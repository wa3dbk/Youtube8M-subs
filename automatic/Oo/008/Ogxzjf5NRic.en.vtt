00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
 jack frost 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.470
 to do extreme cycling, forming mountains and challenging vertiginous 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.469
 curves 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.380
 or embark on a similar adventure on a motorcycle through an obstacle course 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.380
 and unknown routes 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:26.279
 for any young person this would be a good way to play sports and 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.550
 have fun 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.610
 but for Juan Antonio llerena of 31 years 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.700
 who legally blind it is a life challenge to honor the memory of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.610
 his father who was a great motorcyclist 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.480
 6% and to the mind I think that when my dad feels more like it is when I 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.670
 I do is all 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.659
 all these sports because l 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.429
 loved that I did this really it was he who pushed me 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.540
 in this sport the chepo of its own limits then 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.309
 he knows how far it goes but obviously the subject always 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.440
 the worry that something might happen 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.370
 a congenital malformation affected the vision of Juan Antonio almost 70% 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.720
 but he never let himself be overcome by this evil rather it became a challenge 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.020
 the problem is called congenital nystagmus my problem warns in the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.680
 taint 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.910
 it's a connection to the brain 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.270
 my friends bother me saying that it is the wiring that is damaged 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.070
 that's really the problem 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.270
 when we met him we arrived loaded with questions about how he manages to launch himself 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.300
 road 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.750
 with almost complete blindness, little by little our doubts were clearing 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.100
 It turns out that part of the secret is that Javier Merchan his best friend since 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 his adventures have always been with him for many years 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.810
 but I will do 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 every time we do something for myself the cinema is an example when 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.250
 we compete with the end of the race 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.829
 by the way and even though we did not win that common feeling that 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.960
 You achieved the goal that you wanted Javier Javier Tito year as you know the forum 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.010
 they have developed a unique language when they go on motorbikes and 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.169
 we won 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.739
 Javier goes forward 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.799
 and he follows carefully the instructions of his guide 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:21.569
 without the eyes of his friend he could not be able to give figures of the fao Cuba 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.569
 you left stressed is a curve 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.809
 drank ceased but an open right in a curve that is not very 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.879
 percent and that the wider right that was not going to wait so much let's 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.820
 covers a lot we will do little 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.230
 we also have on him like this if this one 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.729
 on the road there are many cracks 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:47.059
 in which the rims are nailed a charnego warning where there are cracks 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.129
 It is because he does not tell me that I can 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.900
 do not lock any of those and drop the chiqui has happened to me 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.309
 the complement showed relaxed that yesterday 1 100 percent on the other device that 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:01.760
 says javier virto years 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.739
 react not 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.540
 in a curve to the left in is like a crack the pp expects us to go 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.299
 we go 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.419
 the unfair distribution 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.539
 bermejo these images correspond to several competitions 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.890
 liaison with cyclists have participated 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.510
 they assure that to have finished the crossing called extreme chimborazo 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.400
 has been his greatest achievement the mice since quite complicated 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.879
 we had been singing all the time so that the cb finding with sound 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.259
 Percent has been encouraging us because he did not serve very strong but if the bicycle 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:41.319
 it is difficult the bike will not be left behind even though they take all the measures 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.319
 of security 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.889
 in this case, unlike cycling, the two youngsters go on the same bike 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.480
 who manages this year 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.569
 guided by javier 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.890
 thus they were launched to perform jumps and pirouettes 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.999
 but this time 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.599
 something failed 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.680
 luckily it was nothing serious 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.599
 and the spirit remained intact 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.059
 to motivate him 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.979
 whether I am the 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.089
 Unruly emotion as he calls debate he must listen 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.970
 pt wins 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.390
 and a little common that 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.039
 it is not the father's 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.819
 nothing was going on it a little bit yielding a little stronger to me I like that I 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:22.349
 I felt a bit 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.800
 because sometimes I'm half frozen in Chile that makes 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.770
 when the mercedes tam is squeezing a bit it means that I'm wrong 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.469
 peacock 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.849
 undoubtedly an example of brotherhood patience and love 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.639
 The best way to prove it is that when it comes to overcoming adversity the 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:41.969
 The union makes the force
