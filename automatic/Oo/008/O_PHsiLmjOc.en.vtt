00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
can give the first and the most obvious

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.530 
can give the first and the most obvious
is<00:00:13.200> mechanical<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.610> red<00:00:14.820> pen<00:00:15.120> type

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
is mechanical this is the red pen type

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.750 
is mechanical this is the red pen type
of<00:00:15.719> stuff<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.199> means<00:00:16.440> you're<00:00:16.670> circling<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
of stuff this means you're circling a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.840 
of stuff this means you're circling a
comma<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.840> certain<00:00:19.260> funny<00:00:19.560> word<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.789> is

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
comma or a certain funny word this is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
comma or a certain funny word this is
the<00:00:21.029> very<00:00:21.240> small<00:00:21.390> stuff<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.920> what

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the very small stuff and it's what

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.750 
the very small stuff and it's what
people<00:00:23.490> tend<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.449> do<00:00:24.510> feedback

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
people tend to do when they do feedback

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.759 
people tend to do when they do feedback
next<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.880> mid-level<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.019> means<00:00:28.289> instead

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
next is mid-level and this means instead

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
next is mid-level and this means instead
of<00:00:29.010> focus<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.789> little<00:00:30.000> stuff<00:00:30.330> it

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
of focus on the really little stuff it

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
of focus on the really little stuff it
means<00:00:30.960> you're<00:00:31.080> focusing<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.890> sentences<00:00:32.700> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
means you're focusing on sentences and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.639 
means you're focusing on sentences and
paragraphs<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.719> there's<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.140> little<00:00:34.350> bit

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
paragraphs so there's a little bit

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.740 
paragraphs so there's a little bit
bigger<00:00:35.040> stuff<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.210> about<00:00:36.360> whether<00:00:36.570> or

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
bigger stuff this is about whether or

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.740 
bigger stuff this is about whether or
not<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> meaning<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:38.149> whatever<00:00:39.149> piece<00:00:39.629> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
not the meaning of whatever piece of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.610 
not the meaning of whatever piece of
writing<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.140> getting<00:00:40.440> across<00:00:42.200> now<00:00:43.200> third<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
writing is getting across now third and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.619 
writing is getting across now third and
I<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.160> most<00:00:44.340> important<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.000> global

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
I think most important is global

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
I think most important is global
feedback<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.920> goes<00:00:47.129> along<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
feedback and this goes along with the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.970 
feedback and this goes along with the
rhetorical<00:00:48.450> situation<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:49.500> we've<00:00:49.710> talked

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
rhetorical situation which we've talked

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.869 
rhetorical situation which we've talked
about<00:00:50.360> that<00:00:51.360> means<00:00:51.600> you're<00:00:52.170> gonna<00:00:52.260> say<00:00:52.530> okay

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
about that means you're gonna say okay

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.459 
about that means you're gonna say okay
here's<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.570> topic<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
here's what I think your topic is and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.459 
here's what I think your topic is and
here's<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.550> should<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.820> or

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
here's what I think it should be or

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.590 
here's what I think it should be or
you've<00:00:58.469> got<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.829> wide<00:00:59.129> topic<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.300> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you've got this wide topic I think you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.110 
you've got this wide topic I think you
should<00:01:00.809> narrow<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.320> topic<00:01:01.770> or<00:01:01.920> maybe<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
should narrow the topic or maybe you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
should narrow the topic or maybe you
should<00:01:03.329> include<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.199> part<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.530> your

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
should include this as part of your

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.070 
should include this as part of your
topic<00:01:04.890> now<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.909> might<00:01:06.360> also<00:01:06.390> make<00:01:06.810> comments

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
topic now you might also make comments

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.620 
topic now you might also make comments
on<00:01:07.439> audience<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.310> say<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:09.150> sure<00:01:09.360> who

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
on audience and say I'm not sure who

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.179 
on audience and say I'm not sure who
you're<00:01:09.780> writing<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.740> audience<00:01:11.040> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you're writing this to your audience is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.850 
you're writing this to your audience is
vague<00:01:11.430> or<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.689> might<00:01:12.869> say<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.409> think<00:01:13.500> you're

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
vague or you might say I think you're

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.190 
vague or you might say I think you're
writing<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.520> pre-med<00:01:14.939> students<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.689> I

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
writing this to pre-med students and I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.600 
writing this to pre-med students and I
think<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.560> ought<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.979> writing<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.490> to

think you ought to be writing it to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.420 
think you ought to be writing it to
fifth<00:01:17.820> graders<00:01:18.470> global<00:01:19.470> feedback<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.159> going

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
fifth graders global feedback is going

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
fifth graders global feedback is going
to<00:01:20.580> deal<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:20.880> these<00:01:21.390> three<00:01:21.750> parts<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
to deal with these three parts of the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.340 
to deal with these three parts of the
rhetorical<00:01:23.280> triangle<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> type<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
rhetorical triangle and it's the type of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.960 
rhetorical triangle and it's the type of
feedback<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.920> people<00:01:25.950> tend<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> overlook

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
feedback that people tend to overlook

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.969 
feedback that people tend to overlook
and<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.720> probably<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> most<00:01:28.500> important

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
and it's probably the most important

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.770 
and it's probably the most important
okay<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:32.159> within<00:01:32.490> those<00:01:32.790> three<00:01:33.090> types<00:01:33.390> there

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
okay now within those three types there

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.289 
okay now within those three types there
are<00:01:33.810> three<00:01:33.960> levels<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.770> feedback<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:36.060> first

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
are three levels of feedback the first

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.100 
are three levels of feedback the first
is<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.689> simply<00:01:36.869> identify<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.890> problem<00:01:38.579> or<00:01:39.110> I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
is to simply identify a problem or I

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
is to simply identify a problem or I
shouldn't<00:01:40.650> limit<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.430> problems

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
shouldn't limit it to just problems

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.370 
shouldn't limit it to just problems
because<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.390> identify<00:01:42.540> what's<00:01:43.110> going

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
because you can identify what's going

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.249 
because you can identify what's going
well<00:01:43.560> -<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.040> could<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.509> mechanical<00:01:46.020> level

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
well - you could on the mechanical level

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.050 
well - you could on the mechanical level
you<00:01:46.380> could<00:01:46.530> circle<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> word<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.310> say<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.909> is

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you could circle a word and say this is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.230 
you could circle a word and say this is
a<00:01:48.090> weird<00:01:48.299> word<00:01:48.600> or<00:01:48.869> whatever<00:01:50.149> for<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
a weird word or whatever for the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.969 
a weird word or whatever for the
mid-level<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> could<00:01:52.110> underline<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> sentence

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
mid-level you could underline a sentence

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
mid-level you could underline a sentence
and<00:01:53.189> say<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.729> confused<00:01:54.420> by<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.630> sentence

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and say I'm confused by this sentence

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.319 
and say I'm confused by this sentence
that's<00:01:55.439> identifying<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.280> problem<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
that's identifying a problem or you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.789 
that's identifying a problem or you
could<00:01:57.479> identify<00:01:57.600> something<00:01:58.259> good<00:01:58.409> by<00:01:58.560> just

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
could identify something good by just

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.020 
could identify something good by just
saying<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.700> this<00:02:00.000> sentence<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.670> next

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
saying I like this sentence the next

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.510 
saying I like this sentence the next
level<00:02:03.329> though<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.079> suggest<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.740> solution<00:02:05.310> as

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
level though is to suggest a solution as

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
level though is to suggest a solution as
well<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.329> when<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> say<00:02:06.810> okay<00:02:07.079> add<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
well so that's when you say okay add a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.229 
well so that's when you say okay add a
period<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:07.829> or<00:02:08.220> why<00:02:08.819> don't<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.090> add<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
period here or why don't you add a

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.330 
period here or why don't you add a
transition<00:02:09.899> sentence<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
transition sentence like this one and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.070 
transition sentence like this one and
then<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.459> write<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> transition<00:02:12.390> sentence<00:02:12.810> for

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
then you write a transition sentence for

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.750 
then you write a transition sentence for
them

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
them

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.440 
them
the<00:02:14.760> third<00:02:15.090> level<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:16.580> explain<00:02:17.580> rhetorical

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the third level is to explain rhetorical

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.290 
the third level is to explain rhetorical
options<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.820> essentially<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.000> goes<00:02:21.180> along

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
options and essentially this goes along

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.170 
options and essentially this goes along
with<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:22.220> convergent<00:02:23.220> versus<00:02:23.490> divergent

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
with the convergent versus divergent

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.320 
with the convergent versus divergent
thinking<00:02:24.650> almost<00:02:25.650> always<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.850> writing

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
thinking almost always in writing

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.420 
thinking almost always in writing
there's<00:02:28.110> not<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.380> single<00:02:28.890> right<00:02:29.220> answer

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
there's not a single right answer

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.810 
there's not a single right answer
there's<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.540> divergent<00:02:31.410> set<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:32.040> many<00:02:32.340> answers

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
there's a divergent set of many answers

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.000 
there's a divergent set of many answers
that<00:02:33.090> would<00:02:33.210> work<00:02:33.450> well<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.620> if<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:34.860> can

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
that would work well so if you can

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.160 
that would work well so if you can
identify<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.580> couple<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.210> good<00:02:36.420> options<00:02:36.900> for

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
identify a couple of good options for

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.410 
identify a couple of good options for
the<00:02:37.260> writer<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.860> let<00:02:38.370> them<00:02:38.610> choose<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.270> best

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
the writer and let them choose the best

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.270 
the writer and let them choose the best
option<00:02:39.690> that's<00:02:40.230> probably<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.860> best<00:02:41.040> feedback

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
option that's probably the best feedback

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.030 
option that's probably the best feedback
and<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.690> think<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.500> important

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
and I think that this is important

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.930 
and I think that this is important
because<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:45.180> lets<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.140> author<00:02:46.700> maintain<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
because it lets the author maintain the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.250 
because it lets the author maintain the
power<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:50.790> lets<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> author<00:02:51.360> decide<00:02:51.930> what's

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
power it lets the author decide what's

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.870 
power it lets the author decide what's
right<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.860> final<00:02:53.340> outcome<00:02:53.490> of<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
right in the final outcome of the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.350 
right in the final outcome of the
writing<00:02:55.250> now<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.640> combine<00:02:56.880> these<00:02:57.300> two

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
writing now you can combine these two

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.500 
writing now you can combine these two
models<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:59.040> see<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.580> each<00:02:59.790> each

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
models and you can see that in each each

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.060 
models and you can see that in each each
of<00:03:00.750> these<00:03:00.870> three<00:03:01.200> types<00:03:01.500> there<00:03:01.920> are<00:03:01.950> three

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
of these three types there are three

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.240 
of these three types there are three
levels<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:04.290> because<00:03:04.440> identifying<00:03:05.160> a

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
levels now just because identifying a

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.740 
levels now just because identifying a
problem<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.940> bottom<00:03:06.270> doesn't<00:03:06.510> mean

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
problem is on the bottom doesn't mean

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.930 
problem is on the bottom doesn't mean
you<00:03:06.900> should<00:03:07.110> not<00:03:07.290> do<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.680> if<00:03:08.130> that's<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.700> best

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
you should not do it if that's the best

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.550 
you should not do it if that's the best
that<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.210> can<00:03:09.360> do<00:03:09.600> that's<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.320> really

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
that you can do that's actually a really

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.050 
that you can do that's actually a really
good<00:03:10.740> feedback<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.610> simply<00:03:12.030> identify

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
good feedback to simply identify

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.530 
good feedback to simply identify
problems<00:03:13.050> what's<00:03:13.860> more<00:03:14.130> important<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.030> that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
problems what's more important is that

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.320 
problems what's more important is that
you<00:03:16.020> don't<00:03:16.470> neglect<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.310> mid-level<00:03:17.850> feedback

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
you don't neglect the mid-level feedback

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.230 
you don't neglect the mid-level feedback
and<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.170> global<00:03:19.590> feedback<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.640> definitely

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
and the global feedback you definitely

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.000 
and the global feedback you definitely
want<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.570> address<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.410> issues<00:03:22.740> of<00:03:22.770> the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
want to address the issues of the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.430 
want to address the issues of the
rhetorical<00:03:23.520> situation<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:24.420> whether<00:03:25.170> or<00:03:25.320> not

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
rhetorical situation and whether or not

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.260 
rhetorical situation and whether or not
the<00:03:25.650> meaning<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.190> getting<00:03:26.460> across<00:03:26.730> at<00:03:27.210> the

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
the meaning is getting across at the

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.880 
the meaning is getting across at the
paragraph<00:03:28.070> mid<00:03:29.070> level<00:03:30.260> let<00:03:31.260> me<00:03:31.380> give<00:03:31.530> three

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
paragraph mid level let me give three

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.430 
paragraph mid level let me give three
quick<00:03:32.190> or<00:03:32.730> yeah<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.780> couple<00:03:34.020> of<00:03:34.140> quick<00:03:34.290> examples

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
quick or yeah a couple of quick examples

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.040 
quick or yeah a couple of quick examples
so<00:03:35.250> if<00:03:35.460> you're<00:03:35.910> gonna<00:03:36.000> do<00:03:36.180> mid-level<00:03:36.750> you're

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
so if you're gonna do mid-level you're

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.220 
so if you're gonna do mid-level you're
gonna<00:03:37.140> say<00:03:37.410> I'm<00:03:37.710> confused<00:03:38.310> by<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.490> paragraph

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
gonna say I'm confused by this paragraph

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.110 
gonna say I'm confused by this paragraph
that's<00:03:40.230> identifying<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.040> problem<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.970> could

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
that's identifying a problem you could

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
that's identifying a problem you could
help<00:03:42.900> them<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:44.220> gather<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.610> solution<00:03:45.270> by

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
help them to gather a solution by

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.530 
help them to gather a solution by
writing<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.160> specific<00:03:47.640> sentence<00:03:47.970> out<00:03:48.150> for<00:03:48.390> them

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
writing a specific sentence out for them

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.949 
writing a specific sentence out for them
or<00:03:49.170> third<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:50.100> could<00:03:50.310> suggest<00:03:50.959> several

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
or third you could suggest several

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.900 
or third you could suggest several
options<00:03:52.350> in<00:03:52.530> how<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.770> improve<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.370> for<00:03:53.430> a

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
options in how to improve that for a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.300 
options in how to improve that for a
particular<00:03:54.570> topic<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.590> particular<00:03:56.070> reader

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
particular topic and a particular reader

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.170 
particular topic and a particular reader
from<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.880> particular<00:03:57.420> author<00:03:58.490> this<00:03:59.490> works<00:03:59.760> very

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
from a particular author this works very

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.290 
from a particular author this works very
much<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.660> same<00:04:00.840> way<00:04:01.050> with<00:04:01.260> global<00:04:01.680> feedback

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
much the same way with global feedback
