00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
smells clean but I noticed it doesn't

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.249

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
but it smells really good though and it

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.709 
but it smells really good though and it
did<00:04:49.889> give<00:04:50.099> me<00:04:50.129> some<00:04:50.430> shine<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:51.270> a<00:04:51.419> little<00:04:51.659> bit

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
did give me some shine and a little bit

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.619 
did give me some shine and a little bit
of<00:04:51.780> volume<00:04:52.050> as<00:04:52.439> well<00:04:52.580> so<00:04:53.580> I'm<00:04:54.120> believe<00:04:54.479> I'm

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
of volume as well so I'm believe I'm

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.450 
of volume as well so I'm believe I'm
assuming<00:04:55.439> that<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.740> have<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:56.039> use<00:04:56.189> the<00:04:56.340> other

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
assuming that you have to use the other

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.550 
assuming that you have to use the other
shampoo<00:04:56.969> and<00:04:57.210> then<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.659> treatment<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:58.469> I'll

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
shampoo and then the treatment so I'll

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.839 
shampoo and then the treatment so I'll
definitely<00:04:58.740> have<00:04:59.009> to<00:04:59.129> try<00:04:59.279> the<00:04:59.370> other<00:04:59.580> ones

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
definitely have to try the other ones

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.350 
definitely have to try the other ones
