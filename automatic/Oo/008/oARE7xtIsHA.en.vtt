some<00:01:08.130> unique<00:01:08.430> EBS<00:01:09.090> mechanics<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.020> i'm

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
some unique EBS mechanics but i'm

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.640 
some unique EBS mechanics but i'm
guessing<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> world<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:12.140> on<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.380> hand

for<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> time<00:01:14.310> control<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.689> adepts<00:01:16.110> are

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
for the time control the adepts are

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.550 
for the time control the adepts are
trying<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> bring<00:01:16.830> us<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.369> new<00:01:17.729> tank<00:01:17.970> mechanic

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
trying to bring us a new tank mechanic

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.890 
trying to bring us a new tank mechanic
this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> rich<00:01:20.070> press<00:01:20.570> while<00:01:21.570> playing

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
this is the rich press while playing

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
this is the rich press while playing
times<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.799> use<00:01:22.979> third<00:01:23.220> time<00:01:23.460> abilities<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
times can use third time abilities to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.120 
times can use third time abilities to
send<00:01:24.540> them<00:01:24.659> into<00:01:24.869> an<00:01:25.049> extreme<00:01:25.409> weight<00:01:25.680> state

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
send them into an extreme weight state

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.340 
send them into an extreme weight state
in<00:01:26.369> where<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> time<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.720> taken<00:01:27.810> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
in where all the time it's taken is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.069 
in where all the time it's taken is
healed<00:01:28.920> back<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> tongue<00:01:29.810> seems<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
healed back to the tongue seems like the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.499 
healed back to the tongue seems like the
tanks<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.619> healers<00:01:31.860> need<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.030> work<00:01:33.270> out

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
tanks and healers need to work out

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.359 
tanks and healers need to work out
together<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.200> coordinate<00:01:34.650> themselves<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
together and coordinate themselves to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.749 
together and coordinate themselves to
get<00:01:35.549> used<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.030> new<00:01:36.270> mechanic<00:01:37.159> but<00:01:38.159> about

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
get used to this new mechanic but about

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.330 
get used to this new mechanic but about
this<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.360> some<00:01:39.570> concerns<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.290> don't<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.159> how
