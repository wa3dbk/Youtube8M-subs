00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:27.079
 the way the finne says dear friends 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:29.880
 I'll show you again today that the 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:33.720
 I've already had scale up in loco 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:41.519
 presented in a small video and 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:45.150
 then the martini counterpart too 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:51.890
 a big praise in loco traditional 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:57.809
 art I've already said yes a 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:00.830
 quite old brand from finland and from 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.500
 denisa gape per founded and then 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:10.740
 there are just too wide 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.680
 Company is now from Finland j 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.920
 for janne martini is always conspicuous 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:23.300
 double double in the middle that's that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.750
 260 models here 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.180
 Finland will always be on top of it 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:35.940
 In any case, this jana martini founded 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:39.000
 1928 the company has its own in 1923 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:43.610
 had forge and that was then 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 family-owned until 2005 and since then 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.840
 is the one of a larger company 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.680
 been taken but still 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:59.340
 Produce the ones in Rovaniemi in Finland 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.330
 well both companies think times are very 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.280
 viewed 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.890
 very well known and accordingly something 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.569
 equivalent now to the measure or 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.620
 I started with the damage 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:18.110
 Both divorces are structured similarly 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.110
 also made according to traditional art 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:30.810
 the seam and then for the belt this 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:33.569
 Fix the slightly higher quality 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.569
 scabbard is from järvenpää has 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.480
 stronger leather 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:49.349
 I also find something nice 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:53.370
 the color while the somewhat soft makes 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:56.760
 the divorce is not very good 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.680
 made so beautifully then the two 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.680
 knives also made similar 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:09.720
 a number larger is the 260 of 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.640
 martini is currently no longer so 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.930
 There are only in the 250er 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:25.790
 version which is only 16 cm long 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.790
 Blade while this has almost 20 cm 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:33.950
 otherwise the already who are finally 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:42.959
 realize it when you start that 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:46.350
 end plates made of nickel silver then comes the 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.530
 Mars birches hereby only trough for 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:54.989
 the index finger at martigny and then 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:59.060
 gag in the case of nickel silver and 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:04.290
 then comes the stainless steel klinger respectively 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:09.569
 with the sink to the 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:15.540
 Processing is similar where I mean 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:18.979
 that the café is a little bit better and 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.180
 clean worked 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.510
 especially on the back you can see that 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.979
 but also the blade itself is one 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.260
 a bit cleaner sanded and at 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.750
 martigny 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.770
 that does not look like that a bit 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.510
 crafted out of something more and 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.690
 made here faster 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:48.240
 Small things like this lace do not 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.970
 beautiful evenly made so was 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.080
 even sleep is not completely identical 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.080
 on both sides 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:02.880
 Of course the most beautiful ones are noticeable 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:09.080
 Mirror polished klinger with this 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:11.670
 laser engraving and this eye-catching 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.010
 this eye-catching scene, too 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.040
 traditional at this martini fair 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:22.220
 and always with the reindeer 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:26.190
 rag in his sled this 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.190
 tent-like dwelling in the tundra 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.400
 landscape and then still stands here 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:37.640
 on it j point martini finland rag 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:40.560
 German and stainless steel for sword 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.990
 I've already read that here 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:49.890
 but six years ago at ties 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:55.620
 for people here too as a marker 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:58.770
 on the two year old pekinger both knives 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:03.930
 are absolutely worthy of collecting beautiful 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:09.750
 to look at lie also priced similarly 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:13.680
 I think 50 60 70 euro one can 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.050
 for it as used as it 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.330
 as new knives were still something 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:23.640
 of course in good condition 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.950
 They were in demand again and again 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:32.900
 as a user then I would but this 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.900
 Preferring knives here is easy 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:41.960
 better use will I think 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:47.660
 It has almost become one 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:53.470
 little magnets is also 105 grams more 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:58.420
 So that's 175 grams, the 280 grams 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:07:06.260
 but both very nice Finnish knives 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:10.010
 I now once wanted to show you the 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:14.630
 I have one again for now 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:17.750
 you this is probably staying in here 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:20.260
 my collection will look like it 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.260
 looks 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:29.740
 ok to see you soon with a new trade fair 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.740
 jake wide
