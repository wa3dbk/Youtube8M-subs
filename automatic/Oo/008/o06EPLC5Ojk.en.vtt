bucket then kappa we all thought that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.830 
bucket then kappa we all thought that
was<00:00:51.780> probably<00:00:52.559> quite<00:00:52.969> expected<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
was probably quite expected and the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.569 
was probably quite expected and the
Goliath<00:00:55.469> did<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> most<00:00:55.920> damage<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> early

Goliath did the most damage in the early

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.240 
Goliath did the most damage in the early
stages<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.780> Kraken<00:00:58.260> did<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> most<00:00:58.770> evenly

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
stages the Kraken did the most evenly

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.860 
stages the Kraken did the most evenly
spread<00:00:59.550> damage<00:00:59.879> across<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.270> stages<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
spread damage across the all stages and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.360 
spread damage across the all stages and
the<00:01:01.140> Wraith<00:01:01.289> did<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> most<00:01:01.770> damage<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.219> stage

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the Wraith did the most damage and stage

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.719 
the Wraith did the most damage and stage
through<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.830> lot<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.460> kind<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
through the so a lot of this was kind of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.780 
through the so a lot of this was kind of
expected<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:07.020> win<00:01:07.260> rate<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.680> around<00:01:07.770> 50<00:01:08.460> 50

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
expected and a win rate of around 50 50

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.230 
expected and a win rate of around 50 50
at<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.270> stage<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:10.189> absolutely<00:01:11.189> amazing<00:01:11.520> for

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
at this stage is absolutely amazing for

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.950 
at this stage is absolutely amazing for
a<00:01:12.479> balance<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.200> such<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> complex<00:01:14.159> gang<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.479> in

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
a balance of such a complex gang so in

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.859 
a balance of such a complex gang so in
alpha<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.710> hunters<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.189> upset<00:01:18.090> fifty-seven

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
alpha the hunters one upset fifty-seven

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.770 
alpha the hunters one upset fifty-seven
percent<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> time<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.409> think<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
percent of the time I think it was and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.240 
percent of the time I think it was and
it<00:01:21.780> looks<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.619> they're<00:01:22.830> doing<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.070> pretty

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it looks like they're doing a pretty

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.370 
it looks like they're doing a pretty
good<00:01:23.340> job<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.759> balancing<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:24.479> near<00:01:25.080> 50

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
good job of balancing it because near 50

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.280 
good job of balancing it because near 50
50<00:01:25.710> that's<00:01:26.369> great<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> beta<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.540> from

the others balances in the game might

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.300 
the others balances in the game might
benefit<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.930> Goliath<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.190> hopefully

benefit the Goliath and so hopefully

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.610 
benefit the Goliath and so hopefully
that<00:03:41.610> will<00:03:41.700> help<00:03:41.850> but<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.660> bring<00:03:43.530> everything

3<00:05:58.540> stars<00:05:58.810> to<00:05:58.960> get<00:05:59.050> the<00:05:59.140> most<00:05:59.260> out<00:05:59.440> of<00:05:59.470> them<00:05:59.620> was

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
3 stars to get the most out of them was

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.250 
3 stars to get the most out of them was
taking<00:06:00.280> people<00:06:00.490> quite<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.640> long<00:06:00.820> time<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:01.300> they

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
taking people quite a long time and they

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.840 
taking people quite a long time and they
don't<00:06:02.470> want<00:06:02.590> Matt<00:06:02.890> to<00:06:02.919> take<00:06:03.160> very<00:06:03.340> long<00:06:03.490> so

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
don't want Matt to take very long so

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.320 
don't want Matt to take very long so
they<00:06:04.030> massively<00:06:04.900> reduced<00:06:05.520> the<00:06:06.520> masteries

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
they massively reduced the masteries

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.180 
they massively reduced the masteries
across<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:07.870> board<00:06:08.110> so<00:06:08.440> for<00:06:08.620> example<00:06:08.650> mark

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
across the board so for example mark

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.280 
across the board so for example mark
hobbs<00:06:09.430> three-star<00:06:10.030> arc<00:06:10.270> mines<00:06:10.690> we're<00:06:11.140> taking

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
hobbs three-star arc mines we're taking

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.610 
hobbs three-star arc mines we're taking
on<00:06:11.919> average<00:06:12.810> 12.6<00:06:13.810> three<00:06:14.020> hours<00:06:14.350> for<00:06:14.470> people

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
on average 12.6 three hours for people

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.140 
on average 12.6 three hours for people
to<00:06:14.680> complete<00:06:14.950> and<00:06:15.130> now<00:06:15.640> should<00:06:15.880> be<00:06:15.910> around

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
to complete and now should be around

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.140 
to complete and now should be around
five<00:06:16.600> hours<00:06:16.780> so<00:06:17.470> all<00:06:18.100> across<00:06:18.669> the<00:06:18.820> board<00:06:18.850> those

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
five hours so all across the board those

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.640 
five hours so all across the board those
mastery<00:06:19.480> changes<00:06:19.810> have<00:06:19.900> been<00:06:19.990> lowered<00:06:20.320> so

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
mastery changes have been lowered so

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.550 
mastery changes have been lowered so
that<00:06:20.680> all<00:06:20.919> in<00:06:21.130> within<00:06:21.570> about<00:06:22.570> five<00:06:22.870> hours<00:06:23.050> it's

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
that all in within about five hours it's

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.130 
that all in within about five hours it's
the<00:06:23.650> idea<00:06:23.980> and<00:06:24.390> so<00:06:25.390> that<00:06:25.570> should<00:06:25.750> really<00:06:25.990> help

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
the idea and so that should really help

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.800 
the idea and so that should really help
now<00:06:26.740> I'm<00:06:27.400> really<00:06:27.910> looking<00:06:28.150> forward<00:06:28.180> to<00:06:28.480> evolve

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
now I'm really looking forward to evolve

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.600 
now I'm really looking forward to evolve
I<00:06:28.990> think<00:06:29.590> it's<00:06:29.740> going<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:29.890> be<00:06:29.980> an<00:06:30.070> amazing<00:06:30.250> game

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
I think it's going to be an amazing game

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.450 
I think it's going to be an amazing game
and<00:06:30.820> with<00:06:30.940> this<00:06:31.090> level<00:06:31.330> of<00:06:31.980> Peter<00:06:32.980> and<00:06:33.010> alpha

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
and with this level of Peter and alpha

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.350 
and with this level of Peter and alpha
balancing<00:06:33.880> that<00:06:33.970> they've<00:06:34.090> been<00:06:34.270> going

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
balancing that they've been going

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.090 
balancing that they've been going
through<00:06:34.720> before<00:06:35.169> the<00:06:35.410> games<00:06:35.590> released<00:06:35.770> I

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
through before the games released I

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.340 
through before the games released I
think<00:06:36.400> that<00:06:36.610> it's<00:06:36.729> a<00:06:36.970> good<00:06:37.180> chance<00:06:37.750> that<00:06:38.260> this

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
think that it's a good chance that this

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.530 
think that it's a good chance that this
game<00:06:38.560> will<00:06:38.740> be<00:06:38.860> relatively<00:06:39.550> good<00:06:39.820> for<00:06:39.940> eSport

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
game will be relatively good for eSport

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.300 
game will be relatively good for eSport
as<00:06:40.690> well<00:06:40.930> and<00:06:41.290> and<00:06:41.620> that's<00:06:41.740> what<00:06:41.950> you<00:06:42.040> want<00:06:42.220> you

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
as well and and that's what you want you

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.010 
as well and and that's what you want you
need<00:06:42.490> the<00:06:42.700> game<00:06:42.820> to<00:06:43.000> be<00:06:43.060> balanced<00:06:43.480> you<00:06:43.600> need<00:06:43.810> it

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
need the game to be balanced you need it

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.790 
need the game to be balanced you need it
to<00:06:44.670> the<00:06:45.670> only<00:06:46.510> ceiling<00:06:46.960> needs<00:06:47.050> to<00:06:47.200> be<00:06:47.290> skill

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
to the only ceiling needs to be skill

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.820 
to the only ceiling needs to be skill
and<00:06:48.100> so<00:06:48.790> should<00:06:49.450> be<00:06:49.570> at<00:06:49.990> low<00:06:50.200> level<00:06:50.620> of<00:06:50.680> play

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
and so should be at low level of play

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.610 
and so should be at low level of play
should<00:06:51.250> see<00:06:51.400> 50<00:06:51.700> 50<00:06:52.060> and<00:06:52.240> a<00:06:52.870> high<00:06:53.200> level<00:06:53.470> play

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
should see 50 50 and a high level play

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.440 
should see 50 50 and a high level play
when<00:06:53.770> everyone's<00:06:54.340> equal<00:06:54.550> you<00:06:54.880> should<00:06:55.030> see<00:06:55.150> 50

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
when everyone's equal you should see 50

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.380 
when everyone's equal you should see 50
50<00:06:55.750> win<00:06:56.110> rate<00:06:56.320> that's<00:06:57.220> that's<00:06:57.700> own<00:06:57.940> porn<00:06:58.180> and

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
50 win rate that's that's own porn and

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.270 
50 win rate that's that's own porn and
those<00:06:58.600> kind<00:06:58.870> of<00:06:58.900> balances<00:06:59.260> are<00:06:59.380> hard<00:06:59.560> to<00:06:59.650> do<00:06:59.800> so

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
those kind of balances are hard to do so

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.970 
those kind of balances are hard to do so
