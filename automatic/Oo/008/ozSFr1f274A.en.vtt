00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600
 Well now and clear the value from now 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.839
 Generalization specification of US military realignment maintenance specific resources in Japan 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.749
 I just saw hibernation now 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.730
エ ッ ト あ ん エ ッ ト な

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.970
 Last 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.089
 In the case of Deco-babo provided drive 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.609
 I spoke out my heart 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.619
 I lined up with the 8th captain 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.029
 So the rock side Kagawa that the open had 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.679
 Maybe 8 1 Nissan Nissan Honda fans are also the fourth 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:36.990
 I think 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.230
 Finally there is a chance to spread this 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.200
 So when developing 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 Take that match into account as usual 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.590
 It will be 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.300
 I'm wondering why it's difficult now during parliament 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.260
 Has a history 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.540
 The user is 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.950
 There is such a tool. 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.710
 I'm daum 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.950
 that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.880
 This is an annual total point 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 This was done 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.570
 Got stuck 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.240
 There is no meaning to live 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.140
 Oya becomes very easy if there is this stock 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830
 I think that can be used from 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.150
 This is 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.330
 It says that there are eight people, but this is a person 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
 At that time 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.260
 From below 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
 Can be done from below 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.220
 tightly 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.689
 To date so far 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.170
 Same as before 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 I am from the bottom 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.620
 And I also said I was concerned 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480
 In this way 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 If Tsu City 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.739
 I don't know if I'm in this house 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.369
 How to do it 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.669
 Finally 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.949
 It was at the founder's association 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.089
 I wonder if I will come to Tianjin 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.639
 Yokohama 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.689
 Country 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.689
 Is it about 300 people before the weather? 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.189
 There are many main temples, but 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.479
 Dramatic pedigree 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.439
 In this day 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.879
 It is alive 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.589
 Democracy 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.589
 We expect soc to be a little more billion yen 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.429
 Let's fit together 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:54.669
 Together 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.219
 I will try it once more 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.219
 France Renault 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.969
 It is a kit cut 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.969
 I talked about the heat 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.869
 I did this 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.869
 I am doing it 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.319
 So 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.319
 11:30 pm on the 9th 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:32.899
 It does not go to the same test specification 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:35.559
 one 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.079
 .. 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.139
 Collapse 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.029
 this 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.859
 Father and son 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.179
 Light money 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.179
 Determined from below 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.879
 To the prefecture 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.099
 Urban style 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.699
 It's high, I'm going back and it's a closing price base.
