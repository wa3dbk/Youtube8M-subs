00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.920
 hello my name is folk and today we are 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.590
 We will delight our pets 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.109
 namely making toys for cats 1 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.630
 the toy will be shaped like a sweet donut for 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.800
 we will need its saint 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.779
 felt scissors catnip threads immediately 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.969
 I will say the cat throws pleasure rare 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.500
 and or cheap but for the home 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.390
 you can try to look for a pet 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.100
 i bought a pack of catnip in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.329
 the pet store of your city for 200 rubles 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.340
 dried grass 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.200
 at first I wanted to cut the cushion in 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.030
 which shit dried juniper but 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.629
 then decided instead use hay 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.760
 for rodents 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.680
 for a start we have a piece of paper or throw 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
 sketch the toys further cut so that he 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.770
 served us a kind of patterns 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 apply a circle to a wolf and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.210
 a piece of chalk or soap bypass the need 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.399
 outline and cut two such circles 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.469
 Next, cut out of the paper pattern 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.539
 glaze put it to felt 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.780
 we outline and cut out in a single 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.430
 a copy of the icing I just 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.960
 took colored threads and in a chaotic 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 ok done short stitches 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.700
 trying to actually enter the sweet color 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.740
 sew the embroidered glaze sew to 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.939
 one of the circles sew glaze 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.310
 only on the outer edge 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.960
 inner edge we will touch on later when 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.790
 we will sew together the two halves 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.770
 Donut now sew two halves 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.720
 fingers start to sew on 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.549
 inner circle and together with halves 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.590
 when donut stitching seize and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.570
 icing I tried to make these school u 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.670
 line as continuous as possible 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.409
 so that the grass that you are filled with toy 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.150
 products did not get enough sleep through equal 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.820
 spans sheeting the inner circle 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.770
 proceed to the outer sheathe it only 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.479
 half through the open half 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.970
 we finish the toy with herbal mixture 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.310
 cook very simply a little dried 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.320
 grass or hay mix of about 1 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.909
 a teaspoon of catnip and need 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.439
 be too zealous with the addition of mint 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.450
 and because it acts on cats 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.979
 as well as on the kids has a sweet and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.460
 so it's better not to invest here than 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.799
 to shift 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 stuffing a toy we sew and and I also 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.369
 besides herbal mixture, I decided to sew in 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.590
 toy ringing bell that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.160
 cats were more interesting the first toy 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.170
 ready 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.910
 proceed to the second next toy 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.590
 will be made in the form i'm mexican 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.740
 so for its production to us 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.720
 need colored felt scissors thread 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.640
 and a mixture of catnip and dried herbs 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.230
 for these toys you can not throw in 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.870
 pattern because everything will be extreme 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.880
 just cut a small circle it will 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.620
 the two halves so have a circle of red 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.510
 varnish cut in two will perform 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.850
 the role of tomatoes and half a cup and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.540

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.130
 we put a half of a big circle 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.260
 and encircle it and draw around it 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.330
 small semi circles then cut out 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.390
 lettuce sew first tomatoes 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.550
 then the cucumber is further sewn into the workpiece 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.440
 in the cake as well as from the previous 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.660
 sew up the toy to the end 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.280
