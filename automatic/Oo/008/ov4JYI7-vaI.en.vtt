00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 a legitimate destroyer of human beings 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.330
 a beast that was born to give of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.730
 waits either in the entertainment 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.380
 sporting the world of wrestling or 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.519
 be in the octagon of the arts 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.679
 mixed martial 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.030
 we are talking about brock lesnar a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.859
 fighter which has been 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.369
 debating on several controversial cases 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.109
 like 21 to 1 in reserve or 30 over 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.090
 its overvalued due to its huge 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.220
 achievements and victories in a very short time 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.800
 being the youngest fighter in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 get the championship of the wwf 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.390
 he has also been world weight champion 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.040
 heavy of the ufc thing that not all 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.110
 that enter that octagon can 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 get but we are to talk about 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.579
 lesnar in his stay in ww and if 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.530
 It really can be considered a 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.750
 legend of this company we will be 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 analyzing three points for it its 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.410
 importance his charisma and his quality in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.410
 the ring so let's start 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.579
 let's start with his charisma lesnar is a 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.890
 guy that intimidates obviously seeing 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.230
 similar human being of almost 2 meters of 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.229
 height his nickname of the embodied beast 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.720
 his f5 and paul heyman make lesnar be 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.090
 a pretty charismatic fighter maybe 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.159
 not at the level of a hbk or a triple h 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.880
 but it does attract the attention of the 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.190
 viewer 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.070
 lesnar also in recent years 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.470
 especially in reserve and a-31 with the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.299
 phrase that said about suplex ittibitz not 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.640
 he is a fighter who uses almost nothing 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.649
 microphone then really all the work 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.840
 of the promos of lesnar are part of 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.000
 paul heyman although the little that can be 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.100
 see of lesnar with the microphone is not so 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.470
 bad as some really say a 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.810
 character that attracts quite being the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.340
 of the embodied beast which turns 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.280
 definitely in a character 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.009
 charismatic but not so charismatic 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.080
 and other legends of the company let 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.179
 with its quality in the ring many of 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.039
 you especially those who started 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.530
 see the slim goal about three years ago 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.659
 or so now they will think that it is a 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.060
 bulge since it only uses suplex is the 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.409
 kimura lock and the f 5 but this is a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.719
 tremendous mistake 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.789
 those few movements that Russian lesnar 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.069
 they are obviously by the character that 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.500
 it has to be a beast totally 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.599
 dominant and not like the one before to see me 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000
 I explain to those who think that lesnar 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.980
 it is a bulge is that they are ignorant 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.019
 Lesnar is one of the most fighters 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.269
 complete in the whole story very 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.459
 technical in the ring with a very large 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.340
 variety of movements from a simple 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.230
 suplex up to a shooting star press alone 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.720
 see your fight against kurt angle in 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.819
 reserve neither to 19 or against undertaker in 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.160
 the quality of the INACER Lesnar is 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.390
 similar to kurt angle very technical and 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.430
 with great force 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.620
 Lesnar can offer an incredible fight 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.959
 of quality in fight but also you can 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.910
 give a lot of show definitely 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.040
 valid for war sling this I say 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.629
 by many fools who consider that 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.690
 lesnar was not born for the world of 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.280
 wrestling 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.090
 finally let's talk about its importance in 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.940
 the company 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.340
 lesnar has only worked for six ww 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.500
 years more the next three years would be 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.870
 nine very few years to get 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.569
 incredible achievements like being the champion of 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.790
 the youngest ww in history to be 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.250
 undisputed champion be the winner of the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.060
 royal rumble heavyweight world champion 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.370
 World Heavyweight WW Champion Winner 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.560
 from the king of the ring literally violate 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.510
 to jones and nan summerslam take down the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.180
 unbeaten streak of the undertaker in reset 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.040
 mania moment that nobody believed it without 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.959
 doubt the most shocking moment of the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.540
 history of this company among others 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.390
 victories as against triple rock h 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.910
 kurt angle dulko band tm punk besides 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.040
 that he has only lost twice 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.080
 cleanly since he's since 2012 I've 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.820
 here a very curious fact if it is that for 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.190
 give it a little more credibility 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.170
 the fighter who is considered by 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.660
 many as the best in history if 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.239
 this is the regime already before the happy 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.500
 lesnar scarce is that you iker never 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.780
 I repeat never 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.710
 I never repeat the never again 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.230
 beat Brock Lesnar even in a 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.750
 mcdow ni raul payment to see between dozens 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.310
 of more impressive victories what 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.320
 for me it really is one of the 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.960
 most dominant fighters in history 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.840
 possibly the most dominant really 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.430
 for only six years in the wwf and 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.180
 get all those awesome 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.410
 iconic achievements and victories is really 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.210
 overrated but it's not for nothing 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.489
 no wrestler shit for this 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.410
 business but overrated nobody 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.080
 can earn such achievements in such 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.320
 only six years not even jonsin to me 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.930
 triple h in yoga nor anyone my opinion 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.640
 finally about this quick analysis is 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.710
 that yes lesnar can be very 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.170
 overrated but has made history and 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.420
 rightly having so many achievements though 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.550
 It does not convince me that I worked so hard 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.710
 few years for the good wine company 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.350
 in short this was a small analysis 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.120
 Stay tuned to my next channel like this 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.670
 like in a week or maybe less 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.920
 I will be uploading another analysis to combat 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.080
 that could happen in reserve or 32 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.940
 Between sting in the tail want a video 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.470
 similar to the one I did on the shield 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.960
 few days ago in order 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.470
 I hope you liked it, like it and 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.470
 see you soon
