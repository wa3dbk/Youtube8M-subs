00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:59.200
 Hello everyone and today I will show you how 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.580
 make the right machines 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.580
 well, a hundred times 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.230
 start take x 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.650
 will be faster 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.670
 So 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:22.550
 when we take a pit we take it we take the engine 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.510
 any of this though i better i will 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.510
 spend 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.980
 take another notebook 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.890
 pipes transport 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.230
 one chest 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.300
 more precisely 2 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.550
 and 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.230
 for the lever and what else is that damn 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.230
 Well, I have fuel 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.820
 we set a quarry 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.820
 next to him this 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.490
 luxury 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.970
 set 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.970
 this and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.300
 So 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.910
 start working now 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.790
 to get rid of faster you can do 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.280
 very few immediately put 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.459
 still somehow probably put 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.459
 here 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.710
 uchida set the lever 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.420
 like this 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.700
 still he will do now i'm on 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.390
 pause I put it here we finished 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.390
 start doing 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.030
 where I will show you how to do 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.490
 type wells 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.490
 we take this installation 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:13.630
 will deliver 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.630
 next to him you can not dress 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.650
 the reason nothing is needed 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.220

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.220

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.720

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.720
