00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.590 
we're gonna erupt simply you wrap for 13
rows<00:00:34.690> so<00:00:35.680> you<00:00:36.640> don't<00:00:36.910> have<00:00:37.059> to<00:00:37.210> do<00:00:37.360> anything

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
so we're here we're going to wrap every

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.260 
so we're here we're going to wrap every
single<00:00:53.620> peg<00:00:54.150> yarn<00:00:55.150> over<00:00:55.450> for<00:00:55.840> 13<00:00:56.200> rows<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:58.090> do

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
single peg yarn over for 13 rows just do

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.960 
single peg yarn over for 13 rows just do
that<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:58.810> I'll<00:00:59.020> see<00:00:59.230> you<00:00:59.350> up<00:00:59.470> so<00:01:00.100> now<00:01:00.430> that<00:01:00.700> we

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
that and I'll see you up so now that we

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.499 
that and I'll see you up so now that we
have<00:01:01.329> done<00:01:01.570> all<00:01:01.900> earth<00:01:02.350> irreps<00:01:03.130> rows<00:01:03.640> we're

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
have done all earth irreps rows we're

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.340 
have done all earth irreps rows we're
going<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:04.720> start<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.229> fingertip<00:01:05.860> shaping<00:01:06.369> so

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
going to start the fingertip shaping so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.950 
going to start the fingertip shaping so
the<00:01:08.350> next<00:01:08.590> two<00:01:08.860> rows<00:01:09.100> will<00:01:09.579> be<00:01:09.610> work<00:01:10.030> as<00:01:10.329> knit

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
the next two rows will be work as knit

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.850 
the next two rows will be work as knit
one<00:01:11.200> ear<00:01:11.500> up<00:01:11.740> one<00:01:12.100> for<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.909> first<00:01:13.240> row<00:01:13.540> and<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
one ear up one for the first row and the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.219 
one ear up one for the first row and the
second<00:01:15.189> row<00:01:15.220> will<00:01:15.579> be<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:16.060> wrap<00:01:16.450> one<00:01:16.810> knit<00:01:17.200> one

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
second row will be a wrap one knit one

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.599 
second row will be a wrap one knit one
so<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.280> it's<00:01:18.549> like<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:20.109> cop<00:01:20.380> when<00:01:20.679> you<00:01:20.710> go<00:01:20.950> knit

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
so it it's like the cop when you go knit

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.569 
so it it's like the cop when you go knit
one<00:01:21.909> purl<00:01:22.359> one<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.530> instead<00:01:23.679> is<00:01:24.189> going<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.429> be

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
one purl one but instead is going to be

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.629 
one purl one but instead is going to be
knit<00:01:24.880> one<00:01:25.090> ear<00:01:25.359> app1<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.499> let's<00:01:26.799> start<00:01:27.130> we're

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:27.639 
knit one ear app1 so let's start we're

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:37.700 
knit one ear app1 so let's start we're
gonna<00:01:27.999> do<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.389> for<00:01:28.810> one<00:01:29.079> row<00:01:29.969> so<00:01:33.179> go<00:01:34.179> knit

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:52.500 

tight<00:01:38.710> here<00:01:39.720> ear<00:01:40.720> up<00:01:43.830> knit

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.890 

you<00:01:53.510> rap<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.430> we<00:01:55.430> keep<00:01:55.610> going<00:01:55.880> like<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.360> to

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
you rap and we keep going like this to

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:06.420 
you rap and we keep going like this to
the<00:01:57.050> end

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.100 

so<00:02:07.430> here<00:02:07.790> we<00:02:07.970> are<00:02:08.000> now<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.510> start<00:02:08.990> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
so here we are now to start the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.920 
so here we are now to start the
decreasing<00:02:09.740> so<00:02:10.670> we're<00:02:10.970> going<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.150> move<00:02:11.390> every

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
decreasing so we're going to move every

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.460 
decreasing so we're going to move every
third<00:02:12.200> loop<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.430> right<00:02:13.520> around<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.960> so

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
third loop to the right around it so

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.300 
third loop to the right around it so
this<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.160> peg<00:02:16.820> 1<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.570> treat<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.040> third

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
this is peg 1 to treat this is the third

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.930 
this is peg 1 to treat this is the third
loop

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
loop

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.050 
loop
Treach<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.600> off<00:02:20.780> I'd<00:02:21.740> like<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:22.280> take<00:02:22.430> my<00:02:22.640> finger

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
Treach it off I'd like to take my finger

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.380 
Treach it off I'd like to take my finger
to<00:02:23.300> do<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.630> more<00:02:24.020> than<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.320> hook<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.820> I'll<00:02:26.120> go

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
to do it more than the hook so I'll go

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.460

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.700 
unstretched yarn if you work with
something<00:03:17.500> with<00:03:17.650> wool<00:03:17.890> or<00:03:18.930> any<00:03:19.930> other<00:03:20.200> fiber<00:03:20.530> I

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
something with wool or any other fiber I

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.760 
something with wool or any other fiber I
guess<00:03:20.950> that's<00:03:21.430> going<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.880> be<00:03:21.970> easier<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.780> this

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
guess that's going to be easier so this

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.470 
guess that's going to be easier so this
is<00:03:23.950> not<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.250> greatest<00:03:24.610> yarn<00:03:24.880> for<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.240> it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
is not the greatest yarn for it it

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.720 
is not the greatest yarn for it it
doesn't<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.990> looks<00:03:26.170> hard<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.800> take<00:03:27.310> them<00:03:27.520> off

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
doesn't it looks hard to take them off

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.840 
doesn't it looks hard to take them off
but<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.240> is<00:03:28.270> not<00:03:28.600> usually<00:03:29.460> it's<00:03:30.460> not<00:03:30.550> like

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
but it is not usually it's not like

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.760

eight pegs left so I already start by
taking<00:05:11.729> that<00:05:12.060> loop<00:05:12.360> here<00:05:12.979> put<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.100> on<00:05:14.250> the

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
taking that loop here put it on the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.850 
taking that loop here put it on the
right<00:05:14.580> one<00:05:14.970> making<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:15.960> loop<00:05:16.199> here<00:05:16.410> putting

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
right one making that loop here putting

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.070 
right one making that loop here putting
on<00:05:17.009> the<00:05:17.100> right<00:05:17.310> one

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080

on the right one
taking<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.259> loop<00:05:19.620> here<00:05:20.900> go<00:05:21.900> stretch<00:05:24.380> open<00:05:25.380> it

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
taking that loop here go stretch open it

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:36.079 
taking that loop here go stretch open it
and<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.210> right<00:05:29.600> again<00:05:31.130> stretch

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.089 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:41.519
