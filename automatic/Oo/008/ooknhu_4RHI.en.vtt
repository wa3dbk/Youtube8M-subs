I'm shakin bro y ou 20 gunstreak perhaps

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.440 
I'm shakin bro y ou 20 gunstreak perhaps
because<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:25.200> might<00:02:25.470> be<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.680> reason

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
because of that that might be the reason

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.230 
because of that that might be the reason
because<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.720> honest<00:02:28.020> I've<00:02:28.980> never<00:02:29.040> gotten<00:02:29.760> a

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
because to be honest I've never gotten a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.350 
because to be honest I've never gotten a
nuke<00:02:30.960> doubt<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.500> that's<00:02:31.710> kind<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.010> weird

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
nuke doubt and that's kind of weird

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.820 
nuke doubt and that's kind of weird
because<00:02:33.360> i<00:02:33.630> did<00:02:33.840> use<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.230> basically<00:02:34.380> just

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
because i did use to basically just

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.050 
because i did use to basically just
grind<00:02:36.500> mold<00:02:37.500> team<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.040> that's<00:02:38.610> why<00:02:38.760> i<00:02:38.790> didn't

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
grind mold team and that's why i didn't

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.810 
grind mold team and that's why i didn't
play<00:02:39.209> too<00:02:39.270> much<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.570> freefall<00:02:40.430> freefall<00:02:41.430> really

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
play too much a freefall freefall really

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.350 
play too much a freefall freefall really
that's<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.209> map<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.510> ghosts<00:02:43.970> I'm<00:02:44.970> doing<00:02:45.330> fine

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
ish I guess but that spawned no man

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.530 
ish I guess but that spawned no man
that's<00:02:48.510> not<00:02:48.630> really<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.170> swag<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.560> like<00:02:50.540> where
