00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
it it makes noises and you can't really

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.830 
it it makes noises and you can't really
you<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.549> either<00:01:38.759> someone<00:01:39.210> focus<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and I'm basically the next step is find

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.499 
and I'm basically the next step is find
myself<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.069> cameraman<00:02:08.459> which<00:02:08.819> will<00:02:08.970> private<00:02:09.390> my
