00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
but I think stealing the show was the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.110 
but I think stealing the show was the
burger<00:02:08.819> king<00:02:09.149> king<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.090> site<00:02:12.090> that

ice<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.010> did<00:02:14.340> not<00:02:14.550> really<00:02:14.850> believe<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.240> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
ice I did not really believe that the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.270 
ice I did not really believe that the
burger<00:02:15.720> king<00:02:15.960> was<00:02:16.170> coming<00:02:16.530> down<00:02:16.740> from<00:02:17.070> there

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the first round um it was figuring each

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.310 
the first round um it was figuring each
other<00:02:21.000> out<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.810> think<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:21.990> either<00:02:22.080> one

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320

the fight from there but coming out

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.220 
the fight from there but coming out
Floyd<00:02:26.700> was<00:02:26.940> very<00:02:27.210> quick<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.570> start<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.020> fight

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.040 
Floyd was very quick to start the fight
I<00:02:28.470> thought<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.070> Floyd<00:02:29.510> definitely<00:02:30.510> maybe

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
I thought that Floyd definitely maybe

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.530 
I thought that Floyd definitely maybe
won<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.590> first<00:02:31.830> round<00:02:32.100> he<00:02:32.880> was<00:02:33.000> very<00:02:33.180> quick

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
won the first round he was very quick

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.330 
won the first round he was very quick
and<00:02:33.720> trying<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.110> decide<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.680> way<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.010> fight

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
and trying to decide the way the fight

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.490 
and trying to decide the way the fight
was<00:02:35.490> going<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.209> round<00:02:36.480> two<00:02:36.780> but

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
was going to go in in round two but

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.800 
was going to go in in round two but
definitely<00:02:38.040> Pacquiao<00:02:38.850> came<00:02:39.180> out<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.510> he<00:02:39.600> won

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
definitely Pacquiao came out and he won

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.560 
definitely Pacquiao came out and he won
round<00:02:40.080> four<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.740> 15<00:02:41.490> really<00:02:42.000> really<00:02:42.209> strong
