all<00:04:11.959> of<00:04:12.049> those<00:04:12.140> things<00:04:12.409> I<00:04:12.530> covered<00:04:12.890> in<00:04:12.980> the

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
previous review of the 328 now this is

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.620 
previous review of the 328 now this is
the<00:04:15.590> car<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:15.829> would<00:04:15.980> choose<00:04:16.370> because<00:04:16.579> of<00:04:17.239> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
the car I would choose because of the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.420 
the car I would choose because of the
inline<00:04:17.959> 6-cylinder<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.009> the<00:04:19.100> only<00:04:19.250> one

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
inline 6-cylinder this is the only one

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.159 
inline 6-cylinder this is the only one
that<00:04:19.609> still<00:04:19.699> has<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.150> in<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.329> 3-series<00:04:20.750> so

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
that still has it in the 3-series so

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.210 
that still has it in the 3-series so
we're<00:04:21.259> gonna<00:04:21.380> start<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.650> up<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:21.919> go<00:04:22.009> for<00:04:22.190> a

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
we're gonna start it up and go for a

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.690 
we're gonna start it up and go for a
spin

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.810 

now<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.760> 335<00:04:31.750> has<00:04:32.230> 300<00:04:32.890> foot-pounds<00:04:33.730> of

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
now the 335 has 300 foot-pounds of

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.780 
now the 335 has 300 foot-pounds of
torque<00:04:33.880> at<00:04:34.420> just<00:04:34.660> 1300<00:04:35.410> RPM<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.100> is<00:04:36.340> really

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
torque at just 1300 RPM that is really

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.090 
torque at just 1300 RPM that is really
quite<00:04:37.180> remarkable<00:04:37.380> it's<00:04:38.380> because<00:04:38.770> they<00:04:38.920> have

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
quite remarkable it's because they have

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.130 
quite remarkable it's because they have
this<00:04:39.220> twin<00:04:39.550> power<00:04:39.820> feature<00:04:40.240> with<00:04:40.630> this<00:04:40.780> new

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
this twin power feature with this new

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.070 
this twin power feature with this new
version<00:04:41.170> of<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.710> 335<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.850> original<00:04:43.210> 335<00:04:43.840> had

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
version of the 335 the original 335 had

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.230 
version of the 335 the original 335 had
a<00:04:44.110> twin<00:04:44.710> turbo<00:04:44.890> it's<00:04:45.250> now<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.430> single<00:04:45.790> turbo

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
a twin turbo it's now a single turbo

a twin turbo it's now a single turbo
charger<00:04:46.720> they<00:04:47.260> have<00:04:47.560> direct<00:04:47.860> injection<00:04:48.460> now

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.970 
charger they have direct injection now
and<00:04:48.880> they<00:04:49.150> have<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.510> variable<00:04:50.200> vanos<00:04:50.530> system

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
and they have the variable vanos system

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.310 
and they have the variable vanos system
that<00:04:51.160> all<00:04:51.400> comes<00:04:51.850> together<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.480> still<00:04:53.050> produce

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
that all comes together to still produce

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.010 
that all comes together to still produce
300<00:04:53.700> foot-pounds<00:04:54.700> of<00:04:54.790> torque<00:04:54.850> but<00:04:55.210> also<00:04:55.540> 300

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
300 foot-pounds of torque but also 300

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.710 
300 foot-pounds of torque but also 300
horsepower<00:04:56.620> yet<00:04:57.370> get<00:04:57.700> greater<00:04:58.030> efficiency

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
horsepower yet get greater efficiency

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.780 
horsepower yet get greater efficiency
this<00:04:59.200> car<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.590> bigger<00:04:59.920> than<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.400> previous

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
this car is bigger than the previous

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.150 
this car is bigger than the previous
model<00:05:01.210> it's<00:05:01.390> lighter<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:02.140> has<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.650> same<00:05:02.860> power

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
model it's lighter it has the same power

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.430 
model it's lighter it has the same power
but<00:05:03.520> it<00:05:04.000> gets<00:05:04.120> better<00:05:04.360> fuel<00:05:04.720> economy<00:05:04.840> so

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
but it gets better fuel economy so

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.140 
but it gets better fuel economy so
that's<00:05:05.710> why<00:05:05.950> this<00:05:06.010> car<00:05:06.640> is<00:05:06.670> a<00:05:06.850> great

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
that's why this car is a great

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.090 
that's why this car is a great
