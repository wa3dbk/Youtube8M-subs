00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.110
 megahertz number of processor cores 4 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.869
 in principle, this is all process information 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.780
 which you may know then from us 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.990

 storage capacity 2 terabyte card reader 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.250
 we really don't have an optical dvd drive 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:51.390

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.769
 we are at the very top of the top 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.560
 start button of the computer he 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.650

 put it look front here 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.120
 it's not even a button it's just probably 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.760
 I don't even know why this is necessary here 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.099
 us along the reset button 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.790

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.900

 here we have 2 and successful and one lesbian 30 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.140
 that is, two holes can be so 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.050

 look no further we have here is the back view it 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.140
 looks very nice from behind 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.660
 we can see the cooler still with the camera pancake 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.330
 hands to demolish the camera here with us 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.569
 here is the cooler by the way 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:03.430
 cooler do not know how we have there in my 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:07.000
 cooler zalman we have here i am the usual outlets 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.280
 standard successful monitor 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.280
 this monitor is ground and can be connected 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.870
 here it is here and all sorts of surplus 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.180
 true we have very few outputs yes audio 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.610
 but this is not a problem here we connect 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.130
 wire and turn on the computer network here we are 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.019
 we can shut it down here 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.989
 various wires are located my ate 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.329
 see and basically i'm still not on the computer 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.940
 , I am sure that he is good and you 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.720
 you cost is 43 thousand 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.000
 rubles already it costs 44,000 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.489
 but I bought it for 43 ie today 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.310
 imagine came store already bought 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.370
 Grade bought here 43 became today 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.980
 in the evening I go to the site and it costs forty 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.829
 four thousand rubles and so computer i 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.950
 bought with a personal monitor from him 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.590
 using 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.200
 here is his installation disk probably 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.049
 I don't know any drivers either gender 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.389
 just elji tires drive some with 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.590
 i'll figure it out later we have everything 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:10.720
 much needed yes yes we have a connection 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.209
 for the monitor connection ordinary 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.549
 standard by the way they had been 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.609
 protection is located here is our wire 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.270
 for the computer itself that is, we have it with 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.060
 using this wire connect to the network 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.770
 we have it we have a monitor wire 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.080
 that is, we will connect it to the city this 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.630
 inserts it so that it works by 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.360
 at least he was getting power here 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.050
 we have one more adapter for our 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.210
 monitor 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.220
 for the wire from probably spare I him 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:45.250
 I leave and we have tanks here and there 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.509
 website and from cityline company 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:53.560
 this is most likely it â€™s my installer 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:56.940
 windows 8 for product use 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.400
 just from the cityline macro author 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.400
 the installer is still with us one for 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.009
 windows 8 hike two installation disks 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.080
 that is, we will have two licenses for 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.259
 windows 8 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.560
 so this is us m from salsk and for in 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.800
 first we have drivers for the most 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.909
 computer is most likely for 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.310
 motherboards and nvidia we have up 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:26.590
 I will have to go envy 770 this 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.930
 well, no matter how cape in my opinion it is 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.210
 I remember yes and masalsky driver rather 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.539
 just two is with us and gtx770 is us and 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.460
 Masalsky video card but nothing bad 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.710
 I do not see it but no it was mine 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.690
 video yes all the same so i can 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.360
 making mistakes right now is definitely not why 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.669
 a lot of masai products here 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.250
 possibly corps and soviet quite 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:52.599
 so we have different here 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:56.710
 driver again we have some guides 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:58.300
 most likely it can be for games 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.130
 they have a license any game i 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.810
 get some kind of bonus like it was in 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.690
 case with a laptop and this is ours 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.930
 motherboard motherboard operation 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.430
 that is, and I in the camera, that is, here we are 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.779
 can find all useful for us 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:18.909
 the information here is written all the necessary 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:20.500
 numbers with glasses so I will later read it 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.639
 let's see what yes how but she on 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.620
 English is therefore most likely 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.569
 they read alright all thanks for 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.190
