00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
we've been getting is whether or not

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.880 
we've been getting is whether or not
this<00:06:20.760> one<00:06:20.940> plays<00:06:21.120> ps2<00:06:21.600> games<00:06:21.840> the<00:06:22.530> answer<00:06:22.740> to

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
it does not play any of them because it
