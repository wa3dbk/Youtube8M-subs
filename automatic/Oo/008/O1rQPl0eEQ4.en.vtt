00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
make ourselves without a cup of

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.529 
make ourselves without a cup of
breadcrumbs<00:01:49.189> once<00:01:50.189> that's<00:01:50.369> cool<00:01:51.240> down<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.539 --> 00:02:03.429 
breadcrumbs once that's cool down a
little<00:01:51.720> bit<00:01:51.929> add<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.920> basil<00:01:55.069> the<00:01:56.069> egg<00:01:57.979> parsley

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.169 

about<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.470> half<00:02:04.709> a<00:02:04.799> cup<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:05.009> breadcrumbs

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.680 

and<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.920> crab

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.920 

and<00:02:13.620> mix<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.100> all<00:02:14.160> around<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.900> little

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
and mix that all around just a little

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.480 
and mix that all around just a little
bit<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.440> Dijon<00:02:19.860> mustard<00:02:20.070> too<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:25.400> think<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
bit of Dijon mustard too I think the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.160 
bit of Dijon mustard too I think the
idea<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.850> for<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> get<00:02:27.390> kind<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.720> sticky

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
idea is for it to get kind of sticky

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.230 
idea is for it to get kind of sticky
like<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.530> can<00:02:28.680> make<00:02:28.800> little<00:02:28.950> balls<00:02:29.700> out<00:02:30.060> and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
like you can make little balls out and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.630 
like you can make little balls out and
take<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.480> rest<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:33.990> breadcrumbs<00:02:34.640> put

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
take the rest of the breadcrumbs put

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.310 
take the rest of the breadcrumbs put
them<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> plate<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.150> guess<00:02:37.460> make<00:02:38.460> some<00:02:38.760> little

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
them on a plate I guess make some little

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.970 
them on a plate I guess make some little
crab<00:02:40.320> cakes<00:02:40.620> out<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.010> stuff
