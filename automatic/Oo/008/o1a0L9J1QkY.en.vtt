the stock lights back in it that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.450 
the stock lights back in it that
shouldn't<00:01:09.380> be<00:01:09.439> too<00:01:09.500> much<00:01:09.710> for<00:01:09.770> problems<00:01:10.310> so

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
shouldn't be too much for problems so

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.200 
shouldn't be too much for problems so
that<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.240> bezel<00:01:11.719> itself<00:01:12.079> looks<00:01:12.320> pretty<00:01:12.560> good

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
that the bezel itself looks pretty good

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.230

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
it's a good the motor itself the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.160 
it's a good the motor itself the
drivetrain<00:01:27.170> is<00:01:27.439> in<00:01:27.619> really<00:01:27.829> nice<00:01:28.069> condition

be a good project bike for someone we're
offering<00:01:37.329> this<00:01:38.329> bike<00:01:38.630> very<00:01:38.990> reasonable

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
offering this bike very reasonable

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.699 
offering this bike very reasonable
because<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.609> paint<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.409> back<00:01:42.409> end

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
because of the paint and the back end

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.690 
because of the paint and the back end
its<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:44.450> think<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:45.319> pretty<00:01:45.529> cheap<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.249> it's

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
its I think it's pretty cheap so it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.580 
its I think it's pretty cheap so it's
it's<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.359> good<00:01:47.509> enough<00:01:47.689> price<00:01:47.990> where<00:01:48.289> someone

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
it's a good enough price where someone

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.499 
it's a good enough price where someone
could<00:01:48.709> get<00:01:48.889> it<00:01:49.069> and<00:01:49.249> do<00:01:49.939> what<00:01:50.060> they<00:01:50.209> want<00:01:50.450> with

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
could get it and do what they want with

00:01:50.509 --> 00:02:37.320 
could get it and do what they want with
