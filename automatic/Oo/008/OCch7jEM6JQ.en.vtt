that position if there was a contract in

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.390 
that position if there was a contract in
place<00:04:49.240> then<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:52.180> know<00:04:52.330> had<00:04:52.600> a<00:04:52.630> specific

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
place then that you know had a specific

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.500 
place then that you know had a specific
morality<00:04:54.400> clause<00:04:54.670> I<00:04:54.940> think<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.330> it<00:04:55.420> would

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
morality clause I think that it would

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.240 
morality clause I think that it would
make<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.720> difference<00:04:56.200> all<00:04:56.440> right<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.560> think<00:04:57.040> at

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
make a difference all right I think at

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.040 
make a difference all right I think at
least<00:04:57.510> people<00:04:58.510> would<00:04:58.600> know<00:04:58.780> where<00:04:58.930> they're

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
least people would know where they're

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.740 
least people would know where they're
getting<00:04:59.320> into<00:04:59.620> I<00:04:59.860> didn't<00:05:00.250> know<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:01.540> was

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
going to judge so harshly that those

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.900 
going to judge so harshly that those
this<00:05:05.200> was<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.800> way<00:05:05.919> they<00:05:06.130> you<00:05:06.460> know<00:05:06.580> felt
