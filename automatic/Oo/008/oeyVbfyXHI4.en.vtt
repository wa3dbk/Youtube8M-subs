hey everyone Steve subsequent should
have<00:00:06.759> been<00:00:06.880> engineering<00:00:08.129> working<00:00:09.129> on<00:00:09.340> one<00:00:09.490> of

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:09.520 
have been engineering working on one of

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.270 
have been engineering working on one of
my<00:00:09.670> friends<00:00:09.850> ATVs<00:00:10.629> and<00:00:11.020> it's<00:00:11.740> got<00:00:11.889> CB

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
my friends ATVs and it's got CB

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.549 
my friends ATVs and it's got CB
carburetors<00:00:12.940> on<00:00:13.209> it<00:00:13.389> and<00:00:13.570> because<00:00:14.049> of<00:00:14.080> the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
carburetors on it and because of the

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.019 
carburetors on it and because of the
ability<00:00:14.740> to<00:00:15.070> see<00:00:15.279> into<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.610> co-operators

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
ability to see into the co-operators

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.060 
ability to see into the co-operators
it's<00:00:16.480> a<00:00:16.570> really<00:00:16.810> good<00:00:16.960> opportunity<00:00:17.199> to<00:00:17.830> kind

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
it's a really good opportunity to kind

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.400 
it's a really good opportunity to kind
of<00:00:18.130> show<00:00:18.390> carburetor<00:00:19.390> function<00:00:19.960> and<00:00:20.109> some<00:00:20.289> of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
of show carburetor function and some of

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.739 
of show carburetor function and some of
the<00:00:20.470> things<00:00:20.710> that<00:00:20.949> happen<00:00:21.419> we're<00:00:22.419> gonna<00:00:22.509> have

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:22.749 
the things that happen we're gonna have

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.859 
the things that happen we're gonna have
to<00:00:22.869> caption<00:00:23.349> this<00:00:23.439> video<00:00:23.800> because<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:25.660> thing

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
to caption this video because this thing

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.519 
to caption this video because this thing
is<00:00:25.990> noisy<00:00:26.619> and<00:00:26.890> so<00:00:27.640> you<00:00:28.509> know<00:00:28.630> me<00:00:29.140> trying<00:00:29.409> to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
is noisy and so you know me trying to

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.720 
is noisy and so you know me trying to
talk<00:00:29.710> about<00:00:29.859> where<00:00:30.099> it<00:00:30.130> isn't<00:00:30.429> going<00:00:30.519> to<00:00:30.609> be

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
talk about where it isn't going to be

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.700 
talk about where it isn't going to be
all<00:00:30.849> that<00:00:30.880> effective<00:00:31.300> but<00:00:31.960> basically<00:00:32.470> here's

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
all that effective but basically here's

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.350 
all that effective but basically here's
what<00:00:32.890> you're<00:00:33.070> going<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.280> see<00:00:33.550> I'm<00:00:34.090> going<00:00:34.300> to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
what you're going to see I'm going to

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.500 
what you're going to see I'm going to
fire<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:34.930> bike<00:00:35.140> up<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.460> look<00:00:36.970> down<00:00:37.150> into<00:00:37.210> the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
fire the bike up and look down into the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.390 
fire the bike up and look down into the
carburetor<00:00:37.930> throat<00:00:38.410> so<00:00:38.710> that<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:38.980> can<00:00:39.160> see

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
carburetor throat so that you can see

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.460 
carburetor throat so that you can see
what's<00:00:39.580> happening<00:00:40.030> with<00:00:40.240> the<00:00:40.330> slides<00:00:40.690> there's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
what's happening with the slides there's

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.470 
what's happening with the slides there's
no<00:00:41.680> air<00:00:41.890> filter<00:00:42.340> on<00:00:42.520> there<00:00:42.790> so<00:00:43.240> what<00:00:43.450> I

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
no air filter on there so what I

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.600 
no air filter on there so what I
ultimately<00:00:43.720> do<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.560> cover<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.160> the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
ultimately do is cover the the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.220 
ultimately do is cover the the
carburetors<00:00:46.240> with<00:00:46.540> my<00:00:46.750> hand

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
carburetors with my hand

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.050 
carburetors with my hand
and<00:00:47.710> show<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:47.980> how<00:00:48.430> these<00:00:48.640> carburetors

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
and show you how these carburetors

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.930 
and show you how these carburetors
function<00:00:49.870> when<00:00:50.050> they<00:00:50.200> have<00:00:50.860> some<00:00:51.220> restriction

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
function when they have some restriction

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.700 
function when they have some restriction
when<00:00:52.090> they<00:00:52.210> don't<00:00:52.450> have<00:00:52.720> restriction<00:00:53.470> what

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
when they don't have restriction what

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.900 
when they don't have restriction what
happens<00:00:54.070> that<00:00:54.190> they<00:00:54.340> have<00:00:54.520> too<00:00:54.760> much

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
happens that they have too much

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.200 
happens that they have too much
restriction<00:00:55.510> okay<00:00:56.050> so<00:00:56.820> let's<00:00:57.820> get<00:00:57.970> right<00:00:58.150> to

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
restriction okay so let's get right to

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:14.490 
restriction okay so let's get right to
it

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.920 
not have an air filter this one here has
a<00:02:55.010> pretty<00:02:55.370> significant<00:02:55.970> air<00:02:56.120> filter<00:02:56.480> system

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
a pretty significant air filter system

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.530 
a pretty significant air filter system
on<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.640> obviously<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:59.090> means<00:02:59.270> that<00:02:59.450> in

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
on it and obviously it means that in

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.630 
on it and obviously it means that in
order<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.750> have<00:02:59.870> best<00:03:00.200> performance<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.040> you

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
order to have best performance so you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.479 
order to have best performance so you
can<00:03:01.850> see<00:03:02.120> from<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.650> just<00:03:03.650> exactly<00:03:04.310> what

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
can see from that just exactly what

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.020 
can see from that just exactly what
happens<00:03:04.940> on<00:03:05.810> your<00:03:05.989> Kawasaki<00:03:06.680> concourse<00:03:07.340> even

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
happens on your Kawasaki concourse even

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.400 
happens on your Kawasaki concourse even
if<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.270> just<00:03:08.450> have<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.690> crack<00:03:09.020> in<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.200> air

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
if you just have the crack in the air

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.680 
if you just have the crack in the air
box<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.670> can<00:03:10.819> see<00:03:11.060> obviously<00:03:11.209> they<00:03:11.600> are

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
box and you can see obviously they are

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.000 
box and you can see obviously they are
going<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.870> give<00:03:12.020> away<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.230> lot<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.560> performance

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
going to give away a lot of performance

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.550 
going to give away a lot of performance
