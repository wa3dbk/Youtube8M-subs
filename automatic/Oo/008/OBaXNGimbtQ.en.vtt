kaffir<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.299> also<00:01:51.659> full<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> protein<00:01:52.680> or<00:01:52.860> amino

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
kaffir is also full of protein or amino

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.910 
kaffir is also full of protein or amino
acids<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.140> helps<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> rebuild<00:01:55.409> your

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
acids and that helps to rebuild your

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550 
acids and that helps to rebuild your
hair<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.399> make<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.670> shine<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.270> let's<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.409> if

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
hair and make you shine so let's see if

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.670 
hair and make you shine so let's see if
it<00:01:58.680> lives<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> the<00:02:00.000> claim

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
it lives up to the claim

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.820 
it lives up to the claim
and<00:02:00.980> oscillator<00:02:01.660> so<00:02:02.660> got<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:02.990> mask<00:02:03.230> on<00:02:03.470> now

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
and oscillator so got the mask on now

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.280 
and oscillator so got the mask on now
and<00:02:04.160> I<00:02:05.120> made<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.330> little<00:02:05.570> mistake<00:02:05.720> because<00:02:06.260> I

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
and I made a little mistake because I

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.340 
and I made a little mistake because I
want<00:02:06.620> the<00:02:06.830> cap<00:02:07.010> here<00:02:07.220> too<00:02:08.060> much<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.020> became

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
want the cap here too much and so became

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.410 
want the cap here too much and so became
really<00:02:09.830> really<00:02:09.920> clear<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.520> me<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.060> now<00:02:11.240> it's

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
really really clear to me and now it's

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.140 
really really clear to me and now it's
leaking<00:02:11.840> all<00:02:12.590> over<00:02:12.650> my<00:02:13.070> face<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.370> all<00:02:13.880> over<00:02:13.910> my

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
leaking all over my face and all over my

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.530 
leaking all over my face and all over my
t-shirt<00:02:14.890> but<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.700> okay<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.180> still<00:02:17.330> going

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
t-shirt but it's okay it's still going

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.320 
t-shirt but it's okay it's still going
to<00:02:17.660> work<00:02:17.810> I've<00:02:18.290> got<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.880> couple<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:20.000> tablespoons

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
to work I've got a couple of tablespoons

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.090 
to work I've got a couple of tablespoons
of<00:02:20.660> carefully<00:02:21.020> laughs<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.590> I'm<00:02:21.650> going<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.860> use

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
of carefully laughs and I'm going to use

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.790 
of carefully laughs and I'm going to use
that<00:02:22.280> as<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.520> face<00:02:23.210> mask<00:02:23.420> doll<00:02:24.020> in<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.200> plan<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:24.740> I

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
that as a face mask doll in a plan but I

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.850 
that as a face mask doll in a plan but I
thought<00:02:25.010> why<00:02:25.250> not<00:02:25.280> try<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:26.750> as<00:02:26.900> well<00:02:27.110> and

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
thought why not try that as well and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.700 
thought why not try that as well and
that's<00:02:28.040> leaking<00:02:28.520> all<00:02:28.730> over<00:02:28.760> my<00:02:29.120> legs<00:02:29.300> as<00:02:29.450> well

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
that's leaking all over my legs as well

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.540 
that's leaking all over my legs as well
so<00:02:32.950> let's<00:02:33.950> try<00:02:34.280> it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
so let's try it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.350 
so let's try it
and<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.600> remember<00:02:35.810> carefully<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.410> really

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
and I remember carefully is really

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.310 
and I remember carefully is really
cooling<00:02:38.709> he<00:02:39.709> just<00:02:39.920> bring<00:02:40.130> for<00:02:41.080> hot<00:02:42.080> summer

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
cooling he just bring for hot summer

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:51.270 
cooling he just bring for hot summer
weather<00:02:42.470> which<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.370> what<00:02:43.580> we're<00:02:43.730> having<00:02:43.850> now

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.940 

so<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.400> mask<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.880> on<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:54.350> feels<00:02:54.620> so

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
so the mask is on and it feels so

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.460 
so the mask is on and it feels so
cooling<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.180> unbelievable<00:02:56.870> but<00:02:57.290> it's

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
cooling it's it's unbelievable but it's

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.470 
cooling it's it's unbelievable but it's
very<00:02:57.620> liquid<00:02:58.100> because<00:02:58.550> my<00:02:58.730> kid<00:02:58.940> feels<00:02:59.209> really

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
very liquid because my kid feels really

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.320 
very liquid because my kid feels really
fresh<00:02:59.770> it's<00:03:00.770> not<00:03:02.230> matured<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:04.190> it's<00:03:05.060> very

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
fresh it's not matured so it's very

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.820 
fresh it's not matured so it's very
runny<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.930> think<00:03:06.170> I'll<00:03:06.230> have<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.410> go<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.739> lie

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
runny I think I'll have to go and lie

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.199 
runny I think I'll have to go and lie
down<00:03:06.890> for<00:03:07.220> now<00:03:07.370> or<00:03:07.640> read<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> book<00:03:07.970> or<00:03:08.180> something

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
down for now or read a book or something

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.420 
down for now or read a book or something
like<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.410> be<00:03:09.590> horizontal<00:03:09.830> because

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
like that just to be horizontal because

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.820 
like that just to be horizontal because
otherwise<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:11.239> leaking<00:03:11.570> too<00:03:11.690> much<00:03:11.870> or<00:03:12.709> maybe

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
otherwise it's leaking too much or maybe

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.400 
otherwise it's leaking too much or maybe
it's<00:03:13.010> going<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.220> dry<00:03:13.430> very<00:03:13.700> soon<00:03:14.260> Charlie<00:03:15.260> not

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
it's going to dry very soon Charlie not

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:24.970 
it's going to dry very soon Charlie not
Lucy<00:03:15.800> I'll<00:03:16.400> be<00:03:16.700> back<00:03:16.880> soon<00:03:23.140> come<00:03:24.140> back<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.739> my

Lucy I'll be back soon come back and my
ear<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.459> dry<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:26.690> it's<00:03:27.470> time<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.739> tell<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.070> what

ear is dry so it's time to tell you what
I<00:03:28.310> thought<00:03:28.550> of<00:03:28.820> this<00:03:29.060> whole<00:03:29.330> cafe<00:03:30.140> or

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
I thought of this whole cafe or

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.180 
I thought of this whole cafe or
experience<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.160> think<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.239> really<00:03:32.480> liked<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.930> I

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
experience I think I really liked it I

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.490 
experience I think I really liked it I
think<00:03:34.190> my<00:03:34.280> hair<00:03:34.550> is<00:03:34.580> feeling<00:03:35.000> much<00:03:35.209> softer<00:03:35.870> it

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
think my hair is feeling much softer it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.380 
think my hair is feeling much softer it
didn't<00:03:36.800> actually<00:03:36.890> smell<00:03:37.400> bad<00:03:37.670> until<00:03:38.180> when<00:03:38.360> I

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
didn't actually smell bad until when I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.810 
didn't actually smell bad until when I
kept<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:38.900> for<00:03:39.260> 90<00:03:39.650> minutes<00:03:39.769> instead<00:03:40.220> of<00:03:40.340> 60

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
kept it on for 90 minutes instead of 60

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.330 
kept it on for 90 minutes instead of 60
I've<00:03:41.480> spent<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.410> whole<00:03:42.560> time<00:03:42.620> reading<00:03:43.280> a

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
I've spent the whole time reading a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.729 
I've spent the whole time reading a
magazine<00:03:43.580> which<00:03:44.090> was<00:03:44.269> quite<00:03:44.510> fun<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.200> it

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
magazine which was quite fun and it

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.199 
magazine which was quite fun and it
wasn't<00:03:46.070> that<00:03:46.160> runny<00:03:46.400> answer<00:03:46.790> around<00:03:46.970> 30

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
wasn't that runny answer around 30

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.259 
wasn't that runny answer around 30
minutes<00:03:47.420> so<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.810> wasn't<00:03:48.200> too<00:03:48.350> bad<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:49.120> find<00:03:50.120> that

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
minutes so it wasn't too bad I find that

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.270 
minutes so it wasn't too bad I find that
my<00:03:50.480> scalp<00:03:50.900> is<00:03:51.170> really<00:03:51.200> really<00:03:51.980> comfortable

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
my scalp is really really comfortable

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.390 
my scalp is really really comfortable
and<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:54.110> main<00:03:54.320> thing<00:03:54.560> was<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.890> cooling

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
and the main thing was the cooling

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.280 
and the main thing was the cooling
effect<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:56.630> remembered

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
effect I remembered

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.350 
effect I remembered
kaffir<00:03:57.890> is<00:03:58.250> really<00:03:58.580> good<00:03:58.730> for<00:03:58.940> summer<00:03:59.120> month

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
kaffir is really good for summer month

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.030 
kaffir is really good for summer month
because<00:03:59.570> it's<00:03:59.840> really<00:03:59.959> cool<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.590> it's

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
because it's really cool and it's

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
definitely brilliant thing oh and by the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.420 
definitely brilliant thing oh and by the
way<00:04:46.690> forgot<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.200> mention<00:04:47.350> how<00:04:47.650> my<00:04:47.860> skin<00:04:48.160> liked

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
way forgot to mention how my skin liked

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.370 
way forgot to mention how my skin liked
it<00:04:48.640> so<00:04:49.000> my<00:04:49.120> skin<00:04:49.419> definitely<00:04:49.720> felt<00:04:50.110> really

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
it so my skin definitely felt really

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.400 
it so my skin definitely felt really
cold<00:04:50.650> as<00:04:50.890> well<00:04:51.100> and<00:04:51.370> if<00:04:52.060> fieldtrip<00:04:52.780> smooth<00:04:53.140> now

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
cold as well and if fieldtrip smooth now

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.470 
cold as well and if fieldtrip smooth now
but<00:04:54.280> it's<00:04:54.430> not<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.610> massive<00:04:54.790> difference<00:04:55.120> I

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
but it's not a massive difference I

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.260 
but it's not a massive difference I
guess<00:04:55.510> probably<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.050> my<00:04:56.260> skin<00:04:56.560> was<00:04:56.770> quite

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
guess probably the my skin was quite

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.790 
guess probably the my skin was quite
smooth<00:04:58.270> already<00:04:58.720> before<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.169> mask<00:04:59.380> so<00:04:59.770> I

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
smooth already before the mask so I

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.100 
smooth already before the mask so I
didn't<00:05:00.160> see<00:05:00.310> huge<00:05:00.580> difference<00:05:00.970> there<00:05:01.150> but<00:05:02.050> I

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
didn't see huge difference there but I

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.780 
didn't see huge difference there but I
didn't<00:05:02.380> apply<00:05:02.440> any<00:05:02.800> oil<00:05:03.070> as<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.340> moisturizer

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
didn't apply any oil as a moisturizer

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.540 
didn't apply any oil as a moisturizer
today<00:05:04.180> just<00:05:05.080> for<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.530> sake<00:05:05.740> of<00:05:05.770> experiment

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
today just for the sake of experiment

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.140 
today just for the sake of experiment
and<00:05:06.730> my<00:05:07.390> skin<00:05:07.690> still<00:05:07.960> felt<00:05:08.400> comfortable<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:09.760> I

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
and my skin still felt comfortable so I

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.200 
and my skin still felt comfortable so I
guess<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.020> came<00:05:11.200> from<00:05:11.320> ask<00:05:11.530> is<00:05:11.770> quite

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
guess that the came from ask is quite

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.320 
guess that the came from ask is quite
moisturizing<00:05:13.210> as<00:05:13.780> well<00:05:14.190> so<00:05:15.190> bottom<00:05:16.120> line<00:05:16.150> is

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
moisturizing as well so bottom line is

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.940 
moisturizing as well so bottom line is
that<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:16.690> definitely<00:05:17.140> recommend<00:05:17.350> carefully

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
that I definitely recommend carefully

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.000 
that I definitely recommend carefully
for<00:05:18.610> both<00:05:18.790> face<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:20.080> hair<00:05:20.350> if<00:05:20.860> you

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
for both face and the hair if you

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.650 
for both face and the hair if you
