00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.680
 now i'm bad costume welcome in 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.050
 this new video will forgive me if 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.210
 I speak a little low but it's night 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.179
 and now I'll explain why 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.820
 comments of my video mister vin 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 bon one of my writings writes you sera 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.130
 marcus if I had created a plant 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.240
 automatic which produces and pumpkin pies 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.220
 but without using timers 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.720
 if you'd like to try, I just wanted to give you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.369
 this inspiration given that it does not seem to me 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.019
 very easy to do to her I have 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.380
 asked him I told him but he really has i 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.030
 timer in particular or sequences 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.430
 they were want them or all the networks not 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.469
 you want it or even rest circuits 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.629
 normal not them and he told me that 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.460
 actually he didn't want and nothing that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.559
 created a loop so we can't 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.390
 don't even make the classic vanilla look 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.489
 with the rest do not repeat it and then I have 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.340
 created this very water plant 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 they tively simple methods with vanilla 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.070
 town car 3 is a bit of bull kraft now 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.870
 let's see how it works then here 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.270
 I put these nice simpa lists 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 straw golem hello dear I am in 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.590
 credit and you do not click these not 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.619
 they click just when a pumpkin 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.830
 let's take the pumpkin they sold pumpkin gourd 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.790
 pumpkin gourd pumpkin para papa when the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.369
 pumpkin grows they go and break it and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.930
 our golan workers leave it there 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.579
 with perception therefore increases the range 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.439
 they see the pumpkin drop and they go to 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.470
 bring in here where this mark is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.380
 so here ends the pumpkin 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.630
 perfect here these others though 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.670
 I'm not quick sorry these ones I have them 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.299
 put these others fast I put them 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.470
 smart because other institutions there 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.220
 they would destroy all the cane from 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.200
 sugar 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 instead when it grows they break 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.210
 only the excess one look at that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.290
 nice and as usual after that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.670
 I grew up here and here I lost her later 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.070
 that our goals have grown to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.079
 wooden workers will pick up 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.240
 the stolen and they will put it inside 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.459
 this party 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.890
 after having missed 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.319
 will jump toe for a while to see here 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.239
 that is disappearing because why here 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.560
 attacked there is a kraft tomorrow in tackle 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.330
 which produces sugar 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.980
 here I put a gate arches with a 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.599
 signals rezzo one off then 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.120
 but you can put pulsating energy 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.550
 even in stonehenge a in is not there 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.010
 I didn't make any difference for 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.050
 make it more compact then in here 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.010
 ends the sugar broken by the reeds from 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.110
 sugar 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.940
 now it's gone but let's move on here 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.920
 there is a classic pharma chicken with water 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.930
 this is a vanilla method I believe of 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.959
 have I already shown it to you in mine 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.160
 series pass the drop the hens do not 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.370
 they fall below the level 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.519
 water stopped by the say in English 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.590
 sign but from the signs and while the eggs 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.230
 cascano are brought below the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.209
 eggs fall here where it is written to and 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.440
 when they fall we do it immediately 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:11.250
 and here they are, but I don't want one 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.480
 only one I want 16 at least we do 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.680
 so pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa and here 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.299
 the eggs that fall when they fall i 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.410
 our golan workers are activated 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.390
 they take the eggs 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.459
 snap on the band returns starting 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.220
 now they do it all in two for you 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.209
 if the production increases e 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.069
 get back in here 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.670
 when it is pumpkin, sugar and eggs 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.670
 see on 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.730
 very very very nice I can't 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.000
 eating asked in creative 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.370
 this paths we call this kind of 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.990
 challenge that launched me seeing the baby 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.840
 my made me think 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.180
 I said to myself why not ask for more 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.680
 challenges ask what you want things 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.860
 also that maybe you have never seen e 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.270
 you want to know if you can do it or not 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.930
 maybe I never thought that if 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.570
 it can be done 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.580
 they put their efforts into it and we also see 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.310
 what useless guys don't have to be 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.130
 useful things for diamond production 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.840
 those already do things to me that to amy k 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.609
 they would not pass by the right, and you will 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.109
 I hope I have satisfied the 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.430
 billboard request 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.859
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.180
 I remind you who to give you if he speaks to 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.350
 low voice but it's three in the morning 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:31.160
 only that I am one even if tomorrow 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.680
 but from them I am a person is stimulated 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.169
 from things you don't know that 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.550
 he doesn't know if he can do it or not so he doesn't 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.870
 as soon as I saw that request I have 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.540
 said without a timer 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.030
 that is, I see march alive then immediately 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.970
 that there are practiced and the hula hula grapes 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.600
 hula well for good i'm in back up there 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.410
