you<00:01:25.920> having<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.280> wildlife<00:01:26.670> festival<00:01:27.210> in

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
you having a wildlife festival in

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
you having a wildlife festival in
November<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> mountains<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.090> reason

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
November in the mountains and the reason

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.749 
November in the mountains and the reason
for<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.170> their<00:01:31.829> mating<00:01:32.220> season

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
for that is this is their mating season

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.240 
for that is this is their mating season
and<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.600> bighorn<00:01:34.079> sheep<00:01:34.170> will<00:01:34.500> come<00:01:34.710> down<00:01:34.950> in

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and so bighorn sheep will come down in

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
and so bighorn sheep will come down in
lower<00:01:35.670> elevations<00:01:36.479> during<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.140> time<00:01:37.350> of
