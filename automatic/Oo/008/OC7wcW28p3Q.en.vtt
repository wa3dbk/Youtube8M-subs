out way better than I expected I

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.850 
out way better than I expected I
literally<00:03:16.030> just<00:03:16.180> made<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.780> up<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.290> morning<00:03:17.709> of

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
literally just made it up the morning of

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.420 
literally just made it up the morning of
the<00:03:18.040> race<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:19.090> um<00:03:19.480> actually<00:03:20.440> might<00:03:20.830> turn<00:03:21.250> it

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430

into<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.850> tutorial<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:22.959> because<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.560> did<00:03:23.740> come

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
into a tutorial just because it did come

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.400 
into a tutorial just because it did come
out<00:03:24.040> really<00:03:24.220> pretty<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.610> think<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:26.230> might

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
out really pretty I think that it might

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.710 
out really pretty I think that it might
be<00:03:26.590> something<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.670> guys<00:03:27.940> might<00:03:28.360> want<00:03:28.630> to

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
be something that you guys might want to

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.199 
be something that you guys might want to
try<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:29.800> don't<00:03:30.010> need<00:03:30.130> locks<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:31.030> was

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
try you don't need locks this was

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.790 
try you don't need locks this was
something<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.540> was<00:03:31.720> really<00:03:32.020> special<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.620> me

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800
