00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that will be touching the same table so

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.700 
that will be touching the same table so
in<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.320> instance<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.950> played<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> German<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
in this instance I played a German and a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.890 
in this instance I played a German and a
Turkish<00:01:37.710> woman<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> since<00:01:39.150> there<00:01:39.329> were<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.689> man

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900

Turkish woman and since there were a man
and<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.170> woman<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.560> could<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.740> played<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and a woman that could be played and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.280 
and a woman that could be played and
they<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.579> both<00:01:41.759> touching<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.450> Turkish<00:01:42.899> table

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
is a lot of control given to the player

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.449 
is a lot of control given to the player
and<00:03:33.569> will<00:03:33.810> be<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.199> great<00:03:34.590> game<00:03:34.799> for<00:03:35.069> families

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
that your turn is over since there are

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.509 
that your turn is over since there are
different<00:03:52.079> ways<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.739> your<00:03:52.919> turn<00:03:53.069> can<00:03:53.340> be

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
different ways that your turn can be

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.369 
different ways that your turn can be
ended<00:03:53.879> then<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.780> would<00:03:54.900> be<00:03:55.019> great<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.290> have

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
ended then it would be great to have

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.740 
ended then it would be great to have
more<00:03:55.560> indication<00:03:56.099> of<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:57.239> game<00:03:57.480> works

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
more indication of this this game works

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.960 
more indication of this this game works
very<00:03:58.049> well<00:03:58.169> solo<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:59.040> especially<00:03:59.370> pass<00:03:59.760> and

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
very well solo and especially pass and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.119 
very well solo and especially pass and
play<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.810> game<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.169> all<00:04:01.319> open<00:04:01.739> information

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
play the game is all open information

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.240 
play the game is all open information
and<00:04:02.669> so<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.209> great<00:04:03.510> for<00:04:04.069> multiple<00:04:05.069> players

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
and so it is great for multiple players

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.979 
and so it is great for multiple players
to<00:04:05.489> sit<00:04:05.669> around<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.030> play<00:04:06.150> at<00:04:06.299> one<00:04:06.480> time<00:04:06.720> I

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
to sit around and play at one time I

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.680 
to sit around and play at one time I
think<00:04:07.620> that<00:04:07.889> this<00:04:08.190> will<00:04:08.909> be<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.239> good<00:04:09.479> feature

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
think that this will be a good feature

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.689 
think that this will be a good feature
