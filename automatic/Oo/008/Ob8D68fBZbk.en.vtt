00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750 
directly in the corners there that way
it's<00:01:00.930> gonna<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.289> more<00:01:01.500> round<00:01:01.920> rather<00:01:02.520> than

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it's gonna be more round rather than

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.890 
it's gonna be more round rather than
just<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.329> direct<00:01:03.719> turn<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:06.390> will<00:01:06.570> make<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
just a direct turn this will make it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.390 
just a direct turn this will make it
more<00:01:07.020> comfortable<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> hand<00:01:07.890> it'll<00:01:08.250> also

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
more comfortable in the hand it'll also

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.740 
more comfortable in the hand it'll also
make<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> weapon<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> little<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:09.540> more

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
make the weapon a little bit more

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.030 
make the weapon a little bit more
durable<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.409> it'll<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.860> make<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
durable and it'll just make it

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.080 
durable and it'll just make it
all-around<00:01:11.700> easier<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.119> cut<00:01:13.220> alright<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.490> got

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
all-around easier to cut alright I got

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.780 
all-around easier to cut alright I got
all<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> metal<00:01:15.689> cut<00:01:16.020> out<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:17.009> was<00:01:17.310> quite

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
all the metal cut out it was quite

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
all the metal cut out it was quite
difficult<00:01:18.200> using<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.650> hand<00:01:19.890> tools<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:22.100> so

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
difficult using just hand tools so so

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.890 
difficult using just hand tools so so
I've<00:01:23.250> got<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> metal<00:01:23.850> cut<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.689> pretty

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I've got the metal cut out it was pretty

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
I've got the metal cut out it was pretty
difficult<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.830> use<00:01:26.130> mostly<00:01:26.520> hand

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
difficult because I use mostly hand

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.179 
difficult because I use mostly hand
tools<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.020> I've<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> cut<00:01:29.159> out

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
tools to do it but I've got it cut out

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.270 
tools to do it but I've got it cut out
now<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.290> take<00:01:31.500> files

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.249 
now what I'm going to do is take files
and<00:01:32.759> probably<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> journal<00:01:33.479> tool<00:01:33.659> also<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and probably a journal tool also and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.260 
and probably a journal tool also and
just<00:01:35.040> clean<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.520> all<00:01:35.790> up

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
just clean it all up

middle<00:01:40.170> piece<00:01:40.350> right<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:41.520> that's

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
middle piece right here because that's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
middle piece right here because that's
the<00:01:41.820> piece<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.240> gonna<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.659> between<00:01:42.810> your

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the piece it's gonna be in between your

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
to even it out so that it's a really

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.840 
to even it out so that it's a really
flush<00:02:56.670> with<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.540> metal<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:59.370> evened<00:02:59.730> out

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.530 
flush with the metal it's evened out
pretty<00:03:00.120> good<00:03:00.360> now<00:03:00.600> but<00:03:01.490> just<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:03.120> finish<00:03:03.240> it

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
pretty good now but just to finish it

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.270 
pretty good now but just to finish it
off<00:03:03.720> I'm<00:03:04.110> gonna<00:03:04.320> wrap<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.800> grip<00:03:05.010> with<00:03:05.160> some

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
off I'm gonna wrap the grip with some

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.860 
off I'm gonna wrap the grip with some
paracord<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.620> voila<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:08.970> pretty<00:03:09.330> rough<00:03:09.630> but

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
paracord and voila it's pretty rough but

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.590 
paracord and voila it's pretty rough but
it's<00:03:10.230> perfectly<00:03:10.680> usable<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.420> came

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
it's perfectly usable I think it came

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.770 
it's perfectly usable I think it came
out<00:03:12.780> all<00:03:12.930> right<00:03:13.280> now<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.550> have<00:03:15.060> pretty<00:03:15.570> big

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
out all right now I have pretty big

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.320 
out all right now I have pretty big
hands<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.410> would<00:03:17.280> recommend<00:03:17.880> something<00:03:18.180> like

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
hands I would recommend something like

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.050 
hands I would recommend something like
this<00:03:18.570> for<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.930> person<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.440> has<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:20.190> lot<00:03:20.489> smaller

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
this for a person that has a lot smaller

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.090 
this for a person that has a lot smaller
hands<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:22.410> even<00:03:23.160> with<00:03:23.780> my<00:03:24.780> hands<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.709> still

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
hands but even with my hands it still

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:39.580 
hands but even with my hands it still
fits<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.459> there<00:03:26.670> pretty<00:03:27.090> well<00:03:37.910> as<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.209> see

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
fits in there pretty well as you can see

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:52.570 
fits in there pretty well as you can see
went<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.709> there<00:03:40.890> pretty<00:03:41.190> easily

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.270 

you<00:03:53.580> do<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.000> all<00:03:54.150> day<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.650> that's<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.069> push

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
you do that all day so that's the push

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.510 
you do that all day so that's the push
dagger<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:57.380> lot<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.500> work<00:03:58.620> went<00:03:58.860> into<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.220> and

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
dagger a lot of work went into this and

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.390 
dagger a lot of work went into this and
I<00:04:00.209> think<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.599> came<00:04:00.780> out<00:04:00.989> pretty<00:04:01.349> nice<00:04:01.680> it's

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
I think it came out pretty nice it's

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.330 
I think it came out pretty nice it's
perfectly<00:04:02.910> usable<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:04.110> looks<00:04:04.380> really

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
perfectly usable and it looks really

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.930 
perfectly usable and it looks really
really<00:04:05.370> cool<00:04:06.290> but<00:04:07.459> once<00:04:08.459> again<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:08.760> think

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
really cool but once again I think

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.050 
really cool but once again I think
that's<00:04:09.300> all<00:04:09.510> we<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.840> for<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:10.140> video<00:04:10.850> if<00:04:11.850> you

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
