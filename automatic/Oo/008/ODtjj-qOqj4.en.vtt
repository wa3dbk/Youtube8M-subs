00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 so people and welcome to today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.350
 video yes you see it is again info 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.660
 video shop is last two weeks ago 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.969
 but it refers to a thing that 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.980
 many many many many wanted and indeed 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.990
 until today we can read on that 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 judo tournament what you have planned me 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.100
 first wanted to know how much pipapo 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.869
 about play and yes yours 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
 Last I would sign up now 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.210
 best 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.740
 the first name purely in the comments 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.269
 We thought up the rules 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.579
 I will continue to do so 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.320
 I have about 30 people now 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.579
 had comments to it is already 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.270
 a few maybe not 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.430
 fewer 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.290
 that's why it was going to do that to me 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.969
 is still decided 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.379
 I would like to know how it works 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.000
 a lot of things are simple thats why that is 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.360
 last chance as said for it 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.340
 to write and yes then 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.660
 I 'll dangle the tournament like 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.399
 there are many people in the ko system 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.320
 work that it is 32 people 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.039
 while it is going to be that way i 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.400
 be throws in out who is playing against whom 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.740
 and then the one in a match against 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.140
 the others are playing a match is not 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.110
 Do not forget to round a match 13 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 Games at most means who two victories 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.549
 has three plays wins sounds 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.470
 logical or and that is then a round 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.060
 many others have me in the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.520
 Comments also asked info video 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.890
 also knows precisely on I again 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.750
 counted a lot now, however , it was 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.790
 a second chance in the far too 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.920
 I do not know yet 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.869
 I do that I am quite funny 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.070
 I might then fight in the satel 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.890
 then the loser against the loser 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.880
 again but I think that is also 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.079
 too much 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.549
 I think like I said 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.680
 many people participate in which 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.640
 people like me will do that 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.810
 but that's why so redistributed 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.930
 he is also i'm going to join in 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.520
 tournament somewhere random in there and me 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.320
 then everything will follow suit 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.329
 comment on whether we do it that way 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.579
 in the mega the file sends you theirs 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.110
 or the viewer is fooled 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.100
 and then record that way by the way 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.200
 i also comment that maybe 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.250
 even better because there i could 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.750
 not necessarily see your dealers 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.280
 but say oh he plays that and that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.120
 made that and that interesting thing 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.940
 could have others 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.610
 this is for me so oh my god awakens 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.230
 now the bls that would be no 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.550
 judge that nicolas would do 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.670
 that's why you can my comments 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.230
 that's why people definitely write 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.530
 betrayed pokemon writes pogue comes on 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.260
 Saturday morning must be tomorrow 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.700
 work but I have pokÃ©mon ready 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.850
 Rendered without it will be on everyone tomorrow 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.250

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.380
 bmw or yue gu I have to look ever 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.320
 after this 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.160
 and yes, otherwise it would actually be people 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.050
 said iphone provider writes pure and 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.610
 Another thing I necessarily do 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.630
 I still want to do that, and yes I have 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.520
 zero ever opens an account here 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.440
 yes yes zero and the tables before two 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.350
 Months last made something like 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.980
 You never had anything to do with that and 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.450
 I reactivated is now easy so 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.450
 you can help me make happen now 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.250
 I'll get it from this morning the day after tomorrow 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.070
 answer everywhere 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.560
 and that's the way it is with my instagram 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:16.709
 ak and that's why I have already 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.209
 a few days years and yes the pictures de 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.950
 I'll probably go now 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.360
 economy reactivate well again 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.730
 is just going to pack up and now 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.440
 then somehow that fits in because of that 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.940
 For example do you know my friends? 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.130
 hope the video has something fader 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.989
 helped as I said that has no beard 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.880
 came but I'm totally broke from the 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.400
 I did not want to work 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.720
 the rush in the timetable so what if 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.120
 I was not the last few days too 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.590
 home 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.690
 that means not at home arrived at home 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.770
 and then immediately drove away but 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.140
 I would be a few probably 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.610
 therefore always tell in the buddy 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.440
 on the way or otherwise is because of it 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.600
 wait stress i'll give him the arms and 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.280
 although more intensively at home again 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.230
 some one fun for tomorrow and 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.390
 that was stressful hope the week now 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.680
 will look better times in any case 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.819
 people i would say that out of the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.810
 today's couple we are first time 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.810
