 [Music] 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.550
 value before loss value of 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.769
 replacement to say expert or value 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.269
 residual difficult to find between 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.310
 all these notions of expertise 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.140
 automobile and yet these values ​​are 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.150
 very important since they allow 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.619
 to an insurer to define compensation 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.839
 for a damaged vehicle 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.970
 here are some ways to navigate 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.439
 more easily the basic principle of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.510
 the appraiser to compare the amount of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.400
 repairs to the value of the vehicle on 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.450
 the second-hand market so the value 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.340
 of the vehicle it is calculated from 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.970
 several ways to know balance 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.990
 technical basis argus and ads have 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.430
 makes a vehicle worth 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.830
 we figure the amount of the repair 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 of the vehicle they compared the value of the 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.400
 vehicle this is called the vrs 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.950
 pre- disaster value it's not something 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.600
 thing that is defined from the advanced 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.450
 define roughly according to the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.060
 vehicle amount at the period also 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.010
 where the accident is happening ie 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.930
 a convertible weighing less expensive 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.100
 winter than in summer and depending on 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.530
 general maintenance of the vehicle 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 then the crashed vehicle he has a 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.620
 value called residual value 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.080
 that's what he calls a value after 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.180
 disaster after an accident the insurer 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.040
 therefore sends an expert to gauge the state 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.880
 of the vehicle several elements make 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.800
 trala good account 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 we have depreciation tables in 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.020
 function of the number of years have rather 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.800
 according to the number of months 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.810
 vehicle mileage 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.300
 does it intervene when it generates 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.810
 plus capital gains or losses 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.580
 vehicle maintenance 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.090
 we are very careful about the state 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.340
 general value in the market of over 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.500
 the coast of the second hand market 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.979
 earlier all these settings 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.770
 put end to end and allow well to 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.330
 the expert to establish a harbor a worth 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.000
 alternative say expert is from 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.610
 this value 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.770
 which we talk about when your insurer 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.130
 offers you compensation at a 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.420
 accident in total loss or theft 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.190
 so to summarize the value before 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.570
 sinister is the real value 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.729
 of the vehicle when his 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.930
 owner decides on sweat and the 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.330
 substitute value to say expert 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.910
 or market value comes after a 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.990
 accident and the residual value 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.000
 represents the value 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.160
 remaining vehicle in terms of pabx 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.440
 in this very specific case where the car 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.690
 is no longer usable the insurer can 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.340
 propose to buy it back 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.780
 if the insured as part of a case 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.209
 wrecked 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.900
 that is, the value of the repair 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.150
 exceeds the value 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.980
 this is called difference treatment 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.170
 values ​​if the insured person gives up his 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.489
 vehicle to the insurance company and 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.880
 touch the pre- disaster value to say 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.500
 expert 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.030
 on the other hand he always has the choice of 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.160
 keep the vehicle worth 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.570
 residual value after disaster goes 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.400
 be deducted from the value ahead 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.750
 in the event that an insured 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.850
 would oppose the results of 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.070
 expert appraisals can 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.900
 to be engaged at the end of the second he 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.440
 will eventually have to comply with the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.060
 decision deemed final and irrevocable 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.810
 therefore, advises policyholders who 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.940
 would feel aggrieved 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.739
 remember to keep track of 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.959
 changes made to your vehicle 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.430
 all bills for a new engine 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.200
 or new brake pads 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.190
 should be stored in a shelter 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.140
 folder 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.269
 this will enhance the value of 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.290
 the car and thus benefit from a 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.290
 much better compensation 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.219
