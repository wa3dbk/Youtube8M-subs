00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.559
 we will revise the language with this is a 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.260
 special table for those who 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.779
 like to draw or design can do 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.029
 tables or add the original partners 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.369
 Andhra studios seek to find 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.900
 information about the tablet and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.900
 also the applications that we can 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.140
 install to give you an acquaintance here 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.719
 have people we found the table that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.180
 let's leave it isolated by movement 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.250
 here we have in installation with the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.100
 manual 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.290
 and a guide how to install it in those that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.540
 we can also use it as the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.900
 cable to connect it to the computer to the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.760
 obama management and meetings to change 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.680
 to when it is necessary the first thing that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.350
 they will do is install the software 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.780
 dongbu and connect the usb cable to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.510
 computer me more then you should know that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.360
 the table has marked an area where 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.720
 let's use it because sometimes with the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.780
 mouse we usually press on a place and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.580
 go back to continue but you're like 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.220
 outside the desk area so we can 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.440
 continue on the track and half is also going to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.240
 be in the middle of the desk if yes what 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.700
 we put in a corner is also going to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 see in the corner if we go back it's going to 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 return will not continue in the same 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.000
 place does not need to press much 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.369
 the pen against the tablet so you can 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.640
 work can only sustain it from 3 to 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.820
 5 millimeters and we see how it moves 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.410
 also to right click 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.640
 press the top button and 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.640
 we found the options 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.580
 here we have the software that we have 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.010
 installed where we are going to find 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.780
 various applications and the tutorial that 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.850
 will serve as a guide and help for 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.619
 learn to use the ink pen 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.619
 digital draw and paint 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.039
 as I told you here we have different 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.130
 applications but we can also 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.230
 download more bamboo collection 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.660
 the entire collection are all 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.030
 applications that we can use some 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.820
 that others are recommended to play 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.010
 to create documents or paint and other 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.840
 that are utility like wing touch that 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.220
 seems to be the ideal complement of 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.870
 Facebook 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.770
 we have downloaded some 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.090
 applications like this game where 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.459
 we must free the bird 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.890
 for that we must make circles or 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.430
 square circles are made 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.870
 pressing the tip of the pencil and the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.870
 squares tracing the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.980
 we also have an application here 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.709
 to edit photographs and images cycle 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.020
 shopper draw smoke call paint 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.300
 can even insert images of those 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.709
 computers do not have to create new ones 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.709
 let's import one 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.950
 here as we see is a pretty problem 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.380
 similar to photoshop although we see a 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.450
 little more limited but we have enough 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.930
 tools like those that can attack 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.070
 neither is it to clone the state of 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.840
 text text hÃ©ctor one 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.270
 brush tool to make your 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.890
 jobs around here we have also is 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.140
 to modify the image of our 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.570
 Nice to meet you with our girl 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.950
 doing some things to get some 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.500
 really weird things or followers 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.930
 photographs but you who we are 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.770
 experts will be able to do what they are 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.510
 crave 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.970
 another of the applications that we have 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.590
 found in the software is a call 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.760
 double cross that allows us to draw 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.710
 I imagine you will love those 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.210
 people who liked to make their 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.880
 creations in the computer and sometimes not 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.590
 You can do it with the help of the mouse 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.340
 remember that this pencil 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.130
 allows them to draw lines according to the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.690
 way how they press it for example if 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.400
 I want to make a very strong stroke 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.400
 I keep pressed 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.200
 while that is to do more prayer instead 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.360
 if I want to make a thin line 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.379
 I simply do 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.270
 well and this is quite practical I imagine 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.810
 for people who know how to draw the truth 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.560
 shared I do not know much about this either 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.560
 but you do what you left 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.500
 as I was telling you a moment ago, 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.200
 designated area here is the area of â€‹â€‹the 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 screen if we place ourselves in any 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.970
 of the areas we will not be able to draw 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.690
 because we would have to get right 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.690
 where is the paper 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:10.120
 and one more application that we are going to 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.120
 show is this call animator 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.990
 feed them present second version is 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.540
 an application that the second we've 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.480
 seen allows us to be just like your 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.280
 name says animations here we 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.480
 we have created one but you can 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.550
 do the same action applies in the 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.450
 animation here have the two grades by 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.450
 example this one 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.199
 what is a beach a forest even the 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.419
 space because he has the tools 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:43.280
 to make your pencil strokes push the 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.090
 colors that they want to use they choose them 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.070
 here 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.070
 in this case we will have yellow 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.580
 the notes 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.220
 but we in a crusader so 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.580
 let's load one of the projects that 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.580
 we have done 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.860
 to reproduce it they have to go to 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.880
 playback 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.860
 and choose the speed 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.040
 let's move the vibration to be 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.990
 here 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.990
 and four blocks per second 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.759
 It's pretty fun and it's not required 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.580
 be a cartoonist to do what 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.069
 you do 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.689
 and you are more skillful with the 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.789
 drawings can already do more things 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:32.159
 interesting and share them because here 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:35.039
 they always share those and the fape and 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:38.180
 a permission to share your video in the 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.220
 wacom channel from youtube 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.539
 well these have been some of the 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.270
 applications that we have been able to prove in 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:46.330
 the time we have had on the tablet 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.250
 remember that 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.680
 in the work area so essential 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.289
 they have to get used to this so 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.270
 other is quite practical is like a 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:57.099
 mouse works from a bus you can use them 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.000
 with any application actually 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:00.000
 even with word 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.189
 if you want to insert this one hand 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.349
 they just have to make the strokes 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:09.289
 I'm writing and it's going to come out 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:11.360
 the word is sometimes necessary another 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:14.449
 sometimes not so much but I imagine that everything 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.110
 it depends how we trace the girls the 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.110
 words 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.590
 all that for example as it would be very good 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.710
 what you think write so 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.750
 It all depends on how you use the 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.090
 not only can they insert text 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.040
 from this box but they can also 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.930
 do it using an application called 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.570
 and your fish layman which can 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.220
 download from the wacom website that 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.250
 will allow annotations in any 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.620
 file type you have to excel 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.660
 even from the 2007 version for 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.000
 ahead so it would be a matter of that 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.620
 Logically the annotations 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.240
 that they are going to leave freehand goes to 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.340
 be like history and being on a 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.530
 notebook with the help of this pencil 

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.840
 then friends that has been all in this 

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.840
 review the truth that we thought was a 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.790
 interesting tablet for certain kind of 

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.370
 public, I do not think that everyone 

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.370
 very comfortable but there is a segment that 

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:13.030
 if you are going to find it quite attractive 

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.030
 Until another chance
