I'm<00:02:33.409> still<00:02:33.799> not<00:02:33.950> sure<00:02:34.010> about<00:02:34.430> them<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:35.620> but

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
I'm still not sure about them now but

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.199 
I'm still not sure about them now but
when<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.769> put<00:02:37.010> them<00:02:37.099> on<00:02:37.220> foot<00:02:37.579> that<00:02:38.000> would<00:02:38.090> be<00:02:38.180> a

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
when I put them on foot that would be a

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.630 
when I put them on foot that would be a
different<00:02:38.599> thing<00:02:38.629> I<00:02:38.870> reckon<00:02:39.140> not<00:02:39.829> no<00:02:40.069> leather

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
different thing I reckon not no leather

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.270 
different thing I reckon not no leather
strap<00:02:40.879> that<00:02:40.909> I<00:02:41.239> like<00:02:41.750> them<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.859> like<00:02:42.890> them<00:02:43.189> a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
strap that I like them and I like them a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.740 
strap that I like them and I like them a
lot<00:02:43.569> as<00:02:44.859> an<00:02:45.859> anniversary<00:02:46.159> trainer<00:02:46.909> it's<00:02:47.510> one

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
lot as an anniversary trainer it's one

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.930 
lot as an anniversary trainer it's one
that<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.079> to<00:02:48.170> have<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:48.379> the<00:02:48.470> collection

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
that you have to have in the collection

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.759 
that you have to have in the collection
night<00:02:49.940> did<00:02:50.359> do<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.569> preliminary<00:02:50.870> drop<00:02:51.409> of<00:02:51.590> these

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
night did do a preliminary drop of these

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.059 
night did do a preliminary drop of these
and<00:02:52.040> then<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.690> then<00:02:53.989> they<00:02:54.139> sold<00:02:54.440> out<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:54.950> they

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
and then and then they sold out so they

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.099 
and then and then they sold out so they
make<00:02:55.310> up<00:02:55.489> again<00:02:55.760> they<00:02:55.879> may<00:02:56.030> not<00:02:56.209> by<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.930> way

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
make up again they may not by the way

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.170 
make up again they may not by the way
some<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.590> these<00:02:57.769> materials<00:02:58.579> now<00:02:58.760> this<00:02:58.940> is<00:02:59.060> why

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
some of these materials now this is why

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.670 
some of these materials now this is why
I<00:02:59.209> don't<00:02:59.329> necessarily<00:03:00.019> believe<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.319> this

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
I don't necessarily believe that this

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.629 
I don't necessarily believe that this
was<00:03:00.829> a<00:03:00.859> trainer<00:03:01.129> that<00:03:01.250> Tinker<00:03:01.609> Hatfield

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
was a trainer that Tinker Hatfield

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.420 
was a trainer that Tinker Hatfield
designed<00:03:02.420> before<00:03:02.659> the<00:03:03.500> Nike<00:03:03.709> Air<00:03:03.889> Max<00:03:03.920> one

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
designed before the Nike Air Max one

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.910 
designed before the Nike Air Max one
because<00:03:05.090> some<00:03:05.269> of<00:03:05.299> these<00:03:05.450> materials<00:03:05.659> and<00:03:06.379> this

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
because some of these materials and this

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.879 
because some of these materials and this
technology<00:03:07.549> just<00:03:08.150> wasn't<00:03:08.209> about<00:03:08.780> unless<00:03:09.680> he's

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
technology just wasn't about unless he's

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.860 
technology just wasn't about unless he's
designed<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.670> with<00:03:10.879> a<00:03:10.909> view<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.269> he<00:03:11.629> was<00:03:11.750> in

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
designed it with a view that he was in

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.930 
designed it with a view that he was in
the<00:03:11.959> future<00:03:12.379> and<00:03:12.739> he's<00:03:13.159> thinking<00:03:13.370> Rob<00:03:13.760> when

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
the future and he's thinking Rob when

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.940 
the future and he's thinking Rob when
the<00:03:14.030> technologies<00:03:14.480> come<00:03:14.690> about<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:15.139> am<00:03:15.889> going

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
the technologies come about I am going

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.520 
the technologies come about I am going
to<00:03:16.489> be<00:03:16.639> making<00:03:16.819> this<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.569> let's<00:03:18.230> just<00:03:18.379> get<00:03:18.440> into

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
to be making this so let's just get into

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.439 
to be making this so let's just get into
some<00:03:18.739> of<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.889> details<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.519> this<00:03:19.879> might<00:03:20.090> swoosh

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
some of the details so this might swoosh

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.479 
some of the details so this might swoosh
I<00:03:20.629> believe<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.019> free<00:03:21.290> M<00:03:21.440> I'll<00:03:22.010> test<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.430> out

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
I believe is free M I'll test that out

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.250 
I believe is free M I'll test that out
later<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.910> I'll<00:03:23.030> put<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.239> bit<00:03:23.419> of<00:03:23.449> them<00:03:23.720> I'll

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
later and I'll put a bit of them I'll

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.390 
later and I'll put a bit of them I'll
put<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.500> flash<00:03:24.709> on<00:03:25.090> then<00:03:26.090> you've<00:03:26.239> got<00:03:26.449> these

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
put the flash on then you've got these

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.309 
put the flash on then you've got these
this<00:03:28.400> material<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:29.449> don't<00:03:30.019> know<00:03:30.139> how<00:03:30.230> to

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
this material is I don't know how to

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.659 
this material is I don't know how to
describe<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:32.120> not<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.359> rubber<00:03:33.489> but<00:03:34.489> it's

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
describe it it's not a rubber but it's

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.809 
describe it it's not a rubber but it's
like<00:03:34.849> the<00:03:35.030> toe<00:03:35.419> cap<00:03:35.750> of<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:36.230> flying<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:37.040> chuckle

like the toe cap of a flying it chuckle

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.460 
like the toe cap of a flying it chuckle
if<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.870> makes<00:03:39.079> sense

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
if that makes sense

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.930 
if that makes sense
it's<00:03:39.709> like<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:39.949> toe<00:03:40.160> cap<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.519> flying<00:03:40.760> it

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
it's like the toe cap of a flying it

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.789 
it's like the toe cap of a flying it
chuckle<00:03:41.299> so<00:03:41.810> kind<00:03:42.019> of<00:03:42.079> like<00:03:42.199> a<00:03:42.319> a<00:03:42.500> rubber

that's mad that's going to squeak and
then<00:04:01.489> you've<00:04:01.639> got<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.909> night<00:04:02.120> at<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.389> bottom

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
then you've got the night at the bottom

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.589 
then you've got the night at the bottom
like<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:03.799> white<00:04:04.310> sole<00:04:04.760> which<00:04:05.090> I'm<00:04:05.209> not<00:04:05.299> a<00:04:05.359> fan<00:04:05.569> of

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
like a white sole which I'm not a fan of

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.409 
like a white sole which I'm not a fan of
white<00:04:06.169> souls<00:04:07.010> like<00:04:07.340> that<00:04:07.579> but<00:04:07.790> hey<00:04:07.970> how<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.299> is

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
white souls like that but hey how it is

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.770 
white souls like that but hey how it is
what<00:04:08.599> it<00:04:08.690> is<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:10.090> believe<00:04:11.090> these<00:04:11.269> laces<00:04:11.659> are

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
what it is I believe these laces are

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.020 
what it is I believe these laces are
free<00:04:12.019> em<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.780> believe<00:04:15.109> that<00:04:15.470> this<00:04:16.459> is<00:04:16.729> free

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
free em and I believe that this is free

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.219 
free em and I believe that this is free
em<00:04:17.150> but<00:04:17.329> I'm<00:04:17.419> gonna<00:04:17.479> turn<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.810> flash<00:04:17.959> on<00:04:18.079> in<00:04:18.199> a

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
em but I'm gonna turn the flash on in a

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.710 
em but I'm gonna turn the flash on in a
minute<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:19.340> toe<00:04:19.579> box<00:04:19.820> as<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.120> stands<00:04:20.389> it

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
minute and the toe box as it stands it

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.690 
minute and the toe box as it stands it
is<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.870> nice<00:04:21.079> shape<00:04:21.380> but<00:04:22.190> when<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.400> turn<00:04:22.550> it

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.879 
was talking about this tall box and this
material<00:04:53.010> I<00:04:53.550> said<00:04:53.940> was<00:04:54.510> like<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:55.139> material

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
material I said was like the material

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.620 
material I said was like the material
that<00:04:56.040> is<00:04:56.220> on<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:57.470> what's<00:04:58.470> it<00:04:58.560> called<00:04:59.270> the<00:05:00.270> sock

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
that is on the what's it called the sock

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.790 
that is on the what's it called the sock
dance<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:02.160> so<00:05:02.970> it's<00:05:03.210> not<00:05:03.419> very<00:05:03.630> stable<00:05:04.380> but

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
dance so it so it's not very stable but

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.070 
dance so it so it's not very stable but
I<00:05:04.889> think<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.400> but<00:05:05.910> again<00:05:06.090> I'll<00:05:06.540> do<00:05:06.690> non<00:05:06.840> foot

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
lightning that part is 3m as well and

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.900 
lightning that part is 3m as well and
and<00:05:47.020> if<00:05:47.140> I<00:05:47.230> just<00:05:47.380> zoom<00:05:47.440> in<00:05:47.860> on<00:05:47.950> the<00:05:48.070> sock<00:05:48.340> on<00:05:48.880> the

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
and if I just zoom in on the sock on the

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.460 
and if I just zoom in on the sock on the
toe<00:05:49.180> box<00:05:49.450> you<00:05:49.600> can<00:05:49.780> just<00:05:49.810> see<00:05:50.170> that<00:05:50.200> material

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
toe box you can just see that material

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.600 
toe box you can just see that material
there<00:05:51.480> it<00:05:53.040> hopefully<00:05:54.040> doesn't<00:05:54.190> mold<00:05:54.490> to<00:05:54.580> the

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
there it hopefully doesn't mold to the

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.510 
there it hopefully doesn't mold to the
shape<00:05:54.700> of<00:05:55.030> my<00:05:55.090> toes<00:05:56.280> hopefully<00:05:57.280> it<00:05:57.370> doesn't

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
shape of my toes hopefully it doesn't

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.610 
shape of my toes hopefully it doesn't
but<00:05:58.060> I'm<00:05:58.210> anyway<00:05:58.600> and<00:05:59.170> then<00:05:59.350> you've<00:05:59.470> got<00:05:59.590> that

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
but I'm anyway and then you've got that

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.830 
but I'm anyway and then you've got that
air<00:05:59.920> unit<00:06:00.310> which<00:06:00.760> is<00:06:00.880> like<00:06:01.030> a<00:06:01.060> turquoise<00:06:01.330> air

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
air unit which is like a turquoise air

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.740 
air unit which is like a turquoise air
unit<00:06:02.110> by<00:06:02.590> all<00:06:02.710> accounts<00:06:02.830> it<00:06:03.190> works<00:06:03.750> ultimately

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
unit by all accounts it works ultimately

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.820 
unit by all accounts it works ultimately
I<00:06:04.840> think<00:06:04.990> what's<00:06:05.140> gonna<00:06:05.260> happen<00:06:05.320> with<00:06:05.620> these

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
I think what's gonna happen with these

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.950 
I think what's gonna happen with these
is<00:06:06.160> they're<00:06:06.880> gonna<00:06:07.000> release<00:06:07.510> them<00:06:07.810> in

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
is they're gonna release them in

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.780 
is they're gonna release them in
different<00:06:08.110> colorways<00:06:08.590> but<00:06:09.130> this<00:06:09.370> will<00:06:09.550> be<00:06:09.670> the

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
different colorways but this will be the

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.450 
different colorways but this will be the
og<00:06:10.300> first<00:06:10.810> version<00:06:11.350> and<00:06:11.500> I<00:06:11.920> believe<00:06:12.160> when<00:06:12.340> they

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
og first version and I believe when they

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.430 
og first version and I believe when they
sell<00:06:12.730> out<00:06:12.760> they<00:06:13.030> sell<00:06:13.300> out<00:06:13.330> so<00:06:14.050> these<00:06:14.230> were<00:06:14.410> a

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
sell out they sell out so these were a

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.100 
sell out they sell out so these were a
hundred<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:14.980> I<00:06:15.340> don't<00:06:16.150> even<00:06:16.300> know<00:06:16.540> but<00:06:16.570> I<00:06:16.840> use

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
hundred and I don't even know but I use

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.860 
hundred and I don't even know but I use
a<00:06:17.140> pulse<00:06:17.470> cold<00:06:17.800> on<00:06:18.130> them<00:06:18.370> so<00:06:18.970> you<00:06:19.420> can<00:06:19.570> see<00:06:19.690> my

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
a pulse cold on them so you can see my
