00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
heavy lifts on days i do speed work I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.090 
heavy lifts on days i do speed work I
normally<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.360> try<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> keep<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> intent<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100

the<00:01:11.220> day<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:12.090> keep<00:01:12.299> them<00:01:12.330> fast<00:01:13.729> that<00:01:14.729> way

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the day and just keep them fast that way

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429 
the day and just keep them fast that way
you<00:01:15.000> recover<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> little<00:01:15.930> better<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.320> your

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you recover a little better from your

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.350 
you recover a little better from your
workout<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> don't<00:01:17.189> get<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.549> devastated

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.510 

so<00:01:21.360> here's<00:01:21.600> an<00:01:21.720> example<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.530> speed<00:01:23.310> pull

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
so here's an example of a speed pull

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.730 
so here's an example of a speed pull
against<00:01:23.790> some<00:01:23.970> bands<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.229> pulling<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
against some bands see here pulling it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.999 
against some bands see here pulling it
from<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> floor<00:01:26.840> get<00:01:27.840> myself<00:01:28.020> tight<00:01:28.500> trying

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
from the floor get myself tight trying

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.890 
from the floor get myself tight trying
to<00:01:29.100> wind<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.210> explore<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.659> into<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
to wind up and explore it into the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.960 
to wind up and explore it into the
weight<00:01:31.079> best<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.670> here's<00:01:32.670> some

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
weight best you can here's some

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.210 
weight best you can here's some
assistance<00:01:33.900> work<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.740> stiff<00:01:34.979> leg

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
assistance work this is just a stiff leg

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.060 
assistance work this is just a stiff leg
deadlift<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.970> off<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.450> bumper<00:01:36.810> plate<00:01:37.070> about

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
deadlift on off of a bumper plate about

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.539 
deadlift on off of a bumper plate about
a<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.549> about<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> 4<00:01:39.780> inch<00:01:40.070> well<00:01:41.070> probably<00:01:41.369> about

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
a for about a 4 inch well probably about

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.819 
a for about a 4 inch well probably about
three<00:01:41.850> inch<00:01:41.970> deficit<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.689> maybe<00:01:43.290> 4<00:01:43.680> inch

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
three inch deficit or so maybe 4 inch

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.249 
three inch deficit or so maybe 4 inch
but<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.640> almost<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:45.030> pulling<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> weights

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
but it's almost like pulling the weights

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.770 
but it's almost like pulling the weights
off<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.680> shoe<00:01:46.890> laces<00:01:46.920> they're<00:01:47.600> also<00:01:48.600> using

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
off your shoe laces they're also using

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.810 
off your shoe laces they're also using
