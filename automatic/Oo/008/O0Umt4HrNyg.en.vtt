00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.540
 Y 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.820
 Y 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.469
 for everyone the same and welcome to a 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.829
 new video of battlefield 4 today we are 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:29.039
 playing admits gration eradication in 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.039
 the map of the east condo of snow 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.009
 local operation I think it's called 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.990
 always always always confuse me the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.909
 name and today I wanted to talk to you a little 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.780
 of strategy and different ways of 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.219
 play this game mode in a way 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.259
 smart and in a fun way and 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.280
 I'm going to spend it really all 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.780
 I played in the game 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.310
 obviously I will summarize it a bit 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.450
 because there is a lot of running on the maps 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.569
 at the end of the week 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.099
 they are always very long and for me 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.709
 strategy that you are using here and a 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:58.599
 important thing is that the as it's called 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.640
 this filing was 64 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:02.799
 players which I usually 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.770
 I try to avoid let's talk a little bit 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.270
 of that also in the games of 64 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.979
 players are fun to me it seems 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.440
 in conquest it seems to me that conquest 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.750
 is done by the way I do not know if some 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.099
 trento experienced but lately 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.599
 I'm having a type of forest in 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.280
 the game that I'm running the moment 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.190
 another one is like if it were a lake 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.270
 incredible that teleports me a couple 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.460
 of steps back 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.460
 and you give me a lot, it's horrible 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.400
 this problem but well let's continue 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.140
 talking about eradication 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.970
 it usually seems to me that the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.410
 games of 64 players to give 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.080
 can do in the new generations 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.790
 of console and also in the project 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.720
 I was playing Baron film 3 notorious with 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.000
 this Friends 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.770
 and in baron phil 3 is upside down the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.530
 configuration of where the medicine cabinet is 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.960
 and where is the paddles then in 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.680
 male filtered from the raisin by stretching the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.950
 the box and now the same is happening to me 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.080
 Well, talking about 64 players 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.670
 it seems to me that the best game mode 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.190
 conquest because it is where it is best given 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.710
 the maps are absolutely complete 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.230
 large in male 4 you can use a 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.370
 lots of planes and a lot good at 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.500
 actually the same amount of goods by 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.640
 a lot of vehicles and in 64 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.680
 players is usually where better 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.970
 it feels like I think that's where it is 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.550
 the experience for 64 more players 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.140
 more satisfactory apart from that is 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.300
 giving in squadron that is something else that 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.280
 Now let's talk about that in the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.020
 games 64 players of conquests 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.810
 where you can probably get him 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.670
 much more played to play with your 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.680
 friends and with classmates and everything and so on 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.930
 including to me conquest by general not 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.280
 I like to play only obliteration that 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.740
 has quickly become the same 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.500
 Baron Fut's favorite game games 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.630
 it's a bit different first of all to 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.210
 64 players on this map always what 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.940
 they make very complicated you almost never see a 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.370
 game where someone wins the game 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.350
 having planted the three bombs here 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.180
 not usually time runs out what 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.100
 which makes the spot of each 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.690
 one of the two teams is at 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.400
 end of each of the map and as the map 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.760
 rectangular really is a straight line 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.470
 the claustrophobic effect of 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.510
 shoot in nearby corridors and 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.190
 closed corridors except this part of 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.240
 outside as a team can here 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.650
 to write the bomb the goal and and 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.209
 what is it called and the only part that is 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.769
 really outdoors is that part of 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.440
 outside but let's talk a little bit about 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.700
 the eradication strategy with 64 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.550
 players because it 's important the 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.610
 number 2 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.349
 in a little number 1 the squadron in 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.750
 the one you are here was playing 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.419
 with a bunch of guiris gringos no 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.770
 I knew them the truth but what I 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.080
 had done since the previous game 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.909
 before entering this map was to look 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.190
 what the squad to play more 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.569
 team is very easy to do it does not have 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.060
 No complications can be done 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.289
 whenever they are playing alone no no no 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.449
 they have to stay in the squadron that 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.039
 they have put them all at once but 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.629
 when they are with 64 players first 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.550
 that they have to hopefully look for a squadron 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.110
 that is full is to enter search in 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.240
 join the game in different 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.490
 squads and search if alphabeta charly 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.800
 delta etc. any of which 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.840
 have 4 or 5 players who are playing 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.520
 by definite does not necessarily have 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.219
 to be playing and you see us 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.810
 up in the highest part of the 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:15.699
 score of the partners but in that 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.599
 be that you see them or be and 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.389
 obviously the only way to 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.979
 experience it I can play with each one of 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.500
 the squads a little while that you 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.210
 see them that they are really 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.159
 entering being born with his companions that 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.750
 have different classes as you can see 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.670
 here we had engineers we had support 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.800
 we had a corner we had 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.910
 and what's his name we had an assault and that 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.160
 means that among all of us 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.840
 We could give ammunition and we could 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.820
 give life and we could be reliving 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.330
 and we had ways to open a gap 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.010
 with the rockets in other parts of the map 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.390
 and so on or so he did he did it very 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.080
 well because he's on a streak 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.640
 great and that 's the first thing 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.730
 it seems to me that it is important to play 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.010
 with 64 players the second is to try 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.720
 get a lot of points that you 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.310
 help you first of all reliving 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.300
 teammates if you're in 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.290
 support 'do not bullets them and always 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.110
 colleagues from another team and that's 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.280
 important not necessarily to others 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.780
 players that of course it helps 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.190
 but when you spend your time reliving 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.660
 teammates and if you're the 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.610
 leader of the squadron you start giving them 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.440
 instructions whether they follow them or not 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.500
 follow is the relevant every time if 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.510
 the follow you begin to accumulate 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.070
 as it is called is the famous Brouwer 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.020
 that little bit that you see down there 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.120
 where the specializations begin 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.090
 of field that helps the whole team 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.000
 to go up their improvements then it is 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.470
 most important and to escort the 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.240
 bomb people what you have to 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.759
 to do is to try to open up your field 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.590
 between spaces where they are not in the 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.539
 case in my case to be able to try 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.759
 open up that field and be able to make 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.080
 what is it called that they had 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:50.060
 gaps to enter the territory 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.919
 enemy what I decided to do is bring the 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.380
 doll with silencer as you can see 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:56.000
 here and is using the weapon of a 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.830
 very effective way flanking the 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.870
 enemies then what do I try to 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.160
 always enter the enemy zone 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.900
 where we are where the enemies are 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.300
 but without them seeing so that I do not 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.789
 can you find then those are the 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.860
 small as they are called small 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.690
 tips that I want to give them to play 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.009
 a little bit of eradication on this map 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:19.130
 especially with 64 players that is so 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:20.690
 complicated and that they do it real well I 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.919
 remember a single pump the only thing that 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.620
 they occupy to win because if the 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:26.860
 planted and manage to weigh that is 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.810
 doing type there I did not realize 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.580
 and if they do not want to plant that unique 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.139
 pump and your team is already 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.840
 winning there now the only thing they would have 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:36.669
 what to do is defend the advantage and 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.169
 end up as good game winners 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:40.469
 guys that's all I hope you have 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:44.939
 liked the video very much if you liked it 

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:44.939
 until the next goodbye
