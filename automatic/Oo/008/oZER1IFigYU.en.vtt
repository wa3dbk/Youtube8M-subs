believe this is a DVD burner right with
label<00:05:26.740> clock<00:05:26.889> and<00:05:27.849> now<00:05:28.570> we<00:05:28.630> have<00:05:28.960> hard<00:05:29.770> years

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
label clock and now we have hard years

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.269 
label clock and now we have hard years
so<00:05:33.029> that<00:05:33.239> would<00:05:33.359> be<00:05:33.479> six<00:05:34.019> in<00:05:34.199> total<00:05:34.349> USB<00:05:34.859> 2.0

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
so that would be six in total USB 2.0

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:41.499 
so that would be six in total USB 2.0
