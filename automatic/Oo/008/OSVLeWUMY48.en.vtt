00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.630
 but notice that for spontaneous 

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:09.920
 striker who call this 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:14.210
 in the Anglo-Saxon language is jimmy jump 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.340
 This is a professional wine and 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.150
 it comes from jaume throughout the nation 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.520
 Sabadell in Catalonia and marketing and 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.439
 puts resignation because it jumps maybe both 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.720
 in parts this is the contest of the 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.320
 Eurovision of last year and when 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.189
 daniel follows that I said 7 in the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.220
 Spanish contestant who is in that 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.170
 moment singing high settings nobody knows 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.430
 what to do with it he starts to imitate the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.660
 choreography come out some 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.940
 with security 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.370
 very professional but still as if nothing 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.470
 they let us go out again 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.190
 repeating his song just in case it 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.060
 we will do in 2004 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.390
 [Applause] 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.059
 and also dangers usually always 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.160
 claim the independence of Catalonia 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.470
 this is a Barcelona fan who 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.000
 always take out what is called barretina 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.880
 it's your hat that brings this 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.070
 It's a little hat that puts all the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.860
 world and you want to place it from now 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.979
 be soccer players here to federer 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.979
 that gives a jump this pretty 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:36.200
 this is not the past then I what 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.380
 I do not know is how he does it to follow 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.380
 going in there is this is very good 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.470
 and what I wanted was this good then 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.330
 put the flag of Barcelona to the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.930
 opponents of mete goal with his 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.580
 body what it does is goal medel 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.580
 during the week 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.180
 they almost always look good on the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.790
 people because the funny people were passing 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.569
 three times of his life in jail this 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.569
 it stops him 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.580
 so it's one of the most sounded the year 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.920
 last in the final on 11 July 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.680
 South Africa when Spain was against 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.569
 holland went to put the barretina 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.569
 is at the world cup 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.460
 they have but makes you look ridiculous 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.360
 also the security many times 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.459
 the vast majority of cases 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.459
 [Music] 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.090
 but it runs runs and although 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.220
 there are a lot of security people this 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.000
 it does not achieve all possible sports 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.940
 rugby basketball has also been to 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.940
 been this is the one before shaving 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.689
 [Music] 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.930
 also a water polo match 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.950
 frequent is not true 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:31.470
 but what is in the delivery of the 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.480
 goya let's go into the hallway when 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.880
 they were giving the winner as best 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.880
 actor then unemployment 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.550
 [Music] 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.550
 last year when ghana by biutiful 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.570
 with her 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.900
 [Applause] 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.430
 [Music] 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.710
 [Applause] 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.760
 [Music] 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.760
 I dedicate it to all players 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.819
 today they are counting half more because 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.129
 you were 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.230
 to all as a moment a bit of 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.199
 tension that you do not know to gas in Spain 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.150
 that is a country from with enough 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:23.330
 terrorist issue you will always have 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.250
 the doubt of whether he comes in good plan or is going to 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.410
 ally the pretty front of always there 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.090
 is this moment of uncertainty and 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.250
 detention but when then you see that 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.800
 is line or by all who do not have the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.580
 web page of course they give us 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.930
 it's funny 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.699
 obviously does not mean that it's okay 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.289
 it does not mean that it's okay but good in 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:45.210
 this case as they are known 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.210
 globally good 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.020
 curious how they let this happen and how 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.480
 continues to access spaces 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.720
 public but with a wig and with all that 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.720
 kind
