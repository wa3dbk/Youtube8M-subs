just over seven hours or so at full
charge<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.770> expecting<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.700> be

charge and I was expecting that to be
around<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.180> generous<00:02:18.810> estimation<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.650> they

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
around a generous estimation as they

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.220 
around a generous estimation as they
often<00:02:20.160> are<00:02:20.520> but<00:02:21.150> I'll<00:02:21.240> be<00:02:21.390> damned<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.960> didn't

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
often are but I'll be damned if I didn't

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.690 
often are but I'll be damned if I didn't
get<00:02:22.350> at<00:02:22.500> least<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:22.980> much<00:02:23.100> out<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.550> I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
get at least that much out of it I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.190 
get at least that much out of it I
reckon<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.300> kept<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.600> screen<00:02:24.870> at<00:02:25.020> low

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
reckon if you kept the screen at low

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.780 
reckon if you kept the screen at low

the<00:02:32.430> best<00:02:32.730> keyboard<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.510> have<00:02:33.660> ever<00:02:33.960> used<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.560> a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the best keyboard I have ever used on a

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.770 
the best keyboard I have ever used on a
computer<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.100> size<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:36.060> key<00:02:36.240> caps<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
computer this size the key caps and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.570 
computer this size the key caps and
pitch<00:02:36.960> are<00:02:37.170> only<00:02:37.380> slightly<00:02:37.860> short<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.430> being

pitch are only slightly short of being

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.610 
pitch are only slightly short of being
full-sized<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.390> they<00:02:39.570> feel<00:02:39.870> great<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.410> type

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
full-sized and they feel great to type

full-sized and they feel great to type
on<00:02:40.800> frankly<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.850> was<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.060> surprise<00:02:42.480> because

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
on frankly it was a surprise because

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.990 
on frankly it was a surprise because
I've<00:02:42.990> got<00:02:43.170> big<00:02:43.470> old<00:02:43.680> man<00:02:43.920> hands<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:44.820> get

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
I've got big old man hands and I can get

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.180 
I've got big old man hands and I can get
rather<00:02:45.180> clumsy<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:45.960> most<00:02:46.230> netbook<00:02:46.620> keyboards

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
rather clumsy on most netbook keyboards

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.390 
rather clumsy on most netbook keyboards
but<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:47.970> one<00:02:48.180> barely<00:02:48.510> slowed<00:02:48.870> me<00:02:49.020> down<00:02:49.400> what

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
but this one barely slowed me down what

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.550 
but this one barely slowed me down what
I<00:02:50.430> didn't<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.120> however<00:02:51.540> was<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.230> touchpad

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
I didn't like however was the touchpad

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.960 
I didn't like however was the touchpad
it's<00:02:53.220> too<00:02:53.430> small

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
it's too small

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.540 
it's too small
it<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.270> absolutely<00:02:55.080> flush<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.070> case<00:02:56.310> you

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
it is absolutely flush with the case you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.490 
it is absolutely flush with the case you
can't<00:02:56.790> find<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.630> edge<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.960> can't<00:02:58.170> feel<00:02:58.470> it

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
can't find the edge you can't feel it

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.830 
can't find the edge you can't feel it
which<00:02:59.160> means<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.730> was<00:02:59.970> often<00:03:00.150> swiping<00:03:00.720> my

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
which means I was often swiping my

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.390 
which means I was often swiping my
finger<00:03:00.870> right<00:03:01.440> off<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.770> end<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.160> thing

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
finger right off the end of the thing

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.640 
finger right off the end of the thing
without<00:03:02.580> even<00:03:02.970> knowing<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.390> basically<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.080> had

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
without even knowing it basically I had

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.500 
without even knowing it basically I had
to<00:03:04.770> keep<00:03:04.920> looking<00:03:05.430> down<00:03:05.670> at<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.060> thing<00:03:06.270> to

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
to keep looking down at the thing to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.750 
to keep looking down at the thing to
make<00:03:06.660> sure<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.900> was<00:03:07.140> still<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.460> do

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
make sure I was still on it you do

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.120 
make sure I was still on it you do
gradually<00:03:09.390> adjust<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.080> get<00:03:10.200> used<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.560> kind

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
gradually adjust and get used to it kind

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.970 
gradually adjust and get used to it kind
of<00:03:11.490> but<00:03:11.940> it's<00:03:12.210> still<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.570> piece<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.320> crappy<00:03:13.770> user

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
of but it's still a piece of crappy user
