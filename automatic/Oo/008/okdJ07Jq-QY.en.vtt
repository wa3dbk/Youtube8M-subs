when<00:01:48.180> Pharaohs<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.780> over<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.350> need<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.310> actually

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
when Pharaohs is over I need to actually

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
when Pharaohs is over I need to actually
like<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.899> wait<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.439> an<00:01:52.500> enemy<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
like to see if wait for an enemy to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.910 
like to see if wait for an enemy to
spawn<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.450> tell<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.020> over<00:01:55.799> or

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
spawn then I can tell if it's over or

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.499 
spawn then I can tell if it's over or
not<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> don't<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.090> how<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> feel<00:01:57.450> about

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
not so I don't know how I feel about

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.490 
not so I don't know how I feel about
that<00:01:58.159> next<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.700> tank<00:02:00.119> spawns<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> flare

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that next the tank spawns with a flare

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.039 
that next the tank spawns with a flare
so<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.130> play<00:02:02.430> tank<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.969> lot<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.479> start<00:02:03.899> with

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
so if you play tank a lot you start with

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.770 
so if you play tank a lot you start with
a<00:02:04.079> flare<00:02:04.469> every<00:02:05.250> single<00:02:05.610> game<00:02:05.759> though<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
a flare every single game though you

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.719 
a flare every single game though you
start<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.649> you'll<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> flare<00:02:08.399> which

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
start in and you'll have a flare which

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.360 
start in and you'll have a flare which
is<00:02:08.910> actually<00:02:09.300> kind<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.720> cool<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.289> don't<00:02:11.009> see<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
is actually kind of cool I don't see the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.820 
is actually kind of cool I don't see the
purpose<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.300> really<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.470> mass

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
purpose and that really but with mass

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
purpose and that really but with mass
scavenger<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:14.910> grant<00:02:15.210> player<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.840> it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
scavenger it's a up grant player so it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.540 
scavenger it's a up grant player so it
will<00:02:16.290> be<00:02:16.410> lasting<00:02:16.890> longer<00:02:18.500> next<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.070> prone

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
will be lasting longer next the prone

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.200 
will be lasting longer next the prone
challenge<00:02:21.560> now<00:02:22.560> gets<00:02:23.160> affected<00:02:23.760> by<00:02:23.910> traps

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
challenge now gets affected by traps

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.390 
challenge now gets affected by traps
again<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.500> were<00:02:25.680> one<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:25.920> those<00:02:26.100> solo

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
again so if you were one of those solo

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.450 
again so if you were one of those solo
players<00:02:26.790> who<00:02:27.090> had<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.290> quit<00:02:28.800> games<00:02:29.160> now

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
players who had to quit games now

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.910 
players who had to quit games now
because<00:02:30.120> every<00:02:31.020> single<00:02:31.170> time<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.620> see<00:02:31.770> that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
because every single time you see that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.500 
because every single time you see that
prone<00:02:32.130> challenge<00:02:32.520> you're<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:33.060> can't<00:02:33.300> do

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
prone challenge you're like I can't do

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.110 
prone challenge you're like I can't do
this<00:02:33.750> because<00:02:34.260> how<00:02:35.190> we<00:02:35.250> used<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:35.970> was

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
this because how we used to do it was

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.390 
this because how we used to do it was
that<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.360> put<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.570> sentry<00:02:37.020> gun<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.740> an<00:02:38.010> electric

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
that you put a sentry gun on an electric

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.370 
that you put a sentry gun on an electric
trap<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.120> you'll<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:39.840> activate<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
trap and you'll just activate the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.710 
trap and you'll just activate the
electric<00:02:40.740> trap<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.160> go<00:02:41.340> prone<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.000> then<00:02:42.150> you

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
electric trap and go prone and then you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.000 
electric trap and go prone and then you
would<00:02:42.840> only<00:02:42.990> stand<00:02:43.320> up<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.680> go<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:43.920> your

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
would only stand up to go on your

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.350 
would only stand up to go on your
grenade<00:02:44.340> turret<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.670> guard<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:44.970> drill<00:02:45.210> and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
grenade turret to guard the drill and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.880 
grenade turret to guard the drill and
you<00:02:45.450> would<00:02:45.630> let<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> trap<00:02:46.200> kill<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.680> kills

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
you would let the trap kill the kills

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.310 
you would let the trap kill the kills
for<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.540> actually<00:02:48.840> makes<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.170> really

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
for you so that actually makes it really

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.340 
for you so that actually makes it really
easy

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
easy

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.250 
easy
next<00:02:52.350> they<00:02:52.740> also<00:02:53.040> patched<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.240> bunch<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.990> bugs

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
next they also patched a bunch of bugs

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.120 
next they also patched a bunch of bugs
in<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> game<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.850> like<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.500> bug<00:02:58.740> where<00:02:59.040> if

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
in the game so like the the bug where if

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.180 
in the game so like the the bug where if
you<00:02:59.250> stand<00:02:59.550> by<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.730> door<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.620> awakening<00:03:01.620> and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
you stand by the door in awakening and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.130 
you stand by the door in awakening and
how<00:03:02.730> all<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.000> enemies<00:03:03.450> will<00:03:03.600> spawn<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.840> other

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
how all the enemies will spawn the other

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.350 
how all the enemies will spawn the other
side<00:03:04.380> they<00:03:04.620> patched<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.190> they<00:03:05.760> also<00:03:05.940> passed

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
side they patched that they also passed

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.600 
side they patched that they also passed
the<00:03:06.570> gas<00:03:06.780> ex-boy<00:03:07.350> on<00:03:07.560> May<00:03:07.740> Day<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> drill

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the gas ex-boy on May Day and the drill

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.970 
the gas ex-boy on May Day and the drill
exploit<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.240> made<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:10.220> they<00:03:11.220> also<00:03:12.830> improved<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
exploit I made a they also improved the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.530 
exploit I made a they also improved the
logic<00:03:14.580> for<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> Vanguard<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.690> awakening<00:03:16.530> and

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
logic for the Vanguard in awakening and

Exodus so that used to be an impossible

run<00:03:30.360> which<00:03:30.989> was<00:03:31.200> kind<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.620> frustrating<00:03:32.100> it

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
run which was kind of frustrating it

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.880 
run which was kind of frustrating it
could've<00:03:32.519> make<00:03:32.940> or<00:03:33.300> break<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.959> run<00:03:34.170> sometimes

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
could've make or break the run sometimes

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.390 
could've make or break the run sometimes
and<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.760> one<00:03:36.450> fail<00:03:36.720> challenge<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.380> worth<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:38.010> lot

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
and a one fail challenge is worth a lot

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
and a one fail challenge is worth a lot
of<00:03:38.610> score<00:03:39.120> trust<00:03:40.050> me<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:41.610> fact<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.030> they

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
of score trust me so the fact that they

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.680 
of score trust me so the fact that they
prevented<00:03:43.050> this<00:03:43.200> that's<00:03:43.560> pretty<00:03:44.040> good

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
prevented this that's pretty good
