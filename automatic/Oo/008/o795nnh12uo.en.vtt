00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
perfect solution when you grow in soil

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.490 
perfect solution when you grow in soil
you<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.299> think<00:01:27.630> about<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:27.990> much<00:01:28.110> just

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you don't think about it very much just

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.580 
you don't think about it very much just
add<00:01:28.650> water<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.280> maybe<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.880> little<00:01:30.000> bit<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
add water and maybe a little bit of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.980 
add water and maybe a little bit of
nitrogen<00:01:31.590> or<00:01:31.740> something<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.250> that

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
nitrogen or something like that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.010 
nitrogen or something like that
basically<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.380> has<00:01:34.799> its<00:01:35.640> pH<00:01:36.090> adjusted<00:01:36.720> water

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
basically just has its pH adjusted water

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440 
basically just has its pH adjusted water
with<00:01:37.680> fertilizer<00:01:38.159> added<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.790> needed<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
with fertilizer added as needed and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.510 
with fertilizer added as needed and
we're<00:01:39.720> splashing<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.619> into<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> tank<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.430> get

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
we're splashing it into the tank to get

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
we're splashing it into the tank to get
some<00:01:41.729> oxygen<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> water<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.649> our

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
some oxygen in the water so that our

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.710 
some oxygen in the water so that our
roots<00:01:44.070> still<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.850> oxygen<00:01:45.329> even<00:01:45.540> though

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
roots still get oxygen even though

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.719 
roots still get oxygen even though
they're<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.049> soil<00:01:46.439> we're<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:47.549> just

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
they're not in soil we're here we just

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.819 
they're not in soil we're here we just
start<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.090> water<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:49.470> put<00:01:49.680> everything

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
start with water and we put everything

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.710 
start with water and we put everything
we<00:01:50.100> need<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> water<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.149> make<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> plants

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
we need in the water to make the plants

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.260 
we need in the water to make the plants
grow<00:01:51.780> correctly<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:53.399> kind<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.119> at<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
grow correctly it's kind of going at it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.580 
grow correctly it's kind of going at it
backwards<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> way<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.100> seems<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.549> work

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.529 

outside<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.829> just<00:02:00.009> grow<00:02:00.219> one<00:02:00.820> crop<00:02:01.149> for<00:02:01.420> one

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
outside you just grow one crop for one

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.300

season here we're always turning over
every<00:02:03.670> half<00:02:04.329> week<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:04.869> plant<00:02:05.170> seeds<00:02:05.409> every

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
every half week we plant seeds every

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.319 
every half week we plant seeds every
half<00:02:05.979> week<00:02:06.250> we<00:02:06.430> harvest<00:02:06.850> therefore<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.210> have

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
half week we harvest therefore we have

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.930 
half week we harvest therefore we have
continuous<00:02:07.869> rotation<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.399> challenge<00:02:09.759> to

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
continuous rotation it's a challenge to

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.070 
continuous rotation it's a challenge to
grow<00:02:10.179> crops<00:02:10.840> here<00:02:11.290> around<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:13.630> greenhouse

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
grow crops here around the greenhouse

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.770 
grow crops here around the greenhouse
buildings<00:02:14.500> design<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.280> key<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:16.030> creating<00:02:16.209> this

have a main controller computer we just

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.910 
have a main controller computer we just
do<00:02:52.660> all<00:02:52.690> our<00:02:52.959> settings<00:02:53.230> which<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.650> quite<00:02:53.890> a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
on it so that when we harvest it we also

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.360 
on it so that when we harvest it we also
