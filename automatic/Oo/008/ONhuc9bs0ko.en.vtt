00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
through it just to get rid of any stalks

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.250 
through it just to get rid of any stalks
and<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:36.450> we've<00:00:36.540> given<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.899> good<00:00:37.020> wash<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
and then we've given it a good wash and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.840 
and then we've given it a good wash and
are<00:00:37.500> dry<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.160> now<00:00:38.250> we're<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> top

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
are dry and now we're just going to top

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.770 
are dry and now we're just going to top
for<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:40.850> just<00:00:41.850> want<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> really<00:00:42.300> nice<00:00:42.450> sharp

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
for it just want a really nice sharp

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.510 
for it just want a really nice sharp
knife<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.160> careful<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.460> your

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
knife and just be careful of your

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.970 
knife and just be careful of your
fingers<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:48.200> we<00:00:49.200> want<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.590> fine<00:00:49.800> as

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
fingers so we want it as fine as

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.430 
fingers so we want it as fine as
possible<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.930> don't<00:00:52.170> end<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.379> with

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
possible so that you don't end up with

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.310 
possible so that you don't end up with
really<00:00:52.770> big<00:00:52.890> pieces<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.250> parsley<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> think

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
really big pieces of parsley so I think

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.950 
really big pieces of parsley so I think
we're<00:01:01.500> almost<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:02.359> it's<00:01:03.359> nice<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> fine

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
we're almost there it's nice and fine

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.520 
we're almost there it's nice and fine
but<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.320> too<00:01:04.589> dusty<00:01:06.080> will<00:01:07.080> pop<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.439> in

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
but it's not too dusty will pop that in

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.779 
but it's not too dusty will pop that in
the<00:01:07.590> bowl

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:13.219 

it's<00:01:12.210> gonna<00:01:12.329> put<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.509> bit<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.719> good<00:01:12.840> virgin

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it's gonna put a bit of good virgin

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.969 
it's gonna put a bit of good virgin
olive<00:01:13.320> oil<00:01:13.590> over<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:16.649> dash<00:01:16.829> of

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
olive oil over it and a little dash of

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.450 
olive oil over it and a little dash of
red<00:01:17.130> wine<00:01:17.310> vinegar

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.520 

so<00:01:22.000> what<00:01:22.150> we<00:01:22.240> did<00:01:22.360> earlier<00:01:22.450> took<00:01:23.080> our<00:01:23.260> dried

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
so what we did earlier took our dried

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.740 
so what we did earlier took our dried
cheer<00:01:23.770> batter<00:01:23.980> life<00:01:24.220> took<00:01:24.850> off<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.150> crust<00:01:25.420> I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
cheer batter life took off the crust I

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.330 
cheer batter life took off the crust I
just<00:01:26.260> soaked<00:01:26.500> it<00:01:26.620> in<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.770> little<00:01:27.010> bit<00:01:27.070> of<00:01:27.130> water

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
just soaked it in a little bit of water

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.480 
just soaked it in a little bit of water
just<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.150> kind<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.390> soften<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.840> up<00:01:29.370> so<00:01:30.370> if<00:01:30.460> you

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
just to kind of soften it up so if you

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.530 
just to kind of soften it up so if you
squeeze<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.090> excess<00:01:31.420> juice<00:01:31.630> out<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.390> the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
squeeze the excess juice out and the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.760 
squeeze the excess juice out and the
reason<00:01:34.690> for<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:35.080> going<00:01:35.320> in<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.530> sauce<00:01:35.740> it

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
reason for this going in the sauce it

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.350 
reason for this going in the sauce it
adds<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.190> certain<00:01:36.220> amount<00:01:36.610> of<00:01:36.729> body<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.150> depth

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
adds a certain amount of body and depth

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.150 
adds a certain amount of body and depth
without<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.410> can<00:01:38.560> be<00:01:38.680> a<00:01:38.710> bit<00:01:38.890> sort<00:01:39.100> of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
without it it can be a bit sort of

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.740 
without it it can be a bit sort of
watery<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:40.210> bit<00:01:40.330> loose<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:43.330> may<00:01:43.479> seem<00:01:43.690> a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
watery and a bit loose it may seem a

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.750 
watery and a bit loose it may seem a
little<00:01:43.780> bit<00:01:43.960> odd<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.170> put<00:01:44.470> bread<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.520> sauce

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
little bit odd to put bread in a sauce

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.060 
little bit odd to put bread in a sauce
but<00:01:45.790> once<00:01:46.720> it's<00:01:46.930> in<00:01:47.050> there<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:47.380> disappears<00:01:47.890> and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
but once it's in there it disappears and

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.140 
but once it's in there it disappears and
you<00:01:48.130> can't<00:01:48.369> really<00:01:48.520> taste<00:01:48.790> it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
you can't really taste it

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.630 
you can't really taste it
but<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.630> does<00:01:49.780> give<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.020> really<00:01:50.380> good<00:01:50.560> amount<00:01:51.490> of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
but it does give a really good amount of

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.690 
but it does give a really good amount of
volume<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.090> depth<00:01:52.330> to<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:56.160> next<00:01:57.160> to

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
volume and depth to it next to

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.080 
volume and depth to it next to
hard-boiled<00:01:58.240> eggs<00:01:59.100> remove<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.250> white

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.609 

and<00:02:05.600> we've<00:02:05.720> just<00:02:05.750> been<00:02:05.869> left<00:02:06.170> with<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.380> yolks

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
and we've just been left with the yolks

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.210 
and we've just been left with the yolks
so<00:02:07.280> they're<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.520> going<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.759> get<00:02:07.909> chopped

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
so they're just going to get chopped

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.720 
so they're just going to get chopped
nice<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.459> roughly<00:02:15.220> they<00:02:16.220> get<00:02:16.370> added<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.700> the
