starting<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.990> build<00:03:02.200> up<00:03:02.470> some<00:03:02.680> layers

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.600 

you

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.690 

got<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.790> face<00:03:19.270> fairly<00:03:19.780> well<00:03:19.990> blocked<00:03:20.980> in<00:03:21.310> and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
got the face fairly well blocked in and

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.660 
got the face fairly well blocked in and
I'm<00:03:22.150> starting<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.600> work<00:03:22.810> my<00:03:22.840> way<00:03:23.170> around

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
I'm starting to work my way around

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.270 
I'm starting to work my way around
putting<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.850> my<00:03:25.750> interpretation<00:03:26.050> of<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:27.040> hair

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
putting in my interpretation of the hair

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.480 
putting in my interpretation of the hair
and<00:03:28.230> starting<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.290> work<00:03:29.350> on<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.800> body<00:03:29.980> area

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
and starting to work on the body area

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.360 
and starting to work on the body area
got<00:03:31.210> a<00:03:31.270> little<00:03:31.480> cutoff<00:03:31.690> here<00:03:32.110> on<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.440> on<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
got a little cutoff here on the on the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.340 
got a little cutoff here on the on the
video<00:03:33.640> camera<00:03:33.940> but<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.630> get<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.200> general

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
video camera but you get the general

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.110 
video camera but you get the general
idea<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:37.740> putting<00:03:38.740> out<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.890> lot<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.190> paint<00:03:39.550> paint

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
idea of putting out a lot of paint paint

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.020 
idea of putting out a lot of paint paint
blocking<00:03:40.600> in<00:03:40.810> some<00:03:41.020> areas<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.710> then<00:03:42.610> working

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
blocking in some areas and then working

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.380 
blocking in some areas and then working
towards<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.740> end<00:03:44.980> which<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.610> refining<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
towards the end which is refining the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.720 
towards the end which is refining the
shapes<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:47.010> pretty<00:03:48.010> much<00:03:48.190> taking<00:03:48.550> some

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
shapes and pretty much taking some

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.699 
shapes and pretty much taking some
liberties<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.330> decide<00:03:49.750> how<00:03:50.080> do<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.260> want<00:03:50.560> this

liberties to decide how do I want this

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.800 
liberties to decide how do I want this
painting<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.280> go<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:52.560> looking<00:03:53.560> at<00:03:53.740> color

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
combinations this is a little bit

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.710 
combinations this is a little bit
different<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.730> way<00:03:57.880> this<00:03:58.060> whole<00:03:58.239> painting<00:03:58.540> is

black with a heavy shadow area and then

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:53.769 
black with a heavy shadow area and then
I'll<00:04:51.929> come<00:04:52.229> back<00:04:52.499> over<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:53.069> once<00:04:53.249> that's<00:04:53.429> dry

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:53.779 
I'll come back over it once that's dry

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.329 
I'll come back over it once that's dry
with<00:04:54.779> the<00:04:55.080> combination<00:04:55.649> of<00:04:55.769> some<00:04:56.009> warmer

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:56.339 
with the combination of some warmer

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
but now it's a lot of studying be the

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.699 
but now it's a lot of studying be the
source<00:05:06.119> photo<00:05:06.599> and<00:05:07.079> looking<00:05:07.949> for<00:05:08.219> real<00:05:08.789> slight

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
nuances in the gray areas and trying to

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:23.090 
nuances in the gray areas and trying to
get<00:05:14.879> a<00:05:14.909> nice<00:05:15.679> develop<00:05:16.679> piece<00:05:17.339> for<00:05:17.699> the<00:05:17.789> face

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.130 

initially<00:05:24.100> I<00:05:24.130> had<00:05:24.460> started<00:05:25.450> to<00:05:25.480> go<00:05:25.750> with<00:05:25.930> just

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
initially I had started to go with just

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.040 
initially I had started to go with just
a<00:05:26.260> straight<00:05:26.680> black<00:05:27.040> background<00:05:27.730> but<00:05:28.030> as<00:05:28.900> the

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
a straight black background but as the

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.350 
a straight black background but as the
painting<00:05:29.350> progressed<00:05:29.740> I<00:05:29.950> decided<00:05:30.370> I<00:05:30.790> might

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
painting progressed I decided I might

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.290 
painting progressed I decided I might
want<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.810> add<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.050> little<00:05:32.320> bit<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.620> color<00:05:32.860> so<00:05:33.850> I

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
want to add a little bit of color so I

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.660 
want to add a little bit of color so I
picked<00:05:34.960> up<00:05:35.140> some<00:05:35.320> red<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.890> little<00:05:36.100> bit<00:05:36.370> of<00:05:36.460> water

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
picked up some red a little bit of water

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.580 
picked up some red a little bit of water
and<00:05:38.700> added<00:05:39.700> some<00:05:39.880> pink<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:40.270> yellow<00:05:40.530> wanted<00:05:41.530> to

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
and added some pink and yellow wanted to

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.200 
and added some pink and yellow wanted to
see<00:05:41.770> how<00:05:41.890> that<00:05:42.130> was<00:05:42.310> going<00:05:42.580> to<00:05:42.640> work<00:05:42.850> to<00:05:43.060> help

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
see how that was going to work to help

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.770 
see how that was going to work to help
support<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.840> painting<00:05:44.170> and<00:05:44.760> in<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:46.150> end<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.570> I

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
support the painting and in the end I I

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.150 
support the painting and in the end I I
kept<00:05:47.410> the<00:05:47.830> red<00:05:48.160> in<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.670> background<00:05:49.240> so<00:05:50.200> again

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
kept the red in the background so again

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.740 
kept the red in the background so again
artists<00:05:51.520> choice<00:05:51.760> decide<00:05:52.270> what<00:05:52.450> you<00:05:52.540> want<00:05:52.690> to

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
do moving towards the finish line and

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.990 
do moving towards the finish line and
hopefully<00:05:56.020> I<00:05:56.710> can<00:05:57.220> always<00:05:57.460> paint<00:05:57.640> over<00:05:57.850> it<00:05:57.940> if

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
hopefully I can always paint over it if

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.290 
hopefully I can always paint over it if
I<00:05:58.090> didn't<00:05:58.300> like<00:05:58.420> it

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300
