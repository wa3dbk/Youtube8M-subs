like that so there is another like kind

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.000 
like that so there is another like kind
of<00:04:42.690> subtle<00:04:42.990> way<00:04:43.080> of<00:04:43.110> flirting<00:04:43.380> which<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.830> think

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
of subtle way of flirting which I think

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.680 
of subtle way of flirting which I think
exists<00:04:44.310> in<00:04:44.430> North<00:04:44.490> America<00:04:44.880> as<00:04:44.940> well<00:04:45.090> okay<00:04:45.540> and

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
exists in North America as well okay and

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.000 
exists in North America as well okay and
that's<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.900> cost<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.230> of<00:04:46.320> like<00:04:46.470> taking<00:04:46.800> care

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
that's the cost of of like taking care

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.710 
that's the cost of of like taking care
of<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.160> person<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:47.760> for<00:04:47.880> example<00:04:48.300> if<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.600> have

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
of the person so for example if you have

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.120 
of the person so for example if you have
class<00:04:48.900> with<00:04:48.930> somebody<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.740> you're<00:04:49.830> going<00:04:50.040> out
