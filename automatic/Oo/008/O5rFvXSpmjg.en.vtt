simply adjust the amount it's hard for
me<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.899> tell<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.470> zoomed<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.189> far<00:01:56.460> so

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
me to tell when I'm zoomed in so far so

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
me to tell when I'm zoomed in so far so
I'm<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> click<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.630> fill<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.649> zoom<00:01:58.890> out

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
I'm going to click on fill to zoom out

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.459 
I'm going to click on fill to zoom out
and<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.090> looking<00:02:00.240> pretty<00:02:00.719> good<00:02:01.049> I'm

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and I think it's looking pretty good I'm

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
and I think it's looking pretty good I'm
going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.740> zoom<00:02:01.920> back<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.939> show<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
going to zoom back in to show you that

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.469 
going to zoom back in to show you that
if<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.320> need<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.920> add<00:02:05.070> more<00:02:05.100> light<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:06.000> plus

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
if you need to add more light if plus

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.199 
if you need to add more light if plus
for<00:02:06.780> an<00:02:06.990> exposure<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:07.950> enough<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.640> you

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
for an exposure is not enough if you

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.020 
for an exposure is not enough if you
have<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> dark<00:02:09.840> eye<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.920> one<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.819> can

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
have a dark eye like this one you can

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.180 
have a dark eye like this one you can
also<00:02:12.300> use<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.110> shadow<00:02:13.349> slot

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
also use the shadow slot

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.400 
also use the shadow slot
so<00:02:14.520> as<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.820> add<00:02:15.030> light<00:02:15.480> into<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.990> shadows

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so as we add light into the shadows

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.260 
so as we add light into the shadows
where<00:02:16.620> we've<00:02:16.800> painted<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.460> see<00:02:17.880> how

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
where we've painted you can see how

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.540 
where we've painted you can see how
bright<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.960> can<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.590> catch<00:02:19.830> light<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.340> my

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
bright I can get that catch light in my

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.990 
bright I can get that catch light in my
eye

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
adjustments I can then dial back the top

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.400 
adjustments I can then dial back the top
adjustment<00:02:59.180> to<00:03:00.180> get<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> amount<00:03:01.110> that

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
adjustment to get just the amount that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.550 
adjustment to get just the amount that
I'm<00:03:01.560> looking<00:03:01.739> for<00:03:02.810> next<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.959> would<00:03:04.050> hold<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
I'm looking for next I would hold the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.920 
I'm looking for next I would hold the
spacebar<00:03:04.860> down<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.360> click<00:03:06.600> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
spacebar down so that I can click and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.280 
spacebar down so that I can click and
drag<00:03:07.260> over<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:08.400> my<00:03:08.730> other<00:03:08.970> eye<00:03:09.060> now<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.020> eyes

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
drag over to my other eye now the eyes

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.350 
drag over to my other eye now the eyes
are<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.950> different<00:03:11.310> brightnesses<00:03:11.880> starting

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
are of different brightnesses starting

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.960 
are of different brightnesses starting
out<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:12.900> very<00:03:13.080> well<00:03:13.530> might<00:03:13.770> want<00:03:14.220> different

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
out so I very well might want different

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.240 
out so I very well might want different
settings<00:03:15.720> for<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.080> catch<00:03:16.290> light<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:16.980> eye

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
settings for the catch light in this eye

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.190 
settings for the catch light in this eye
so<00:03:18.090> I'm<00:03:18.209> going<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.420> do<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.570> brand<00:03:18.930> new

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
so I'm going to do a brand new

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.979 
so I'm going to do a brand new
adjustment<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:20.070> I'll<00:03:20.700> start<00:03:21.060> again<00:03:21.239> with

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
adjustment and I'll start again with

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.170 
adjustment and I'll start again with
positive<00:03:22.530> exposure<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.370> negative

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
positive exposure and negative

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.199 
positive exposure and negative
saturation<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.170> I'll<00:03:25.890> click<00:03:26.160> with<00:03:27.030> my<00:03:27.180> mouse

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
saturation and I'll click with my mouse

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.470 
saturation and I'll click with my mouse
out<00:03:27.720> that's<00:03:28.560> not<00:03:28.739> enough<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.580> I'll<00:03:29.940> add<00:03:30.120> light

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
out that's not enough so I'll add light

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.740 
out that's not enough so I'll add light
into<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> shadows<00:03:31.489> maybe<00:03:32.489> zoom<00:03:32.970> out<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.630> can

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
into the shadows maybe zoom out so I can

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.570 
into the shadows maybe zoom out so I can
get<00:03:33.870> some<00:03:34.049> perspective<00:03:34.290> here<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:35.549> I

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
get some perspective here and then I

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.310 
get some perspective here and then I
continue<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.209> work<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.690> from<00:03:36.810> here<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.260> think

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
continue to work on it from here I think

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.470 
continue to work on it from here I think
they're<00:03:37.650> too<00:03:37.830> bright<00:03:38.010> at<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.549> point<00:03:38.850> now

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
they're too bright at this point now

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.560 
they're too bright at this point now
this<00:03:40.260> pin<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.709> active<00:03:41.160> it's<00:03:41.370> black<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.269> can

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
this pin is active it's black so I can

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.380 
this pin is active it's black so I can
simply<00:03:42.959> dial<00:03:43.320> back<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.650> exposure<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:45.239> get

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
simply dial back the exposure so to get
