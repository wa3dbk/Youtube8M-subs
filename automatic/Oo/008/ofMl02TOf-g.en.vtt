hey guys welcome today I'm going to show
you<00:00:18.560> how<00:00:18.800> to<00:00:18.860> paint

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
you how to paint

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.630 
you how to paint
basically<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.529> carbon<00:00:21.890> fiber<00:00:22.040> effect<00:00:22.430> make

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
basically the carbon fiber effect make

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.280 
basically the carbon fiber effect make
something<00:00:22.939> look<00:00:23.000> like<00:00:23.060> carbon<00:00:23.540> fiber<00:00:23.689> using

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
something look like carbon fiber using

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.880 
something look like carbon fiber using
spray<00:00:24.590> cans<00:00:26.050> so<00:00:27.050> we've<00:00:27.170> got<00:00:27.320> here<00:00:27.470> a<00:00:27.500> panel

without<00:01:02.900> it<00:01:03.339> but<00:01:04.339> this<00:01:04.400> is<00:01:04.610> just<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.939> simple

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
without it but this is just a simple

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.390 
without it but this is just a simple
like<00:01:06.170> if<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.680> were<00:01:06.829> doing<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.130> with<00:01:07.310> an

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
like if you were doing this with an

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.399 
like if you were doing this with an
airbrush<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.939> could<00:01:08.119> use<00:01:08.329> the<00:01:08.750> white<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:09.170> lot

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
airbrush you could use the white a lot

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.289 
airbrush you could use the white a lot
more<00:01:09.619> effectively<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:10.790> just<00:01:10.939> a<00:01:11.060> simple

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
more effectively this is just a simple

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.190 
more effectively this is just a simple
version<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.229> carbon<00:01:12.530> fiber<00:01:12.740> effect<00:01:14.200> so

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
version of the carbon fiber effect so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.569 
version of the carbon fiber effect so
that<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:15.439> can<00:01:15.590> do<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.829> with<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.220> couple<00:01:16.340> of

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
that you can do it with just a couple of

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.560 
that you can do it with just a couple of
colors<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.030> spray<00:01:17.420> cans<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:19.310> what<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.330> want

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
colors and spray cans so what you want

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.180 
colors and spray cans so what you want
to<00:01:20.630> do<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:23.900> mention<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.320> shelf<00:01:24.530> liner<00:01:24.740> you

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
to do that I mention the shelf liner you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.850 
to do that I mention the shelf liner you
need<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.400> shelf<00:01:25.640> liner<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.810> tool<00:01:27.590> box

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
need the shelf liner this is tool box

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.520 
need the shelf liner this is tool box
shelf<00:01:28.159> liner<00:01:29.470> see<00:01:30.470> how<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:30.830> looks<00:01:31.040> it's<00:01:32.530> it's

also shelf liner for kitchens and stuff

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.210 
also shelf liner for kitchens and stuff
it's<00:01:35.720> designed<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.590> keep<00:01:36.650> things<00:01:37.070> from

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
it's designed to keep things from

it's designed to keep things from
slipping<00:01:37.580> around<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:39.229> it's<00:01:39.350> just<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.590> rubbery

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
slipping around so it's just a rubbery

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.430 
slipping around so it's just a rubbery
substance<00:01:40.130> with<00:01:40.520> some<00:01:40.670> holes<00:01:40.850> in<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:42.320> what

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
substance with some holes in it so what

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.510 
substance with some holes in it so what
you<00:01:42.530> do<00:01:42.710> is<00:01:43.670> lay<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.180> across<00:01:44.479> your<00:01:44.720> surface

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
you do is lay that across your surface

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.340 
you do is lay that across your surface
you<00:01:46.520> can<00:01:46.700> use<00:01:46.760> masking<00:01:47.390> tape<00:01:47.450> if<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:47.840> want<00:01:47.960> to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
you can use masking tape if you want to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.679 
you can use masking tape if you want to
kind<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.590> tack<00:01:48.799> it<00:01:48.950> down

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
kind of tack it down

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.069 
kind of tack it down
you<00:01:50.500> can<00:01:50.649> also<00:01:50.799> use<00:01:51.159> masks<00:01:51.750> let's<00:01:52.750> go<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:52.930> the

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
you can also use masks let's go to the

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.870 
you can also use masks let's go to the
bottom<00:01:53.350> here<00:01:53.500> you<00:01:53.740> can<00:01:53.979> also<00:01:54.189> use<00:01:54.460> masking

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
bottom here you can also use masking

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.870 
bottom here you can also use masking
tape<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.149> mark<00:01:55.899> where<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.350> was<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:57.369> if<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.610> want

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
tape to mark where it was so if you want

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.700 
tape to mark where it was so if you want
to<00:01:58.119> tuck<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.200> down<00:01:59.229> like<00:01:59.590> that<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:01.679> make<00:02:02.679> a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
to tuck it down like that and make a

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.310 
to tuck it down like that and make a
little<00:02:02.920> mark<00:02:03.220> on<00:02:03.399> each<00:02:03.579> piece<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:05.079> you<00:02:05.140> are

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
little mark on each piece if you are

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.430 
little mark on each piece if you are
using<00:02:05.770> another<00:02:06.100> color<00:02:06.340> after<00:02:07.050> for<00:02:08.050> example

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
using another color after for example

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.910 
using another color after for example
white<00:02:08.619> like<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:08.920> said<00:02:10.170> if<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.319> make<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:11.620> mark

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
white like I said if you make that mark

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.800 
white like I said if you make that mark
and<00:02:12.099> then<00:02:12.519> when<00:02:12.640> you're<00:02:12.760> finished<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.750> can

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
and then when you're finished you can

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.970 
and then when you're finished you can
cut<00:02:14.140> move<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.160> down<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.640> slightly<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.709> use

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
cut move it down just slightly and use

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.910 
cut move it down just slightly and use
that<00:02:18.130> mark<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.489> gauge<00:02:18.700> how<00:02:18.880> far<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.269> move<00:02:19.420> your

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
that mark to gauge how far you move your

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.710 
that mark to gauge how far you move your
self<00:02:20.920> liner<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.299> can<00:02:22.450> spray<00:02:22.690> your

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
self liner and then you can spray your

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.610 
self liner and then you can spray your
your<00:02:23.290> white<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:24.220> get<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:25.380> three<00:02:26.380> color

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
your white in to get a three color

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.870 
your white in to get a three color
carbon<00:02:27.040> fiber<00:02:27.250> effect<00:02:28.380> anyway<00:02:29.760> what<00:02:30.760> do<00:02:30.819> you

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
carbon fiber effect anyway what do you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.289 
carbon fiber effect anyway what do you
want<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.090> be<00:02:31.209> here<00:02:32.340> pretty<00:02:33.340> simple<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.120> just

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
want to be here pretty simple you just

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.800 
want to be here pretty simple you just
lay<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.569> stuff<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:35.310> fairly<00:02:36.310> light<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.849> like<00:02:37.690> to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
lay this stuff on fairly light I like to

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.979 
lay this stuff on fairly light I like to
do<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.110> at<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> 45<00:02:38.739> degree<00:02:38.860> angle<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.489> not<00:02:39.989> not

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
do it at a 45 degree angle and not not

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.250 
do it at a 45 degree angle and not not
really<00:02:41.290> go<00:02:41.620> for<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.950> thick<00:02:42.190> even<00:02:42.400> coat<00:02:42.790> on<00:02:42.940> this

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
really go for a thick even coat on this

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.180 
really go for a thick even coat on this
you're<00:02:44.260> trying<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.590> do<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.739> without<00:02:44.829> getting

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
you're trying to do it without getting

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.199 
you're trying to do it without getting
paint<00:02:45.340> all<00:02:45.459> over<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.760> other<00:02:45.880> side<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.150> my

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
paint all over the other side of my

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:54.380 
paint all over the other side of my
family<00:02:48.420> yeah<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:50.430> kind<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.489> that<00:02:51.610> angle

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.339 

it's<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.480> little<00:02:55.720> tough<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.900> see<00:02:56.140> what<00:02:56.260> you're

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
it's a little tough to see what you're

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.170 
it's a little tough to see what you're
doing<00:02:56.560> here<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.550> aware<00:02:57.640> of<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.200> do<00:02:59.200> using

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
doing here so be aware of that do using

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.430 
doing here so be aware of that do using
stronger<00:03:01.180> silver<00:03:01.659> this<00:03:01.840> stuff<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.170> kind<00:03:02.379> of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
stronger silver this stuff is kind of

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.199 
stronger silver this stuff is kind of
semi-transparent<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.819> makes<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.120> even

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
semi-transparent so that makes it even

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.289 
semi-transparent so that makes it even
more<00:03:04.360> challenging<00:03:04.510> you're<00:03:05.500> using<00:03:05.650> stronger

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
more challenging you're using stronger

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.970 
more challenging you're using stronger
pigmented<00:03:07.299> silver<00:03:07.659> it'll<00:03:08.620> be<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.769> little

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
pigmented silver it'll be a little

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.130 
pigmented silver it'll be a little
easier<00:03:09.099> for<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.519> see<00:03:09.840> like<00:03:10.840> you'll<00:03:10.989> get<00:03:11.080> a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
easier for you see like you'll get a

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:19.040 
easier for you see like you'll get a
different<00:03:11.319> effect<00:03:11.530> out<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:11.980> that

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.240 

so<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.350> can<00:03:19.440> see<00:03:19.560> I'm<00:03:19.650> not<00:03:19.740> putting<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.100> on

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
so you can see I'm not putting this on

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.190 
so you can see I'm not putting this on
dry<00:03:20.490> heaven<00:03:20.820> moving<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> can<00:03:21.990> very<00:03:22.230> quickly

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.910 

that's<00:03:26.740> about<00:03:26.950> all<00:03:27.100> I'm<00:03:27.220> looking<00:03:27.490> for<00:03:27.520> you

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
that's about all I'm looking for you

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.990 
that's about all I'm looking for you
kind<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:29.980> want<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.190> settle<00:03:30.430> carbon-fibre

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
kind of want to settle carbon-fibre

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.490 
kind of want to settle carbon-fibre
effect<00:03:31.270> you<00:03:31.360> see<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.540> lot<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.810> people<00:03:32.080> doing<00:03:32.290> a

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
effect you see a lot of people doing a

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.100 
effect you see a lot of people doing a
carbon-fibre<00:03:33.040> effect<00:03:33.520> and<00:03:33.819> then<00:03:34.720> having<00:03:34.930> to

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
carbon-fibre effect and then having to

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.130 
carbon-fibre effect and then having to
go<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:35.290> over<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.270> over<00:03:37.270> reduce<00:03:37.600> black<00:03:37.870> or

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
go back over and over reduce black or

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.559 
go back over and over reduce black or
missed<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.680> there<00:03:39.069> or<00:03:39.190> something<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:40.420> kind

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
missed it on there or something to kind

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.000 
missed it on there or something to kind
of<00:03:40.660> tow<00:03:40.840> them<00:03:40.959> back<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.290> effect<00:03:41.620> once<00:03:41.830> they're

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
of tow them back the effect once they're

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.949 
of tow them back the effect once they're
finished<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.610> don't<00:03:43.330> want<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.510> have<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.690> do<00:03:43.810> that

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
finished I don't want to have to do that

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.199 
finished I don't want to have to do that
I'm<00:03:44.200> lazy<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.770> I<00:03:45.130> don't<00:03:45.250> think<00:03:45.370> it's<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.790> I

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
I'm lazy and I don't think it's that I

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.570 
I'm lazy and I don't think it's that I
don't<00:03:46.480> think<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.750> provides<00:03:46.900> as<00:03:47.320> good<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:48.010> look

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
don't think it provides as good a look

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.490 
don't think it provides as good a look
when<00:03:48.790> I'll<00:03:48.910> set<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:49.330> done<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:50.110> order<00:03:50.380> to

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
when I'll set in done so in order to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.320 
when I'll set in done so in order to
avoid<00:03:50.770> that<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:51.190> just<00:03:51.700> put<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:51.970> on<00:03:52.030> there<00:03:52.209> nice

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
avoid that I just put it on there nice

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:00.160 
avoid that I just put it on there nice
and<00:03:52.570> light<00:03:53.670> now<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.700> pull<00:03:55.000> this<00:03:55.120> off

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.190 

toss<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.830> out<00:04:00.890> of<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.100> way<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.250> guess

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.040 

and<00:04:05.470> what<00:04:06.130> we're<00:04:06.310> left<00:04:06.459> with<00:04:06.670> here

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.190 

is<00:04:13.320> our<00:04:13.770> carbon-fiber<00:04:14.690> effect<00:04:15.690> which<00:04:16.050> I've

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
is our carbon-fiber effect which I've

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.690 
is our carbon-fiber effect which I've
said<00:04:16.410> probably<00:04:16.770> a<00:04:16.920> million<00:04:17.130> times<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.610> this

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
said probably a million times in this

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.160 
said probably a million times in this
video<00:04:17.970> already<00:04:18.360> there<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.380> go<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:20.520> is

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
video already there you go that is

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.450 
video already there you go that is
exactly<00:04:22.170> what<00:04:22.350> we're<00:04:22.590> going<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:22.860> that's<00:04:23.280> how

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
exactly what we're going for that's how

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.640 
exactly what we're going for that's how
you<00:04:24.680> meet<00:04:25.680> carbon-fiber<00:04:27.050> spray<00:04:28.050> fans<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:28.500> don't

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
you meet carbon-fiber spray fans I don't

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.260 
you meet carbon-fiber spray fans I don't
like<00:04:28.770> saying<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:29.190> because<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.970> kind<00:04:30.180> of

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
like saying that because it kind of

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.270 
like saying that because it kind of
makes<00:04:30.960> me<00:04:31.050> feel<00:04:31.290> like<00:04:31.440> I'm<00:04:31.590> telling<00:04:31.890> people<00:04:31.920> to

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
makes me feel like I'm telling people to

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.590 
makes me feel like I'm telling people to
take<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.460> piece<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.700> carbon<00:04:32.940> fiber<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.420> paint

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
take a piece of carbon fiber and paint

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.290 
take a piece of carbon fiber and paint
it<00:04:33.750> but<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.440> know<00:04:34.560> what<00:04:34.680> that's<00:04:35.250> how<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.520> make

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
it but you know what that's how you make

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.970 
it but you know what that's how you make
something<00:04:36.900> look<00:04:37.020> like<00:04:37.080> carbon<00:04:37.590> fiber<00:04:37.770> with

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
something look like carbon fiber with

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.770 
something look like carbon fiber with
spray<00:04:38.160> cans<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.850> can<00:04:38.880> also<00:04:39.150> do<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:39.600> in

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
spray cans you can also do this in

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.470 
spray cans you can also do this in
Reverse<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:41.190> can<00:04:41.670> start<00:04:41.880> with<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.030> silver

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
Reverse you can start with a silver

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.140 
Reverse you can start with a silver
surface<00:04:42.930> and<00:04:43.290> spray<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.040> block<00:04:44.220> on<00:04:44.460> but<00:04:44.970> I

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
surface and spray the block on but I

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.490 
surface and spray the block on but I
really<00:04:45.180> don't<00:04:45.540> recommend<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.170> don't<00:04:46.320> find

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
really don't recommend it I don't find

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.490 
really don't recommend it I don't find
that<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.770> works<00:04:46.920> nearly<00:04:47.100> as<00:04:47.280> good<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:48.630> start

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
that it works nearly as good so start

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.830 
that it works nearly as good so start
with<00:04:49.560> your<00:04:49.620> black<00:04:49.890> surface<00:04:50.540> and<00:04:51.540> then<00:04:51.660> put

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
with your black surface and then put

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.560 
with your black surface and then put
your<00:04:51.930> silver<00:04:52.290> on<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:53.000> if<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.120> can<00:04:54.240> find<00:04:54.420> a

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
your silver on and if you can find a

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.150 
your silver on and if you can find a
subtle<00:04:54.870> silver<00:04:55.620> then<00:04:55.800> you<00:04:55.890> don't<00:04:56.010> have<00:04:56.070> to

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
subtle silver then you don't have to

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.380 
subtle silver then you don't have to
worry<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:56.400> much<00:04:56.580> about<00:04:56.700> having<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.180> tone<00:04:57.360> it

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
worry so much about having to tone it

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.590 
worry so much about having to tone it
