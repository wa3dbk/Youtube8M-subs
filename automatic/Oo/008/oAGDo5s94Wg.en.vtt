00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.220 

since<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.220> player<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:03.030> in<00:00:03.240> his<00:00:03.480> third<00:00:03.780> season

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
since my player is in his third season

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.190 
since my player is in his third season
in<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.650> NBA<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.670> he<00:00:06.270> has<00:00:06.390> accomplished<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.170> lot

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
in the NBA and he has accomplished a lot

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.459 
in the NBA and he has accomplished a lot
I<00:00:07.830> just<00:00:08.639> figured<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.300> probably<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:10.110> all

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
I just figured that I probably have all

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.410 
I just figured that I probably have all
the<00:00:10.650> billboards<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.370> covers<00:00:12.000> by<00:00:12.240> now

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600 
cuz I'm not sure how about this one but
I<00:01:24.840> believe<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.200> got<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.560> when<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I believe I got it when I was on the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.810 
I believe I got it when I was on the
Suns<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.470> my<00:01:28.470> rookie<00:01:28.920> season<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> must<00:01:29.759> be

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
Suns in my rookie season so it must be

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
Suns in my rookie season so it must be
easy<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.750> believe<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.590> gotta<00:01:31.799> get<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
easy to get I believe you gotta get a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.420 
easy to get I believe you gotta get a
certain<00:01:32.579> amount<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.939> assists<00:01:33.890> I'm<00:01:34.890> guessing

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
certain amount of assists I'm guessing

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
certain amount of assists I'm guessing
because<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.790> had<00:01:35.939> something<00:01:36.150> cuz<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
because it had something cuz it's the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.359 
because it had something cuz it's the
name<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> magazine<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.740> time<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
name of the magazine in time so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.620 
name of the magazine in time so
apparently<00:01:38.880> has<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.299> something<00:01:39.509> with

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
apparently has to do something with

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.740 
apparently has to do something with
assists<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.259> probably<00:01:40.740> got<00:01:41.750> double-digit

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
the first screen is glitch for the

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.030 
the first screen is glitch for the
commercial<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:48.400> I<00:05:48.430> just<00:05:48.760> left<00:05:49.000> it<00:05:49.150> at<00:05:49.300> that

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
here's my NBA 2k14 cover I think they

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.720 
here's my NBA 2k14 cover I think they
should<00:05:55.660> have<00:05:55.690> added<00:05:56.050> some<00:05:56.860> background<00:05:57.370> to<00:05:57.580> it

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
should have added some background to it

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.550 
should have added some background to it
make<00:05:57.940> it<00:05:58.060> a<00:05:58.150> little<00:05:58.300> more<00:05:58.420> just<00:05:58.960> spice<00:05:59.260> it<00:05:59.470> up

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
make it a little more just spice it up

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.210 
make it a little more just spice it up
it<00:05:59.740> looks<00:05:59.890> plain<00:06:00.700> as<00:06:00.940> hell<00:06:01.210> looks<00:06:02.080> boring<00:06:02.440> and

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
it looks plain as hell looks boring and

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.580 
it looks plain as hell looks boring and
use<00:06:03.370> some<00:06:03.520> kind<00:06:03.670> of<00:06:03.820> a<00:06:03.970> stupor<00:06:04.870> background<00:06:05.410> or

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
use some kind of a stupor background or

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.950 
use some kind of a stupor background or
something<00:06:05.920> like<00:06:06.010> that<00:06:06.510> makes<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.600> look<00:06:07.750> pretty

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
something like that makes it look pretty

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.840 
something like that makes it look pretty
cool<00:06:08.230> and<00:06:08.590> I<00:06:08.980> guess<00:06:09.190> those<00:06:09.460> are<00:06:09.490> all<00:06:09.730> the

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850
