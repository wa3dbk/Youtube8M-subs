00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.750
 yo everyone knows but accept it 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.170
 love we find ourselves for a new 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.260
 video 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.480
 so after my absence of four days 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.819
 in the Alps 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.289
 so I have the honor to tell you that my 

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:31.130
 first laying of my female asia and 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:33.140
 my evil jenko so his vigilante and down 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.210
 is there and cloud so that gave 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:46.460
 birth to two little babies so 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:48.970
 I hope something also a trick rather 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.970
 useful 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:59.740
 that's ok it's done just noted on date 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.740
 of birth 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:13.229
 so voice 28.03 on their date of 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.939
 birth and we go and I 'll you 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.619
 show so they are in my bag 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.770
 it is heated there as you can 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.770
 to see him 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.290
 so here we have the mu box 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.260
 so a subject of humidified sopalin so 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.000
 every day for the substrate we get 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.000
 do not complicate life we put sopalin 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.560
 as it is newborn 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.890
 so there the cup of calcium and 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.130
 vitamin cut his back to change all 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.300
 the days and a basic bagis hiding 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.550
 so that's the packaging of the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.890
 cutlets so I just made a 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.190
 start a cut and it makes a 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.869
 hiding I will show them to you so 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.530
 I wanted to tell you also about 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.270
 newborns so are very fearful they 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.520
 can they can bite what they have 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.190
 really scared so do not bother them 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.290
 every day and everything so really 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.340
 leave them alone they will not eat 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.340
 than at their first moult so their 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.590
 first molt that it can be between 3 and 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.590
 5 days for a little more but not at 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.160
 over a week and it's only 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.530
 after this moult who will eat and for 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.060
 the temperature at the hot spot it does not take 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.500
 not to exceed 30 degrees so I 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.470
 workers pass 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.050
 so me it's a 31 May 9 oral but in 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.880
 reality just below it so it does 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.650
 in the 30 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.930
 so as never know the good ones 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:58.130
 measures 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:58.130
 why I wanted to show and that's it 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.700
 two little babies 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.360
 so here they are about the same 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.200
 phase 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:18.470
 no actually just a little see they are 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.730
 very fearful just to see her so I 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.030
 do not know if you see but they have 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.530
 very different colors so this one 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.890
 so it's an albino I do not know if 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.980
 you see 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.780
 but compared to him he is very very good 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.090
 rosÃ© but also the biggest in what 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.970
 are very lively reacts a lot so are 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.440
 really watch out 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.460
 and yes, it's much more 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.380
 dark in color that the gifts they 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.430
 were incubated in the 30 degrees so 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.340
 it can be males and two females 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.580
 and they hatched after 43 days 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.570
 incubation 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:06.650
 so here it is surely 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:11.060
 classic or sms buy or d 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:14.239
 Aikido or golden it can be but lives 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.359
 well its colors can see what that 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.570
 will give but also same color a little 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.120
 dull a little whitish so that wants 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.410
 to say he's going that will certainly be fine 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:31.639
 all but why they were not he is 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.080
 will move to hand 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.919
 so what are they really tiny 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.879
 so these 6 cm at birth pretty much 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.919
 so you really have to be careful 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:43.129
 so he is afraid of the death of his son 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:05:00.669
 are we going to do what is it 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:05:03.529
 give up the hiding place and we'll leave them 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.759
 for me they are rather well lit 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:09.590
 finally I think you can see it 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:13.550
 but I have two windows which are 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.229
 yet open so that's so it's 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.219
 to tell you to announce my 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.779
 back and a big weekend of 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.819
 vacation 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:23.779
 so do not worry but the 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:28.129
 small they go very well 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:29.469
 so my pot go and not very very 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.400
 well 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:33.560
 just now what I did was 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.620
 that I changed box breeding the 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.270
 cricket so there they have a pretty good 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.699
 size so guillon breeding to 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.289
 know it's to feed the babies the 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.629
 gecko babies so since it takes a 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.870
 cricket adapted to their size so no 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:53.319
 bigger than lord and so see that gives 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.319
 that in size 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.090
 so it's a good size 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.650
 for babies so I really do not 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.650
 a lot so I looked but there I 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:10.300
 can not show you too much 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.710
 all show there I can not everything you 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:18.340
 show because I have that of them 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:21.100
 crush can there be one that I saw here 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:26.640
 escaped and he went below the 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.640
 field is not very serious is good 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.860
 so cricket breeding is going to 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.210
 wonder 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.340
 did I do too is that 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:38.230
 I started a breeding of morio worms 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.600
 so towards mario proulx go to mario 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.600
 since the greens of work I find 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.350
 it's a bit too small and it costs less 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.540
 dear that morio greens this for that 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.960
 that the morio greens is better to do 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.770
 A breeding 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.840
 I show you a little bit so here it's 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.800
 beetles so they've already made their 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.740
 crisis a guide to jimi flour 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.160
 bread 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:09.750
 we will also settle down are 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:16.030
 rather slow I will lead m to the moment 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:20.830
 otherwise at the chrysalis level what 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:24.100
 so I have used quite a lot 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.900
 so finally greens all that I have not 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:31.300
 a lot of fun we'll see so 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:33.430
 there who is dead too what is 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.960
 rather boring but good so it's a 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:40.800
 beginning in breeding worms we will see well 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.800
 what does it give 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.170
 so here it is to announce you 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.130
 also that I will do a little editing 

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.200
 as I told you the impression of 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.080
 empty and in the previous video a 

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.090
