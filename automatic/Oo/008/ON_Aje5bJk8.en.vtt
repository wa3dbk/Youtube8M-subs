00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
exciting notebooks on binders we can

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.949 
exciting notebooks on binders we can
either<00:01:47.560> pick<00:01:47.950> one<00:01:48.909> for<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.270> whole<00:01:49.450> day<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.840> it

either pick one for the whole day and it

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.229 
either pick one for the whole day and it
would<00:01:50.049> be<00:01:50.139> literally<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.499> huge<00:01:51.009> binder<00:01:51.520> or<00:01:51.700> we

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
would be literally a huge binder or we

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.179 
would be literally a huge binder or we
could<00:01:52.389> pick<00:01:52.539> one<00:01:52.569> for<00:01:53.020> a.m.<00:01:53.349> classes<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.919> 14

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
could pick one for a.m. classes of 14

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.519 
could pick one for a.m. classes of 14
p.m.<00:01:54.399> classes<00:01:54.669> or<00:01:55.149> if<00:01:55.509> you<00:01:55.569> can<00:01:55.689> get<00:01:55.869> 6<00:01:56.109> binders

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:56.529 
p.m. classes or if you can get 6 binders

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:58.319 
p.m. classes or if you can get 6 binders
for<00:01:56.679> each<00:01:56.799> class<00:01:57.159> not<00:01:57.520> including<00:01:57.909> cooler<00:01:58.119> in

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
for each class not including cooler in

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.289 
for each class not including cooler in
gym<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.799> chose<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.369> get<00:02:00.489> the<00:02:00.759> six<00:02:01.059> values

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
gym so I chose to get the six values

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.599 
gym so I chose to get the six values
because<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:01.869> feel<00:02:02.139> like<00:02:02.169> 14<00:02:03.099> a.m.<00:02:03.309> and<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.489> 14

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
because I feel like 14 a.m. and the 14

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.819 
because I feel like 14 a.m. and the 14
p.m.<00:02:03.939> one<00:02:04.239> mic<00:02:04.450> last<00:02:04.689> aren't<00:02:04.989> exactly<00:02:05.319> even<00:02:05.529> to

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
p.m. one mic last aren't exactly even to

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.589 
p.m. one mic last aren't exactly even to
like<00:02:05.950> more<00:02:06.099> classes<00:02:06.489> in<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.639> am<00:02:06.789> then<00:02:07.539> the

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
like more classes in the am then the

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.109 
like more classes in the am then the
p.m.<00:02:07.959> no<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.530> other<00:02:08.590> way<00:02:08.739> around<00:02:08.880> but<00:02:09.880> on

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
p.m. no the other way around but on

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.880 
p.m. no the other way around but on
anyways<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:10.840> think<00:02:11.019> if<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.260> got<00:02:11.439> the<00:02:11.560> binder<00:02:11.860> of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
anyways I think if I got the binder of

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.679 
anyways I think if I got the binder of
each<00:02:12.099> class<00:02:12.340> I'll<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:12.760> more<00:02:12.879> organized<00:02:13.450> i

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
each class I'll be more organized i

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.380 
each class I'll be more organized i
think<00:02:13.900> i<00:02:13.989> weighed<00:02:14.140> over<00:02:14.379> all<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:14.920> you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
think i weighed over all like you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.860 
think i weighed over all like you
fly<00:02:15.780> down<00:02:15.930> behind<00:02:16.080> your<00:02:16.230> feet<00:02:16.319> class<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.160> got

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
fly down behind your feet class I got

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.780 
fly down behind your feet class I got
the<00:02:18.870> Avery<00:02:19.260> durable<00:02:19.709> binder<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.250> green<00:02:20.760> and

originally wasn't going to do whatever
at<00:07:28.730> all<00:07:28.850> so<00:07:29.120> such<00:07:29.330> a<00:07:29.360> hassle<00:07:29.660> so<00:07:30.050> I<00:07:30.140> use<00:07:30.320> some

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:30.670 
at all so such a hassle so I use some

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.070 
at all so such a hassle so I use some
wrapping<00:07:31.670> paper<00:07:31.700> and<00:07:31.940> tape<00:07:32.300> last<00:07:32.660> year<00:07:32.930> and

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 
wrapping paper and tape last year and

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.420 
wrapping paper and tape last year and
I'd<00:07:33.170> take<00:07:33.440> it<00:07:33.560> all<00:07:33.650> down<00:07:33.680> and<00:07:33.890> peel<00:07:34.250> off<00:07:34.400> the

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430 
I'd take it all down and peel off the

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.160 
I'd take it all down and peel off the
tape<00:07:34.550> I<00:07:34.940> think<00:07:35.360> this<00:07:35.450> could<00:07:35.570> be<00:07:35.600> so<00:07:35.840> nice<00:07:36.050> to

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.170
