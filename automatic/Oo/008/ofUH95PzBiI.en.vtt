00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
want to move down to a different

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.999 
want to move down to a different
fingering<00:02:08.660> here<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.020> this<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.289> spot<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.800> do

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
fingering here and this is a spot to do

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.420 
fingering here and this is a spot to do
it<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.460> go

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.000 

now<00:02:18.430> right<00:02:18.640> here<00:02:19.200> move<00:02:20.200> up<00:02:20.410> with<00:02:20.590> your<00:02:20.739> third

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
finger at the fifth fret hit that note

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.030 
finger at the fifth fret hit that note
then<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.800> got

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:50.040 

I<00:02:32.099> think<00:02:32.849> that's<00:02:33.030> right

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.560 

and<00:02:51.010> get<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.190> little<00:02:51.490> bit<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.760> close-up<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.420> my

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
and get a little bit of a close-up of my

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
and get a little bit of a close-up of my
left<00:02:52.810> hand<00:02:52.930> here<00:02:53.440> for<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:55.870> case<00:02:56.320> you're

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
left hand here for that just case you're

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:10.930 
left hand here for that just case you're
not<00:02:56.680> quite<00:02:57.100> seeing<00:02:57.550> it

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:22.250 

you

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.520 

all<00:03:23.260> right<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:24.750> that's<00:03:25.750> pretty<00:03:26.050> much<00:03:26.140> cover

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
all right so that's pretty much cover

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.760 
all right so that's pretty much cover
that<00:03:26.710> part<00:03:28.050> I'm<00:03:29.050> gonna<00:03:29.440> end<00:03:30.190> up<00:03:30.430> doing<00:03:31.740> not<00:03:32.740> a

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
that part I'm gonna end up doing not a

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.370 
that part I'm gonna end up doing not a
complete<00:03:33.280> video<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.480> this<00:03:34.690> but<00:03:35.050> I'm<00:03:35.170> going<00:03:35.320> to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
complete video of this but I'm going to

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.890 
complete video of this but I'm going to
run<00:03:35.590> through<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.550> main<00:03:36.760> sections<00:03:38.520> and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
run through the the main sections and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.280 
run through the the main sections and
break<00:03:40.900> them<00:03:41.080> down<00:03:41.110> just<00:03:41.650> like<00:03:41.800> this<00:03:42.040> one<00:03:43.290> this

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
break them down just like this one this

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.410 
break them down just like this one this
was<00:03:44.560> one<00:03:44.770> of<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.070> trickier<00:03:45.730> ones<00:03:45.970> but<00:03:46.240> there

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
was one of the trickier ones but there

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.850 
was one of the trickier ones but there
is<00:03:46.540> one<00:03:46.720> at<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.870> end<00:03:47.050> that's<00:03:47.320> pretty<00:03:47.530> tricky

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
is one at the end that's pretty tricky

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:57.580 
is one at the end that's pretty tricky
as<00:03:48.130> far<00:03:48.370> as<00:03:48.490> picking

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.679 

but<00:03:58.590> yeah<00:03:59.189> that'll<00:03:59.489> be<00:03:59.579> coming<00:03:59.760> up<00:03:59.999> so<00:04:00.269> stay

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
but yeah that'll be coming up so stay

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:06.019 
but yeah that'll be coming up so stay
tuned<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:03.329> hope<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.780> helped
