00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 greetings youtubers well as they saw the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.850
 description of the video I'm not going to 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.889
 ask what is there here because 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:15.780
 you know what's here is the logitech 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:19.640
 f-310 and we are going to do the unboxing for 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.640
 this we have a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.380
 precision blade with the tip a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380
 little dirty 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.730
 a normal blade or as they say by 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.160
 there in other countries cutter or something like that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.430
 so let's start uncovering this 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.430
 thing 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.810
 there is already inside 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.770
 youtubers as you can see this 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.120
 living 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.210
 as you can see here 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.980
 from him 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.030
 original packaging with some 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.579
 descriptions 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.350
 to a qr code to cross to the page 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.479
 from your smartphone 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.810
 taking from four direction 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.960
 exclusive wide broad switches 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.680
 game compatibility as you can see 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.200
 by the former inp use the input is a 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.810
 option that is below which we are going to 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.030
 show now when we open it is like 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.039
 can see this control allows us 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.130
 also emulate as if it were a control 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.350
 of xbox thanks to the s input as it says here 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.090
 and it also gives them a little bit almost 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.759
 good 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.590
 and as you can see being the card button 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:47.990
 and back controls were found so 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.950
 we are going to disarm we are going to 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.950
 dismantle it 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.240
 here I will put it in fast camera for 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.240
 avoid us 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.409
 lengthen the video 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.020
 m 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.650
 do not 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.040
 in the sky 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.390
 Martin 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.470
 good 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
 all right 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.650
 and 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.200
 finally youtubers 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.770
 Well, now 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.709
 we have already removed it and as always 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.709
 typically 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.939
 here what has 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.660
 guaranteed more aromatic herbs 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.180
 the current 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.180
 let's read 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.360
 and as I understood this, he brought his 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.420
 cidh and its software so I have not 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.420
 viewed 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.510
 and then this is the control 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.990
 as traders can see 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.990
 castles 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.160
 they feel very comfortable as you can see 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.150
 they also have the names of things 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:05.090
 of xbox 360 as I said then rtr 8 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.170
 forgiveness in network lte 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.750
 and the Hebrew 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.750
 As you can see these are the buttons 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.079
 start and back be here there is a button 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.539
 central 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.539
 and I do not know what it will be but the mod 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.210
 the people well 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.410
 and here is what you wanted to see 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.870
 let's see ok 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.600
 here as you can see has an X and 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.760
 one of this is for him it's the ex 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.490
 inputs that is the entry as of xbox and 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.650
 the input on the input dire now 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.230
 We will be back in a soon to see 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.490
 that read a little bit of the instructions and 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.650
 so give it better then information so 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.780
 see you in a little while greetings 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.700
 youtubers have returned and it is to give 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.740
 some data 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.430
 somewhat important then good 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.120
 for example here that says was in the bag 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.120
 let's go a little damn 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.719
 ok as you can see it says that 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.370
 the content of bancaja only brings the 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:15.039
 gamepad and user documentation 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.289
 when I saw the description when I 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.060
 I bought online because he told me that 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.490
 I came with a city 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.620
 and what a pity that I do not work but 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.870
 Normally, I was not going to do anything with him 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.810
 it says here that it has a 6-wire 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.510
 feet in time that is damn ok that 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.810
 my camera works when it insults you 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.320
 comes then the cable is 1.8 meters 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.320
 6 feet 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.740
 I still had not removed this 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.830
 something also that I wanted to tell you is 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.630
 for when you activate the ex input and the 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.730
 trike modem because this button that is 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.620
 here that says logitech it would be like to go 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.620
 at the beginning, so if you go to your xbox 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.159
 so you put it 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.159
 and the cable that is simply long 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.259
 apparently if it has 1.8 feet and as 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.259
 can you see here 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.150
 is the command 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.510
 and it feels very comfortable it feels very 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.510
 willingly 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.919
 it feels very good 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.569
 very very well 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.309
