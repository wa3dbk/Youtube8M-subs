00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello sasha hello again but 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.889
 what a shelf of unusual devices of all kinds 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.849
 arrived for this we understand so let's say 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.560
 talk to you about not an hour 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.539
 swiss would have long been so nothing 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.230
 like they shot you there 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.180
 the channel about who was the review of Apple Watch to 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.810
 than you filmed it in Italian 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 read my own let's talk about folk 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.930
 swiss made watches in china 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.770
 for an hour and my hair 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:42.780
 are caused more than time understood 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.260
 motto so talk about the older model 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.059
 we call it and we are talking about a bracelet 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.690
 I think we will not tell and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.280
 form even a tuzi bracelet you have 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.280
 because by function they are probably there 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 very much like here where the match is 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.129
 us standard clock with oled display 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.390
 Here, in addition to the clock function, it is still 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.790
 perform such useful functions as 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:16.470
 vibrations during a call that is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.330
 Notification that call plus at the same time 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.299
 when he finds out you can immediately answer 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.530
 call in hours built-in microphone 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.509
 the built-in speaker can be quietly on 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.720
 river 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.580
 talk to the subscriber 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.850
 free the subscriber number of which 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.190
 No, unfortunately the name you can not know 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.300
 be introduced sloppy again in Latin but I 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.630
 I think maybe a shock like this 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.150
 good enough hands but 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.570
 not everyone again bible about me like 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.550
 powerful it costs more 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.490
 youth model just for those who are not 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.770
 You can buy a normal watch normal 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.270
 always call my footprint 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.700
 and powerful everything else of course straps 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.210
 different and accordingly there is black 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.050
 orange yes there is an orange I want it 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.390
 notice that pretty simple model 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.820
 because there is no touchscreen 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.430
 a little like let's make a microphone here 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.650
 speaker code with on speaker this one 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.100
 microphone yes there are two buttons 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.410
 time is shown 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.530
 shows the batteries like this 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.580
 ok time battery and pair with 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.050

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.750
 I called Sasha called me immediately and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.099
 starts to vibrate very very 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.140
 you can not miss the call here they are 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.439
 vibrate and here number 6 was born not 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.439
 it is seen 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:09.180

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.520
 conjugations so he and they are conjugated 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.990
 ok, no restart 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:23.400
 connects to standard protocol 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:25.050
 bluetooth 21 with support for dr. may cronus 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.300
 besides there is another interesting feature 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.540
 10 meters away from the phone 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.130
 also starts to vibrate here are connected 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.110
 all write again displays time 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.880
 time you need to set let's check right now 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:47.850
 they can still play music from your 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:51.140
 device plays no tricks like this 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.090
 Focus in general, I will be heard at home 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.900
 quite clear why it is needed but how would 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.520
 then the opportunity is there when 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.110
 accordingly if you talk on 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.040
 hours to talk with 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:09.740

 flirted until the vibrations started brothers i 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.800
 I want to notice on continuous very 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.330
 strongly and simply not to notice it is impossible 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.740
 here is another plus of this watch 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.270

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.250
 cartoon debtors why they are needed 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.699

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.740
