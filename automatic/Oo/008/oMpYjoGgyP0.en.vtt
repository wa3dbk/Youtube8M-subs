and I think s it is through all the Halo

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.980 
and I think s it is through all the Halo
games<00:01:24.610> so

games so

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.010 
games so
it's<00:01:27.560> a<00:01:27.710> little<00:01:27.950> bit<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.659> background<00:01:29.659> I
