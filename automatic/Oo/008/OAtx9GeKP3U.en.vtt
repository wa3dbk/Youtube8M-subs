00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
server but that that that even dropped

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.050 
server but that that that even dropped
the<00:02:34.920> eye<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:35.459> being<00:02:35.640> pissed<00:02:35.820> off<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.580 
the eye and I was being pissed off the
sill<00:02:36.209> for<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.720> that's<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.110> service<00:02:37.500> so

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
sill for that that's not the service so

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.210 
sill for that that's not the service so
that<00:02:37.620> doesn't<00:02:38.160> really<00:02:38.190> help<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.890> yeah<00:02:40.890> so

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
that doesn't really help and yeah so

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.610 
that doesn't really help and yeah so

this<00:03:50.940> building<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.870> useless<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:53.310> was

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
this building it is useless if it was

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.069 
this building it is useless if it was
made<00:03:53.579> out<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.760> wood<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.120> would<00:03:54.390> burn<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.840> but
