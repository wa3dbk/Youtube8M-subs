00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
game and we've also improved many of the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.950 
game and we've also improved many of the
parts<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.119> game<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.510> aren't<00:00:24.840> really

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
parts of the game that aren't really

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.540 
parts of the game that aren't really
working<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.500> well<00:00:25.680> without<00:00:25.890> eye<00:00:26.130> tracking

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550

this<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.970> first<00:00:30.179> example<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.900> Deus<00:00:31.590> Ex

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
this and the first example is in Deus Ex

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.459 
this and the first example is in Deus Ex
I<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:33.000> instead<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.570> having<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> remember<00:00:34.170> each

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
I can instead of having to remember each

I can instead of having to remember each
and<00:00:34.649> every<00:00:34.890> hotkey<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:36.510> example<00:00:36.570> go

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and every hotkey or for example go

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.410 
and every hotkey or for example go
through<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> tab<00:00:37.710> menu<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.850> navigate<00:00:39.390> to

hotkey<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.829> my<00:00:47.070> mouse<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.640> when<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> hold<00:00:48.480> down

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
hotkey on my mouse so when I hold down

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479

with different icons representing the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
with different icons representing the
different<00:00:53.010> menus<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.430> game<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.239> just

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
different menus in the game so I just

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.029 
different menus in the game so I just
look<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> menus<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
look at one of the menus and when I

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.979 
look at one of the menus and when I
release<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.520> button<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.690> take<00:00:57.870> me

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.479 
release the button it's going to take me

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and I can also go back doing the same

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.380 
and I can also go back doing the same
thing<00:01:01.699> another<00:01:02.699> thing<00:01:02.879> I'd<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> show<00:01:03.359> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
thing another thing I'd like to show you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.960 
thing another thing I'd like to show you

is in StarCraft where you have the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
is in StarCraft where you have the
mini-map<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.450> course<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.890> able<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
mini-map of course and to be able to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.620 
mini-map of course and to be able to
navigate<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.549> mini-map<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> first

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
navigate the mini-map you have to first

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
navigate the mini-map you have to first
move<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.990> mouse<00:01:10.260> down<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
move your mouse down here to the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.530 
move your mouse down here to the
mini-map<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.820> click<00:01:12.030> somewhere<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
mini-map and then click somewhere and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
mini-map and then click somewhere and
then<00:01:12.630> move<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> mouse<00:01:12.990> back<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.920> very

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
then move the mouse back and that's very

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
then move the mouse back and that's very
tedious<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> mention<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.840> also

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
tedious not to mention that you also

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
tedious not to mention that you also
lose<00:01:16.229> control<00:01:16.530> over<00:01:16.650> your<00:01:16.830> army<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:18.119> we

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
lose control over your army so what we

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.969 
lose control over your army so what we
do<00:01:18.360> instead<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.869> use<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> same<00:01:19.500> button<00:01:19.710> as

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
do instead is we use the same button as

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.520 
do instead is we use the same button as
in<00:01:20.310> dus<00:01:20.580> X<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.659> mouse<00:01:21.869> button<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
in dus X and this mouse button here so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.710 
in dus X and this mouse button here so
when<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> hold<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.189> down<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> show

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
when I hold that down it's going to show

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230 
when I hold that down it's going to show
me<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.140> entire<00:01:25.560> mini-map<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.000> entire

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
me the entire mini-map or the entire

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.780 
me the entire mini-map or the entire
battlefield<00:01:27.600> over<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> screen<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> I'll

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
battlefield over the screen and I'll

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.190 
battlefield over the screen and I'll
just<00:01:30.030> look<00:01:30.180> somewhere<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.780> example<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
just look somewhere for example on the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.749 
just look somewhere for example on the
enemies<00:01:31.470> over<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.979> when<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> release<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
enemies over here and when I release the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.700 
enemies over here and when I release the
button<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> take<00:01:33.570> me<00:01:33.840> there<00:01:33.869> so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
button it's going to take me there so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.190 
button it's going to take me there so
this<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:36.030> much<00:01:36.299> faster<00:01:36.450> way<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> navigate

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this is a much faster way to navigate

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.050 
this is a much faster way to navigate
the<00:01:37.320> mini-map<00:01:37.619> some<00:01:38.520> other<00:01:38.640> things<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.970> can

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the mini-map some other things you can

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
the mini-map some other things you can
do<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.299> StarCraft<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.810> also<00:01:40.200> we've<00:01:40.799> added

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
do in StarCraft is also we've added

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.980 
do in StarCraft is also we've added
features<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.400> let<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.390> scroll<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.689> screen

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
features to let you scroll the screen

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
features to let you scroll the screen
while<00:01:43.530> looking<00:01:43.979> at<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> edges<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> screen

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
while looking at the edges of the screen

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.880 
while looking at the edges of the screen
so<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.329> hold<00:01:45.689> down<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> button<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.439> then<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> look

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
so I hold down a button and then I look

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.050 
so I hold down a button and then I look
towards<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> edges<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:47.970> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
towards the edges and it's going to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.520 
towards the edges and it's going to
automatic<00:01:48.479> scrolling<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.960> direction<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
automatic scrolling that direction and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.429 
automatic scrolling that direction and
also<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:51.030> give<00:01:51.270> commands<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.840> my<00:01:51.930> units<00:01:52.259> if

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
also I can give commands to my units if

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.069 
also I can give commands to my units if
I<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.740> start<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:54.540> hold

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
I just start it up here and then hold

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.130 
I just start it up here and then hold
down<00:01:55.229> another<00:01:55.530> button<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.719> when<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> hold<00:01:57.960> down

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
down another button and when I hold down

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.649 
down another button and when I hold down
that<00:01:58.200> button<00:01:58.380> every<00:01:59.040> every<00:01:59.790> hotkey<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that button every every hotkey in the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.270 
that button every every hotkey in the
game<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> become<00:02:01.649> gaze<00:02:01.799> enabled<00:02:02.189> so

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
game is going to become gaze enabled so

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.160 
game is going to become gaze enabled so
I<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.460> look<00:02:02.640> somewhere<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.840> press<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
I just look somewhere and then press the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.539 
I just look somewhere and then press the
hotkey<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.189> trigger<00:02:05.340> where

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
hotkey and it's going to trigger where

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.310 
hotkey and it's going to trigger where
I'm<00:02:05.610> looking<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.689> I'm<00:02:06.780> doing<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.259> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
I'm looking so I'm doing this and you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.510 
I'm looking so I'm doing this and you
can<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.649> not<00:02:07.799> moving<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.129> mouse<00:02:08.340> in

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
can see I'm not moving the mouse in

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.919 
can see I'm not moving the mouse in
between<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.970> situation's<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.720> just

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
between the situation's I'm just

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.080 
between the situation's I'm just
pressing<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.349> T<00:02:10.530> button<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.489> also<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
pressing the T button I can also do that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.280 
pressing the T button I can also do that
with<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.390> sentries

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
with the sentries

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.199 
with the sentries
so<00:02:13.469> if<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.860> select<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.489> sentries<00:02:14.819> here<00:02:14.969> I<00:02:15.000> can

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
so if I select the sentries here I can

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.479 
so if I select the sentries here I can
deploy<00:02:15.989> force<00:02:16.230> fields<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.680> them<00:02:16.799> okay<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:19.489> I

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
deploy force fields for them okay and I

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.479 
deploy force fields for them okay and I
can<00:02:20.790> also<00:02:20.909> of<00:02:21.060> course<00:02:21.090> attack<00:02:21.540> new<00:02:22.189> or<00:02:23.189> any

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
can also of course attack new or any

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.729 
can also of course attack new or any
other<00:02:23.700> case<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:24.060> want<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.359> use<00:02:24.480> basically<00:02:25.170> some

do is basically we add gaze data to

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.729 
do is basically we add gaze data to
already<00:02:41.849> exist<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.420> replace<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.379> repay

we've also aggregated an index that will

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.280 
we've also aggregated an index that will
tell<00:03:23.159> you<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.209> comparable<00:03:24.720> index<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.199> you

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
tell you it's a comparable index so you

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.449 
tell you it's a comparable index so you
can<00:03:25.409> see<00:03:25.560> like<00:03:25.709> how<00:03:25.949> much<00:03:26.129> you've<00:03:26.310> improved

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
can see like how much you've improved

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.449 
can see like how much you've improved
since<00:03:27.269> your<00:03:27.510> last<00:03:27.750> few<00:03:28.019> games

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
since your last few games

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.189 
since your last few games
so<00:03:29.459> hopefully<00:03:29.639> that<00:03:29.970> would<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.239> very<00:03:30.629> helpful

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
so hopefully that would be very helpful

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.649 
so hopefully that would be very helpful

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
as you get better at the game one of the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.849 
as you get better at the game one of the
biggest<00:03:36.510> strengths<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.049> this<00:03:37.199> software<00:03:37.560> is

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
biggest strengths of this software is

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.770 
biggest strengths of this software is
that<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.519> basically<00:03:38.940> apply<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.180> any<00:03:39.510> game

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
that you can basically apply to any game

that you can basically apply to any game
that<00:03:40.049> has<00:03:40.379> OpenGL<00:03:41.250> or<00:03:41.310> diuretic<00:03:41.729> support<00:03:42.500> but

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
that has OpenGL or diuretic support but

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.830 
that has OpenGL or diuretic support but
it<00:03:43.590> has<00:03:43.680> its<00:03:43.859> limitations<00:03:44.159> of<00:03:44.489> course<00:03:44.840> with

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
it has its limitations of course with

it has its limitations of course with
real<00:03:46.109> source<00:03:46.440> integration<00:03:46.979> with<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.579> game

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
real source integration with the game

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.219 
real source integration with the game
you<00:03:48.269> could<00:03:48.629> do<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.109> much<00:03:49.290> more<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.220> for<00:03:50.400> example

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
you could do so much more so for example

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.479 
you could do so much more so for example
modifying<00:03:52.229> the<00:03:52.409> user<00:03:52.590> interface<00:03:53.040> depending

on<00:03:53.549> where<00:03:53.669> you're<00:03:53.790> looking<00:03:53.879> so<00:03:54.329> hiding<00:03:54.659> meters

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
on where you're looking so hiding meters

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.379 
on where you're looking so hiding meters
or<00:03:55.440> other<00:03:55.590> parts<00:03:55.979> of<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.489> UI<00:03:56.639> that<00:03:56.970> you're<00:03:57.239> not

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
you're not looking at them and then

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.699 
you're not looking at them and then
showing<00:04:00.359> them<00:04:00.479> when<00:04:01.139> you're<00:04:01.290> looking<00:04:01.500> at<00:04:01.620> the

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
general direction of them for example by

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.089 
general direction of them for example by
modifying<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.810> opacity<00:04:04.229> or<00:04:04.349> moving<00:04:05.010> the

modifying the opacity or moving the
graphics<00:04:05.430> themselves<00:04:06.049> you<00:04:07.049> could<00:04:07.229> also<00:04:07.669> give

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
graphics themselves you could also give

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.349 
graphics themselves you could also give
the<00:04:08.879> gauge<00:04:09.180> data<00:04:09.449> to<00:04:09.689> the<00:04:09.810> AI<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.379> game<00:04:10.530> so

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
the gauge data to the AI of the game so

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.309 
the gauge data to the AI of the game so
improving<00:04:12.359> the<00:04:12.509> AI<00:04:12.689> in<00:04:12.900> different<00:04:13.199> ways

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
improving the AI in different ways

improving the AI in different ways
imagine<00:04:14.069> for<00:04:14.189> example<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.519> boxing<00:04:14.909> game<00:04:15.090> where

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
imagine for example a boxing game where

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.319 
imagine for example a boxing game where
the<00:04:16.259> boxer<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.799> opponent<00:04:17.220> boxer<00:04:17.549> blocks

the boxer the opponent boxer blocks
where<00:04:18.659> you're<00:04:18.780> looking<00:04:18.900> that's<00:04:19.650> kind<00:04:19.889> of<00:04:19.949> how

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
where you're looking that's kind of how

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.370 
where you're looking that's kind of how
it<00:04:20.190> works<00:04:20.370> in<00:04:20.459> real<00:04:20.519> martial<00:04:21.000> arts<00:04:21.180> as<00:04:21.269> well

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
it works in real martial arts as well

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.570 
it works in real martial arts as well
the<00:04:22.380> opponent<00:04:22.830> or<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.310> were<00:04:23.430> always

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
the opponent or and you were always

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.950 
the opponent or and you were always
trying<00:04:23.909> to<00:04:23.969> figure<00:04:24.150> out<00:04:24.270> what<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.659> other<00:04:24.779> guys

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
trying to figure out what the other guys

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.220 
trying to figure out what the other guys
do

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
do

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.290 
do
and<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.890> easiest<00:04:26.250> way<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.550> doing<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.240> to

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
and the easiest way of doing that is to

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.110 
and the easiest way of doing that is to
simply<00:04:27.990> look<00:04:28.230> where<00:04:28.650> he's<00:04:28.890> looking<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:29.400> you

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
simply look where he's looking and you

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.640 
simply look where he's looking and you
need<00:04:30.270> an<00:04:30.360> eye<00:04:30.450> track<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.930> do<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.200> there<00:04:31.470> is<00:04:31.560> no

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
need an eye track to do that there is no

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.150 
need an eye track to do that there is no
other<00:04:31.800> way

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
other way

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.700 
other way
and<00:04:32.250> my<00:04:33.060> personal<00:04:33.390> favorite<00:04:33.570> feature<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.500> what

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
and my personal favorite feature is what

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.770 
and my personal favorite feature is what
I<00:04:34.860> like<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.190> call<00:04:35.370> passive<00:04:35.880> gaze<00:04:36.090> figures<00:04:36.540> and

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
I like to call passive gaze figures and

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.170 
I like to call passive gaze figures and
that's<00:04:37.290> basically<00:04:37.760> integrating<00:04:38.760> eye<00:04:38.910> tracker

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
that's basically integrating eye tracker

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.930 
that's basically integrating eye tracker
with<00:04:39.600> any<00:04:39.900> object<00:04:40.440> or<00:04:40.590> any<00:04:41.220> part<00:04:41.760> of<00:04:41.850> a

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
with any object or any part of a

with any object or any part of a
character<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.570> game<00:04:42.600> really<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.790> well<00:04:44.790> for

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
character in the game really so well for

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.020 
character in the game really so well for
example<00:04:45.270> imagine<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:46.080> medieval<00:04:46.260> bar<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:47.030> you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
example imagine a medieval bar and you

example imagine a medieval bar and you
have<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.270> bartender<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.380> have<00:04:49.530> the

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
have the bartender and you have the

could just stuff like that as well and I

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.660 
could just stuff like that as well and I
mean<00:05:23.670> the<00:05:23.880> technology<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.510> here<00:05:24.810> right<00:05:25.140> now<00:05:25.200> so

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
mean the technology is here right now so

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.010 
mean the technology is here right now so
you<00:05:26.670> can<00:05:26.850> get<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.120> dev<00:05:27.270> kit<00:05:27.480> and<00:05:27.660> start

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
you can get the dev kit and start

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.180 
you can get the dev kit and start
implementing<00:05:28.440> all<00:05:28.680> of<00:05:28.800> these<00:05:28.920> killer
