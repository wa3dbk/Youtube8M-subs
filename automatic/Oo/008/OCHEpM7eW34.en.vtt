00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
coming out the price point supposing on

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.869 
coming out the price point supposing on
the<00:02:22.569> Xbox<00:02:22.900> one<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.170> any<00:02:23.470> dropping<00:02:23.860> as<00:02:23.980> well<00:02:24.159> so

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
the Xbox one is any dropping as well so

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.670 
the Xbox one is any dropping as well so
it's<00:02:25.120> kind<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.360> expected<00:02:25.659> i<00:02:25.900> think<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.349> the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
it's kind of expected i think that the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.900 
it's kind of expected i think that the
ghosts<00:02:27.250> period

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
ghosts period

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.850 
ghosts period
our<00:02:28.000> low<00:02:28.300> especially<00:02:28.660> any<00:02:29.260> game<00:02:29.500> like<00:02:29.680> that

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
our low especially any game like that

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.760 
our low especially any game like that
that<00:02:30.160> is<00:02:30.640> going<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.420> be<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.630> next-gen<00:02:32.230> title<00:02:32.260> and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
that is going to be a next-gen title and

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.770 
that is going to be a next-gen title and
hopefully<00:02:33.040> taking<00:02:33.220> advantage<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.540> newer

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
hopefully taking advantage of the newer

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.710 
hopefully taking advantage of the newer
hardware<00:02:35.550> but<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.580> same<00:02:36.880> time<00:02:37.120> something

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
hardware but the same time something

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.140 
hardware but the same time something
like<00:02:37.750> battlefield<00:02:38.350> 4<00:02:38.620> has<00:02:39.250> had<00:02:39.610> extremely

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
like battlefield 4 has had extremely

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.290 
like battlefield 4 has had extremely
well<00:02:40.450> preorder<00:02:41.170> sales<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.910> might<00:02:43.120> be

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
well preorder sales and this might be

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.780 
well preorder sales and this might be
the<00:02:43.450> year<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.780> called<00:02:44.320> duty<00:02:44.650> has<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.520> much

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
the year that called duty has a much

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.630 
the year that called duty has a much
bigger<00:02:46.150> challenge<00:02:47.020> as<00:02:47.170> far<00:02:47.440> as<00:02:47.680> sales<00:02:48.130> go<00:02:48.400> and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
bigger challenge as far as sales go and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.820 
bigger challenge as far as sales go and
competition<00:02:49.270> goes<00:02:49.450> with<00:02:50.020> battlefield<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.680> mean

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
competition goes with battlefield I mean

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.260 
competition goes with battlefield I mean
the<00:02:50.950> past<00:02:51.100> battlefields<00:02:51.700> always<00:02:51.910> been<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.060> huge

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
the past battlefields always been a huge

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.320 
the past battlefields always been a huge
franchise<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:53.050> it's<00:02:53.200> one<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.470> biggest

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
franchise and it's one of the biggest

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.370 
franchise and it's one of the biggest
first<00:02:55.330> person<00:02:55.600> shooter<00:02:55.780> franchises<00:02:56.230> out

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
first person shooter franchises out

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.350 
first person shooter franchises out
there<00:02:56.620> but<00:02:56.890> called<00:02:57.520> duties<00:02:57.730> always<00:02:57.940> been<00:02:58.150> at

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
there but called duties always been at

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.020 
there but called duties always been at
the<00:02:58.540> very<00:02:58.720> very<00:02:58.810> top<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.440> up<00:03:00.400> until<00:03:00.610> now<00:03:00.850> I

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
the very very top and up until now I

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.460 
the very very top and up until now I
don't<00:03:01.300> think<00:03:01.480> they've<00:03:01.600> really<00:03:01.990> really<00:03:02.170> gotten

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
don't think they've really really gotten

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.930 
don't think they've really really gotten
the<00:03:02.530> true<00:03:02.770> run<00:03:02.950> for<00:03:03.190> their<00:03:03.250> money<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.640> this<00:03:03.820> is

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
the true run for their money and this is

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.430 
the true run for their money and this is
going<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.150> be<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:04.480> think<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.990> first<00:03:05.200> year<00:03:05.410> that

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
going to be I think the first year that

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.050 
going to be I think the first year that
is<00:03:05.620> going<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.800> be<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> very<00:03:06.400> very<00:03:06.700> close

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
is going to be a very very close

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.490 
is going to be a very very close
competition<00:03:07.360> between<00:03:07.840> Call<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.200> Duty<00:03:08.470> and

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
competition between Call of Duty and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.990 
competition between Call of Duty and
Battlefield<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.040> that's<00:03:09.160> a<00:03:09.280> great<00:03:09.490> thing<00:03:09.670> for

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
Battlefield and that's a great thing for

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.480 
Battlefield and that's a great thing for
consumers<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:10.960> that<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.770> what<00:03:11.980> leads<00:03:12.280> to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
consumers that that is what leads to

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.370 
consumers that that is what leads to
innovation<00:03:12.850> from<00:03:13.420> companies<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.200> what

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
innovation from companies that is what

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.700 
innovation from companies that is what
leads<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:15.340> new<00:03:15.760> ideas<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.390> new<00:03:16.810> concept<00:03:17.380> because

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
leads to new ideas a new concept because

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.160 
leads to new ideas a new concept because
they<00:03:17.830> have<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.550> new<00:03:19.330> ideas<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.900> new

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
they have to have new ideas and new

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.890 
they have to have new ideas and new
gameplay<00:03:20.890> for<00:03:21.100> people<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.460> experience<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.510> you

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
gameplay for people to experience to you

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.480 
gameplay for people to experience to you
know<00:03:22.990> essentially<00:03:23.560> get<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.890> leg<00:03:24.130> up<00:03:24.160> on<00:03:24.400> the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
know essentially get a leg up on the

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.340 
know essentially get a leg up on the
competition<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.480> competition<00:03:26.110> is<00:03:26.170> always

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
competition so competition is always

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.320 
competition so competition is always
good<00:03:26.650> for<00:03:26.770> consumers<00:03:26.890> whether<00:03:27.400> that's<00:03:27.730> you

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330
