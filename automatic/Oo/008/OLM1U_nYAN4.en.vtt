00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.890
 This time 

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:10.090
 That we want to be taught side deck of the emblem Beast of the deck 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.090
 I will introduce 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.300
 Patch Faro is 10,000 yen 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.050
 Great king before 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.789
 One fader is included 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.169
 I will have a castrate store 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.169
 Cyclone instead 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.590
 I feel up to one 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.590
 One test 4 photos 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.000
 10,000 yen at the medallion 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.000
 Is north 1 sheet 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.750
 Which 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.320
 Not 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.410
 It is two sheets touch 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.560
 Disturbing 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 I'm asking Faro 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:01:00.170
 I don't need an honest function, so let's skip this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.170
 I'm not finished yet 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.829
 After mental drain too 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.829
 A little subtle 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.130
 Let's explain 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.050
 3 sheets as hard Oh aside 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.480
 Recently there are a lot of alive heroes sober 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.400
 Oh dear 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:25.280
 The Alive hero touched you, such as for Marai 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.460
 If you 're stuck in these four , ask at the basic margin 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.920
 Daio said 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.080
 And from the battle fader Sakai 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.030
 Prioritized 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.230
 Some say that Akashi can be stopped by the moon book 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.510
 After Well 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:49.380
 I'd become caught in the priesthood fader little person is cut 2,000 yen to reverse 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.640
 I feel thankful 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.930
 I have put the fader Forced transition 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.330
 I wanted to put this one more 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.350
 Just put another one 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.240
 Before the cyclone 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.619
 There is a fray, so a cyclone 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.619
 I feel like two sheets 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.090
 do it 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.069
 Oh deck 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.599
 Char monkey they stuck to tentatively Well nail Toka Jefferies 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.590
 It feels like 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.260
 Then limit this 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.410
 Hugh Mameiru 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.940
 It is not an exaggeration to say that both stabs and moat are essential 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.750
 Act at the medallion 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.090
 It is personally strong and one more 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.180
 Then I did it 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.180
 This is extra turn measures 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:46.240
 Nde frame after mental drain seemed One does not enter 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.740
 I want to put through 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.430
 Flat or diamond dust 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.430
 It is two choice 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.100
 Te it's hard unfinished introduction to death 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.500
 Introduced the house 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.090
 I can not proceed in this way
