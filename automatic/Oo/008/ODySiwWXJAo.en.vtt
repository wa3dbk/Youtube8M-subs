00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 guys we are in champion league 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:16.500
 barbarotto what the hell you sleep comes to 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:18.830
 celebrate 325 thousand i like guys 5 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830
 thousand I like it 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.580
 hello to all guys it's me to whom to give 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.670
 and today we are in this new video and 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.520
 yes we finally arrived in the league 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.440
 samples 3200 trophies the red as the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.390
 blood look what a beautiful coat of arms 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.830
 of the league actually samples mine 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.860
 idea was to make a video where I arrived 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.090
 but my champions live 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.460
 damn program doesn't have me 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.050
 saved registration 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.270
 But guys don't cry over milk 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.580
 paid and in any case arrived in 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.309
 champion then for this very thing 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.290
 very very epic 5 thousand sheet I like 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.690
 I know they are so many I know they are 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.970
 however the sample for the first one is very large 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.460
 time so much stuff then kids 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.350
 look like damned because for me 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.000
 it was a truly unique emotion of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.660
 heartbeat I was on the bed doing jumps 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 deadly 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.560
 just imagine how much I have culminated 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.000
 so let's look at boys for a moment 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.790
 I did the last attack I did 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.440
 against this abu fars was a mach state 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.280
 of the Madonna with practically everything to 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.560
 maximum 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.330
 fortunately I say fortunately not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 was the queen of archers in the years 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 active rhubarb so I put it first 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.090
 the balloons from below I pulled 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.740
 out of the clan troops 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.280
 I used this practice which I think is 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.170
 very very effective for making 50 per 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 hundred with hot-air balloon and thugs 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.890
 quite inexpensive so it will succeed 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.690
 to do too many resources then 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.640
 here I destroyed the two witches who 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.830
 they were really annoying then now 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.900
 we speed up a little later has 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.180
 then put on this side a fury and then 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.860
 the balloons that they destroyed 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.600
 this actor from the archer and then the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.230
 put also on this side succeeding 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.550
 almost to destroy even the 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.830
 the defense was but then there are none 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.360
 succeeded I destroyed this other find 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.540
 of the archer then here I put the troops 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.760
 of the clan where there were other balloons 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.500
 and then here I was at 20 percent put 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.270
 we hunt around more or less faster 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.640
 yet another bit and slowly 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.470
 percentage by percentage here for 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.800
 security then eventually put even type 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.660
 a fury here at random to do 50 for 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.120
 a hundred that is to say we say that in these cases 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.340
 better be safe than fail 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.770
 here I put real 50 percent ends 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.840
 battle and we arrived in the sample 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.700
 then another attack and I say that you 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.010
 I wanted to show from this here against a 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.930
 jamon and the madonna with house suits 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.090
 at most, however, like the walls one or the other 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.710
 this is really unwatchable and this 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.730
 boys really had so many 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.010
 resources to steal 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.810
 I honestly could have stolen them 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.760
 everything and I do n't say it to be cool but 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.050
 because anyway I didn't use all the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.210
 troops did not use all the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.920
 spells and then let's say works 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.840
 watch yourself because then I knew I would 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.460
 had to make another attack and then 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.770
 let's say however I managed to 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.240
 take lots of resources always with 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.620
 the same as a ballooning tactic 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.580
 thugs, I put some hot air balloons 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.590
 down here 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.450
 they did their job then the harvest 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.430
 also up here on the left 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.220
 here is the meantime also subjected 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.050
 other schemes that have taken the mythical 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.110
 resources and here here here here I've done 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.790
 really lots of resources especially 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.600
 very much the black turns look how much 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.959
 the black 4.396 really something of 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.959
 epic 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.450
 here I was at 38 percent ie we say that 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.439
 I did 50 percent very much 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.420
 easily 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.310
 above then I finally put mine 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.200
 mythical barbarian king and my mythical queen 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.610
 of the archers who did the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.450
 devastated the last resources 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.079
 available 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.859
 then I finished and bye bye I 'm happy 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.379
 I'm happy I 'm red I'm red I am 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.510
 I'm red and then guys actually 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.030
 I wanted to make a broken champions 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.549
 season 2 as I had already mentioned then 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.650
 what he did yesterday I was at 2800 trophies of 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.690
 so he recorded an episode then maybe 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.250
 we record two or three episodes we see a 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.349
 as it actually is yesterday I did 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.769
 Two hundred trophies I found myself at 3000 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.109
 trophies 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.810
 morning jokingly told us 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.939
 we get to 3200 trophies and they are closed 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.159
 arrived so I didn't believe it either 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.849
 reality attack after attack yes 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.530
 we did it 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.449
 and so now I honestly am 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.639
 finding it very well so I'll try 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.680
 to rise a little more and I will also try to 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.990
 to make sea then to make resources up here in 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.669
 let's see what comes of it maybe I'll do 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.740
 also the video tutorials on these things 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.240
 very very glass pussies this guys 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.830
 I as usual remind you to leave 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.080
 I really like going through the page 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.490
 facebook and still pass for all the 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.560
 link below in description 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.199
 we conclude with these images of the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.659
 acts from my other 201 trophies and nothing 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.139
 guys we see each other in the next 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.139
 video
