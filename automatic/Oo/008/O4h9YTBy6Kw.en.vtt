00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 hi friends my name is juan luis 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.309
 fernandez I am the person who hides 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.110
 behind the character of jenofonte in my 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.030
 youtube channel and on our page one 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.490
 of 25 point blogspot.com 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.960
 I decided to start this video like this 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.390
 because I could not think of another way to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.980
 do it and also so you can see a little 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.900
 as I have right now on the desk 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.749
 of bundled with a lot of screens and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.949
 super weird open programs and very 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.640
 different than what we are 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.619
 used to see in our videos 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.680
 of the youtube channel and in the points that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.410
 we post on the blog the topic that I'm going to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.900
 start today is going to occupy a series of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.520
 chapters is going to be a miniseries and it's 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.610
 dedicated to an issue that is quite 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.370
 delicate and that is very important 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.950
 if we are serious fans to the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.200
 photography that is color management 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.080
 in linux this is an area that 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.230
 generally good is pretty boring 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.150
 and above all, it is very far from the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.130
 initial intention of a photographer who is 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.769
 enjoy photography without eating 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.620
 much more the head unfortunately if 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.820
 we want to get optimal results is 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.050
 something that for what I have 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.870
 and move on and it 's something that we have to 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.850
 know and learn to configure well 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.160
 our team so that what we see to 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.410
 through the viewer then it represents 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.440
 a faithful way on paper or in the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.820
 good screen I tried to do it like 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.200
 always with brevity with simplicity of 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.270
 a most pedagogical way and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.940
 entertaining possible and especially with 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.280
 a lot of love and I hope you find it 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.900
 utility in today's chapter that is going to 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.540
 be the first in the series we're going to 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.520
 start talking about some concepts 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.890
 introductory ones that are important to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.990
 know as the mini-series progresses 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.759
 We will see methods to calibrate the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.800
 monitor what is that of the profiles the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.200
 color modes and a lot of other things 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.770
 that we will see little by little and nothing more 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.770
 I hope you like it 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.540
 to begin with we have to clarify a 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.750
 basic concept which is that excess of 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.580
 color actually the color does not exist are 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 simply wavelengths that 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.190
 they reflect the bodies when they receive light 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.200
 the way we have to perceive the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.910
 color is very different from a person to 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.340
 another and it will also vary depending on 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.050
 the light source and depending on it 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.280
 object of physical characteristics 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.560
 of the object is therefore a subject 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.570
 especially subjective and very complex and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.760
 which is difficult to transfer to the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.260
 numerical information that is with which 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.030
 our devices work 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.300
 electronic cameras monitors 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.230
 the printers and so on the color has 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.700
 three attributes 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.740
 basic attributes that are those that 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.990
 we try to drive when when 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.840
 we manage the color in our 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.050
 photographs that are the tone the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.270
 saturation and brightness the tone is what 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.220
 we usually call color and it's the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.380
 wavelength that told you to be 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.420
 reflects that it gives a color or 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.360
 we interpret as one color or another in 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.390
 function of that length 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.430
 saturation is the degree of purity of 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.980
 that color or a saturated color at 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.720
 maximum is the color in its pure state and 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.850
 As saturation progresses, it acquires 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.900
 other dominants that make it more 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.310
 off to our eyes the last 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.590
 element the last attribute would be the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.260
 brightness which is the amount of light that 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.260
 emits a color or reflected by an object 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.290
 depending on these three attributes are the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.650
 that define the basic color mode in 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.310
 image that is the hsv that comes from the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.390
 acronym you tone saturation saturation and 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.360
 brain drain the brightness this is the mode 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.100
 color or the basic color model and there 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.580
 another three that is very important too 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.580
 know 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.850
 the three models that I am talking about are 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.800
 lab rgb hicm and here the lab mode is a 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.060
 color model independent of the 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.060
 device has as a base three 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.819
 different channels that are a and b the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.370
 first l is of luminosity and the others 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.650
 two a and b are colored as I said 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.510
 this is an independent color mode 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.579
 of the device and is that these modes of 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.400
 color are going to be important depending 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.470
 of the type of device that analyzes the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.810
 picture the other two 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.530
 rg of iu-cm and you'll see how they work 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.510
 rgb is a color mode that comes from 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.820
 lab and that divides the information in this 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.840
 case in three color channels r for the 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.740
 Red 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.500
 for green and b for blue this is 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.560
 the ideal color mode for 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.880
 devices that emit light for example 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.160
 the monitors and good is the values 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:56.280
 they indicate how much light is emitted from each 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.610
 color 0.00 as black is up to 255 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.950
 two 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.350
 55 255 that is the target 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.660
 that's why this additive mode is called 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.570
 The more information we put the more we 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.510
 we approach the white the following way 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.820
 Cement is the ideal 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.680
 printing for the use of your inks 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.770
 name comes from the combination of 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:23.270
 colors that the combination of 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:26.150
 channels that are for the cyan 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.130
 for magenta and yellow for the 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.250
 yellow and cat for black for not 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.950
 repeat the be the blue in this case is 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.440
 ideal for printers because it uses a 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.140
 its color tractive mode in this case 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.170
 the sum of all the colors would not give the 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.840
 white but black and subtraction is to say 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.150
 the complete absence of colors would give the 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.100
 white or the background color of the 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.380
 image that normally in print is 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.720
 a role it is very important to have this in 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.240
 account because our our 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.940
 devices usually work in rgb and 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:03.010
 It is convenient to convert the image of rege of 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.010
 makes mica when we go to print
