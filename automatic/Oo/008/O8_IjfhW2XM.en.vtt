00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.779
 So people with a little bit of delay you can 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:24.779
 now to day 3 let us first rained 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:29.290
 to repeat from yesterday it was a great 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 two now times the clog so swapped 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.390
 turn clockwise you have to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:01:50.590
 guys in the opposite direction then come 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:55.150
 I follow to the train today two of me 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.229
 We want to bring that to one of us 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.640
 That's why because so maybe here 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.070
 because these stones are concerned here 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.950
 must be exchanged in any case 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.039
 is it these two stones here 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.509
 here must logically need this 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.530
 Both people are interested here 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.819
 is solved 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.249
 the solved page 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.299
 on the left as well as in the cheers at the back but 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:21.950
 left and that's exactly what that would have 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.620
 I have to do so with the algorithm 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.420
 then also appears on the dice 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.639
 exactly the same algorithm so me 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.250
 do the job company and then get it 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.689
 I also a shepherd that is now too 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.170
 the same one I use 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.730
 usually people use in others 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.370
 but I think that too very fast 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.450
 can also do it 06 07 seconds 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.980
 okay, you can really do that too 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.079
 work well with that one this couple 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.549
 here pursued the expanded 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:56.180
 So you do ah youtube is the couple 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.639
 here the animal 1 back with uplay then 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.419
 again the same as youtube 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.810
 now the couple back here is 20 l 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:10.609
 prize, the couple started again here 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.260
 with a new prime and the couple has 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:35.239
 shot out now so that carries too 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:36.530
 again with a new prime and are 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.049
 relatively easy to learn so you see 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.030
 The solution really shows 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.689
 again you carry this couple out here 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.560
 is two in there so all youtube is the 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:52.489
 here is one back again yoopress 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.280
 further than youtube then comes the left 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.299
 side game so l prime sit down i 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.389
 the party 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.840
 uk prime the couple back here again 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.840
 use 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:11.109
 twice youtube youtube 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:36.330
 new prime and the youtube you can with 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.820
 So make the double that youtube 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.750
 offers not to do so because 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.430
 but that takes with the medium 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.720
 and to make forefinger 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.820
 because significantly faster then 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.980
 we come to the 11th 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.240
 that is exactly the mirrored so you 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.500
 See here the next page is now 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.830
 right here that 's almost the pole 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.630
 remain formally so concerned formally 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.020
 the two must be exchanged the two 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.230
 and vice versa it's just that 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.190
 same and that is in principle exactly the same 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.750
 mirrored so I do not turn now 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.110
 the right side up, but the left side 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:21.950
 l with a prime, and the pair of two 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:25.830
 further on , the couple once turned back here 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:29.300
 prime youtube with it the right side 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.300
 Do not play the coffee in front of it 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:53.740
 again youtube rtl price youtube rank 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.740
 three 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:34.260
 youtube youtube a few with this couple 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:38.700
 like the 100 for the youtube is here 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.700
 Can you continue as a job here 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.690
 now the parry game is fighting again 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:51.310
 that will be a law tube to that again 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:53.080
 returns have used the algorithm 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.610
 but only if I am 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.290
 exactly this situation before me 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.610
 otherwise I use something now 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.640
 more complicated that's why I bring you 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.410
 not because the stupid it for the 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:12.490
 Just start something so complicated too 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:14.009
 learn there is that relatively fast 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.349
 that too 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:18.389
 that's exactly what it was about the algorithms of 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:22.889
 Today I hope you can 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:24.749
 reasonably well kept so james 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:29.009
 are the stones that are exchanged 

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:33.270
 the solved side left and must the 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:36.599
 stones solved as right and then it is 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:39.899
 actually relatively simple exactly 

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:42.979
 was it thanks for watching and see you 

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:42.979
 till tomorrow
