brake<00:00:09.120> fluid<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.780> know<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.080> much<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.410> time

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
brake fluid you know so much of the time

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.320 
brake fluid you know so much of the time
we<00:00:10.650> talk<00:00:11.010> about<00:00:11.250> what<00:00:11.370> makes<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.670> vehicle<00:00:12.090> run

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
we talk about what makes a vehicle run

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.539 
we talk about what makes a vehicle run
perhaps<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.170> most<00:00:13.349> important<00:00:13.950> thing<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.340> what

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
perhaps the most important thing is what

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.490 
perhaps the most important thing is what
makes<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.910> vehicle<00:00:15.240> stop<00:00:15.540> that's<00:00:16.080> right<00:00:16.350> and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
makes a vehicle stop that's right and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.720 
makes a vehicle stop that's right and
changing<00:00:16.830> brake<00:00:17.010> fluid<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.520> very

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
changing brake fluid can be very

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.620 
changing brake fluid can be very
controversial

pull the rubber boot off and expose the
bleeder<00:02:44.160> valve<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> we're<00:02:45.630> using<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.959> same

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
bleeder valve so we're using the same

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.900 
bleeder valve so we're using the same
vacuum<00:02:46.680> pump<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.160> use<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.580> drain<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
for a test drive it's a good idea to

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.880 
for a test drive it's a good idea to
take<00:04:09.239> time<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.540> check<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.930> brake<00:04:10.260> pads<00:04:10.590> and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
take time to check the brake pads and

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.410 
take time to check the brake pads and
the<00:04:10.980> rotors<00:04:11.340> well<00:04:11.549> we've<00:04:11.670> got<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.940> wheels<00:04:12.150> off
