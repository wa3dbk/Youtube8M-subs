00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.830
 it's enough is over they do not let in that 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.830
 the call nobody 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.770
 but 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.770
 to me 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.849
 in that we need geography to 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.849
 heal our plants 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.750
 the mind the ears 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.420
 ah 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.310
 they no longer have anything to fear ideas 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.310
 Black fled 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.330
 thank you friend but our plants do not 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.950
 they are better I see, I think they are not the 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.350
 black ideas that filled me the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.210
 nature did not come to create problems 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.910
 but to aggravate those that already exist 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.590
 here poor and little flower if you could 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.590
 tell me what it was that made you sick 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.880
 what makes us sick is waking up and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.329
 the stars disappear and we can not 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.689
 survive a hundred without the light of the 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.689
 stars 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.980
 and their plants need the light of the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.200
 stars to develop 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.930
 maybe each flower or fruit corresponds to 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.820
 a star here that means that 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.650
 our micro mates are sick 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.170
 because the stars no longer shine 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.960
 night in the sky and I think that's what 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.620
 the flower was trying to tell me 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.620
 yes 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.909
 has more people 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.700
 but I do not believe you 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.590
 we agree 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.170
 thank you very much for your help but 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.180
 they should go home immediately 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.459
 Good boy go longer welcome 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.879
 I'm sure this planet needs 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.879
 our help 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.920
 thank you for joining us your city is 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.920
 very willing 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.140
 with this evil 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.700
 and more 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.490
 I waited 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.650
 do not leave 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.050
 I do not want my coat and get sick 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.930
 I believe them but what can I do to 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.050
 to save them well a while ago you talked about a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.240
 astronomer antoine true now yes the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.890
 crazy from heaven before he lived with us 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.080
 in the city but the only thing that 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.840
 interested was to see the sky as if the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.820
 coats would come out in the ridiculous clouds 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.050
 maybe but if that astronomer should 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.300
 know the stars 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.700
 we should visit him to ask him if 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.560
 he knows what's wrong with them is that good 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.130
 I would be surprised if he agreed to help the 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.250
 chlorophyll we also live in a place a 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.850
 little special we should try to talk 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.830
 with the 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.970
 listened to live somewhere a 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.970
 little special 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.780
 one 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:51.349
 life and above if I never saw you enjoy a 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.930
 So big is worse than I feared live 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.909
 this great live there according to klaus 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.400
 Antoine wanted to live closer to 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.460
 stars made this tree grow very very 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.710
 high to approach them 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.970
 or I was sick of your people 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.780
 will treat like crazy 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.780
 we live together 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.860
 how 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.410
 ah 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.870
 look nothing else it's very interesting to be 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.350
 Prince are not going to come 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.350
 ah 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.020
 they went to look for antro years 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.360
 I'm sure better until they return 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.090
 your home is surely not a 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.370
 coincidence that they really have the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.430
 stars you know what's going to happen 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.820
 do not worry about current is not going to go 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.820
 I promise 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.710
 not now 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.710
 the his mother 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.900
 I served again is the magic bible 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:10.169
 I'm sure it would not help 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.129
 going too fast also think you 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.129
 you want the metal comes 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.520
 because it's time to get up already 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.520
 we arrived young 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.939
 well I had the giant and careful 

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:31.939
