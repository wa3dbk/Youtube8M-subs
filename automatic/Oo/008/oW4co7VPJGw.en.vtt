00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.349
 hi to all and win fighter province 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.949
 today for a new video 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.330
 commented on gt5 online so it'll be 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.279
 a little video to show you all 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.560
 the submarine danger locations 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.800
 ternheim so the first location is 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.170
 where there agree to the world is right there 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.070
 so this is the house facing side of the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 house that is there where we see game there 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.329
 that one that has 150 thousand dollars so 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.800
 it's not very expensive and then you have a 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.600
 little bit next door so you have the under 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.480
 sailor right in front you have a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.770
 heliport which is right there so 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.980
 So here it is the first 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.070
 location we end up right after 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.780
 no that's the second location and the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.980
 there it's right there you see shard the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.390
 yellow submarine and I do not ask myself 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.680
 gently not in the water why 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.199
 explodes me tac 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.020
 so that's the second location of the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.950
 underwater right here so wait because 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.939
 that first I forgot about you 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.270
 show on the map so I'm going to do 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.470
 both of them so here's another one there at 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.430
 worst you put when you have it 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.240
 found you put a little triangle 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.439
 like that it stays and the other was beautiful 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.590
 right there I told you at home 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:29.859
 here right here yes my bike here to see 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.640
 and so here we go again for the third 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.460
 placement 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.030
 it's just here so wait i'm going to 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:43.469
 ask I show you the map next 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:45.569
 shit mail in the con I preferred the 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.729
 the chaos door 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:51.909
 that's it then on the map happens that 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.369
 it's right there on the little point the 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.599
 justice '' you give yourself a point 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.170
 with triangle well here and we go I 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.250
 can not go out 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.349
 so so we go normally it's just 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:12.310
 beside 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:16.989
 tend normally it's not very very 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.140
 far off at this point etam like that my 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.140
 guys 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.410
 here is right here you rent up 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.849
 so we do not have to buy the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.950
 muscular owner who say we are 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.489
 obliged to buy the property is pale 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.400
 it's you 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.129
 so here you can dive yourself 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.890
 go for it and apparently here there is 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.840
 so apparently I have not checked but 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.940
 there would be full of peace is not me 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.610
 would talk get clear here there would be 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:56.530
 lots of red nuclear stuff not 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.910
 what is it so it can not hurt you 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.459
 money so apparently I spent 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.730
 in the modem we will go you go 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.349

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.880

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.069
 title so that's it's the third 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.079
 location and must be a lot 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.370
 others but hey I know these 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.170
 three there have nothing to see one or two 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.329
 other maybe I'm not patient there 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.310
