can see here it's just one of the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.960 
can see here it's just one of the
charging<00:00:17.130> ports<00:00:17.430> plug<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.910> play<00:00:19.490> but<00:00:20.490> this

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
charging ports plug and play but this

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.560 
charging ports plug and play but this
was<00:00:21.150> built<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> 4x4<00:00:21.779> chassis<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.920> Ford

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
was built on the 4x4 chassis for Ford

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.620 
was built on the 4x4 chassis for Ford
they<00:00:24.570> actually<00:00:25.140> used<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.390> electric<00:00:27.390> motor

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
they actually used a electric motor

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.830 
they actually used a electric motor
between<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:29.039> rear<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.179> rear<00:00:30.330> wheels<00:00:30.570> it's

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
between the rear the rear wheels it's

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.950 
between the rear the rear wheels it's
like<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> transaxle<00:00:31.529> electric<00:00:32.279> drive<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.390> this

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
like a transaxle electric drive and this

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.900 
like a transaxle electric drive and this
controller<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.649> front<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> battery<00:00:35.610> pack

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
controller up front and a battery pack

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.639 
controller up front and a battery pack
underneath<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:36.930> we've<00:00:37.079> done<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.530> we've

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
set this guy up to actually drop the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.260 
set this guy up to actually drop the
battery<00:00:41.129> pack<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.550> from<00:00:41.760> underneath<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.120> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
battery pack out from underneath it it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.760 
battery pack out from underneath it it
comes<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.600> from<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> bottom<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.559> we're

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

gonna crack it open and see what kind of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760 
gonna crack it open and see what kind of
batteries<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.539> there<00:00:45.690> somebody<00:00:46.410> killed

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
batteries are in there somebody killed

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
awesome job building the battery pack

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.040 
awesome job building the battery pack
right<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.980> fiberglass<00:00:56.309> construction

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
okay so here we are this is the battery

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.149 
okay so here we are this is the battery
pack<00:01:33.220> for<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.640> exist<00:01:34.270> that<00:01:35.110> in<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.619> vehicle

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
this is filled with lead acid now if you

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.780 
this is filled with lead acid now if you
come<00:01:41.080> over<00:01:41.259> here<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> brand<00:01:45.640> new

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
come over here this is a brand new

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.280 
come over here this is a brand new
lithium<00:01:46.000> pack<00:01:46.450> that's<00:01:46.659> going<00:01:46.869> in<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.050> mini

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
lithium pack that's going in the mini

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.920 
lithium pack that's going in the mini
but<00:01:48.009> yeah<00:01:48.190> just<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.550> couple<00:01:48.759> more<00:01:49.030> of<00:01:49.090> these<00:01:49.360> and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
but yeah just a couple more of these and

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.870 
but yeah just a couple more of these and
it'll<00:01:50.050> power<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:50.619> truck<00:01:50.979> like<00:01:51.220> nobody's

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
it'll power that truck like nobody's

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.180 
it'll power that truck like nobody's
business<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:52.780> we<00:01:52.899> could<00:01:53.049> go<00:01:53.200> from<00:01:53.580> this<00:01:54.580> to

business so we could go from this to
this<00:01:57.190> this<00:01:57.549> is<00:01:57.700> how<00:01:57.970> far<00:01:58.240> technology<00:01:58.509> has<00:01:59.170> come

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
this this is how far technology has come

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.969 
this this is how far technology has come
in<00:02:00.310> what<00:02:00.580> ten<00:02:01.090> years<00:02:01.119> yeah<00:02:02.100> yes<00:02:03.100> ten<00:02:03.460> years<00:02:03.670> so

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
in what ten years yeah yes ten years so

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.490 
in what ten years yeah yes ten years so
there<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.100> have<00:02:06.280> it
