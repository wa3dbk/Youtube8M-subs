00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
very fluent it's not as fast as I hope

very fluent it's not as fast as I hope
it<00:00:32.969> would<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.239> but<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:34.140> really<00:00:34.380> fast<00:00:34.880> now<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it would be but it's really fast now the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.490 
it would be but it's really fast now the
clip<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> good<00:00:38.219> clip<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.750> i<00:00:40.140> lost

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and sadly it's that it's not even loose

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.750 
and sadly it's that it's not even loose
yet<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.539> Oh<00:00:52.699> see<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.879> oh<00:00:54.030> there<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.660> go<00:00:55.760> that's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.529 
yet so Oh see that oh there we go that's
so<00:00:57.149> much<00:00:57.270> better<00:00:58.340> I'll<00:00:59.340> miss<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.289> anyway<00:01:02.539> um

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
oh this thing here this little hole i

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.859 
oh this thing here this little hole i
guess<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.270> kind<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:10.430> thumb<00:01:11.689> it's<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
guess it's kind of like a thumb it's a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.990 
guess it's kind of like a thumb it's a
way<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> open<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.409> i<00:01:13.590> guess<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.880> just

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
way to open it i guess or it's just

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.550 
way to open it i guess or it's just
decoration<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.110> i<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.560> open<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
decoration but i can open it like that I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.840 
decoration but i can open it like that I
kind<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.710> opening<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.670> better

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
kind of like opening it like that better

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.149 
kind of like opening it like that better
I<00:01:21.180> guess<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.960> kind<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> adds<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.650> effect<00:01:22.950> almost

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I guess it kind of adds in effect almost

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.130 
I guess it kind of adds in effect almost
like<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.430> thumb<00:01:23.640> stud<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.270> nail<00:01:24.479> naked<00:01:24.900> one

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
like a thumb stud and a nail naked one

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380 
like a thumb stud and a nail naked one
because<00:01:25.979> now<00:01:26.220> next<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.670> usually<00:01:26.970> about<00:01:27.060> right

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
because now next are usually about right

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510 
because now next are usually about right
here<00:01:27.689> thumb<00:01:28.259> studs<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.740> usually<00:01:29.159> right<00:01:29.280> there

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
here thumb studs are usually right there

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.200 
here thumb studs are usually right there
so<00:01:30.650> that's<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.890> uh<00:01:33.860> has<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> finger<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:36.060> your

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
so that's that uh has a finger for your

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.499

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
thing right here a little plate used to

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.430 
thing right here a little plate used to
go<00:02:48.580> in<00:02:48.610> there<00:02:48.880> but<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.540> lost<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.170> screw

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
go in there but I lost the screw

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.330 
go in there but I lost the screw
actually<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.840> should<00:02:52.900> basically<00:02:53.500> bottom<00:02:54.220> line

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
actually it should basically bottom line

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.420 
actually it should basically bottom line
is<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.640> screws<00:02:54.940> come<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.269> very<00:02:55.540> easily<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.430> if

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
is the screws come on very easily so if

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.860 
is the screws come on very easily so if
you<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:59.550> suppose<00:03:00.550> from<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.850> belt<00:03:01.090> clip<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.660> could

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
you I suppose from the belt clip I could

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.170 
you I suppose from the belt clip I could
take<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.200> screw<00:03:02.530> from<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.890> belt<00:03:03.069> clip<00:03:03.370> and

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
take the screw from the belt clip and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.660 
take the screw from the belt clip and
put<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.569> in<00:03:04.690> here<00:03:06.180> like<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:08.970> anyway<00:03:10.200> so

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
put it in here like that anyway so

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.560 
put it in here like that anyway so
overall<00:03:12.670> if<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.390> if<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:13.989> like<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.650> first

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
overall if you if this is like a first

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.210 
overall if you if this is like a first
like<00:03:16.570> your<00:03:16.870> first<00:03:17.079> spring<00:03:17.500> assist<00:03:17.799> knife<00:03:17.950> I

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
like your first spring assist knife I

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.420 
like your first spring assist knife I
would<00:03:18.430> definitely<00:03:18.549> get<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.440> I've<00:03:20.440> flipped

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.250 
would definitely get it I've flipped
this<00:03:21.610> thing<00:03:21.910> probably<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:22.930> five<00:03:23.230> hundred

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
this thing probably like five hundred

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.250 
this thing probably like five hundred
times<00:03:23.860> now<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:25.030> never<00:03:25.390> gets<00:03:25.570> old<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.049> play

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
flipping it so much let's try to see if

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.509 
flipping it so much let's try to see if
I<00:03:36.160> can<00:03:36.340> get<00:03:36.489> any<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.799> basically<00:03:42.430> the

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
I can get any this is basically the

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.690 
I can get any this is basically the
player<00:03:42.850> looking<00:03:43.209> at<00:03:43.390> after<00:03:44.130> very<00:03:45.130> much<00:03:45.370> wear

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
player looking at after very much wear

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.990 
player looking at after very much wear
and<00:03:45.730> tear<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:48.130> not<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> lot<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:50.820> this<00:03:51.820> is

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
and tear so not a lot and not this is

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.370 
and tear so not a lot and not this is
just<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.269> blade<00:03:52.480> moving<00:03:52.870> it's<00:03:53.019> not<00:03:53.109> really

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
just the blade moving it's not really

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.960 
just the blade moving it's not really
the<00:03:53.440> play<00:03:55.829> or<00:03:56.829> maybe<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> play<00:03:57.489> yeah<00:03:57.820> it

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970

is the play I think a lot of knives will

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.780 
is the play I think a lot of knives will
do<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.799> much<00:04:03.010> it

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790
