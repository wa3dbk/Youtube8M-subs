00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.840
 what happens people here and welcome to 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.300
 last episode about the classes that 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.850
 will have butterfield 4 in the latter 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.010
 occasion it's the turn of the class of 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.570
 support if you ask now that the 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.880
 record takes here ten and four us 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.650
 we will logically take it easy 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.380
 both will be carried by both 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.730
 different classes so now we're going to 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.520
 start talking about the new 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.420
 light machine guns first 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.300
 We have 100 mk5 or also known 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.989
 as last 100 developed in 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.989
 singapore and as you see will have 590 bullets 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.389
 per minute and will have inside fits very good 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.320
 handling and if I'm not mistaken it will be focused 

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:45.720
 only to the Chinese faction 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.200
 on the other hand they have taken away the famous 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.870
 r pk 74 m and instead we will have the rp 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.750
 12 is a modern version of the 74 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.610
 although a priori in bad and feel 4 what 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.190
 are your characteristics will be very very 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.840
 similar and good on the other hand is a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.720
 weapon more that is based on the new 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 Assault rifle ak 12 and then 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.119
 the aemet 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.810
 88 will be renamed type 88 lmg or 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.759
 also known as j 88 and good of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.520
 new one of Chinese origin and as already 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.170
 you know from the hands of norinco of the new 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.350
 machine gun is one of the most 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 damage and more range has the following is 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.960
 the uve 95 that will go to version 90 and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.680
 51 and once again by hands of norinco 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.360
 is based on the well-known bucket 95 and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.400
 will have some pretty statistics 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.490
 balanced as you can see 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.110
 and finally we have the amg 4 which is a 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.940
 machine gun of German origin though 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.370
 It is also or was used by the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.080
 Spanish land army was seen by 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.180
 first time in the trailer to do 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.220
 storm as you can see in the image and 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.480
 will have the highest cadence of these 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.250
 last with 800 bullets per minute 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.740
 up to here the new machine guns 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.090
 light ones that will not follow debates 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.230
 filtres will be m 27 and m 36 and m 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:11.510
 64 and those that will follow are the pp scholarship 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.220
 have the m 249 the gm 240 p and the the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.500
 exam 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.960
 let's go now for the accessories of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.470
 class we will continue having debate filtres 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.390
 both the c4 and the play mons as well as 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.120
 our box of ammunition and our 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.590
 mortar and as first novelty we will have 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.390
 the m &amp; t a ps always as it is an artifact 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.880
 designed and produced by the industry 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.830
 military of israel and this will serve us 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.570
 as a type of protection for 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.410
 infantry which if I 'm not wrong 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.200
 to avoid and deflect the missiles then 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.780
 we will have the xm25 which will be a type of 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.430
 grenade launcher but all this well 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.390
 like the new types of grenades and 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.640
 pitchers we will treat it in another video 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.660
 and finally if the assault class is 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.610
 they gave the freestyle 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.350
 that is, the first aid pack 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.480
 this kind of support was not going to be less 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.490
 so they have also added a 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.020
 small pack of ammunition that as in the 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.900
 previous case can only be used 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.060
 for a person up here in the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.459
 accessories now it's the turn of the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.250
 specializations that affect you 100% to 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.990
 this class first of all we have the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.350
 same as in the recognition class 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.880
 an improvement on the c4 and the climax this 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.620
 will do as you know has increased the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.040
 effect number and we believe that it will be possible 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.959
 carry on the other hand an improvement 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.450
 in the bags and boxes of ammunition 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.010
 that again this will increase the number of 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.680
 Ammunition boxes that can be 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.810
 unfold and like the kind of 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.150
 assault and engineer class the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.340
 specialization in this case of unit 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.800
 of replenishment that like the others 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.350
 classes will cause that when occupying a vehicle the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.900
 rest of allied vehicles nearby 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.510
 they will obtain ammunition 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.670
 and finally we have a fire improvement 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.239
 indirect that is simply this will do 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.010
 that the damage with the mortar and the xm25 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.750
 increase and good until here the last 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.849
 episode about the classes that will be in 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.860
 butterfield 4 if you have not seen the rest 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.750
 of classes you know that from this image 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.670
 you can access them 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.439
 On the other hand, comment that here 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.390
 just all this is simply the 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.459
 beginning in the next videos about 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.739
 the news of water feel 4 we will talk 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.359
 of a huge amount of things like 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.729
 example the kind of weapons that we still 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.370
 remain to be seen ie the defense 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.080
 personnel and shotguns as well as 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.699
 pistols that we will have as weapons 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.919
 secondary and knife types 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.960
 also the large number of accessories 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.419
 camouflages the new types of grenades 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.660
 the new game modes as well as 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.669
 new premium maps and tlc 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.860
 we will also talk in depth 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.660
 about all specializations that do not 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.940
 we have seen so far 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.260
 as well as novelty also the advantages and 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.930
 the roads that can be chosen in 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.700
 butterfield 4 and good many but that 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.400
 many many more things that remain for 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.260
 count so if you have any idea or 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.750
