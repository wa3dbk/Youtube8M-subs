hmm

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.740 

heat<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> up<00:01:59.700> would<00:01:59.850> be<00:01:59.910> great<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.540> kind

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
heat it up would be great but it's kind

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.620 
heat it up would be great but it's kind
of<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.920> having<00:02:01.920> pork<00:02:02.280> rib<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:02.730> you

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
of like having pork rib and then you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.030 
of like having pork rib and then you
know<00:02:03.720> letting<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.140> temperature<00:02:04.530> go<00:02:04.650> away<00:02:04.860> in

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
know letting the temperature go away in

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.320 
know letting the temperature go away in
room<00:02:05.970> temperature<00:02:06.530> but<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.620> that<00:02:08.330> certainly

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
room temperature but of that certainly

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.470 
room temperature but of that certainly
if<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.540> was<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.440> needed<00:02:10.649> fast<00:02:10.950> nutrition<00:02:11.490> this

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
if I was if I needed fast nutrition this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.860 
if I was if I needed fast nutrition this
would<00:02:12.660> work

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.990 

time<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.989> trying<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.230> Brett
