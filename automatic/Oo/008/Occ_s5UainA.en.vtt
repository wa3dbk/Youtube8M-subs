00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.330
 transmission of the main is my disk 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.560
 successor magnetic portal 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.840
 I have been finishing for over a year 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.760
 after being very stagnant what is 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 musical production and it comes 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.800
 to show my point of view about what 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.300
 which is actually for me the real 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.510
 trans and trans site music 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.930
 since I currently listen to trans music 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.329
 and I do not feel that there is not much trans 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.590
 through 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.290
 and it reflects a lot what is my 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.810
 my current internal process that is 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.010
 to transmute my 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.500
 in my mind in thoughts and the disk 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.980
 contains nine songs that most 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.990
 through messages that 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.730
 that lead to these processes 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.730
 personal to each 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.520
 messages that are for the world of many 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.770
 good energy a lot of vibration which is what 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.770
 that I need also for me 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 clearly 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.960
 and I feel that by adding this message to me 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.400
 music 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.480
 It has much more weight and more importance and 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.650
 and I do not like much more than putting voices 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.870
 that do not make any sense 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.080
 and well this album after a lot 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.050
 time trying to make music 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.840
 new materialized with several with several 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.170
 collaborations as they are from my friends 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.240
 spirit architect leaf a looping nova 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.240
 fractal and mantra 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.479
 and well I hope you liked the album 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.130
 that something different comes subtly 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.280
 different from what is magnetic portal 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.140
 I want that is geometric poetry too 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.910
 that well a little more charged to the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.910
 psychedelia mixed with progressive 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.380
 this album comes a little more monotonous 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.810
 simpler 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.350
 not with so much complication in production 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.320
 thing like that but I feel like I was going 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.110
 little bit more hypnotic more repetitive 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.230
 little monotone without many 'breaks' 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.630
 clearly I believe that that is in favor of 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.630
 what it is to enter a trance state 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.650
 that contains nine songs 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.530
 and will be together to go out for some 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.170
 virtual stores for them 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.390
 and I hope you like them to capture the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.230
 essence of the disc I hope that the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.810
 messages to choose to put in the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.430
 songs serve them especially a one 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.620
 special that is called hop or I can not that 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.480
 it is a therapy of self healing and help 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.519
 to the neighbor 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.030
 I'm very interested in it and here he applied it in 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.620
 my 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.230
 that speaks of four words that you 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.550
 you can repeat and you can heal yourself for that 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.120
 nothing that you think you need to help 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:24.590
 and I feel that using this technique my 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.500
 music will take more people and that is one of 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.330
 the bases of transmutation alterman that 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.640
 is to help money bartel 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.130
 but you like the record in which you have it 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.130
 you appreciate it dances
