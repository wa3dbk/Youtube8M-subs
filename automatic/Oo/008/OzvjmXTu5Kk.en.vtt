00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
low paragon level like let's say you're

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.900 
low paragon level like let's say you're
below<00:02:57.569> 100<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.200> there's<00:02:59.069> three<00:02:59.250> spots<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.849> a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.979 
below 100 and there's three spots in a
game<00:03:00.680> then<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.129> know<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.120> join<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.629> game<00:03:03.840> where

people say highest opens because there's

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.630 
people say highest opens because there's

there's<00:03:46.019> only<00:03:46.049> two<00:03:46.319> choices<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:46.919> there's<00:03:47.099> a

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
there's only two choices if there's a

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.270 
there's only two choices if there's a
three-person<00:03:47.730> game<00:03:47.910> what<00:03:48.419> which<00:03:48.599> has<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.959> be

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
three-person game what which has to be

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.920 
three-person game what which has to be
so<00:03:50.280> see<00:03:50.730> this<00:03:50.970> one<00:03:51.180> I'm<00:03:51.359> actually<00:03:51.540> have<00:03:51.840> to

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
so see this one I'm actually have to

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.270 
so see this one I'm actually have to
reopen<00:03:52.079> because<00:03:52.440> this<00:03:52.560> guy's<00:03:52.709> higher<00:03:52.950> than<00:03:53.160> me

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
reopen because this guy's higher than me

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.670 
reopen because this guy's higher than me
so<00:03:53.819> this<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.870> actually<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.169> first<00:03:55.200> time<00:03:55.440> I've

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
so this is actually the first time I've

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.800 
so this is actually the first time I've
joined<00:03:55.889> a<00:03:56.069> middle<00:03:56.370> middle<00:03:56.669> game<00:03:56.970> or<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.359> have<00:03:57.660> to

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
joined a middle middle game or I have to

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.879 
joined a middle middle game or I have to
be<00:03:57.959> open<00:03:58.230> because<00:03:58.859> he's<00:03:59.160> 525<00:03:59.819> on<00:04:00.030> 520

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
be open because he's 525 on 520

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.099 
be open because he's 525 on 520
generally<00:04:01.889> speaking<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.370> does<00:04:02.700> not<00:04:02.819> happen

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
generally speaking that does not happen

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.140 
generally speaking that does not happen
and<00:04:04.109> you<00:04:04.859> basically<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.310> read<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:06.720> know<00:04:06.840> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
and you basically just read you know and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.440 
and you basically just read you know and
join<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.269> games<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.720> want<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:09.900> join<00:04:11.450> by

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
join the games that you want to join by

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.490 
join the games that you want to join by
the<00:04:12.510> way<00:04:12.630> don't<00:04:12.750> don't<00:04:13.109> look<00:04:13.290> at<00:04:13.410> this

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
the way don't don't look at this

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.279 
the way don't don't look at this
character<00:04:13.919> guys<00:04:14.099> this<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.519> just<00:04:14.730> me<00:04:15.000> I'm<00:04:15.900> busy

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289

higher<00:04:21.239> so<00:04:22.019> ignore<00:04:22.260> this

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
higher so ignore this

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.950 
higher so ignore this
but<00:04:23.720> if<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.110> join<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.530> correct<00:04:24.800> games<00:04:25.960> then

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
but if you join the correct games then

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.470 
but if you join the correct games then
you<00:04:27.560> won't<00:04:27.740> use<00:04:28.100> any<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.430> your<00:04:28.670> written

you won't use any of your written

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.660 
you won't use any of your written
fragments<00:04:30.130> unless<00:04:31.130> you<00:04:31.220> just<00:04:31.370> don't<00:04:31.520> care

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
fragments unless you just don't care

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.610 
fragments unless you just don't care
because<00:04:31.910> normal<00:04:32.330> bounties<00:04:32.690> are<00:04:32.810> super<00:04:33.080> quick

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
because normal bounties are super quick

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.770 
because normal bounties are super quick
super<00:04:33.830> easy<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.880> know<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.240> that's<00:04:35.450> a<00:04:35.570> video

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
super easy you know and that's a video

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.240 
super easy you know and that's a video
that<00:04:35.840> I'll<00:04:36.020> probably<00:04:36.140> be<00:04:36.380> making<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:37.130> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
that I'll probably be making in the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.790 
that I'll probably be making in the
future<00:04:37.720> me<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:38.810> my<00:04:38.870> clan<00:04:39.110> know<00:04:39.320> sometimes<00:04:39.680> we

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
future me and my clan know sometimes we

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.990 
future me and my clan know sometimes we
get<00:04:39.950> a<00:04:40.010> group<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.250> four<00:04:40.460> people<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:40.880> actually

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
get a group of four people you actually

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.160 
get a group of four people you actually
do<00:04:41.300> split<00:04:41.660> acts<00:04:41.840> like<00:04:42.170> acts<00:04:42.350> 1<00:04:42.590> through<00:04:42.770> 4<00:04:43.010> and

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
do split acts like acts 1 through 4 and

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.990 
do split acts like acts 1 through 4 and
we<00:04:45.170> on<00:04:45.560> average<00:04:46.040> spend<00:04:46.310> about<00:04:46.460> two<00:04:46.760> minutes

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
we on average spend about two minutes

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.180 
we on average spend about two minutes
per<00:04:47.360> cash<00:04:48.640> so<00:04:53.350> you<00:04:54.350> know<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:54.740> can<00:04:54.860> get<00:04:55.010> rich

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
per cash so you know you can get rich

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.450 
per cash so you know you can get rich
keep<00:04:55.370> fragments<00:04:55.790> pretty<00:04:55.970> quickly<00:04:56.240> too<00:05:00.460> so

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
keep fragments pretty quickly too so

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.380 
keep fragments pretty quickly too so
there's<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.670> lot<00:05:01.790> of<00:05:01.820> ways<00:05:02.000> that<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.150> can<00:05:02.300> do

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
there's a lot of ways that you can do

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.820 
there's a lot of ways that you can do
this<00:05:02.510> and<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.870> kind<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.080> have<00:05:03.230> to<00:05:03.260> figure<00:05:03.710> out

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
this and you kind of have to figure out

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.070 
this and you kind of have to figure out
you<00:05:04.310> know<00:05:04.340> what's<00:05:04.430> what's<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.480> optimal<00:05:05.960> way

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
you know what's what's the optimal way

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.570 
you know what's what's the optimal way
for<00:05:06.290> you<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.410> do<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:09.220> you<00:05:10.220> know<00:05:10.310> i<00:05:10.340> would

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
for you to do this and you know i would

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.760 
for you to do this and you know i would
recommend<00:05:11.060> doing<00:05:11.540> games<00:05:11.900> withers<00:05:12.290> if<00:05:12.620> you

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
recommend doing games withers if you

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.350 
recommend doing games withers if you
don't<00:05:13.070> want<00:05:13.250> to<00:05:13.310> use<00:05:13.400> your<00:05:13.550> rifky<00:05:13.850> fragments<00:05:14.270> i

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
don't want to use your rifky fragments i

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.520 
don't want to use your rifky fragments i
would<00:05:14.480> recommend<00:05:14.870> doing<00:05:14.960> games<00:05:15.290> where

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
would recommend doing games where

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.590 
would recommend doing games where
there's<00:05:15.710> three<00:05:16.130> people<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:16.790> if<00:05:17.390> you<00:05:17.450> have<00:05:17.540> a
