turn<00:02:16.040> there<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.849> there's<00:02:17.150> much<00:02:17.330> like<00:02:17.599> that

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
turn there and there's much like that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.270 
turn there and there's much like that
and<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.560> goes<00:02:18.769> like<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:19.720> or<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:21.280> and

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
must be closed so you give your finger

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.440 
must be closed so you give your finger
space<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:35.900> do<00:02:36.080> all<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.530> fingerings

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
space to do all the fingerings

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.199 
space to do all the fingerings
especially<00:02:38.450> for<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.780> fourth<00:02:39.049> finger<00:02:40.209> okay

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
especially for the fourth finger okay

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.750 
especially for the fourth finger okay
but<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:42.049> muscle<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.250> muscle<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.640> is

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
