00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.889
 everyone knows who got us a lot 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.630
 something really interesting 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.849
 but a little less fuck at a time and 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.470
 also a bit critical because it's 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.470
 true that it can remove almost a 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.270
 job is actually the limits as 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.119
 indicates the site down one can say that the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.130
 drones end the robots finally over the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.550
 future brown finally replaced a little 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.320
 the man 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.849
 and then a lot of business that's 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.300
 especially now in the factory or stuff 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.189
 like that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.989
 before it was the manual now there is 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.820
 robots that actually replaces me 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.460
 people of course there is always 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.230
 races or even 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.579
 manual with people but what 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 will sing to tell you it's finally 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.829
 the drones heroes at all that are in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 train little by little and good to eat a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.640
 little any and all of these trades that the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.710
 humans have taken place and that ultimately 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.020
 down it eliminates that removes 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.370
 and unfortunately good trades 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.320
 there is not necessarily that it is 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.940
 FIP and also that one might sarah 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 say like that and I started with 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.750
 information that is to say drones from 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.850
 document delivery companies in dubai 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.890
 what does it mean these are 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510
 simply deliveries by 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.610
 drone 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.100
 so that was already done no amazon and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.950
 then there is now emirates 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.869
 united arabs excuse me I say slowly 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.299
 for not making any link fault while 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.799
 it actually embarking on a project 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.540
 and it's this one ie roll that 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.060
 all documents for example official 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.470
 which are intended for citizens by 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.900
 example the drones 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.040
 excuse me for example of if the 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.740
 official documents for example the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.050
 passports ID cards ago 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.660
 also a lot of things and well will be 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.550
 sent for citizens by 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.930
 drones so for now at dubai and 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.180
 was also part of my company 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.280
 amazon france that in my opinion it must be 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.510
 in the united states by amazon and again this 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.550
 not to be everywhere everywhere because 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 that she was rays of course these drones 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.660
 the fauna about 45 cm and its 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.580
 behavior have made a big 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.260
 battery but be careful it's a 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.820
 battery will not be able to do more 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.420
 country okay you 're not having a 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 amazon drone to leave for example 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.450
 United States arriving in France I 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.340
 do not it's possible 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.560
 they have a certain radius then the radius 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.910
 2 in flight 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.920
 we do not know for the moment five 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.600
 officers at this stuff but in 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.280
 anyway they will have a certain radius and 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.709
 if you have to know it's not easy to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.110
 dubai and the wrong the radius needed 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.060
 to make all citizens in dubai 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.160
 so good it still remains a very 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.300
 big radius and ben it can not hurt 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.680
 of things but both that and that 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.060
 could say it's weird so I 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.150
 will show you of course 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.040
 images of these of these drones to face to 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.450
 quadri kopter I do not think so 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.640
 actually has four propellers you 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.230
 know each side and then like that one 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.810
 see that it allows a big teuf 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.480
 we will say stability in fact two of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.890
 the device like that it is not and 3 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.680
 end he is not sliced ​​on a dildo he 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.810
 is really stable he's right and 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.700
 then the security system for example 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.019
 that kanak that will also be deemed limited 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.519
 will replace the post yes it's going 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.320
 replace the post a little somewhere 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.280
 it's going to do the mail the way I've 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.440
 says official things 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.450
 but be careful what to know 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.650
 it is that they are comprised of a reader 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.200
 fingerprint as well as a 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.730
 iris scanner that is to say that it will 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.739
 scan your fingerprint as well 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.140
 that your escapee actually wow scanner 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.930
 your eye to find out if it's fine 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.070
 you like that after you'll have your 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.630
 ID card then on a map 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.980
 ID or a blue card you can 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.230
 not distribute it like that to the strong 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.840
 who what is the drone is wrong even 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.460
 tasks it's going to the neighbor from above bah 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.050
 frankly it can be very very 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.900
 it's annoying especially if your neighbor 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.700
 you do not like he's going to smoke you rare he 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.800
 there is a lack of looking ben you 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.450
 smoke somewhere so it's true 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.040
 it sounds pretty good here 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.440
 it's the technology of today 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.790
 said sand will still future 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.020
 maybe but it's true that it can 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.390
 for example removing some trades 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.580
 then finally bassed up basle 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.680
 to be human somewhere a bag that can 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.450
 look pretty blurry so what's needed 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.160
 know that for now it's a 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.430
 fashion and that's for six months from 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.750
 of today and that against these 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.460
 robots there they have resistors 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.980
 extra that we will not have if that 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.870
 come to europe why not because 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.610
 meteorological helpers are very 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.560
 different in dubai than in france 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.040
 okay 1 there are sandstorms to 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.500
 dubai 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.900
 1 - with respect to sandstorms in 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.790
 France you will not have one I agree 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.830
 know that sometimes there are the homes of 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.480
 desert sand of the sahara or to be 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.890
 like that happens in France but not 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.560
 sand storms perhaps not 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.480
 to abuse it too and to the Mafia passage of 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.840
 sandstorms at dubai and also the 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.850
 heat 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.370
 okay so there is also a lot of 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.350
 heat it's very hot then some 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.510
 basically if it can go very unique ctu 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.490
 strech hulu com as a place but 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.050
 good they have a lot of money to they are 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.730
 Petes thunes and honestly they in 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.230
 not care a bit hilarious that they have the 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.170
 thanks to oil stuff like that a 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.280
 little bit everywhere in this kind of website of 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.230
 geographical location Bah 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.700
 frankly that's it they can very well 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.560
 to afford to do quadricopter 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.520
 without any worries and that's tell me 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.860
 often thought that only a bar of 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.270
 comments my personal opinion ségala 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.650
 process good thing since it's true 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.420
 that it's more very futuristic but at the 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.850
 times it's bad because already five 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.830
 removed from the trades and then by 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.860
 aso let's talk about that post me if 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.990
 somewhere it's dangerous 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.240
 I find it maybe not not doing it 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.470
 right now actually 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.840
 by the way that's what he does not know 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.280
 but I think it's too much 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.039
 unstable in fact we can not do this 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.900
 kind of device finally I do not know 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.699
 honestly the guy like stole the drone has 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.150
 do what at last I do not know it in front of a 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.650
 security system but why 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.009
 complicate life when we do not have 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.090
 really still technical means 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.979
 enough to do this stuff 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.780
 are simple ibrahim years to try to 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.520
 do futuristic then finally to a 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.740
 big drouot a big thing like that a 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.060
 quadricopter times for me it's not 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.349
 necessary here it is thanks we take all the 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.909
 people well put in search never dreamed 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.620
 it's a great pleasure especially for me 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.060
 am on my personal page to ask 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.259
 your questions you miss you said to the 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.259
 next track chatchat
