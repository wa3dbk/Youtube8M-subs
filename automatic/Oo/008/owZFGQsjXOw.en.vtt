conditions in wet your lashes and makes

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.950 
conditions in wet your lashes and makes
your<00:01:46.350> mascara<00:01:46.799> glide<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.549> even<00:01:47.970> easier<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.600> I

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
your mascara glide on even easier and I

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780 
your mascara glide on even easier and I
think<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.409> both<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.829> these<00:01:50.100> are<00:01:50.159> exactly

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
think that both of these are exactly

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.050 
think that both of these are exactly
that<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.220> kind<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.520> plumps

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that they this one just kind of plumps

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270 
that they this one just kind of plumps
up<00:01:54.180> your<00:01:54.329> lashes<00:01:54.680> elongates<00:01:55.680> them<00:01:55.890> makes<00:01:56.189> them

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
up your lashes elongates them makes them

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.580 
up your lashes elongates them makes them
very<00:01:56.610> very<00:01:56.850> thick<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
very very thick and then it just kind of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.499 
very very thick and then it just kind of
helps<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> Urban<00:01:59.189> Decay<00:01:59.280> perversion<00:01:59.640> go<00:02:00.270> on

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
helps the Urban Decay perversion go on

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.719 
helps the Urban Decay perversion go on
even<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.460> like<00:02:02.460> thicker<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:04.170> awesome

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
even more like thicker and just awesome

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.819 
even more like thicker and just awesome
so<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> love<00:02:06.240> love<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.840> combination<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.590> both

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
so I love love the combination of both

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.680 
so I love love the combination of both
of<00:02:08.039> these<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.239> gave<00:02:09.479> my

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
of these in the look that really gave my

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990 
of these in the look that really gave my
lashes<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:11.250> can't

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
lashes I can't

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.240 
lashes I can't
really<00:02:12.300> complain<00:02:12.630> about<00:02:12.750> anything<00:02:13.250> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
really complain about anything the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.220 
really complain about anything the
perversion<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.210> little<00:02:15.540> bit<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.810> wet

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
perversion is a little bit of a wet

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.470 
perversion is a little bit of a wet
formula<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.850> be<00:02:17.970> careful<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:18.390> you

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
formula so you have to be careful if you

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.940 
formula so you have to be careful if you
really<00:02:18.720> don't<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:18.990> what<00:02:19.260> formulas<00:02:19.740> but<00:02:19.920> I

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
really don't like what formulas but I

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.770 
really don't like what formulas but I
think<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.310> will<00:02:20.460> just<00:02:21.030> get<00:02:21.180> better<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.750> more

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
think it will just get better the more

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.690 
think it will just get better the more
it<00:02:22.110> keeps<00:02:22.350> drying<00:02:22.740> out<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> more<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.400> keep

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
it keeps drying out and the more I keep

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.460 
it keeps drying out and the more I keep
using<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:25.050> being<00:02:25.380> said<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.810> third<00:02:28.200> day

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
using it that being said I the third day

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.340 
using it that being said I the third day
I<00:02:28.500> tried<00:02:29.100> just<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.000> subversion<00:02:30.690> with<00:02:31.170> my

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
I tried just the subversion with my

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.440 
I tried just the subversion with my
drugstore<00:02:31.710> mascaras<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.150> wanted<00:02:33.390> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
drugstore mascaras because I wanted to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.390 
drugstore mascaras because I wanted to
see<00:02:33.750> how<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.500> primer<00:02:34.740> would<00:02:34.950> work<00:02:35.190> with

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
see how this primer would work with

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.870 
see how this primer would work with
other<00:02:35.760> mascaras<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.130> say<00:02:38.280> sadly

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
other mascaras and I have to say sadly

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.270 
other mascaras and I have to say sadly
it<00:02:39.150> didn't<00:02:39.600> work<00:02:39.810> as<00:02:40.020> well<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.860> did<00:02:41.070> with

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
it didn't work as well as it did with

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.970 
it didn't work as well as it did with
the<00:02:41.430> perversion<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.500> kind<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.740> really

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the perversion it just kind of really

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.970 
the perversion it just kind of really
didn't<00:02:44.220> really<00:02:44.430> help<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.700> much<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.440> that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
didn't really help that much so that

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.770 
didn't really help that much so that
kind<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.250> really<00:02:47.400> sucked<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:48.060> didn't<00:02:48.570> get<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
kind of really sucked I didn't get the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.170 
kind of really sucked I didn't get the
effect<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.230> wanted<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.770> then<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.820> fourth

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
effect that I wanted and then the fourth

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.480 
effect that I wanted and then the fourth
day<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.660> tried<00:02:52.020> out<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.350> perversion<00:02:52.890> by<00:02:53.040> itself

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
day I tried out the perversion by itself

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.180 
day I tried out the perversion by itself
and<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.600> wasn't<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:54.990> impressed<00:02:55.140> by<00:02:55.800> itself

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
and I wasn't that impressed by itself

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.790 
and I wasn't that impressed by itself
either<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.910> think<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:57.780> very<00:02:57.990> similar<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
either I think that it's very similar to

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.250 
either I think that it's very similar to
the<00:02:59.580> scandalized<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.750> scandal<00:03:01.140> eyes<00:03:01.230> a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
the scandalized the scandal eyes a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.050 
the scandalized the scandal eyes a
little<00:03:01.680> bit<00:03:01.800> more<00:03:01.890> drier<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:02.850> little

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
little bit more drier this is a little

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.560 
little bit more drier this is a little
bit<00:03:03.150> more<00:03:03.300> thicker<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.709> wetter<00:03:05.040> but<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.150> think

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
bit more thicker and wetter but I think

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.540 
bit more thicker and wetter but I think
that<00:03:06.750> overall<00:03:07.320> if<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.800> was<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.100> buy<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.280> by

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
that overall if I was to buy this by

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.910 
that overall if I was to buy this by
itself<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.150> could<00:03:09.209> achieve<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:10.260> same<00:03:10.530> kind<00:03:10.770> of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
itself I could achieve the same kind of

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.980 
itself I could achieve the same kind of
lashes<00:03:11.130> using<00:03:12.120> various<00:03:12.510> ones<00:03:12.690> from<00:03:12.930> my

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
lashes using various ones from my

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.960 
lashes using various ones from my
drugstore<00:03:13.320> combining<00:03:14.190> them<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.370> just

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
drugstore combining them and just

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.479 
drugstore combining them and just
thickening<00:03:15.360> up<00:03:15.510> my<00:03:15.690> lashes<00:03:16.140> like<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.830> always<00:03:17.070> do

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
thickening up my lashes like I always do

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.470 
thickening up my lashes like I always do
so<00:03:18.410> that<00:03:19.410> was<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.980> con<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.610> just<00:03:20.940> buying<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.300> by

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
so that was a con of just buying this by

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.210 
so that was a con of just buying this by
itself<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.880> what<00:03:23.880> really<00:03:24.870> irks<00:03:25.410> me<00:03:25.739> about<00:03:25.980> this

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
itself so what really irks me about this

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.580 
itself so what really irks me about this

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
is that they sold both of these together

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.400 
is that they sold both of these together
for<00:03:28.980> $22<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.150> was<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.780> wow<00:03:31.140> this

for $22 and I was like wow this
combination<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.220> awesome<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:33.239> then<00:03:33.420> when<00:03:33.600> I

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630

gives<00:07:33.500> more<00:07:33.800> fullness<00:07:34.159> but<00:07:34.669> this<00:07:35.539> one<00:07:35.810> I

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 
gives more fullness but this one I

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.300 
gives more fullness but this one I
always<00:07:36.080> paired<00:07:36.469> with<00:07:36.620> a<00:07:36.680> few<00:07:37.069> other

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310 
always paired with a few other

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.950 
always paired with a few other
drugstores<00:07:37.940> just<00:07:38.180> to<00:07:38.270> give<00:07:38.389> it<00:07:38.419> that<00:07:38.509> extra

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 
drugstores just to give it that extra

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.950 
drugstores just to give it that extra
oomph<00:07:39.199> but<00:07:40.130> this<00:07:40.639> I<00:07:40.909> would<00:07:41.150> say<00:07:41.360> is<00:07:41.389> a<00:07:41.719> good

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
oomph but this I would say is a good

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.070 
oomph but this I would say is a good
dupe<00:07:42.289> for<00:07:42.590> this<00:07:43.130> it's<00:07:43.520> not<00:07:43.610> exactly<00:07:44.330> the<00:07:44.719> same

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 
dupe for this it's not exactly the same

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.469 
dupe for this it's not exactly the same
but<00:07:45.409> it's<00:07:45.560> very<00:07:45.889> similar<00:07:46.310> and<00:07:46.580> it<00:07:46.669> gives<00:07:46.909> more

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:47.479 
but it's very similar and it gives more

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:49.600 
but it's very similar and it gives more
of<00:07:47.539> a<00:07:47.750> similar<00:07:48.169> effect<00:07:48.560> and<00:07:48.830> this<00:07:49.340> is<00:07:49.520> only

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.610 
of a similar effect and this is only

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.969 
of a similar effect and this is only
about<00:07:49.819> 14<00:07:50.360> dollars<00:07:50.630> at<00:07:50.840> the<00:07:51.050> drugstore<00:07:51.770> so

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:51.979 
about 14 dollars at the drugstore so

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:53.950 
about 14 dollars at the drugstore so
