exercise not only helps your heart it

to<00:00:50.820> making<00:00:51.149> memories<00:00:51.530> but<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.890> all

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
to making memories but that's not all

physical<00:00:54.600> exercise<00:00:55.350> generates<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.280> chemical

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
physical exercise generates a chemical

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.200 
physical exercise generates a chemical
called<00:00:57.149> BDNF<00:00:58.430> brain-derived<00:00:59.430> neurotrophic

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.869 
called BDNF brain-derived neurotrophic
factor<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:01.559> acts<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.859> fertiliser<00:01:02.609> for

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
factor which acts like fertiliser for

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
factor which acts like fertiliser for
the<00:01:03.059> brain<00:01:03.379> encouraging<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> growth<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the brain encouraging the growth of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.530 
the brain encouraging the growth of
neural<00:01:05.250> connections<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> new<00:01:06.270> brain<00:01:06.510> cells

neural connections and new brain cells

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.500 
neural connections and new brain cells
so<00:01:10.040> obviously<00:01:11.040> staying<00:01:11.310> active<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.909> important

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so obviously staying active is important

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.800 
so obviously staying active is important
but<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.890> physically<00:01:14.490> active<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.570> need

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
but not just physically active we need

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.410 
but not just physically active we need
to<00:01:15.960> keep<00:01:16.110> socially<00:01:16.740> active<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.189> well

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
to keep socially active as well

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.660 
to keep socially active as well
especially<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.049> get<00:01:19.170> older<00:01:19.670> because

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
especially as you get older because

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.520 
especially as you get older because
there's<00:01:20.850> growing<00:01:21.060> evidence<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.810> suggest<00:01:21.990> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
there's growing evidence to suggest that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
there's growing evidence to suggest that
people<00:01:22.770> who<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.310> avoid<00:01:23.580> getting<00:01:24.000> lonely

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
people who can avoid getting lonely

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.130 
people who can avoid getting lonely
reduce<00:01:25.229> their<00:01:25.500> risk<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.950> cognitive<00:01:26.280> decline

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
reduce their risk of cognitive decline

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.680 
reduce their risk of cognitive decline
something<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.470> agree<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> good<00:01:29.250> thing

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.790 

but<00:01:32.690> there's<00:01:32.870> one<00:01:33.020> last<00:01:33.200> thing<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.590> need<00:01:33.770> to

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
but there's one last thing you need to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.850 
but there's one last thing you need to
do<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.280> keep<00:01:34.400> your<00:01:34.580> brain<00:01:34.700> healthy<00:01:35.680> keep<00:01:36.680> it

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
do to keep your brain healthy keep it

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.050 
do to keep your brain healthy keep it
active<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.860> no<00:01:40.040> particular<00:01:40.190> order<00:01:40.520> here

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
active so in no particular order here

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.180 
active so in no particular order here
are<00:01:41.690> three<00:01:41.960> top<00:01:42.200> ways<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.680> keep<00:01:42.830> your<00:01:43.010> brain

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
are three top ways to keep your brain

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.620 
are three top ways to keep your brain
stimulated<00:01:45.010> number<00:01:46.010> one<00:01:46.210> challenge<00:01:47.210> yourself

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
stimulated number one challenge yourself

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.660 
stimulated number one challenge yourself
the<00:01:48.290> satisfaction<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:49.070> get<00:01:49.280> from<00:01:49.520> doing

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
the satisfaction you get from doing

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.640 
the satisfaction you get from doing
things<00:01:49.910> slightly<00:01:50.660> beyond<00:01:50.930> your<00:01:51.110> comfort<00:01:51.290> zone

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
things slightly beyond your comfort zone

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.440 
things slightly beyond your comfort zone
actually<00:01:52.190> changes<00:01:52.820> your<00:01:52.850> brain<00:01:53.060> chemistry

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
actually changes your brain chemistry

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.410 
actually changes your brain chemistry
making<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.290> feel<00:01:54.590> more<00:01:54.860> positive<00:01:55.520> number<00:01:56.210> two

making you feel more positive number two

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.900 
making you feel more positive number two
change<00:01:57.110> yourself<00:01:57.500> novelty<00:01:58.310> helps<00:01:58.640> your<00:01:58.790> brain

change yourself novelty helps your brain

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.110 
change yourself novelty helps your brain
so<00:01:59.540> it's<00:01:59.930> good<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.290> experience<00:02:00.320> new<00:02:00.980> things

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
so it's good to experience new things

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.790 
so it's good to experience new things
take<00:02:02.120> on<00:02:02.270> new<00:02:02.510> situations<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:03.500> meet<00:02:03.770> new

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
people and number three learn something

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.150 
people and number three learn something
new<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.810> encourages<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.619> growth<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.830> new

new this encourages the growth of new
brain<00:02:10.399> cells<00:02:10.460> and<00:02:11.030> stimulates<00:02:11.810> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
brain cells and stimulates the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.950 
brain cells and stimulates the
connections<00:02:12.440> between<00:02:12.620> them<00:02:13.630> which<00:02:14.630> has<00:02:14.810> its
