I<00:00:14.139> know<00:00:15.139> today<00:00:15.379> wasn't<00:00:15.589> about<00:00:15.830> comfort<00:00:16.280> that<00:00:16.520> I

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
I know today wasn't about comfort that I

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.280 
I know today wasn't about comfort that I
was<00:00:16.760> about<00:00:16.970> performance<00:00:17.540> but<00:00:17.900> tell<00:00:18.080> me<00:00:18.170> just

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
was about performance but tell me just

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.540 
was about performance but tell me just
did<00:00:18.500> you<00:00:18.590> how<00:00:18.770> did<00:00:18.800> you<00:00:18.950> get<00:00:19.100> a<00:00:19.130> feel<00:00:19.340> for<00:00:19.370> the

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
did you how did you get a feel for the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.040 
did you how did you get a feel for the
comfort<00:00:19.940> the<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.390> ride<00:00:20.570> of<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:20.840> tire<00:00:21.020> a

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
comfort the the ride of the tire a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.020 
comfort the the ride of the tire a
little<00:00:21.440> bit<00:00:21.560> about<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.830> noise<00:00:21.980> and<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:22.460> noise

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.030 
little bit about the noise and the noise

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.480 
little bit about the noise and the noise
generation<00:00:23.540> of<00:00:23.780> the<00:00:23.840> tire<00:00:24.050> yeah<00:00:24.620> it<00:00:24.980> was

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
generation of the tire yeah it was

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.130 
generation of the tire yeah it was
surprising<00:00:26.030> him<00:00:26.150> it<00:00:26.360> wasn't<00:00:26.630> squealing<00:00:27.050> as

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
surprising him it wasn't squealing as

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.000 
surprising him it wasn't squealing as
much<00:00:27.290> as<00:00:27.410> I<00:00:27.500> thought<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.770> would<00:00:27.860> have<00:00:27.950> been

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
much as I thought it would have been

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.040 
much as I thought it would have been
through<00:00:28.460> through<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:28.940> slalom<00:00:29.270> course<00:00:29.660> and

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
through through the slalom course and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.679 
through through the slalom course and
through<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.290> skid<00:00:30.530> pan<00:00:31.029> but<00:00:32.029> even<00:00:32.329> just<00:00:32.540> you

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
through the skid pan but even just you

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.849 
through the skid pan but even just you
know<00:00:32.719> as<00:00:32.840> people<00:00:33.079> were<00:00:33.140> driving<00:00:33.469> around<00:00:33.559> as

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:33.859 
know as people were driving around as

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.740 
know as people were driving around as
you<00:00:33.949> can<00:00:34.100> hear<00:00:34.219> them<00:00:34.339> now<00:00:34.370> it<00:00:34.670> just<00:00:34.699> seems<00:00:35.030> like

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
you can hear them now it just seems like

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.229 
you can hear them now it just seems like
a<00:00:35.809> bit<00:00:36.019> of<00:00:36.079> a<00:00:36.140> quieter<00:00:36.530> tire<00:00:36.769> than<00:00:37.160> usual<00:00:37.550> again

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
a bit of a quieter tire than usual again

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.549 
a bit of a quieter tire than usual again
we're<00:00:38.539> talking<00:00:38.660> about<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:38.899> performance<00:00:39.289> style

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
we're talking about a performance style

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.819 
we're talking about a performance style
which<00:00:39.710> is<00:00:39.859> a<00:00:39.969> inherently<00:00:40.969> layout<00:00:41.449> and<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:42.589> is

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
which is a inherently layout and this is

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.369 
which is a inherently layout and this is
certainly<00:00:43.429> an<00:00:43.579> improvement<00:00:43.820> on<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.199> yet

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
certainly an improvement on that and yet

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.399 
certainly an improvement on that and yet
very<00:00:45.410> comfortable<00:00:45.620> tire<00:00:46.839> yeah<00:00:47.839> and<00:00:48.109> you<00:00:48.260> can

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
very comfortable tire yeah and you can

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.470 
very comfortable tire yeah and you can
feel<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.769> it's<00:00:48.949> it's<00:00:49.519> it's<00:00:49.940> very<00:00:49.999> read

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
feel that it's it's it's very read

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.970 
feel that it's it's it's very read
well-rounded<00:00:51.079> for<00:00:51.230> a<00:00:51.260> sports<00:00:51.499> toy<00:00:51.679> another

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
well-rounded for a sports toy another

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.860 
well-rounded for a sports toy another
and<00:00:52.609> just<00:00:52.819> focused<00:00:53.149> on<00:00:53.269> one<00:00:53.420> area<00:00:53.600> it's

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
and just focused on one area it's

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.270 
and just focused on one area it's
something<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:54.289> could<00:00:54.409> draw<00:00:54.920> on<00:00:54.949> every

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
something that you could draw on every

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.220 
something that you could draw on every
day<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:55.579> not<00:00:55.670> be<00:00:55.789> annoyed<00:00:55.940> with<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:56.390> tell<00:00:57.140> me

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
day and not be annoyed with so tell me

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.569 
day and not be annoyed with so tell me
how<00:00:57.350> did<00:00:57.409> you<00:00:57.530> find<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:57.980> breaking<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.429> wit

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
how did you find the breaking the wit

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.880 
how did you find the breaking the wit
breaking<00:00:58.909> yeah<00:00:59.329> yeah<00:00:59.929> under<00:01:00.199> under<00:01:00.469> brakes<00:01:00.679> it

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
breaking yeah yeah under under brakes it

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.860 
breaking yeah yeah under under brakes it
was<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.339> was<00:01:01.460> working<00:01:02.030> quite<00:01:02.210> well<00:01:02.269> I<00:01:02.569> was

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
was it was working quite well I was

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.939 
was it was working quite well I was
using<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.140> hand<00:01:03.289> brake<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.469> bit<00:01:03.559> more<00:01:03.769> than<00:01:03.859> the

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
using the hand brake a bit more than the

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.490 
using the hand brake a bit more than the
fall<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:04.280> all<00:01:04.400> great<00:01:04.640> rhythm<00:01:05.140> yeah<00:01:06.140> but<00:01:06.320> under

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
fall and all great rhythm yeah but under

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.990 
fall and all great rhythm yeah but under
brakes<00:01:06.710> they're<00:01:06.890> not<00:01:07.100> very<00:01:07.280> good<00:01:07.370> into<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
brakes they're not very good into the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.340 
brakes they're not very good into the
you<00:01:08.300> know<00:01:08.390> we're<00:01:08.630> stopping<00:01:08.960> into<00:01:09.080> that<00:01:09.320> uh

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
you know we're stopping into that uh

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.250 
you know we're stopping into that uh
what<00:01:10.250> we<00:01:10.340> call<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.550> garage<00:01:10.730> and<00:01:11.180> yeah<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.170> was

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
what we call a garage and yeah it was

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.740 
what we call a garage and yeah it was
very<00:01:12.320> easy<00:01:12.650> very<00:01:12.740> predictable<00:01:13.250> yeah<00:01:14.210> good

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
very easy very predictable yeah good

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.120 
very easy very predictable yeah good
turning<00:01:15.080> good<00:01:15.350> turning<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.800> draw<00:01:15.950> as<00:01:16.010> well

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
turning good turning in the draw as well

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.860 
turning good turning in the draw as well
yeah<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:16.640> good<00:01:16.850> turn<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.240> surprisingly<00:01:17.840> good

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
yeah a good turn in surprisingly good

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.120 
yeah a good turn in surprisingly good
you<00:01:18.140> sort<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.380> realized<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:18.830> there's<00:01:18.980> a<00:01:19.010> bit

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
you sort of realized that there's a bit

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.130 
you sort of realized that there's a bit
more<00:01:19.280> there<00:01:19.430> than<00:01:19.460> your<00:01:19.760> first<00:01:19.940> thought<00:01:20.150> and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
more there than your first thought and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.230 
more there than your first thought and
yeah<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.190> I<00:01:22.310> said<00:01:22.460> very<00:01:22.700> predictable<00:01:23.030> that's

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
yeah like I said very predictable that's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.030 
yeah like I said very predictable that's
a<00:01:23.330> very<00:01:23.540> poor<00:01:23.720> twenty<00:01:23.960> turning<00:01:24.260> in<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.500> so

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
a very poor twenty turning in you so

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.800 
a very poor twenty turning in you so
don't<00:01:25.250> feel<00:01:25.490> like<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.850> not<00:01:26.420> sure<00:01:26.630> what's

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
don't feel like you not sure what's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.940 
don't feel like you not sure what's
gonna<00:01:26.870> happen<00:01:27.200> if<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.380> give<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.620> more<00:01:27.740> you're

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
gonna happen if you give it more you're

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.730 
gonna happen if you give it more you're
very<00:01:28.490> easy<00:01:29.180> to<00:01:29.450> find<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.960> finder<00:01:30.470> line

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.800 

all<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.830> impressions<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.460> GT<00:01:34.820> today<00:01:35.120> are<00:01:35.420> very

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
all the impressions of GT today are very

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.300 
all the impressions of GT today are very
good<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.050> couldn't<00:01:36.410> believe<00:01:36.560> how<00:01:36.830> they<00:01:37.040> stuck

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
good I couldn't believe how they stuck

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.670 
good I couldn't believe how they stuck
to<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.490> road<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:37.850> well<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.390> was<00:01:38.570> incredible<00:01:39.440> it

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
to the road so well it was incredible it

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.650 
to the road so well it was incredible it
really<00:01:39.830> was<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.310> quite<00:01:40.760> a<00:01:40.790> surprise<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:41.480> it<00:01:41.540> was

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
really was a quite a surprise so it was

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.990 
really was a quite a surprise so it was
very<00:01:42.260> very<00:01:42.470> very<00:01:43.370> good
