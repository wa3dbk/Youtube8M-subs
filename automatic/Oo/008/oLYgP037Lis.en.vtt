00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.230
 and 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.330
 hello girls are my name as if Chinese 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.300
 It's difficult for me, but I do not know 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.170
 worry I hope you get used to this look 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.970
 that I recorded is at night or it can be 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.980
 for a cocktail or for what you 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.009
 want I'll leave you two options 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.250
 lip so keep looking now 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.529
 I am using a first of eyes 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.649
 before placing our shadow so that 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.520
 I can paint better now I'm going to add 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:37.670
 a shadow of white color or perlite 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.559
 for the success of our eyebrow so that 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.429
 can light up a little more our 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.399
 we are going to add a color 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:48.859
 brown light a canillita in all the 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.489
 basin to make it a color of 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.489
 transition 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.650
 and then we're going to add this jumbo 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.790
 knicks 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.980
 what is the golden color goal 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.770
 and we are going to put it in all our 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.130
 eyelid and then we are going to blur it very 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.120
 very well to then seal it with a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.909
 shadow of golden color 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.570
 no no 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.570
 d 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.100
 from this we are going to grab a color 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.560
 darker brown and let's put it in 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 the whole basin so that a little more of 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.450
 depth and can be seen in a look 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.509
 a little more open 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.509
 and 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.909
 d 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.720
 or not 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.830
 Y 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.500
 Now what we are going to do is line 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.270
 with our course the same as we have 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.790
 used as a primer for our 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.220
 golden shade in all the part of the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.100
 delineated from inside a part of the video 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.990
 down 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.660
 and we are going to put the same shadow that 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.720
 we have put 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.880
 on the eyelid I'm now checking my 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.950
 eyelashes as you see I put tabs 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.020
 fake because if not the look is going to 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.440
 see a little more dead and what I want 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.440
 is that 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.640
 being is to put a little shadow just 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.070
 in the bottom corner of our game 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.830
 a brown color so that the tear 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.960
 highlight because we have put a gold and 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.960
 have a little more elegance 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.280
 the final look of our eyes that 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.280
 I seem to like it 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.180
 Now I told them I was going to be two 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.600
 lip options so this is the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.390
 first the first one is a red one red 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.790
 I've used live now, I'm using a 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.040
 eyeliner there is no ex and I will use 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.040
 the labial of strike also 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:06.830
 now in the second is a color and not a 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.650
 purple is a purple with a wine 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.240
 the weird medium because in the camera I do not know 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:18.590
 see in that way how is it now what 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.739
 I have to it is a little bit darker than how 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.900
 it looks in the camera but I still like it 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.840
 I think the difference is super great 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.060
 between this and the other is that this is a 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.060
 labial close that is one of Milan 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.340
 it seems to me that pigment very well 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.050
 I'm super shaken because I do not 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.090
 I imagined that this and lucid to try 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.009
 that way but I really love them 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.370
 the results and that is how I have been 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:05:10.650
 I love this this makeup 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:13.690
 I still find it super nice 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.039
 subscribe be commented I love to know 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.039
 what do they think
