00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
break the toy but you're not his head

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.450 
break the toy but you're not his head
eventually<00:03:14.550> does<00:03:14.730> pop<00:03:15.030> off<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:16.280> then<00:03:17.280> when

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
eventually does pop off and then when

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.760 
eventually does pop off and then when
you<00:03:17.550> go<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.790> stick<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.270> new<00:03:18.420> head<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.810> you'll

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
you go to stick the new head on you'll

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.200 
you go to stick the new head on you'll
have<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.100> same<00:03:20.280> issue<00:03:20.490> basically<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.120> have

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
have the same issue basically you have

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.640 
have the same issue basically you have
to<00:03:21.270> apply<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.570> lot<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.900> pressure<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.410> get<00:03:22.530> it

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
to apply a lot of pressure to get it

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.700 
to apply a lot of pressure to get it
back<00:03:22.770> on<00:03:23.150> here<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.780> close-up<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> other

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
back on here is a close-up on the other

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:38.410 
back on here is a close-up on the other
head

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.880 

sticks<00:03:39.290> on<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:41.230> now<00:03:42.230> there<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:42.620> not<00:03:42.860> a

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
sticks on like that now there is not a

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.620 
sticks on like that now there is not a
lot<00:03:43.130> of<00:03:43.160> articulation<00:03:43.910> in<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.150> neck<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
lot of articulation in the neck and the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.510 
lot of articulation in the neck and the
reason<00:03:44.959> being<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.440> partly<00:03:45.950> because<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.459> the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
reason being is partly because of the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.309 
reason being is partly because of the
scarf<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.060> also<00:03:47.360> he<00:03:48.020> had<00:03:48.140> too<00:03:48.290> much

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
scarf and also he had too much

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.110 
scarf and also he had too much
articulation<00:03:48.709> in<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.280> head<00:03:49.459> his<00:03:49.760> head<00:03:49.970> would

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
articulation in the head his head would

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.970 
articulation in the head his head would
probably<00:03:50.660> fall<00:03:50.930> off<00:03:50.989> too<00:03:51.410> easily<00:03:51.620> and

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
probably fall off too easily and

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.360 
probably fall off too easily and
obviously<00:03:52.310> that's<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:52.819> bad<00:03:53.000> thing<00:03:53.860> now<00:03:54.860> time<00:03:55.190> to

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
obviously that's a bad thing now time to

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.390 
obviously that's a bad thing now time to
