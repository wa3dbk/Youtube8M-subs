00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.129
 she practices approached the ability to 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.840
 ability with the machine is then 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 people also do the training with 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.000
 load handling operator proposes the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.189
 student is aware that with the movement to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.710
 safety is positioning 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.600
 of the instrumentations that garfou torre

 the beginning operator receives around 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.170
 one thousand two hundred reais 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.869
 already a more experienced professional arrives 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.299
 to earn up to three minimum wages 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.240
 the risks are greater in relation to 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.619
 handling of high loads he 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.229
 there are several risks there 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.549
 during the activity as it Campinas 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.720
 for example collision it has to be 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.110
 well-kept shelves for the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.490
 Cargo handling the matter 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.439
 attention with the pds within the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.759
 undertaking which is also at risk of 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.369
 run over 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.430
 it is a machine that moves it then 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.130
 have and are very risky and develop 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.290
 an accident to trample trampling 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.299
 and collisions even the tipping otherwise 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.579
 follow safety procedures there 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.829
 the demand is not only for men the 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.700
 women are also interested in the 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.549
 profession 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.399
 Julian is an example aroused 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.550
 interest in the profession for working 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.300
 in companies and I do not find the course difficult 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.760
 I opted for this option 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.650
 because I worked for companies that 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.810
 have eight employers, including 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.330
 I have friends who are women and who 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.810
 operates a forklift truck and I've always had 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.680
 curiosity says of knowing how it was and 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.530
 Then came the course I came to do the course 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.300
 to enter this area also has a 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.940
 opportunity of a company 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.980
 already ronaldo was unemployed and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.650
 got a scholarship 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.440
 found the course very 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.560
 good for anyone who wants to join this area 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.990
 is great have to have the right course 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.200
 have to have the course to act launched 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.580
 after informing Rafael that he intends to work in 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.800
 other states 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.090
 I'm thinking of leaving the park. 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.670
 Which deposit can I think is a 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.810
 A little bit harder, I'm thinking of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.420
 leave town 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.850
 according to the teacher the market of 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.760
 favorable to the operator. 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.040
 forklift trucks mainly for 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.650
 trained professionals who have 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.240
 enough agility and speed 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.310
 the market for forklift operator 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.430
 very promising right? 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.500
 companies today require that at least the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.860
 operator has category b 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.510
 it is for him to operate is what he has to 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.730
 having a sense of ability has to have 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.930
 notions of direction of the machine to buy 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.310
 be to drive 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.780
 besides other questions that are 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.190
 addressed in the extension course of 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.470
 accidents prevention 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.209
 the caution of the operator who is 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.940
 very important for the operation of the 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.640
 machine and its own movement 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.070
 this forklift operator already operates 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.890
 six years in the area chose the profession 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.989
 For always liking machines. 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.140
 currently he works in a supermarket 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.020
 in the center of the city in a 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.000
 seven hours a day for him the good 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.080
 has to meet qualities 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.050
 how patience, attention and respect is the 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.230
 care and attention not slow at first 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.680
 because until you get the practice and 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.630
 ability to handle is complicated 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.769
 there are lots of practice a lot of patience 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.240
 Look out, people have a little 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.220
 experienced a little faster but 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.220
 at the beginning instead of worth
