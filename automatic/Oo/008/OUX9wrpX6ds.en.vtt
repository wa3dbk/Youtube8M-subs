audience we could say we understood was

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.430 
audience we could say we understood was
ourselves<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.510> went<00:02:39.660> back<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.810> basics<00:02:40.290> we

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
ourselves so we went back to basics we

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.390 
ourselves so we went back to basics we
tried<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.739> think<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.890> something<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.220> we

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
tried to think of something that we

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.580 
tried to think of something that we
ourselves<00:02:41.810> needed<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.930> wanted<00:02:43.019> there

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
ourselves needed and wanted there

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
problem that we needed solving and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.949 
problem that we needed solving and
there's<00:02:48.180> where<00:02:48.269> smoothies<00:02:48.630> came<00:02:48.810> from

benefits of healthy eating and it's just

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.979 
benefits of healthy eating and it's just
quite<00:03:02.819> difficult<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.329> do<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.690> there's

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
quite difficult to do it there's

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.170 
quite difficult to do it there's
something<00:03:04.230> about<00:03:04.410> modern<00:03:04.650> life<00:03:04.769> that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
something about modern life that

conspires against people being healthy
so<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:09.180> was<00:03:09.480> where<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.319> where<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> idea

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
so that was where the where the idea

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.379 
so that was where the where the idea
came<00:03:10.950> from<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.340> wanted<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.730> solve<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.150> little

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
came from we wanted to solve that little

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.539 
came from we wanted to solve that little
riddle<00:03:12.540> we<00:03:12.900> wanted<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.350> make<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:13.980> easy<00:03:14.280> for

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549
