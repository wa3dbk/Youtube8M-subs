00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.270
 but basically i think that's good 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.030
 generally speaking one should use this one 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.259
 type of 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.619
 for good reason lpu stands therefore all the same we 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.900
 let him please mts ate 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.519
 I copy designs 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.900
 and imagine 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.330
 directly to where it should be 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.439
 compiled by 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560
 on his legal 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.300
 and Egypt down 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.659
 I close much here 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:29.960
 this type 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.470
 keeping the changes opponents will see 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.680
 how did it affect payment 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.560
 climate 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.510
 refreshing the page need nothing 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.940
 changed but still need it 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.090
 use because you never know what is there 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.769
 will be further such 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.629
 you will want the item used so 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:45.069
 way 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:47.189
 will look like if i don't 

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:48.420
 put 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.240
 what else is there a connection to the stands 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.380
 but here that is it is wonderful that 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.130
 something like blocks with rounded corners 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.450
 who are very fond of using designers 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.270
 whether I like them very much because 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.460
 what do they look like 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.340
 from the shops friendly 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.650
 this way the data is formed 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.680
 hollow they are formed with the help of Greece 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 now we will see 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.430
 how do they work 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.480
 again i choose the quick tool 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.690
 access to the elements pale over the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.770
 appropriate or not 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.450
 here and if we pay attention to 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.190
 Well, this type of which actually 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.920
 this element is formed 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.650
 and its exterior decor 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.100
 you see here 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.190
 seven 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.330
 so here it is seven if yayu changed 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.300
 squad ten 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.000
 attention to this corner 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.160
 and I will now change semen cool 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 ten 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.970
 for example, I put in 10 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.130
 that is, in this way just making 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.630
 corresponding changes 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.290
 class 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.260
 corresponding to such a figure who are you 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.940
 can change rounding 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.450
 What for in power shaft with father creators 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.120
 but this issue is repaired 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.690
 he I knew it for a reason from 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.110
 experimenting cars read 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.960
 corresponding section 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960
 Help on the official website 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.699
 this incident 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.039
 as you remember that 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.889
 format allows this way 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:17.949
 live 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.319
 throw out a mini skirt on May 3rd structure and 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.209
 see her right there on the page itself 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.049
 thus the change affects 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.099
 appearance but making some changes 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.099
 should them 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.549
 m then be sure to enter quotas on 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.589
 export 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:33.929
 so oh well in principle Ariana I 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:34.769
 I think that with the rest 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.459
 the elements you figure it out so 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.629
 in the way they are made up here all very 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.369
 It seems that this is basically 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.419
 what I'll tell you a little drum 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.629
 buying avoda 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.140
 Hasis tremor content 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.639
 copy the appropriate block 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.679
 trying not to break the structure and 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.929
 Pov platov insert 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.619
 so let's see what we have here for this 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.729
 third phase what's in it in 3d 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.089
 I opened it a percentage of drove parking that 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.349
 he is a set 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.979
 such from various clubs 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.539
 here you can see how 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:08.829
 how to work with these groups 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.419
 rounded corners both surrender and width and 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.079
 heights and so on the same with the help in 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.899
 airport 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.719
 well i download this
