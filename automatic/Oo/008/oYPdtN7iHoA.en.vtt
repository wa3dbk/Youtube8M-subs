which is a rare unknown d and then

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:39.030 
which is a rare unknown d and then
unknown<00:02:31.330> em<00:02:36.330> next<00:02:37.330> one<00:02:37.630> one<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.560> says<00:02:38.769> to

okay<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:52.870> there's<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.310> Cacturne<00:02:54.310> which<00:02:54.730> isn't

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
okay so there's a Cacturne which isn't

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.209 
okay so there's a Cacturne which isn't
uncommon<00:02:55.530> then<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.650> other<00:02:56.799> one<00:02:56.889> is<00:02:57.189> a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:57.219 
uncommon then the other one is a

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
fortress which is a reverse holo rare a

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.470 
fortress which is a reverse holo rare a
nice<00:03:00.760> car<00:03:01.030> from<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.299> legends<00:03:01.659> awake<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.170> say

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480

sleeves<00:03:10.299> up<00:03:11.010> 3d<00:03:12.010> video<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.370> guess<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:14.170> don't

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
sleeves up 3d video I guess you don't

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.770 
sleeves up 3d video I guess you don't
even<00:03:14.409> need<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.650> glasses<00:03:15.239> well<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:16.540> there's<00:03:16.719> a

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
even need the glasses well so there's a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.789 
even need the glasses well so there's a
Pikachu<00:03:17.879> from<00:03:18.879> jungle<00:03:19.560> wonder<00:03:20.560> if<00:03:20.620> that

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
Pikachu from jungle wonder if that

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.640 
Pikachu from jungle wonder if that
marker<00:03:21.219> is<00:03:21.340> on<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.609> card<00:03:21.909> oh<00:03:22.269> just<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.469> the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
marker is on the card oh just on the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.199 
marker is on the card oh just on the
sleeve<00:03:24.219> there<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.579> thought<00:03:24.790> maybe<00:03:24.939> there's<00:03:25.120> an

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
sleeve there I thought maybe there's an

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.500 
sleeve there I thought maybe there's an
air<00:03:25.389> card<00:03:25.719> of<00:03:25.870> some<00:03:26.019> type<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:28.030> then<00:03:28.389> the<00:03:28.480> other

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
air card of some type and then the other

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.009 
air card of some type and then the other
card<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.019> Lucario<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.159> rare<00:03:30.459> card<00:03:30.900> from<00:03:31.900> the

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
card is Lucario is a rare card from the

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.000 
card is Lucario is a rare card from the
great<00:03:32.469> encounter<00:03:33.359> set<00:03:34.359> I<00:03:34.719> believe<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:36.689> believe

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
great encounter set I believe I believe

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.770 
great encounter set I believe I believe
great<00:03:39.010> encounters<00:03:39.459> probably<00:03:40.419> could<00:03:40.629> be

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
great encounters probably could be

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.970 
great encounters probably could be
diamond<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.290> pearl<00:03:41.409> though<00:03:41.590> I'm<00:03:41.650> pretty<00:03:41.709> sure

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
diamond and pearl though I'm pretty sure

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.319 
diamond and pearl though I'm pretty sure
it<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.129> diamond<00:03:42.459> pearl<00:03:42.699> now<00:03:42.849> that<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.060> look<00:03:43.209> at

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
it is diamond pearl now that I look at

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.689 
it is diamond pearl now that I look at
it<00:03:43.449> again<00:03:43.859> okay<00:03:44.859> so<00:03:44.919> there's<00:03:45.280> one<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.549> says

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
it again okay so there's one that says

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:50.189 
it again okay so there's one that says
to<00:03:45.849> open<00:03:46.090> forth<00:03:48.419> so<00:03:49.419> I'll<00:03:49.480> set<00:03:49.719> these<00:03:49.900> cards

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
to open forth so I'll set these cards

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.189 
to open forth so I'll set these cards
aside<00:03:51.060> till<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.120> get<00:03:52.269> both<00:03:52.419> of<00:03:52.569> them<00:03:52.629> out<00:03:52.810> looks

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
aside till I get both of them out looks

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.780 
aside till I get both of them out looks
like<00:03:53.349> there's<00:03:53.590> actually<00:03:54.009> three<00:03:54.040> cards<00:03:54.639> in
