rich for gloss which isn't black normal

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.230

because<00:01:22.920> most<00:01:23.160> of<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.430> red<00:01:23.610> lipsticks<00:01:24.060> are

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
because most of my red lipsticks are

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960 
because most of my red lipsticks are
actual<00:01:24.720> lipsticks<00:01:25.410> are<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.650> actually<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> like

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
love with it and one thing I would say

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210 
love with it and one thing I would say
because<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.870> lip<00:01:43.080> gloss<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.980> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
because there is a lip gloss you have to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.360 
because there is a lip gloss you have to
use<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.760> lip<00:01:45.150> liner<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.990> doesn't<00:01:46.380> bleed

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
use a lip liner so that it doesn't bleed

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.430 
use a lip liner so that it doesn't bleed
out<00:01:47.510> which<00:01:48.510> is<00:01:48.659> something<00:01:48.900> that<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.230> don't

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
out which is something that I don't

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.670 
out which is something that I don't
usually<00:01:49.800> do<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.310> lipsticks<00:01:50.760> but

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
usually do with lipsticks but

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.110 
usually do with lipsticks but
specifically<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.830> gloss<00:01:53.310> surface<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.000> would

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
specifically for gloss surface I would

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.680 
specifically for gloss surface I would
definitely<00:01:54.840> use<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:55.260> look
