00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
like that's a great idea because my big

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.660

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
strength is a mite that project ever

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.360 
strength is a mite that project ever
happened<00:02:14.410> for<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.890> something<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
desperately want or is that just sort of

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.550 
desperately want or is that just sort of
more<00:02:17.770> time<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.489> have<00:02:18.670> available<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.569> is

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
more time and you have available it is

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.300 
more time and you have available it is
more<00:02:21.370> time<00:02:21.670> than<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.180> have<00:02:22.209> available<00:02:23.200> at<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
more time than I have available at the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.500 
more time than I have available at the
moment<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:26.290> know<00:02:26.410> someday<00:02:27.040> I'll<00:02:27.850> be<00:02:27.880> able

moment so you know someday I'll be able

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.960 
moment so you know someday I'll be able
to<00:02:30.000> retire<00:02:31.000> from<00:02:31.660> television<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.709> then<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.730> can

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
to retire from television and then I can

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.880 
to retire from television and then I can
that's<00:02:34.690> at<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.080> top<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:36.160> my<00:02:37.060> list<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.890> fun

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that's at the top of my list of fun

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.830 
that's at the top of my list of fun
things<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.459> build<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.330> actually<00:02:40.660> really

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
things to build is it's actually really

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.290 
things to build is it's actually really
easy<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.560> build<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:42.130> if<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.459> can<00:02:42.519> build<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.030> have

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
easy to build like if I can build I have

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.600 
easy to build like if I can build I have
the<00:02:43.660> last<00:02:43.840> time<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.170> did<00:02:44.350> any<00:02:44.620> woodworking<00:02:44.950> I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
the last time I did any woodworking I

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.280 
the last time I did any woodworking I
was<00:02:45.910> in<00:02:46.030> junior<00:02:46.150> high<00:02:46.390> school<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:46.989> built<00:02:47.170> a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
was in junior high school and I built a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.009 
was in junior high school and I built a
chess<00:02:47.560> board<00:02:47.700> yes<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:49.150> between<00:02:49.420> then<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:49.840> now

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
chess board yes in between then and now

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.100 
chess board yes in between then and now
nothing<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.180> look<00:02:52.390> at<00:02:52.510> my<00:02:52.630> TARDIS<00:02:52.989> I'm

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
nothing and and I look at my TARDIS I'm

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.620 
nothing and and I look at my TARDIS I'm
like<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.470> was<00:02:53.590> really<00:02:54.040> good<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.150> think<00:02:55.269> one

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
like that was really good so I think one

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.539 
like that was really good so I think one
of<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.870> one<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.680> benefits<00:02:57.069> of<00:02:57.190> having<00:02:57.310> a

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
of the one of the benefits of having a

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.610 
of the one of the benefits of having a
very<00:02:57.760> forgivable<00:02:58.360> for<00:02:58.510> giving<00:02:58.900> medium<00:02:59.350> is

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
very forgivable for giving medium is

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.180 
very forgivable for giving medium is
that<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.400> don't<00:03:00.640> need<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:01.090> ton<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.920> talent<00:03:02.920> to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
that you don't need a ton of talent to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.289 
that you don't need a ton of talent to
put<00:03:03.340> something<00:03:03.610> together<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.880> think<00:03:03.940> if<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.209> was

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
put something together I think if I was

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.479 
put something together I think if I was
machining<00:03:04.900> something<00:03:05.410> yeah<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.190> might<00:03:06.340> be

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
machining something yeah it might be

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.699 
machining something yeah it might be
more<00:03:06.640> problematic<00:03:07.230> here's<00:03:08.230> another<00:03:08.290> thing

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
more problematic here's another thing

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.400 
more problematic here's another thing
about<00:03:09.180> something<00:03:10.180> like<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.510> TARDIS<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.049> that

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
about something like the TARDIS and that

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.180 
about something like the TARDIS and that
is<00:03:11.860> when<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.819> see<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.180> in<00:03:13.299> real<00:03:13.330> life<00:03:14.070> even<00:03:15.070> if

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
is when you see it in real life even if

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.670 
is when you see it in real life even if
it's<00:03:15.370> not<00:03:15.760> perfect<00:03:15.820> your<00:03:16.570> mind<00:03:16.900> makes<00:03:17.440> it

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
it's not perfect your mind makes it

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.000 
it's not perfect your mind makes it
perfect<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.250> fills<00:03:18.670> in<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.030> gaps<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.410> if

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
perfect it fills in the gaps and so if

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.170 
perfect it fills in the gaps and so if
it's<00:03:21.370> close<00:03:22.739> it's<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.920> TARDIS<00:03:24.340> yeah<00:03:24.880> you're

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
it's close it's a TARDIS yeah you're

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.430 
it's close it's a TARDIS yeah you're
absolutely<00:03:25.329> right<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.049> think<00:03:26.079> that's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
absolutely right and I think that's

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.710 
absolutely right and I think that's
something<00:03:26.680> as<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.130> as<00:03:27.700> someone<00:03:28.510> who<00:03:28.660> is

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
something as a as someone who is

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.690 
something as a as someone who is
typically<00:03:29.109> a<00:03:29.200> perfectionist<00:03:29.950> in<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.340> stuff<00:03:30.549> I

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
typically a perfectionist in the stuff I

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.550 
typically a perfectionist in the stuff I
build<00:03:30.940> yeah<00:03:31.480> which<00:03:31.690> also<00:03:31.870> hinders<00:03:32.350> me<00:03:32.530> from

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
build yeah which also hinders me from

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.099 
build yeah which also hinders me from
completing<00:03:33.010> anything<00:03:33.609> but<00:03:34.239> as<00:03:34.329> perfectionist

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
completing anything but as perfectionist

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.640 
completing anything but as perfectionist
working<00:03:35.620> with<00:03:35.769> material<00:03:36.310> like<00:03:37.320> spruce<00:03:38.320> and

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
working with material like spruce and

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.250 
working with material like spruce and
pine<00:03:38.709> or<00:03:39.340> soft<00:03:39.700> woods<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.420> know<00:03:40.510> don't<00:03:40.720> hold

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
pine or soft woods you know don't hold

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.930 
pine or soft woods you know don't hold
their<00:03:41.470> shape<00:03:41.500> very<00:03:41.890> well<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.459> took<00:03:42.670> me<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.910> very

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
their shape very well it took me a very

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.750 
their shape very well it took me a very
long<00:03:43.299> time<00:03:43.720> sorta<00:03:44.170> just<00:03:44.290> let<00:03:44.560> go<00:03:44.859> look<00:03:45.609> at

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
long time sorta just let go look at

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.849 
long time sorta just let go look at
perfectionist<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.540> like<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.109> saved<00:03:47.380> when

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
perfectionist and like you saved when

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.849 
perfectionist and like you saved when
you<00:03:47.980> see<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> things<00:03:48.609> sitting<00:03:48.880> there<00:03:49.620> no<00:03:50.620> one

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
you see the things sitting there no one

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.890 
you see the things sitting there no one
notices<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.700> seams<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.540> slats

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
notices that the seams on the slats

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.660 
notices that the seams on the slats
don't<00:03:53.260> match<00:03:53.470> perfectly<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.160> you're<00:03:54.549> just

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
don't match perfectly and you're just

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.550 
don't match perfectly and you're just
like<00:03:54.850> oh<00:03:54.970> it's<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.209> TARDIS<00:03:55.660> yeah<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.410> it's

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
like oh it's a TARDIS yeah and it's

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.400 
like oh it's a TARDIS yeah and it's
imposing<00:03:57.040> its<00:03:58.030> it's<00:03:58.480> more<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.260> know

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
imposing its it's more like you know

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.319 
imposing its it's more like you know
it's<00:03:59.739> it's<00:04:00.310> not<00:04:00.519> like<00:04:00.730> move<00:04:00.970> there's<00:04:01.209> this

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
it's it's not like move there's this

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.500 
it's it's not like move there's this
mother<00:04:01.600> oh<00:04:01.810> my<00:04:02.290> god<00:04:02.650> it's<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:03.100> TARDIS<00:04:05.010> Matt

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
mother oh my god it's a TARDIS Matt

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.530 
mother oh my god it's a TARDIS Matt
you've<00:04:07.510> got<00:04:07.829> darkness<00:04:09.090> that's<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.299> reaction

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
you've got darkness that's the reaction
