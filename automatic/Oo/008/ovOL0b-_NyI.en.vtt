passings<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.479> probably<00:01:30.840> more<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
passings are probably more of a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.840 
passings are probably more of a
sentiment<00:01:31.680> than<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> center<00:01:32.280> attacking<00:01:32.700> mid

but<00:01:33.299> should<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.570> some<00:01:33.750> very<00:01:33.990> very<00:01:34.200> solid

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
but should have some very very solid

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.980 
but should have some very very solid
stats<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> again<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> looks<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.689> rather

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
stats and again it looks like a rather

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
stats and again it looks like a rather
nice<00:01:37.229> card<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> probably<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.250> easily

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
nice card that I probably would easily

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.929 
nice card that I probably would easily

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
skills and three stoic foot I'm sure the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.300 
skills and three stoic foot I'm sure the
kind<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> place<00:02:09.660> holders<00:02:10.110> as<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.950> kind<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.220> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
kind of place holders as it's kind of a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.890 
kind of place holders as it's kind of a
default<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.849> defaults<00:02:12.300> give<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> player<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
default the defaults give a player to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.760 
default the defaults give a player to
restore<00:02:13.170> skills<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
restore skills and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
restore skills and
so<00:02:14.040> each<00:02:14.190> foot<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.640> then<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.210> can<00:02:15.330> be

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
so each foot and then they can be

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.030 
so each foot and then they can be
changed<00:02:15.690> later<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.260> think<00:02:16.680> money<00:02:16.950> will

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
changed later so I do think money will

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.130 
changed later so I do think money will
hopefully<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.700> given<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.090> star<00:02:18.330> skills<00:02:18.600> but

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
hopefully be given for star skills but

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.020 
hopefully be given for star skills but
still<00:02:19.350> even<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:20.040> he<00:02:20.130> does<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> 3some<00:02:20.760> skills

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
still even if he does a 3some skills

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.480 
still even if he does a 3some skills
does<00:02:21.270> look<00:02:21.450> credibly<00:02:22.290> nice<00:02:22.500> card<00:02:22.860> some<00:02:23.250> reason

he's a sort of striker that reminds me a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.480 
he's a sort of striker that reminds me a
bit<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.170> urethane<00:02:40.560> if<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.040> remember<00:02:41.340> using

Brazil<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.060> was<00:02:42.210> all<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.390> way<00:02:42.420> back<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.930> with<00:02:43.620> a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
Brazil so was all the way back in with a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.190 
Brazil so was all the way back in with a
fee<00:02:43.920> for<00:02:43.950> 11<00:02:44.430> i<00:02:44.490> think<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.790> was<00:02:44.910> he<00:02:45.420> has<00:02:45.540> 92<00:02:45.900> pace

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
fee for 11 i think it was he has 92 pace

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.980 
fee for 11 i think it was he has 92 pace
70<00:02:46.830> dribbling<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.370> 71<00:02:47.940> shooting<00:02:48.300> other<00:02:48.630> than

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
70 dribbling and 71 shooting other than

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.780 
70 dribbling and 71 shooting other than
that<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.170> suppose<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> 68<00:02:50.070> heading<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.430> kind<00:02:50.700> of

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
that I suppose the 68 heading is kind of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.000 
that I suppose the 68 heading is kind of
notable<00:02:51.240> as<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.630> not<00:02:51.780> too<00:02:51.990> bad<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.650> looks<00:02:52.830> like

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.340 
notable as is not too bad it looks like
he<00:02:53.130> could<00:02:53.250> be<00:02:53.310> an<00:02:53.550> incredibly<00:02:54.120> fast<00:02:54.450> very<00:02:55.050> very

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
he could be an incredibly fast very very

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.080 
he could be an incredibly fast very very
overpowered<00:02:55.920> striker<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.700> think<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:56.940> I

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
overpowered striker and I think if I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.260 
overpowered striker and I think if I
remember<00:02:57.450> he<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:58.050> around<00:02:58.470> sort<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.920> 5<00:02:59.250> for<00:02:59.430> 11<00:02:59.580> 6

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
remember he is around sort of 5 for 11 6

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.580 
remember he is around sort of 5 for 11 6
foot<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.720> he<00:03:00.750> could<00:03:01.020> be<00:03:01.200> incredibly

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
foot so he could be incredibly

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.220 
foot so he could be incredibly
overpowered<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.150> honestly<00:03:03.600> last<00:03:03.780> plane<00:03:04.110> was

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
four-star any I think he's been playing

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.890 
four-star any I think he's been playing
quite<00:03:11.280> well<00:03:11.460> for<00:03:11.670> French<00:03:12.000> under-21s<00:03:12.630> when

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
quite well for French under-21s when

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.360 
quite well for French under-21s when
he's<00:03:12.990> been<00:03:13.110> playing<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.770> think<00:03:13.950> either<00:03:14.100> I

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
he's been playing and I think either I

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.010 
he's been playing and I think either I
did<00:03:14.700> have<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.850> look<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.270> he<00:03:15.330> scored<00:03:15.630> six<00:03:15.900> goals

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
did have a look and he scored six goals

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.840 
did have a look and he scored six goals
in<00:03:16.350> eight<00:03:16.560> games<00:03:16.770> them<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.310> he<00:03:17.400> looks<00:03:17.550> like<00:03:17.700> a

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
in eight games them so he looks like a

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.120 
in eight games them so he looks like a
real<00:03:18.090> real<00:03:18.300> prospect<00:03:18.870> should<00:03:19.590> hopefully<00:03:19.800> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
real real prospect should hopefully the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.490 
real real prospect should hopefully the
same<00:03:20.370> with<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:21.090> think<00:03:21.930> it's<00:03:22.050> same<00:03:22.170> with<00:03:22.200> money

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
same with I think it's same with money

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.310 
same with I think it's same with money
should<00:03:23.010> hopefully<00:03:23.280> have<00:03:23.810> maybe<00:03:24.810> force<00:03:25.140> us

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
should hopefully have maybe force us

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.260 
should hopefully have maybe force us
going<00:03:25.680> again<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.340> do<00:03:26.520> think<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.000> lot<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.150> these

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
going again I do think a lot of these

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.430 
going again I do think a lot of these
players<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.690> Theresa<00:03:27.959> skimmers<00:03:28.410> and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
players of Theresa skimmers and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.810 
players of Theresa skimmers and
three-star<00:03:28.920> weak<00:03:29.100> foot<00:03:29.310> their<00:03:29.520> kind<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.730> a

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
three-star weak foot their kind of a

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.699 
three-star weak foot their kind of a
placeholder<00:03:30.030> they<00:03:30.810> look<00:03:31.020> like<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.350> be<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> very

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
placeholder they look like to be a very

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.620 
placeholder they look like to be a very
solid<00:03:32.040> card<00:03:32.310> not<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:32.970> best<00:03:33.060> shooting<00:03:33.450> or

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
solid card not the best shooting or

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.990 
solid card not the best shooting or
passing<00:03:34.080> which<00:03:34.200> should<00:03:34.590> hopefully<00:03:34.770> have<00:03:35.010> 87

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
passing which should hopefully have 87

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.330
