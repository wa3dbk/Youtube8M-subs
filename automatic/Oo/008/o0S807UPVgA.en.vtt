00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello to all who visit the page 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.160
 web for yourself the present video is 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.349
 dedicated to the use of the metro in 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.590
 concrete for the measurement of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.839
 resistances of appliances or 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.460
 light bulbs that are two types of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.310
 resistors that we can find 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.140
 usually in any dwelling in another 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.859
 video I will dedicate to the measure 10 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.140
 electronic resistors since in 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.480
 this field there is a lot more to explain 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.960
 therefore this will be a somewhat 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.399
 simple 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.829
 for stockings of stock 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.829
 appliances we will use the 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.530
 polymer the ohm scale we have the 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.230
 200 ohm scale at full scale 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.659
 that is to say at this point the metro 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:52.690
 will mark two houses as a maximum of 200 years 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:55.930
 2020 almost twenty thousand 20 thousand euros 200 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.130
 houses 200 thousand or mine 2 million or 20 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.490
 millions of euros 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.440
 or 2 billion years are different 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.699
 scales that this polymer has in 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.490
 concrete you can find others 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.350
 polymers that scale 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.930
 only have a maximum of 2m or 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.750
 20m this one has a pretty scale 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.520
 superior therefore it is very complete is 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.440
 a polymer that sponsored you and you 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.540
 I advise from the web to yourself 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.360
 in the foot in the video you will see the data 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.320
 of the seller delivery terms and cost of the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.350
 same very economical polymer 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.180
 to perform the measurement with the same 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.090
 we turn on our pool and metro 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.550
 and to measure resistances we will use the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.550
 scale lower the 200 scale 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.810
 we connect the test points we 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.079
 we will connect in the common terminal 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.579
 and volts ohms normally these 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.490
 they are common for many others 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.100
 other polymers that you have may be more 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.409
 or less similar 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.960
 the cop me back is indicating us one 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.119
 of the screen indicating circuit 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.950
 open the first check that 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.830
 you have to do when connecting 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.450
 a multimeter is to test the tips of 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.450
 test to see if they give closed circuit 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.830
 has to give 0 or very close to 0 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.480
 as you see from one of mine practically zero 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.640
 Our meter is correct for 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.040
 check the resistance whether it's outside 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.440
 or inside the appliance the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.710
 we will check by touching on their two 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.710
 terminals 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.459
 gives us a measure of 26.4 not mine 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.530
 other resistances can give other 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.230
 measures from 30 to 40 to 50 or less 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.790
 usually the washing machines and this 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.849
 type of resistance is usually about 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.780
 the 26 ohms therefore this would be 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.520
 okay 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.380
 the second check that can be 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.050
 perform in this type of resistance is 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.870
 the derivation to mass is always say 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.370
 metal and sheet metal there is a resistance 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.370
 electrical that should not exist 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.670
 on this scale that is most measured we 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.620
 will open as you see 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.720
 and to make this measurement we're going 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.150
 at the highest scale of the polymer 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.300
 in this case as we have the 2000 m 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.280
 would be the other used polymers that 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.280
 do not have it, we would use a smaller scale 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.110
 we bought 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.270
 and we see that we mark a measure 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:54.830
 17 16 mega ohms we lower the scale to 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.830
 try to focus more the measure 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 and we see that it gives us a measure of 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.830
 in this case about 18 19 a scale 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.830
 upward 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.389
 47.5 this resistance is derived mass 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.430
 therefore it is defective has a 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.190
 continuity of electric that should not 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.350
 exist therefore the same we should not 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.210
 discard has a breakdown and a breakdown 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.500
 It would be that it would cause us to jump 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.500
 differential housing 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.139
 we go down the scale again and we're going to 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.139
 check a light bulb 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:48.590
 gives us a measurement of 93 94 3 ohms 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:51.950
 or throws a little because of 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.090
 lead takes you to the base the bulb 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.740
 that usually fails a little 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.740
 but good initially we see 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.629
 the filament of the bulb is here and 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.870
 ok therefore it is 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:08.210
 working we will use for resistance the 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.550
 scale of 200 and the face download them 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.099
 we will use for components used in 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.600
 electronics, as we would have 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.460
 created before 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.040
 but for this I will dedicate a video 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.220
 specific to explain how they are checked 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.650
 the same 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.020
 I hope the video will be helpful on 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.720
 everything being one of the videos dedicated 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.640
 to use the metro meter a greeting and that 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.240
 continue visiting the web page run 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.240
 for yourself
