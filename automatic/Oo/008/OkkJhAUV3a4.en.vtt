00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
know just aware of the park and what's

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.810 
know just aware of the park and what's
going<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.769> or<00:00:28.920> wherever<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.310> choose<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.670> write

it the one I have right here happens to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.690 
it the one I have right here happens to
be<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> concrete<00:00:32.730> park<00:00:32.969> model<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:35.309> scooter

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
be the concrete park model the scooter

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310 
be the concrete park model the scooter
is<00:00:35.850> actually<00:00:36.390> called<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> speed<00:00:37.110> control

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
is actually called the speed control

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
is actually called the speed control
scooter<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.790> can't<00:00:39.000> really<00:00:39.090> call<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.300> SCS

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
scooter you can't really call it SCS

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.630 
scooter you can't really call it SCS
since<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.129> know<00:00:41.250> Andrew

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
since that's the you know Andrew

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.090 
since that's the you know Andrew
standard<00:00:42.030> compression<00:00:42.480> system<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.920> just

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
standard compression system so I just

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.720 
standard compression system so I just
call<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> speed<00:00:44.820> control<00:00:45.000> scooter<00:00:46.730> let's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
call it the speed control scooter let's

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.029 
call it the speed control scooter let's
start<00:00:48.000> off<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.270> course<00:00:48.710> most<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> are

start off of course most of you are

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.229 
start off of course most of you are
probably<00:00:50.070> already<00:00:50.309> familiar<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> speed

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239

the video i made for those the back
wheel<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.739> something<00:01:05.070> new<00:01:05.220> i<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> call<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
wheel is something new i like to call it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.399 
wheel is something new i like to call it
the<00:01:06.450> metal<00:01:07.439> wheel<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:09.360> speed<00:01:09.750> control<00:01:09.900> wheel

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the metal wheel the speed control wheel

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.120 
the metal wheel the speed control wheel
was<00:01:10.770> developed<00:01:11.310> by<00:01:11.460> me<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.820> steven<00:01:12.470> about<00:01:13.470> six

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
was developed by me and steven about six

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.810 
was developed by me and steven about six
months<00:01:14.189> ago<00:01:15.710> it's<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.799> pretty<00:01:16.979> basic<00:01:17.189> concept

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
months ago it's a pretty basic concept

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.210 
months ago it's a pretty basic concept
this<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.229> included<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:20.040> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
this is going to be included with all of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.510 
this is going to be included with all of
the<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.330> cement<00:01:22.080> park<00:01:22.320> models<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> Nate

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the the cement park models of the Nate

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.780 
the the cement park models of the Nate
grant<00:01:23.790> pro<00:01:24.090> model<00:01:24.450> v2<00:01:25.369> what's<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.549> neat<00:01:26.759> about

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
grant pro model v2 what's so neat about

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.270 
grant pro model v2 what's so neat about
it<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.330> since<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.439> metal<00:01:28.829> cores<00:01:29.100> are

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it is since you know metal cores are

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.859 
it is since you know metal cores are
really<00:01:29.490> cool<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.970> thought<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.450> cool<00:01:30.659> would<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
really cool we thought how cool would it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
really cool we thought how cool would it
be<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.710> could<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> metal<00:01:32.640> wheel

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
be if we could just have a metal wheel

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.149 
be if we could just have a metal wheel
and<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.229> basically<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:34.950> did

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and so that's basically what we did

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520 
and so that's basically what we did
we've<00:01:35.460> crafted<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.000> metal<00:01:36.299> wheel<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:37.350> are

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
we've crafted a metal wheel there are

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
we've crafted a metal wheel there are
some<00:01:37.740> bits<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.070> European<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> slow

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
some bits of European on there to slow

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.390 
some bits of European on there to slow
you<00:01:39.119> down<00:01:39.530> which<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> nice<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.159> touch

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
you down which is a nice little touch

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.300 
you down which is a nice little touch
Steven<00:01:41.970> added<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.770> felt<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.950> would<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.130> be

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
Steven added that felt it would just be

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.539 
Steven added that felt it would just be
a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.610> safer<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:46.170> little<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.159> little<00:01:47.280> more

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
a little safer a little a little more

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 
a little safer a little a little more
relevant<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> knee<00:01:48.420> grant<00:01:48.659> pro<00:01:48.840> model<00:01:49.140> if

relevant to the knee grant pro model if

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.889 
relevant to the knee grant pro model if
we<00:01:49.500> did<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.939> what's<00:01:51.210> nice<00:01:51.360> about<00:01:51.420> this

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
we did that but what's nice about this

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.920 
we did that but what's nice about this
is<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.619> land<00:01:52.920> sketchy<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.399> airs<00:01:53.930> gaps

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
is you can land sketchy on airs gaps

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.469 
is you can land sketchy on airs gaps
pretty<00:01:55.770> much<00:01:55.920> anything<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.670> since<00:01:57.360> it's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
pretty much anything and since it's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.300 
pretty much anything and since it's
metal<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.200> concrete<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.799> will<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:58.950> slide

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
metal and on concrete it will just slide

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.359 
metal and on concrete it will just slide
right<00:01:59.369> out<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
right out so it's it's going to be a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.380 
right out so it's it's going to be a
great<00:02:02.610> new<00:02:02.790> part<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.689> new<00:02:03.840> pro<00:02:04.049> model<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
great new part of the new pro model and

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.880 
great new part of the new pro model and
hopefully<00:02:06.390> everyone<00:02:06.689> loves<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:06.960> another

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
hopefully everyone loves them another

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.279 
hopefully everyone loves them another
great<00:02:08.099> feature<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.910> new<00:02:09.360> speed<00:02:09.929> control

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
great feature of the new speed control

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.620 
great feature of the new speed control
scooter<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> speed<00:02:11.039> control<00:02:11.220> deck

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.910 

as<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.050> see<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:19.120> dropouts<00:02:19.960> are<00:02:20.170> actually

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
as you can see the dropouts are actually

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.840 
as you can see the dropouts are actually
bent<00:02:21.160> upwards<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.050> there<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.170> no<00:02:23.350> break

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
bent upwards and there is no break

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.360 
bent upwards and there is no break
basically<00:02:24.850> how<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.240> works<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.860> break<00:02:27.070> you

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
basically how this works is to break you

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.760 
basically how this works is to break you
just<00:02:27.400> simply<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.910> plush<00:02:28.180> freshen<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.380> folding

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
just simply a plush freshen the folding

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.449 
just simply a plush freshen the folding
met<00:02:29.950> give<00:02:30.400> us<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.580> little<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:33.040> scrape<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
met give us a little and you scrape the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.730 
met give us a little and you scrape the
ground<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:33.970> it's<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.600> much<00:02:34.930> safer<00:02:35.170> way<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.410> stop

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
ground and it's a much safer way to stop

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.880 
ground and it's a much safer way to stop
than<00:02:36.480> having<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.540> move<00:02:37.690> your<00:02:37.870> feet<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.290> put

than having to move your feet and put

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.340 
than having to move your feet and put
them<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> break<00:02:39.370> now<00:02:40.360> as<00:02:40.690> scooter<00:02:41.080> riders

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
it and fly away it's a it's pretty cool

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.720 
it and fly away it's a it's pretty cool
we've<00:03:30.519> tested<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:31.200> probably<00:03:32.200> about<00:03:32.400> 30<00:03:33.400> times

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
we've tested it probably about 30 times

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.160 
we've tested it probably about 30 times
the<00:03:34.150> skate<00:03:34.390> park<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.860> works<00:03:36.070> pretty<00:03:36.280> well

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
the skate park and it works pretty well

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.960 
the skate park and it works pretty well
another<00:03:38.170> thing<00:03:38.260> is<00:03:38.590> there's<00:03:39.280> one<00:03:39.519> blue<00:03:39.730> grip

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
another thing is there's one blue grip

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.449 
another thing is there's one blue grip
one<00:03:40.330> black<00:03:40.600> grip<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.130> always<00:03:42.310> know

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
one black grip just so you always know

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.729 
one black grip just so you always know
which<00:03:42.730> way<00:03:42.910> is<00:03:42.970> forward<00:03:43.150> on<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.480> bars<00:03:43.739> again

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
which way is forward on the bars again

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:45.990 
which way is forward on the bars again
with<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.130> wheel<00:03:45.280> like<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.610> speed<00:03:45.850> control

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
with the wheel like the speed control

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.150 
with the wheel like the speed control
wheel<00:03:46.420> it's<00:03:46.959> very<00:03:47.049> important<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.500> have<00:03:47.590> facing

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
wheel it's very important to have facing

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.960 
wheel it's very important to have facing
forward<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:49.470> let's<00:03:50.470> see<00:03:50.680> as<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.610> can<00:03:51.730> see

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
forward and let's see as you can see

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.870 
forward and let's see as you can see
it's<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.329> special<00:03:52.720> fork<00:03:52.989> design<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:54.640> bars

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
it's a special fork design the bars

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.310 
it's a special fork design the bars
don't<00:03:55.090> clamp<00:03:55.360> all<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.690> way<00:03:55.750> onto<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.049> fork

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
don't clamp all the way onto the fork

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.860 
don't clamp all the way onto the fork
that's<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:57.519> if<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:58.120> think<00:03:58.570> you're<00:03:58.690> going<00:03:58.840> to

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
that's so if you think you're going to

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.140 
that's so if you think you're going to
bail<00:03:59.110> or<00:03:59.500> something<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.640> know<00:04:00.670> someone's

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
bail or something you know someone's

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.270 
bail or something you know someone's
coming<00:04:01.390> at<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.720> literally<00:04:02.470> all<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.769> do<00:04:03.010> is
