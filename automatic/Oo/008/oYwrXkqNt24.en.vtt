through<00:00:03.990> teaching<00:00:04.170> Photoshop<00:00:04.920> one<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
through teaching Photoshop one of the

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.190 
through teaching Photoshop one of the
things<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.609> I've<00:00:05.759> discovered<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
things that I've discovered is that the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.290 
things that I've discovered is that the
shadow<00:00:07.500> highlights<00:00:08.130> command<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.760> often

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
shadow highlights command is often

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.290 
shadow highlights command is often
underused<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.980> here<00:00:11.280> with<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.580> image<00:00:11.790> we're

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
underused so here with this image we're

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.459 
underused so here with this image we're
going<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.480> take<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.630> look<00:00:12.929> at<00:00:13.049> another<00:00:13.170> example

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
going to take a look at another example

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.189 
going to take a look at another example
of<00:00:14.219> how<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.969> use<00:00:15.240> shadow<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.780> highlights

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
of how we can use shadow and highlights

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.620 
of how we can use shadow and highlights
in<00:00:16.410> order<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.220> improve<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.730> overall<00:00:17.850> light<00:00:18.390> in

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
in order to improve the overall light in

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.929 
in order to improve the overall light in
this<00:00:18.810> photograph<00:00:19.189> this<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> photograph<00:00:20.520> of

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
this photograph this is a photograph of

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.210 
this photograph this is a photograph of
a<00:00:21.060> professional<00:00:21.480> mountain<00:00:21.930> biker<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.740> again

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
a professional mountain biker and again

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.099 
a professional mountain biker and again
because<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.760> backlit<00:00:24.330> because<00:00:24.750> there's<00:00:24.900> no

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
because it's backlit because there's no

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
because it's backlit because there's no
on-camera<00:00:25.680> flash<00:00:25.800> or<00:00:26.310> no<00:00:26.340> light<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:27.240> under

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
on-camera flash or no light it's under

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.810 
on-camera flash or no light it's under
exposed<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> want<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.490> bring

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
our shadows so go ahead and work on

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.840 
our shadows so go ahead and work on
those<00:00:55.620> shadows<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.670> want<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
those shadows and we really want to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
those shadows and we really want to
crank<00:00:57.180> these<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.719> we're<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.170> go<00:00:58.260> too

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
crank these up so we're going to go too

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.290 
crank these up so we're going to go too
far<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.789> we're<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> use

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
far with this because we're going to use

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.939 
far with this because we're going to use
masking<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> order<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> make<00:01:01.739> some

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
masking in order to make some

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.030 
masking in order to make some
corrections<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
corrections to get this just right so

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
corrections to get this just right so
I'm<00:01:05.129> increasing<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:05.970> sliders<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.510> till<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
I'm increasing these sliders just till I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.590 
I'm increasing these sliders just till I
see<00:01:07.350> something<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.860> think<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.640> too<00:01:09.299> far

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
see something I think is a bit too far

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.140 
see something I think is a bit too far
bit<00:01:09.960> over<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> top<00:01:10.670> all<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:12.000> my

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
bit over the top all right with my

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.969 
bit over the top all right with my
highlights<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.869> also<00:01:13.020> work<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.470> those<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:13.920> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
highlights I can also work on those if I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
highlights I can also work on those if I
want<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.159> bring<00:01:14.310> those<00:01:14.490> down<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> bit<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
want to bring those down a bit the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.390 
want to bring those down a bit the
radius<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.110> really<00:01:16.380> interesting<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
radius is really interesting if I

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
radius is really interesting if I
increase<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:18.090> dramatically<00:01:18.720> you're<00:01:18.900> going

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
increase this dramatically you're going

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499 
increase this dramatically you're going
to<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.350> how<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:20.040> radius<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.759> control<00:01:21.210> how

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
to see how this radius will control how

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
to see how this radius will control how
close<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.229> getting<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:22.979> other<00:01:23.250> tones

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
close is getting to these other tones

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.600 
close is getting to these other tones
hear<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> glow<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.400> case

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
hear what the glow is so in this case

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.730 
hear what the glow is so in this case
we'll<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:27.000> ahead<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.210> bring<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.540> down<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
we'll go ahead and bring that down you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.350 
we'll go ahead and bring that down you
want<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> find<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.369> radius<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.299> you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
want to find that radius just so you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.749 
want to find that radius just so you
have<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> nice<00:01:30.720> soft<00:01:31.079> transition<00:01:31.579> along<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
have a nice soft transition along that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.060 
have a nice soft transition along that

good<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.400> they<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.670> even<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.299> bit

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
good and they go even a little bit

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.590 
good and they go even a little bit

this juncture the image is looking

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.719 
this juncture the image is looking
interesting<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.360> overdone<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:47.369> wanted<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
interesting but overdone and I wanted to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.060 
interesting but overdone and I wanted to
overdo<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.780> illustrate<00:01:48.930> how<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.799> can

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
overdo this to illustrate how you can

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.060 
overdo this to illustrate how you can
use<00:01:50.220> masking<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.000> make<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.360> even<00:01:51.750> better

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
use masking to make this even better

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.740 
use masking to make this even better
what<00:01:53.070> we're<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> do<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.579> add<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> mask<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
what we're going to do is add a mask to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.109 
what we're going to do is add a mask to
add<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.170> mask<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.799> hold<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.130> option<00:01:56.520> or

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
add this mask will hold down option or

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.539 
add this mask will hold down option or
alt<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.899> we'll<00:01:58.320> click<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> add<00:01:59.070> layer

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
and so what I'm doing is I'm hand

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.760 
and so what I'm doing is I'm hand
painting<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.780> brightness<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
painting in this brightness in the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.010 
painting in this brightness in the
particular<00:02:50.310> areas<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.570> rather<00:02:51.810> than<00:02:51.930> having

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
particular areas so rather than having

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.470 
particular areas so rather than having
the<00:02:52.410> effect<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.610> hundred<00:02:53.760> percent<00:02:53.940> all

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
the effect at one hundred percent all

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.750 
the effect at one hundred percent all
over<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> image<00:02:55.380> I'm<00:02:56.100> just<00:02:56.310> going<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.460> bring

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
over the image I'm just going to bring

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.270 
over the image I'm just going to bring
it<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.390> couple<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.840> different<00:02:58.170> places<00:02:58.410> by

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
it in in a couple of different places by

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.060 
it in in a couple of different places by
hand-painting<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.690> mask<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.920> is

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
hand-painting on this mask and this is

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.190 
hand-painting on this mask and this is
going<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.280> give<00:03:02.520> me<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> really<00:03:03.030> nice<00:03:03.330> look<00:03:03.900> here

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
going to give me a really nice look here

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.840 
going to give me a really nice look here
because<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.680> can<00:03:04.890> then<00:03:05.040> control<00:03:05.550> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
because I can then control the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.540 
because I can then control the
brightness<00:03:06.060> value<00:03:06.720> here<00:03:07.410> we<00:03:07.560> have<00:03:07.740> before<00:03:07.950> and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
brightness value here we have before and

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.720 
brightness value here we have before and
then<00:03:09.090> after<00:03:09.450> if<00:03:09.990> we<00:03:10.710> shift<00:03:11.040> click<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.520> mask

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
then after if we shift click the mask

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.150 
then after if we shift click the mask
you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.270> see<00:03:12.510> before<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:12.960> after<00:03:13.560> with<00:03:13.770> and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
you can see before and after with and

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.860 
you can see before and after with and
without<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.640> mask<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.390> can<00:03:15.540> see<00:03:15.750> how

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
without the mask and you can see how

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.930 
without the mask and you can see how
we're<00:03:16.020> controlling<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:17.070> little<00:03:17.580> bit<00:03:17.790> more

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
we're controlling this a little bit more

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.200 
we're controlling this a little bit more
closely<00:03:18.330> next<00:03:18.950> up<00:03:19.950> increase<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.000> feather

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
closely next up increase the feather

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.990 
closely next up increase the feather
amount<00:03:21.540> soften<00:03:22.290> those<00:03:22.380> edges<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:22.950> then<00:03:23.250> lower

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
amount soften those edges and then lower

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.610 
amount soften those edges and then lower
the<00:03:24.180> opacity<00:03:24.270> we<00:03:24.900> want<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.170> lower<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.530> opacity

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
the opacity we want to lower the opacity

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.100 
the opacity we want to lower the opacity
till<00:03:26.580> we<00:03:26.700> find<00:03:27.000> just<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.390> right<00:03:27.480> spot<00:03:27.900> of

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
till we find just the right spot of

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.230 
till we find just the right spot of
adding<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.650> touch<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:29.070> light<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.460> the<00:03:30.090> nice

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
adding a touch of light and the nice

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.000 
adding a touch of light and the nice
thing<00:03:30.270> about<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.900> again<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.530> we<00:03:31.770> have

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
thing about this again is that we have

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.310 
thing about this again is that we have
this<00:03:32.190> incremental<00:03:32.880> light<00:03:33.240> where<00:03:33.930> certain

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
this incremental light where certain

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.380 
this incremental light where certain
areas<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:34.860> not<00:03:35.040> quite<00:03:35.460> so<00:03:35.670> strong<00:03:36.060> other

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
areas it's not quite so strong other

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.570 
areas it's not quite so strong other
areas<00:03:36.690> we're<00:03:37.050> really<00:03:37.230> boosting<00:03:37.890> things<00:03:38.130> up<00:03:38.370> in

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
areas we're really boosting things up in

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.640 
areas we're really boosting things up in
order<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.510> bring<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.900> some<00:03:40.080> light<00:03:40.290> into<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
order to bring in some light into the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.470 
order to bring in some light into the
photograph<00:03:41.160> all<00:03:41.760> right<00:03:42.000> well<00:03:42.150> here's<00:03:42.390> that

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
photograph all right well here's that

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.690 
photograph all right well here's that
before<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.350> then<00:03:44.010> here's<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.520> after

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
before and then here's the after

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.850 
before and then here's the after
bringing<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.750> little<00:03:46.020> bit<00:03:46.170> more<00:03:46.320> light<00:03:46.590> into

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
bringing a little bit more light into

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.980 
bringing a little bit more light into
the<00:03:47.010> subject<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.000> think<00:03:48.270> even<00:03:48.480> at<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.780> higher

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
the subject and I think even at a higher

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.290 
the subject and I think even at a higher
opacity<00:03:49.620> here<00:03:49.800> would<00:03:49.920> be<00:03:50.040> kind<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.340> nice<00:03:50.490> maybe

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
opacity here would be kind of nice maybe

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.270 
opacity here would be kind of nice maybe
something<00:03:51.750> right<00:03:51.930> around<00:03:52.140> there<00:03:52.410> all<00:03:53.070> right

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
something right around there all right

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.090 
something right around there all right
here<00:03:53.520> we<00:03:53.550> have<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.970> before<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.810> then<00:03:55.350> after<00:03:55.650> a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
here we have it before and then after a

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.340 
here we have it before and then after a
really<00:03:56.670> easy<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.360> effective<00:03:57.660> way<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.080> make

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
really easy and effective way to make

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.680 
really easy and effective way to make
corrections<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.280> your<00:03:59.460> photographs<00:03:59.940> using

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
corrections to your photographs using

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.400 
corrections to your photographs using
