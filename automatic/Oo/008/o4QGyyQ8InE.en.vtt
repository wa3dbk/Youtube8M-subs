00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.230
 by the way, there is no building material that is pike super that can Semper 2 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.569
 Differences before times up to 50 degrees balancing the best it does not cost 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:16.650
 you do not have to separate truth yet you just have to harden a bit you have to 

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.109
 because at more than 5 degrees in the living room 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.669
 unfortunately the fastest barrel 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.949
 exclude a house completely 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.019
 It's warm and cozy inside 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.339
 even though the walls are made of blues only forged 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.670
 while outside temperatures are far below freezing it is 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.670
 inside 15 degrees above zero 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.570
 only the body heat of the inhabitants is enough to heat up under snow 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.800
 Blacksmith is a good foundation and works similar to Styrofoam 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.190
 Snow consists mainly of air 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.360
 and the list of projects not outside 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.940
 which is why it does not get cold in a corridor in a refrigerator 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.129
 is due to its design warm air rises to the top so are the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.140
 Sleeping places also at the highest point is the clogs 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.290
 The inhabitants have to pass through a small tunnel to get outside 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.189
 crawl 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.189
 at the entrance, the cold air collects 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.250
 Beaumont is just about to build 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.460
 Lower snow 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.250
 Mas Bender and a shovel 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.700
 decisive is the shape of the snow mountains 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.430
 The building blocks are lowered diagonally out of the snow so that they later become one 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.600
 Group forms 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.000
 she practiced igloo taking an archive picture an hour to build a blacksmith 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.390
 Munich 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.450
 the entrance tunnel is finally thanked 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179
 the temperature in its interior 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.299
 it should rise above freezing but it does not melt 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.390
 because it is very cold outside the thief only a little snow melts 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.320
 the inner wall 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.920
 The ice then freezes again so that a thin layer of ice on the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.200
 Video wall is created 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 and that makes fast that only poets and stable lives 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.330
 but after a few days it will be over 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.770
 so that the igloos have to rise slowly 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.630
 it's over now 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.810
 Obama and his vice u + c events the 24 hours a day for them and we 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.050
 We are also happy if you write us about pennystockpicks de 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.879
 hope we will see us 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:20.859
