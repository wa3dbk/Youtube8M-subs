around here where people get all you
know<00:02:54.370> with<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.610> Fupa<00:02:54.970> everything<00:02:55.510> that's

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
know with the Fupa everything that's

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
where you're gonna have issues so I

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.120 
where you're gonna have issues so I
think<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.660> not<00:02:58.870> going<00:02:59.170> down<00:02:59.200> yet<00:02:59.530> assuming

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
think it's not going down yet assuming

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.160 
think it's not going down yet assuming
it's<00:03:00.250> not<00:03:00.310> just<00:03:00.640> you're<00:03:00.820> still<00:03:01.060> fat<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.750> I'm

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
it's not just you're still fat and I'm

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.230 
it's not just you're still fat and I'm
guessing<00:03:02.500> at<00:03:02.590> 180<00:03:02.980> he's<00:03:03.220> not<00:03:03.400> fat<00:03:03.700> enough<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
guessing at 180 he's not fat enough to

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.860 
guessing at 180 he's not fat enough to
have<00:03:04.920> what<00:03:05.920> 300<00:03:06.790> or<00:03:06.880> 180<00:03:07.180> that's<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.540> big

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
have what 300 or 180 that's a big

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.870 
have what 300 or 180 that's a big
difference<00:03:08.110> another<00:03:08.710> big<00:03:09.040> job<00:03:11.340> no<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.460> doesn't

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
difference another big job no it doesn't

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.380 
difference another big job no it doesn't
but<00:03:13.060> at<00:03:13.270> 300<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> picture<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.850> him<00:03:16.090> I

but at 300 is that a picture of him I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.300 
but at 300 is that a picture of him I
think<00:03:17.380> it's<00:03:17.560> this<00:03:17.650> guy<00:03:17.830> in<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.040> back<00:03:20.310> probably
