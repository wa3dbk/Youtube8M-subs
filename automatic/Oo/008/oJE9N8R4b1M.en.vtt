right<00:02:11.240> let's<00:02:11.480> not<00:02:11.660> test<00:02:11.930> these<00:02:12.380> different

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
right let's not test these different

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
right let's not test these different
music<00:02:12.950> files

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.910 

okay<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.720> first<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.200> appears<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> be<00:02:19.739> the
