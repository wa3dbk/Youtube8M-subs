the<00:00:05.910> 7500<00:00:06.480> five<00:00:06.810> models<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.680> these<00:00:07.799> are<00:00:07.980> dual

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
the 7500 five models so these are dual

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.620 
the 7500 five models so these are dual
action<00:00:08.400> knives<00:00:08.760> meaning<00:00:09.150> they<00:00:09.300> can<00:00:09.450> be<00:00:09.540> either

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
action knives meaning they can be either

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.390 
action knives meaning they can be either
manuals<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:10.860> just<00:00:11.010> open<00:00:11.099> them<00:00:11.340> up

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
manuals so you can just open them up

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.220 
manuals so you can just open them up
with<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> thumb<00:00:11.880> stud<00:00:12.150> or<00:00:12.360> they<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.110> actually

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
with a thumb stud or they can actually

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.810 
with a thumb stud or they can actually
be<00:00:13.440> automatics<00:00:14.040> as<00:00:14.190> well<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:14.610> they<00:00:14.700> have<00:00:14.790> a

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
be automatics as well so they have a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.700 
be automatics as well so they have a
hidden<00:00:15.000> mechanism<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:16.170> will<00:00:16.289> open<00:00:16.410> them<00:00:16.619> up

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
hidden mechanism that will open them up

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.590 
hidden mechanism that will open them up
like<00:00:16.859> automatics<00:00:17.400> pretty<00:00:18.029> interesting<00:00:18.420> nice

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
like automatics pretty interesting nice

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.439 
like automatics pretty interesting nice
let's<00:00:18.930> go<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.170> take<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> closer<00:00:19.560> look<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> here

you<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.869> two<00:00:22.020> versions<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> 7500

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
you have the two versions of the 7500

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.939 
you have the two versions of the 7500
five<00:00:23.550> we've<00:00:23.789> got<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> 131<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.930> 132<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
five we've got the 131 and 132 in the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.380 
five we've got the 131 and 132 in the
packaging<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:26.939> wanted<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.240> show<00:00:27.359> you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
packaging and I just wanted to show you

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.790 
packaging and I just wanted to show you
what<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> packaging<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
what the packaging is like with the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.830 
what the packaging is like with the
benchmate<00:00:29.429> sole<00:00:29.640> class<00:00:29.880> stuff<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> little

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
benchmate sole class stuff it's a little

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.330 
benchmate sole class stuff it's a little
bit<00:00:31.019> nicer<00:00:31.140> than<00:00:31.349> once<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.710> get<00:00:31.890> versus<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
bit nicer than once you get versus a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
bit nicer than once you get versus a
regular<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.000> standard<00:00:33.719> cardboard<00:00:34.200> box<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
regular just standard cardboard box to

regular just standard cardboard box to
you<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:34.860> most<00:00:35.010> knives<00:00:35.309> actually<00:00:36.090> give<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you with most knives actually give you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
you with most knives actually give you
pretty<00:00:36.480> nice<00:00:36.630> little<00:00:36.930> collectors<00:00:37.649> case<00:00:37.890> got

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
pretty nice little collectors case got

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.910 
pretty nice little collectors case got
magnetic<00:00:39.210> closures<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.930> we've<00:00:40.739> got<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
magnetic closures on it we've got a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.889 
magnetic closures on it we've got a
certificate<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> knife<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
certificate for the knife and then the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.590 
certificate for the knife and then the
knife<00:00:43.050> itself<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:44.100> course<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.670> then<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.210> bag

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
use in the normal bag this nice little

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
use in the normal bag this nice little
touches<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.750> know<00:00:51.870> showing<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.039> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
touches you know showing you that if you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.540 
touches you know showing you that if you
got<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.460> nicer<00:00:54.090> than<00:00:54.270> normal<00:00:54.600> knife<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> nice<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
got a nicer than normal knife so nice to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.130 
got a nicer than normal knife so nice to
see<00:00:56.699> companies<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.420> stuff<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.989> when

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
see companies do stuff like that when

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.650 
see companies do stuff like that when
they<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> here's<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
they don't have to do so here's the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.110 
they don't have to do so here's the
knife<00:01:00.840> itself<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:02.250> dual<00:01:02.550> action<00:01:02.760> tab

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
knife itself a little dual action tab

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.620 
knife itself a little dual action tab
that<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.480> keep<00:01:03.629> under<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> pocket<00:01:04.320> clip<00:01:05.630> so

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that they keep under the pocket clip so

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.450 
that they keep under the pocket clip so
the<00:01:06.659> knives<00:01:06.960> most<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> specs<00:01:08.159> are<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the knives most of the specs are the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070 
the knives most of the specs are the
same<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> materials<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.960> are

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
same it's the materials that are

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480 
same it's the materials that are
different<00:01:10.380> between<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.830> two<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.430> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
different between the two so you can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
different between the two so you can
kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:12.170> obviously<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> appearance<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
kind of see obviously the appearance is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.690 
kind of see obviously the appearance is
pretty<00:01:14.040> different

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
pretty different

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.109 
pretty different
so<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.049> 1/32<00:01:16.619> has<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> green<00:01:17.220> g10<00:01:17.729> with

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so the the 1/32 has the green g10 with

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.780 
so the the 1/32 has the green g10 with
the<00:01:18.240> titanium<00:01:18.600> both<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.500> them<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> m390

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the titanium both of them have the m390

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.230 
the titanium both of them have the m390
steel<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> titanium<00:01:22.939> frame<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
steel and then the titanium frame in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.969 
steel and then the titanium frame in
addition<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> parts<00:01:25.320> where<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.860> see

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
addition to the parts where you can see

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
addition to the parts where you can see
the<00:01:26.100> g10<00:01:26.520> or<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.390> lightning-strike<00:01:27.900> carbon

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the g10 or the lightning-strike carbon

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.920 
the g10 or the lightning-strike carbon
fiber<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.579> 131<00:01:30.000> has<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> lightning

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
fiber so the 131 has the lightning

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
fiber so the 131 has the lightning
strike<00:01:31.140> carbon<00:01:31.530> fiber<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.460> actually

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
strike carbon fiber and it's actually

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
strike carbon fiber and it's actually
kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> cool<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.509> has<00:01:33.540> an<00:01:33.750> inlay<00:01:34.140> of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
kind of cool because it has an inlay of

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.719 
kind of cool because it has an inlay of
the<00:01:34.770> lightning<00:01:35.040> strike<00:01:35.250> carbon<00:01:35.549> fiber

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the lightning strike carbon fiber

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.289 
the lightning strike carbon fiber
actually<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> blade<00:01:36.630> itself<00:01:36.979> versus<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
actually in the blade itself versus a

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.640 
actually in the blade itself versus a
cutout<00:01:39.299> or<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.659> blood<00:01:39.869> groove<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.320> whatever<00:01:40.530> you

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
cutout or a blood groove or whatever you

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.420 
cutout or a blood groove or whatever you
want<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> call<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.150> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.509> three<00:01:42.750> two

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
want to call that on the one three two

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.740 
want to call that on the one three two
so<00:01:44.430> nice<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.700> touches<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.210> both<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.630> them

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
so nice little touches on both of them

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.100 
so nice little touches on both of them
obviously<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.920> higher<00:01:47.100> price<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.149> 131<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
obviously a higher price on the 131 and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
obviously a higher price on the 131 and
they're<00:01:49.829> very<00:01:50.070> very<00:01:50.310> limited<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.909> they

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
they're very very limited so they

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450 
they're very very limited so they
weren't<00:01:51.240> very<00:01:51.270> easy<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.960> they're<00:01:52.950> making

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
weren't very easy to get they're making

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
weren't very easy to get they're making
a<00:01:53.670> decent<00:01:54.060> amount<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> 132<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.590> these<00:01:55.710> are

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
a decent amount of the 132 so these are

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.100 
a decent amount of the 132 so these are
a<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:56.130> bit<00:01:56.219> easier<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.610> get<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.899> can

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
a little bit easier to get if you can

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.230 
a little bit easier to get if you can
get<00:01:58.799> automatics<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.670> state<00:01:59.939> or<00:01:59.969> country

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
get automatics in your state or country

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.179 
get automatics in your state or country
that<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.899> because<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:01.680> always<00:02:01.890> an<00:02:02.100> issue

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
that is because that's always an issue

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.190 
that is because that's always an issue
so<00:02:02.969> let's<00:02:03.149> talk<00:02:03.240> about<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> mechanics<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
so let's talk about the mechanics of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.719 
so let's talk about the mechanics of
this<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.469> these<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.770> dual<00:02:05.070> action<00:02:05.310> knives

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
this so these are dual action knives

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.880 
this so these are dual action knives
with<00:02:06.360> dual<00:02:06.570> action<00:02:06.719> means<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.740> can

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
with dual action means is that they can

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.630 
with dual action means is that they can
be<00:02:07.920> both<00:02:08.160> manuals<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.879> automatics<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.640> you've

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
be both manuals and automatics so you've

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.910 
be both manuals and automatics so you've
got<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> hidden<00:02:12.090> auto<00:02:13.080> mechanism<00:02:13.709> and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
got a hidden auto mechanism and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.010 
got a hidden auto mechanism and
and<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.520> way<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> activate<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:15.780> piece

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and the way to activate it is this piece

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.750 
and the way to activate it is this piece
right<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.260> what<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.370> just<00:02:17.400> slide

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
right here what you do is you just slide

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.059 
right here what you do is you just slide
it<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.319> see<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.830> automatic

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
it and you can see you get the automatic

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.340 
it and you can see you get the automatic
action<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.660> pop<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.990> little<00:02:22.050> piece

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
action so you just pop this little piece

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.840 
action so you just pop this little piece
down<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.250> little<00:02:23.550> bit<00:02:23.730> of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
down you can see a little bit of

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.580 
down you can see a little bit of
movement<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.240> there<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:25.020> disengages

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
movement in there and that disengages

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.680 
movement in there and that disengages
the<00:02:25.620> lock<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.220> causes<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.970> auto<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.300> come<00:02:27.540> out

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the lock and causes the auto to come out

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.410 
the lock and causes the auto to come out
and<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.160> frame<00:02:29.400> lock<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.270> just

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
and so this is a frame lock so you just

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.340 
and so this is a frame lock so you just
disengage<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.050> lock<00:02:31.760> close<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.910> back<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.090> and

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
disengage the lock close it back up and

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.770 
disengage the lock close it back up and
you<00:02:34.350> hear<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.650> click<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.040> place<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:36.300> doesn't<00:02:36.660> do

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
you hear it click in place it doesn't do

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.480 
you hear it click in place it doesn't do
that<00:02:36.810> when<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.230> use<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.560> manual<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.250> can

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
that when you use the manual so you can

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.630 
that when you use the manual so you can
hear<00:02:38.850> when<00:02:39.420> I'm<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.660> opening<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.080> up<00:02:40.640> you

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
hear when I'm just opening it up you

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.100 
hear when I'm just opening it up you
don't<00:02:41.820> get<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.090> additional<00:02:42.270> little<00:02:42.720> click

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
don't get that additional little click

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.010 
don't get that additional little click
in<00:02:43.260> place<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.850> that<00:02:44.850> auto<00:02:45.090> mechanism<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.870> not

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
in place and that auto mechanism is not

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.880 
in place and that auto mechanism is not
rien<00:02:46.470> gauging<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.820> when<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.030> need<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.890> it's

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
rien gauging so when you need it it's

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.000 
rien gauging so when you need it it's
ready<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.190> go<00:02:51.080> same<00:02:52.080> mechanism<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.680> both<00:02:52.860> of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
ready to go same mechanism on both of

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.770 
ready to go same mechanism on both of
these<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.580> you're<00:02:53.790> not<00:02:53.880> getting<00:02:54.269> just<00:02:54.690> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
these so you're not getting just a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.060 
these so you're not getting just a
manual<00:02:54.959> on<00:02:55.200> one<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.470> these<00:02:55.650> both<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.040> these

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
manual on one of these both of these

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.070 
manual on one of these both of these
have<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> same<00:02:56.580> mechanism<00:02:56.760> they<00:02:57.630> both<00:02:57.840> have

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
have the same mechanism they both have

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.600 
have the same mechanism they both have
that<00:02:58.260> dual<00:02:58.560> action<00:02:58.739> mechanism<00:02:59.010> when<00:02:59.489> you

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
that dual action mechanism when you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.479 
that dual action mechanism when you
slide<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.480> scaled<00:03:00.810> beast<00:03:01.140> down<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> pretty

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
slide that scaled beast down so a pretty

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.710 
slide that scaled beast down so a pretty
cool<00:03:02.640> feature<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.090> know<00:03:03.239> most<00:03:03.390> people<00:03:03.450> look

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
cool feature you know most people look

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.240 
cool feature you know most people look
at<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.959> they're<00:03:04.170> just<00:03:04.350> gonna<00:03:04.470> see<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> big<00:03:05.070> ol

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
at this they're just gonna see a big ol

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.680 
at this they're just gonna see a big ol
knife<00:03:05.430> because<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.000> pretty<00:03:06.330> decent

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
knife because this is a pretty decent

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.870 
knife because this is a pretty decent
sized<00:03:06.810> knife<00:03:07.110> but<00:03:07.739> actually<00:03:08.310> has<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.640> hidden

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
sized knife but actually has that hidden

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.000 
sized knife but actually has that hidden
little<00:03:09.150> feature<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.630> being<00:03:09.840> dual<00:03:10.110> action<00:03:10.320> so

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
little feature of being dual action so

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.320 
little feature of being dual action so
you've<00:03:11.130> got<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.370> automatic<00:03:11.610> when<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.090> want

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
you've got the automatic when you want

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.130 
you've got the automatic when you want

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
reading them off of the benchmade

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.610 
reading them off of the benchmade
website<00:03:19.799> that's<00:03:20.370> exactly<00:03:20.790> what<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:21.000> doing

on the 131 6262 Rockwell both drop

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.000 
on the 131 6262 Rockwell both drop
points<00:03:41.810> seven<00:03:42.810> point<00:03:42.989> seven<00:03:43.110> four<00:03:43.410> ounces<00:03:43.739> on

the 131 seven point eight nine on the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.670 
the 131 seven point eight nine on the
132<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:47.459> slightly<00:03:47.790> heavier<00:03:48.500> probably<00:03:49.500> just

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
132 so slightly heavier probably just

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.140 
132 so slightly heavier probably just
because<00:03:49.769> g10<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.579> a<00:03:50.610> little<00:03:50.820> bit<00:03:50.910> heavier

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
because g10 is a little bit heavier

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.289 
because g10 is a little bit heavier
material<00:03:51.630> than<00:03:51.750> carbon<00:03:52.049> fiber<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.410> general

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
material than carbon fiber in general

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.970 
material than carbon fiber in general
alright<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:54.480> overall<00:03:54.870> length<00:03:55.110> nine<00:03:55.470> point<00:03:55.799> oh

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
alright so overall length nine point oh

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.620 
alright so overall length nine point oh
eight<00:03:56.010> inches<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.090> pretty<00:03:57.390> decent

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
eight inches so this is a pretty decent

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.420 
eight inches so this is a pretty decent
sized<00:03:57.989> knife<00:03:58.290> almost<00:03:58.799> four<00:03:58.980> inches<00:03:59.190> on<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
sized knife almost four inches on the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.340 
sized knife almost four inches on the
blade<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.850> little<00:04:00.390> over<00:04:00.600> nine<00:04:00.780> inches<00:04:00.959> total

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
blade a little over nine inches total

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.229 
blade a little over nine inches total
length<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.220> got<00:04:02.370> five<00:04:02.730> point<00:04:03.030> one<00:04:03.209> eight

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
length and you got five point one eight

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.550 
length and you got five point one eight
inches<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:05.700> close<00:04:05.940> size<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:06.900> pretty

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
inches on the close size so pretty

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.800 
inches on the close size so pretty
decent<00:04:07.860> size<00:04:07.980> knife<00:04:08.220> definitely<00:04:08.850> not<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.269> super

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
decent size knife definitely not a super

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.569 
decent size knife definitely not a super
compact<00:04:10.170> knife<00:04:10.440> it's<00:04:10.769> not<00:04:10.920> massive<00:04:11.190> they're

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
compact knife it's not massive they're

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.310 
compact knife it's not massive they're
obviously<00:04:12.269> bigger<00:04:12.510> lives<00:04:12.780> out<00:04:12.989> there<00:04:13.019> on<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
obviously bigger lives out there on the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.759 
obviously bigger lives out there on the
market

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
market

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.400 
market
but<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.609> a<00:04:14.640> pretty<00:04:14.880> big<00:04:15.180> beefy<00:04:16.019> knife<00:04:16.200> you

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
but this is a pretty big beefy knife you

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.259 
but this is a pretty big beefy knife you
can<00:04:16.500> kind<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.709> see<00:04:16.919> fills<00:04:17.609> up<00:04:17.729> a<00:04:17.820> hand<00:04:18.030> really

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
can kind of see fills up a hand really

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.870 
can kind of see fills up a hand really
well<00:04:18.450> zoom<00:04:18.930> out<00:04:19.079> just<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.380> little<00:04:19.590> bit<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.729> you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
well zoom out just a little bit so you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.940 
well zoom out just a little bit so you
see<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.720> fills<00:04:21.900> up<00:04:22.019> my<00:04:22.169> entire<00:04:22.440> hand<00:04:22.740> with<00:04:22.890> a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
see it fills up my entire hand with a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.640 
see it fills up my entire hand with a
little<00:04:23.130> bit<00:04:23.250> sticking<00:04:23.490> out<00:04:23.669> I've<00:04:24.270> got<00:04:24.570> a

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
little bit sticking out I've got a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.870 
little bit sticking out I've got a
relatively<00:04:25.650> medium<00:04:25.950> size<00:04:26.130> hands<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:26.669> when<00:04:26.789> I

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
relatively medium size hands so when I

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.530 
relatively medium size hands so when I
wear<00:04:27.060> gloves

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
wear gloves

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.930 
wear gloves
we're<00:04:27.630> mediums<00:04:28.020> are<00:04:28.170> larges<00:04:28.740> can<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:29.700> give<00:04:29.850> you

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
we're mediums are larges can I give you

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.920 
we're mediums are larges can I give you
an<00:04:30.060> idea<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.590> what<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.680> looks<00:04:31.710> like

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
an idea of what it looks like

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.450 
an idea of what it looks like
of<00:04:33.930> course<00:04:34.140> same<00:04:34.350> size<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.860> everything<00:04:35.040> on

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
of course same size and everything on

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.370 
of course same size and everything on
both<00:04:35.730> of<00:04:35.940> these<00:04:36.030> models<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:37.140> have<00:04:37.260> the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
both of these models you just have the

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.130 
both of these models you just have the
different<00:04:37.740> materials<00:04:38.280> between<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.730> two<00:04:39.140> so

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
different materials between the two so

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.510 
different materials between the two so
let's<00:04:40.290> zoom<00:04:40.350> in<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:40.830> just<00:04:40.950> see<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:41.190> see<00:04:41.370> them

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
let's zoom in and just see you see them

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.340 
let's zoom in and just see you see them
up<00:04:41.700> close<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.300> little<00:04:42.690> bit<00:04:42.810> better<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:46.260> they

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
up close a little bit better so they

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.720 
up close a little bit better so they
made<00:04:46.470> some<00:04:46.650> really<00:04:46.830> nice<00:04:46.980> touches<00:04:47.250> on<00:04:47.460> this<00:04:47.580> I

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
made some really nice touches on this I

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.310 
made some really nice touches on this I
really<00:04:47.970> like<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.270> inlay<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:48.690> they<00:04:48.930> did<00:04:49.140> I

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
really like that inlay that they did I

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.900 
really like that inlay that they did I
love<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.040> look<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.430> lightning<00:04:50.730> strike

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
love the look of the lightning strike

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.280 
love the look of the lightning strike
carbon<00:04:51.240> fiber<00:04:51.420> I<00:04:51.570> think<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.840> looks<00:04:51.990> really

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
carbon fiber I think it looks really

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.350 
carbon fiber I think it looks really
really<00:04:52.620> cool<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.400> anodization<00:04:53.850> that

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
really cool and the anodization that

let's take a little bit closer look at
the<00:06:24.570> backside<00:06:24.990> of<00:06:25.140> these<00:06:25.260> you<00:06:25.830> see<00:06:26.040> the

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
the backside of these you see the

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.040 
the backside of these you see the
different<00:06:28.530> angles<00:06:28.830> and<00:06:28.950> everything<00:06:30.050> pretty

cool how they integrated the titanium
into<00:06:34.140> the<00:06:34.230> carbon<00:06:34.530> fiber<00:06:34.740> in<00:06:34.950> the<00:06:35.010> g10<00:06:35.480> it's

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
into the carbon fiber in the g10 it's

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.620 
into the carbon fiber in the g10 it's
got<00:06:36.600> a<00:06:36.630> nice<00:06:36.780> look<00:06:36.990> to<00:06:37.020> it
