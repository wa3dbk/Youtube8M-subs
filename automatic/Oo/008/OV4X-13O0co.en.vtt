the<00:02:08.129> tank<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.520> doing<00:02:08.729> fine<00:02:09.060> all<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.440> levels

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the tank is doing fine all the levels

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.580 
the tank is doing fine all the levels
are<00:02:10.920> wonderful<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.730> haven't

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
are wonderful I haven't

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.690 
are wonderful I haven't
checked<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:13.670> haven't<00:02:14.030> done<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.569> water<00:02:15.700> testing

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
checked I haven't done a water testing

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.920 
checked I haven't done a water testing
for<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.660> very<00:02:18.230> very<00:02:18.440> long<00:02:18.740> time<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.660> only<00:02:20.720> thing

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
for a very very long time the only thing

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.130 
for a very very long time the only thing
that<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.319> checked<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.480> salinity<00:02:23.870> in

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
that I checked is the the salinity in

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.720 
that I checked is the the salinity in
the<00:02:24.260> water<00:02:24.730> when<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.760> do<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.209> water<00:02:26.450> change<00:02:26.569> and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the water when I do a water change and

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.750 
the water when I do a water change and
sometimes<00:02:28.730> at<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.090> temperature<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.890> that's

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
sometimes at the temperature but that's

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.690 
sometimes at the temperature but that's
basically<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.959> don't<00:02:33.319> really<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:34.069> don't<00:02:34.459> know

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
basically it I don't really I don't know

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.430 
basically it I don't really I don't know
any<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:35.209> don't<00:02:35.270> know<00:02:35.420> any<00:02:35.690> water<00:02:35.930> tasting

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
any I don't know any water tasting

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.350 
any I don't know any water tasting
because<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:37.040> can<00:02:37.220> tell<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.580> tank<00:02:37.790> it's<00:02:37.970> salty

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
because you can tell the tank it's salty

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.350 
because you can tell the tank it's salty
and<00:02:40.540> also<00:02:41.540> uh<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:42.500> can<00:02:42.890> tell<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:43.580> how<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
and also uh you can tell on how the the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.090 
and also uh you can tell on how the the
corals<00:02:44.780> grow<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.850> still<00:02:46.850> have<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.030> little<00:02:47.150> bit<00:02:47.420> of

that's an elegance coral I still have a
little<00:02:51.709> bit<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.160> ear<00:02:52.790> algae<00:02:53.180> problem<00:02:53.630> but

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
little bit of a ear algae problem but

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.570 
little bit of a ear algae problem but
who<00:02:53.900> has<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.350> who<00:02:54.500> doesn't<00:02:54.709> have<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.370> mean

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
who has it who doesn't have it I mean

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.520 
who has it who doesn't have it I mean
especially<00:02:55.820> in<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.209> small<00:02:56.510> tank<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:57.019> that

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
especially in a small tank like that

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.699 
especially in a small tank like that
packed<00:02:58.040> with<00:02:58.250> corals<00:02:58.819> it's<00:02:59.630> it's<00:03:00.319> it's<00:03:00.560> very

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
packed with corals it's it's it's very

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.220 
packed with corals it's it's it's very
common<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.700> there<00:03:02.390> is<00:03:02.480> nothing<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:03.050> there

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
common and there is nothing in there

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.130 
common and there is nothing in there
they<00:03:03.440> can<00:03:03.470> eat<00:03:03.769> those<00:03:03.950> here<00:03:04.519> dari<00:03:05.150> all<00:03:05.390> your

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
they can eat those here dari all your

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.280 
they can eat those here dari all your
algae<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:06.769> bought<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> couple<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.209> Mexican<00:03:08.750> tour

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
algae I bought a couple of Mexican tour

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.229 
algae I bought a couple of Mexican tour
bus<00:03:09.530> snails<00:03:09.920> don't<00:03:10.069> those<00:03:10.519> are<00:03:10.730> supposed<00:03:11.120> to

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
bus snails don't those are supposed to

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.650 
bus snails don't those are supposed to
eat<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.810> air<00:03:12.019> algae<00:03:12.530> but<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.940> far<00:03:14.239> they

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
eat the air algae but so far they

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.440 
eat the air algae but so far they
haven't<00:03:14.870> gotten<00:03:15.430> nearby<00:03:16.430> it's<00:03:16.670> they're<00:03:17.060> just

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
haven't gotten nearby it's they're just

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.330 
haven't gotten nearby it's they're just
kept<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.049> void<00:03:18.350> they're<00:03:18.920> keeping<00:03:19.250> on

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
kept on a void they're keeping on

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.060 
kept on a void they're keeping on
avoiding<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.900> guess<00:03:21.290> eventually<00:03:21.500> I'm

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
avoiding it I guess eventually I'm

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.840 
avoiding it I guess eventually I'm
assuming<00:03:22.640> they're<00:03:22.790> gonna<00:03:22.910> go<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.959> eat<00:03:24.140> some

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
assuming they're gonna go and eat some

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.900 
assuming they're gonna go and eat some
but<00:03:25.850> I<00:03:26.120> use<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.780> stainless<00:03:27.019> steel<00:03:27.910> tweezers

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
but I use the stainless steel tweezers

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.030 
but I use the stainless steel tweezers
that<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:29.150> have<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.989> kept<00:03:30.230> um<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.620> keep<00:03:30.860> on

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
that I have and I kept um I keep on

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.340 
that I have and I kept um I keep on
pulling<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.299> unfortunately<00:03:32.989> can't

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
pulling it but unfortunately can't

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.800 
pulling it but unfortunately can't
really<00:03:33.769> leach<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:33.980> small<00:03:34.489> parts<00:03:34.880> with<00:03:35.690> the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
really leach the small parts with the

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.819 
really leach the small parts with the
tweezers<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:38.230> know<00:03:39.230> there's<00:03:39.560> some

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
tweezers so you know there's some

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.770 
tweezers so you know there's some
leftover<00:03:43.000> what<00:03:44.000> else<00:03:44.180> what<00:03:44.480> else

a professional I just you know I tried
to<00:03:58.850> copy<00:03:59.120> nature<00:03:59.269> and<00:03:59.870> see<00:04:00.230> oh

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
to copy nature and see oh

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.060 
to copy nature and see oh
I<00:04:00.950> watch<00:04:01.609> a<00:04:01.730> lot<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.940> ocean<00:04:02.359> ocean<00:04:03.140> videos<00:04:03.799> and

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
I watch a lot of ocean ocean videos and

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.979 
I watch a lot of ocean ocean videos and
I<00:04:04.160> go<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.609> aquarium<00:04:05.000> store<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:05.630> see<00:04:05.840> how

they do it and you know it's hard to

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.220 
they do it and you know it's hard to
reproduce<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:11.269> ecosystem<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.079> the
