00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:09.440
 Then... I finished the moment, I finished ahq now, I really think.. Hey! I manage this team so bad? I asked my teammates 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.080
 Because I asked myself to have them in charge, and let everyone go to work on time and practice on time. 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.880
 But the record that came out is really unexpected. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:28.280
 I didn't expect the result to be like this! But, I.. I think about it, it is indeed ahq that is very fierce, very fierce. 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.800
 Especially the way down, there is Xiao An, their, his performance really opened my eyes, 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:42.360
 He is... the content of the game in those days made me feel that there is a world-class AD, basically no mistakes and then... 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.960
 He is good at the current version of two very strong AD, which makes his entire team's BAN PICK have an advantage. 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:59.480
 Because many teams are going to BAN for their way down, like what is Hogart, a role like Cristal. 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:10.000
 Yes, I am still full of admiration when I finish the game. How can I become so strong... (by the waist) 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.340
 How to kill a dozen, I will die when I talk about it. 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.100
 It’s really not awkward to lose, and we know where our team’s problems are before the game. So where are the problems of our team? I won’t say it. 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.200
 In the middle of the special dog, he must watch me live, ah, he is talking, fast. 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.440
 Xiao Yun Xiang Bao! Look at this Mao Kai ID, what a ghost? 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.280
 Xiaoyun Xiang Bao played Mao Kaiye, did not expect Xiaoyun so many brain powder so soon, surprised and surprised 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.560
 I finished the day, basically, I am sure that ahq will run the TPA, because they are really making a lot of progress. 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:09.960
 Therefore, I am also looking forward to their next performance in the world, because I feel that... very competitive, very competitive in the international competition at this level. 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.840
 Thank you for your subscription 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.320
 Hello, don’t you? 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640
 Hello, no! 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.920
 Oh, almost all of them have been twisted. 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.920
 Chair shut up!!!~~~(laugh)
