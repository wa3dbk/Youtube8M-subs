hello YouTube this is Matt with woodies
and<00:00:05.109> wheels<00:00:05.290> and<00:00:05.649> today<00:00:06.519> we're<00:00:07.149> gonna<00:00:07.269> try<00:00:07.539> a

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:07.629 
and wheels and today we're gonna try a

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.180 
and wheels and today we're gonna try a
few<00:00:07.930> a<00:00:08.309> shorter<00:00:09.309> less<00:00:09.670> formal<00:00:10.120> video<00:00:10.420> and

few a shorter less formal video and

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.680 
few a shorter less formal video and
hopefully<00:00:12.190> we'll<00:00:12.429> keep<00:00:12.580> them<00:00:12.700> more<00:00:13.150> frequent

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
hopefully we'll keep them more frequent

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.720 
hopefully we'll keep them more frequent
today<00:00:14.500> we'll<00:00:14.830> be<00:00:14.980> talking<00:00:15.129> about<00:00:15.339> wooden

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
today we'll be talking about wooden

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.390 
today we'll be talking about wooden
wheels<00:00:16.410> there's<00:00:17.410> a<00:00:17.500> wooden<00:00:17.769> wheel<00:00:17.890> there<00:00:18.100> for

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
wheels there's a wooden wheel there for

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.099 
wheels there's a wooden wheel there for
you<00:00:18.550> and<00:00:19.019> how<00:00:20.019> they<00:00:20.140> work<00:00:20.380> and<00:00:21.720> how<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.750> true

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
you and how they work and how to true

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.870 
you and how they work and how to true
them<00:00:23.230> so<00:00:23.529> these<00:00:23.769> wheels<00:00:24.070> that<00:00:24.429> can't<00:00:24.640> they're

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
them so these wheels that can't they're

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.800 
them so these wheels that can't they're
here<00:00:25.300> on<00:00:25.679> this<00:00:26.679> Packard<00:00:27.519> which<00:00:27.970> is<00:00:28.150> getting<00:00:28.779> a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
here on this Packard which is getting a

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.259 
here on this Packard which is getting a
whole<00:00:28.929> new<00:00:28.960> engine<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:29.849> anyways<00:00:30.849> that'll<00:00:31.179> be

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
whole new engine and anyways that'll be

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.930 
whole new engine and anyways that'll be
later<00:00:31.449> stories<00:00:31.929> but<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.829> wheels<00:00:33.190> tend<00:00:33.670> to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
later stories but the wheels tend to

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.110 
later stories but the wheels tend to
ride<00:00:34.390> down<00:00:34.719> down<00:00:35.469> the<00:00:35.620> road<00:00:35.649> and<00:00:36.160> they<00:00:36.340> wobble

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
ride down down the road and they wobble

ride down down the road and they wobble
on<00:00:37.239> this<00:00:37.420> car<00:00:37.660> so<00:00:37.870> we're<00:00:38.620> going<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.770> talk<00:00:38.890> about

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
on this car so we're going to talk about

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.940 
on this car so we're going to talk about
how<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.309> true<00:00:39.700> them<00:00:39.850> you<00:00:40.600> have<00:00:40.780> your<00:00:41.170> spokes

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
how to true them you have your spokes

off of the car yay and if the spokes are

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.420 
off of the car yay and if the spokes are
relatively<00:01:00.309> close<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:02.320> know<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:03.160> wheel

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
relatively close you know the wheel

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.800 
relatively close you know the wheel
should<00:01:03.760> be<00:01:03.940> able<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.150> run<00:01:04.360> through<00:01:04.540> within

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:04.810 
should be able to run through within

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.020 
should be able to run through within
about<00:01:04.930> an<00:01:05.140> eighth<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.410> an<00:01:05.530> inch<00:01:05.730> you<00:01:06.730> can<00:01:06.760> make

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
about an eighth of an inch you can make

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.540 
about an eighth of an inch you can make
slight<00:01:07.330> adjustments<00:01:07.480> in<00:01:07.990> your<00:01:08.050> outer<00:01:08.380> band<00:01:08.770> so

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
fellow here it also helps to have a nice

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.690 
fellow here it also helps to have a nice
wheel<00:01:42.820> and/or<00:01:43.630> tire<00:01:43.870> machine<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:45.430> be<00:01:45.520> able<00:01:45.610> to

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
wheel and/or tire machine to be able to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.960 
wheel and/or tire machine to be able to
work<00:01:45.910> on<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:47.590> once<00:01:47.770> you're<00:01:47.920> done<00:01:48.130> yes

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
work on and then once you're done yes

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.850 
work on and then once you're done yes
the<00:01:49.180> wheels<00:01:49.360> not<00:01:49.660> going<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:49.990> be<00:01:50.080> dead<00:01:50.410> ground

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
the wheels not going to be dead ground

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.550 
the wheels not going to be dead ground
most<00:01:51.250> aren't<00:01:51.780> even<00:01:52.780> spoke<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.200> wheels<00:01:53.350> or

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
most aren't even spoke the wheels or

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.170 
most aren't even spoke the wheels or
whatnot<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.070> then<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.370> use<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.580> tire<00:01:54.970> machine

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
whatnot so then you use a tire machine

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.670 
whatnot so then you use a tire machine
like<00:01:55.480> this<00:01:55.690> with<00:01:56.020> all<00:01:56.920> my<00:01:57.060> adapters<00:01:58.060> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
like this with all my adapters and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.850 
like this with all my adapters and
you're<00:01:59.680> able<00:01:59.860> to<00:02:00.190> then<00:02:00.790> shave<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.540> tire

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
you're able to then shave the tire

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.340
