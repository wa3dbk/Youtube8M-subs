this lever and it should go red yellow
green<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.810> pistons<00:00:22.230> will<00:00:22.350> go<00:00:22.439> up

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
green and then the pistons will go up

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and you can start the race I was when I

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.670 
and you can start the race I was when I
was<00:00:26.699> working<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> turns<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.529> this

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
was working on the turns this like this

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.109 
was working on the turns this like this
first<00:00:28.920> turn<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> actually<00:00:29.340> had<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.670> widen<00:00:29.910> it

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
first turn I actually had to widen it

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.709 
first turn I actually had to widen it
out<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:31.170> there's<00:00:32.040> only<00:00:32.250> its<00:00:33.000> kind<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
out like there's only its kind it was it

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.750 
out like there's only its kind it was it
was<00:00:33.840> kind<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.079> hard<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.370> maneuver<00:00:35.370> around<00:00:35.399> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
was kind of hard to maneuver around that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.030 
was kind of hard to maneuver around that
first<00:00:35.969> turn<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> had<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.320> widen<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:37.829> as

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
first turn so I had to widen it out as

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.700 
first turn so I had to widen it out as
you<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.520> there's<00:00:38.700> only<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.000> three

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
you can see there's only like three

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.790 
you can see there's only like three
squares<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.070> between<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> other<00:00:43.590> part

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
squares in between it and the other part

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.130 
squares in between it and the other part
of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> race<00:00:44.160> track<00:00:44.360> now<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.629> part<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.020> I'm

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
of the race track now this part that I'm

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.250 
of the race track now this part that I'm
coming<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.899> it's<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
coming up to right here is it's like it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
coming up to right here is it's like it
is<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.680> give<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> speed<00:00:50.370> boost<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
is to give you a speed boost really and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.110 
is to give you a speed boost really and
raises<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:52.850> drops<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.090> down

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
raises you up and then drops you down

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.930 
raises you up and then drops you down
and<00:00:54.719> gives<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> pretty<00:00:55.350> cool<00:00:55.469> speed<00:00:55.680> boost

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
and gives you a pretty cool speed boost

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.099 
and gives you a pretty cool speed boost
that<00:00:56.940> was<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.390> part<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.079> I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that was kind of a part that I do when I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.090 
that was kind of a part that I do when I
got<00:00:58.320> bored<00:00:59.359> yeah<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> giant<00:01:01.440> hole<00:01:01.620> but

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
got bored yeah there is a giant hole but

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.329 
got bored yeah there is a giant hole but
I<00:01:02.219> probably<00:01:02.460> need<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> fix<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.769> am<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:04.949> aware<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
I probably need to fix I am now aware of

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.920 
I probably need to fix I am now aware of
that<00:01:05.670> um<00:01:07.820> this<00:01:08.820> turn<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> kind<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that um this turn you have to kind of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.440 
that um this turn you have to kind of
slow<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.220> around<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.850> he

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
slow down actually to get around and he

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
slow down actually to get around and he
had<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> its<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.260> over<00:01:13.500> there<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.189> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
had it to its and over there but I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.679 
had it to its and over there but I
didn't<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.670> whole<00:01:14.790> racetrack<00:01:15.540> because

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
didn't do the whole racetrack because

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.440 
didn't do the whole racetrack because
that<00:01:15.960> would<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> take<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> long<00:01:17.520> time<00:01:17.850> now

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that would kind of take a long time now

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.899 
that would kind of take a long time now
this<00:01:18.630> part<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.049> dropped<00:01:19.409> down<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this part you dropped down and then you

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.749 
this part you dropped down and then you
have<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.500> beat<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.710> enough<00:01:22.950> speed<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> get

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
have to beat have enough speed to get

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.300 
have to beat have enough speed to get
back<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.990> forward<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.159> be

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
back up and then go forward and not be

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.859 
back up and then go forward and not be
pushed<00:01:26.549> back<00:01:26.700> by<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> waterfall<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.689> that's

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
pushed back by that waterfall so that's

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.440 
pushed back by that waterfall so that's
kind<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.400> difficult<00:01:29.400> part<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> move<00:01:30.090> around

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
kind of a difficult part to move around

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.940 
kind of a difficult part to move around
as<00:01:31.200> well<00:01:31.590> ah<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:33.150> green<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.380> red<00:01:34.409> part<00:01:34.829> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
as well ah the green and red part is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.600 
as well ah the green and red part is
like<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> checkpoint<00:01:36.470> it's<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.890> don't<00:01:38.460> I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
like a checkpoint it's like I don't I

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.530 
like a checkpoint it's like I don't I
don't<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:38.880> there's<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.270> checkpoint

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
don't know if there's like a checkpoint

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.090 
don't know if there's like a checkpoint
mod<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.320> I'll<00:01:40.439> look<00:01:40.590> into<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
mod but I'll look into that

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.179 
mod but I'll look into that
and<00:01:41.360> try<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> change<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.009> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and try to change that if there is a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.600 
and try to change that if there is a
checkpoint<00:01:44.460> mod<00:01:45.950> there<00:01:46.950> there<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.369> also

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
checkpoint mod there there are also

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
checkpoint mod there there are also
speed<00:01:48.149> boosts<00:01:48.390> there's<00:01:48.869> two<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.229> them<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
speed boosts there's two of them at the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560
