doesn't make a difference if you make a

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
make a travel 15 patients so everything

it's kind of pressed and what to be

it's kind of pressed and what to be
removed<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.200> cancer<00:03:33.410> cells<00:03:33.770> are<00:03:33.920> using

removed so the cancer cells are using

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.650 
removed so the cancer cells are using

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
autophagy more often because they are
