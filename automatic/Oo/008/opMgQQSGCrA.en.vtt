00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.380
 crucial match between two relegated to 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.970
 Nimes 19th against Istres 18th 3 points 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.450
 difference between these two formations 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.220
 so that's the match to win at all costs 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.290
 for the Olympic Nimes which is four 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.390
 corners of the seventh place for 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.640
 istres a success on the outside could 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.619
 to get out of the red zone because 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.210
 there is only one point behind this 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.070
 famous 17th place and these are the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.950
 Istreans who start best with 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.140
 this strikes the ball saved by the 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.590
 goalkeeper of the olympic nîmes cyrille 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.460
 merville 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.290
 it starts strong for the Provencal people 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.290
 answer it's Nîmes with this center 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.860
 ball released by goalkeeper arnaud 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.230
 balijon 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.470
 he replaces the suspended youth in the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.320
 goal istrean goalkeeper's exit is the 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.190
 rescue in extremis defense 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:04.079
 what an attack for crocos Nîmes 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.079
 while pale gion was beaten 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.190
 a game finally very open with a 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.570
 such an issue it was not obvious 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.030
 two teams let go in attack 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:20.270
 a lot of new opportunities huge 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:22.250
 opportunity for istres a balloon 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.490
 who grazes the post but still no 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.890
 success and keepers who are very 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.229
 solicited with the intervention of 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.479
 balijon then the pole to save the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.150
 Istrians still a chance with this 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.640
 missed recovery a second with this 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.710
 Strikes the deviation at close range 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.100
 the intervention of balijon excessively 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.649
 solicited only situations in this 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.820
 meet 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.050
 side Nîmes must attack without 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.070
 current is one of the good players of 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.710
 this season and corrèze 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.410
 both are injured that does not prevent 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.580
 to have a lot of goal situations 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.979
 Nîmes who took only two 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.470
 points over the last five games and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.320
 who seems determined to win this 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.360
 encounter istres problem also 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.040
 so stay at 0 0 at half time 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.810
 Nîmes who has not scored since three 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.220
 matches has still not succeeded in 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.590
 First 45 minutes of this meeting 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.930
 but will surely insist while they 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.610
 remain on two losses a win 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.900
 on the last seven games only 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.000
 for the Istréens who could 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.299
 eventually settle for the point of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.799
 no 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.930
 according to the results of others 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.940
 formations we start doing a lot 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.860
 calculations in both camps but the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.900
 Nine months to afford this kind 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.019
 of calculations then he continues to attack 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.810
 and it ends up paying in the 67th minute 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.980
 with this goal of vincent gragnic it's his 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.810
 eighth of the season 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.070
 he has long been hurt after having 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.799
 scored a lot of goals 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.900
 the previous seasons for nimes and he 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.540
 is finding himself in this 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.120
 end of the season is very useful for his 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.799
 club leading 1 0 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.720
 watch out for this big mistake of Cyril 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.760
 three minutes from the end 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.810
 he had already taken a yellow card at the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.840
 29th minute 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.829
 he takes another one in the 87th exclusion 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.829
 two young people 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.110
 and istres must end the match at 10 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.510
 against 11 of the Istreans who do not 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.300
 fail to come back and who 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.820
 suffer a very detrimental defeat 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.870
 or even resist and win the match 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.510
 that we had to believe forever 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.510
 success nîmois 1 0 against istres
