black ops 3 I feel like it's too good of
a<00:02:59.209> streak<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.689> it<00:03:00.139> makes<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:00.500> even<00:03:00.590> better<00:03:00.889> in

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
a streak and it makes it even better in

trouble<00:03:12.109> to<00:03:12.349> do<00:03:12.470> well<00:03:12.650> with<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.889> be<00:03:13.010> set<00:03:13.189> up<00:03:13.310> in

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
trouble to do well with the be set up in

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.280 
trouble to do well with the be set up in
the<00:03:13.519> air<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.639> points<00:03:14.269> are<00:03:14.359> like<00:03:14.750> pinpoints

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
the air that points are like pinpoints

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.129 
the air that points are like pinpoints
your<00:03:15.409> exact<00:03:15.799> location<00:03:15.980> stuff<00:03:16.549> like<00:03:16.730> that<00:03:16.940> so<00:03:17.269> I

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
your exact location stuff like that so I

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.930 
your exact location stuff like that so I
was<00:03:18.680> really<00:03:19.069> really<00:03:19.250> hoping<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.639> wasn't

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
was really really hoping that wasn't

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.250 
was really really hoping that wasn't
going<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.120> return<00:03:20.359> but<00:03:20.569> it<00:03:20.660> looks<00:03:20.870> like<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.139> is

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
going to return but it looks like it is

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.349 
going to return but it looks like it is
counter<00:03:21.650> UAVs<00:03:22.010> returning<00:03:22.430> UAVs<00:03:22.879> returning

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
counter UAVs returning UAVs returning

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.330 
counter UAVs returning UAVs returning
and<00:03:24.319> I'm<00:03:24.500> pretty<00:03:24.709> sure<00:03:24.889> it's<00:03:25.069> going<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.250> be<00:03:25.310> a

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
and I'm pretty sure it's going to be a

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.369 
and I'm pretty sure it's going to be a
score<00:03:26.239> streak<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:26.720> not<00:03:26.810> going<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.049> be<00:03:27.109> a<00:03:27.139> kill

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
score streak it's not going to be a kill

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:28.689 
score streak it's not going to be a kill
streak<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:27.739> not<00:03:27.980> gonna<00:03:28.159> be<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.310> point<00:03:28.519> streak

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
streak it's not gonna be a point streak

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.349 
streak it's not gonna be a point streak
it's<00:03:28.879> gonna<00:03:28.970> be<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> scorched<00:03:29.449> streak<00:03:29.629> again<00:03:29.870> so

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
it's gonna be a scorched streak again so

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.520 
it's gonna be a scorched streak again so

actually just leave the game because I

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.149 
actually just leave the game because I
you<00:03:44.930> can't<00:03:45.139> do<00:03:45.260> anything<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.859> I<00:03:45.919> would<00:03:46.069> be

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
forced to run in like UAV counter and

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.050 
forced to run in like UAV counter and
lightning<00:03:49.129> strike<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.579> that<00:03:49.669> was<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.849> only

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
lightning strike and that was the only

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.250 
lightning strike and that was the only
way<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.239> counter<00:03:50.540> some<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.840> parties<00:03:51.139> is

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
way to counter some of the parties is

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.569 
way to counter some of the parties is
running<00:03:51.530> lightning<00:03:51.829> strike<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:52.190> counter<00:03:52.459> UAV

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
running lightning strike and counter UAV

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.309 
running lightning strike and counter UAV
and<00:03:52.909> stuff<00:03:53.060> like<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.359> but<00:03:53.599> if<00:03:54.019> there<00:03:54.229> are

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
and stuff like that but if there are

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.300 
and stuff like that but if there are
smart<00:03:54.560> team<00:03:54.739> they're<00:03:54.859> gonna<00:03:54.979> shoot<00:03:55.159> that

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
smart team they're gonna shoot that

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.849 
smart team they're gonna shoot that
counter<00:03:55.579> down<00:03:55.729> extremely<00:03:56.359> quickly<00:03:56.569> so<00:03:56.959> it's

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
counter down extremely quickly so it's

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.199 
counter down extremely quickly so it's
it's<00:03:58.099> always<00:03:58.220> really<00:03:58.549> difficult<00:03:58.639> plan

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
it's always really difficult plan

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.550 
it's always really difficult plan
against<00:03:59.449> the<00:03:59.510> party<00:03:59.840> and<00:03:59.959> if<00:04:00.079> you're<00:04:00.229> if<00:04:00.470> you

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
against the party and if you're if you

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.930 
against the party and if you're if you
were<00:04:00.680> always<00:04:00.889> playing<00:04:01.190> against<00:04:01.549> constant

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
were always playing against constant

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.909 
were always playing against constant
parties<00:04:02.239> in<00:04:02.359> this<00:04:02.419> game

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
parties in this game

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.589 
parties in this game
my<00:04:03.919> suggestion<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.609> is<00:04:04.940> just<00:04:05.209> try<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.389> get<00:04:05.569> a

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
my suggestion is is just try to get a

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.659 
my suggestion is is just try to get a
three-man<00:04:05.989> party<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.709> really<00:04:07.099> solid<00:04:07.400> players

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
three-man party of really solid players

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.789 
three-man party of really solid players
and<00:04:07.909> usually<00:04:08.209> if<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.900> have<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.199> really<00:04:09.500> solid

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
and usually if you have to really solid

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.110 
and usually if you have to really solid
players<00:04:10.040> playing<00:04:10.340> with<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.549> and<00:04:10.729> your<00:04:10.819> solid

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
players playing with you and your solid

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.819 
players playing with you and your solid
as<00:04:11.239> well<00:04:11.419> you<00:04:11.690> can<00:04:11.840> easily<00:04:12.049> win<00:04:12.409> these<00:04:12.620> types

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
as well you can easily win these types

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.800 
as well you can easily win these types
of<00:04:13.010> match<00:04:13.190> matches<00:04:14.150> because<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.569> could<00:04:14.690> have

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
of match matches because you could have

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.300 
of match matches because you could have
one<00:04:15.019> guy<00:04:15.169> day<00:04:15.229> one<00:04:15.560> guy<00:04:15.709> beat<00:04:15.949> one<00:04:16.130> guy<00:04:16.250> that's

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
one guy day one guy beat one guy that's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.039 
one guy day one guy beat one guy that's
et<00:04:16.760> cetera<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.389> pulling<00:04:17.659> them<00:04:17.720> off<00:04:17.870> like

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
et cetera and pulling them off like

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.599 
et cetera and pulling them off like
fiber<00:04:18.320> just<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.739> save<00:04:18.889> one<00:04:19.070> flag<00:04:19.280> I<00:04:19.459> could

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
fiber just to save one flag I could

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.019 
fiber just to save one flag I could
easily<00:04:19.760> hold<00:04:20.090> them<00:04:20.209> off<00:04:21.490> but<00:04:22.490> unfortunately

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:23.029 
easily hold them off but unfortunately

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:24.339 
easily hold them off but unfortunately
there's<00:04:23.240> three<00:04:23.419> flags<00:04:23.659> and<00:04:23.930> there's<00:04:24.050> only<00:04:24.139> one

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
there's three flags and there's only one

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.480 
there's three flags and there's only one
of<00:04:24.440> me<00:04:24.500> if<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.740> guys<00:04:24.830> know<00:04:24.979> what<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.099> mean<00:04:25.250> but
