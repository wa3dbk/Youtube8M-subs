00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
like to do this because it is easier and

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.620 
like to do this because it is easier and
I<00:01:55.950> didn't<00:01:56.280> want<00:01:56.429> my<00:01:56.460> roots<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.819> be<00:01:56.909> dark<00:01:57.149> I'm

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
and then what about roots to be

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.510 
and then what about roots to be
lightened<00:01:59.940> so<00:02:00.240> yeah<00:02:00.450> kept<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
lightened so yeah kept it like that and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
just doing what I did to the first

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
just doing what I did to the first
bundle<00:02:05.130> since<00:02:05.729> they're<00:02:05.850> all<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> same<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
bundle since they're all the same it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.050 
bundle since they're all the same it
does<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:06.810> matter<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.259> I'm<00:02:07.640> gonna<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.880> I'm

does really matter what I'm gonna do I'm
just<00:02:09.090> doing<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.720> same<00:02:09.899> color<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.470> still<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
just doing the same color so still the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.920

same<00:02:11.370> process<00:02:11.579> to<00:02:11.850> all<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> bundles<00:02:12.420> as<00:02:12.750> you

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
same process to all the bundles as you

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.220 
same process to all the bundles as you
guys<00:02:13.049> can<00:02:13.260> see<00:02:17.120> when<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.209> use<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> plastic<00:02:18.959> cover

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
guys can see when I use a plastic cover

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.440 
guys can see when I use a plastic cover
just<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.620> case<00:02:19.799> um<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.579> lot<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> dog<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.269> don't

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
just in case um a lot of the dog I don't

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.599 
just in case um a lot of the dog I don't
like<00:02:21.630> all<00:02:21.810> over<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.049> place<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.310> with<00:02:23.459> this

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
like all over the place so with this

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.330 
like all over the place so with this
bundle<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:24.000> decided<00:02:24.329> to<00:02:24.660> cut<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.380> herb<00:02:26.040> and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
bundle I decided to cut the herb and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.740 
bundle I decided to cut the herb and
that<00:02:26.549> was<00:02:26.670> holding<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.150> back<00:02:27.329> because<00:02:27.720> I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
that was holding it back because I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.479 
that was holding it back because I
didn't<00:02:28.019> want<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.230> bundle<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.709> have<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.280> dark

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
didn't want this bundle to have the dark

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.740 
didn't want this bundle to have the dark
roots<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.180> want<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.390> make<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.510> look<00:02:30.720> more

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
roots I just want to make it look more

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.590 
roots I just want to make it look more
like<00:02:30.930> highlighted<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:33.329> wasn't<00:02:33.480> really

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
like highlighted and I wasn't really

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.330 
like highlighted and I wasn't really
going<00:02:33.840> for<00:02:33.959> ombre<00:02:34.380> effect<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.829> just<00:02:34.980> didn't

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
going for ombre effect I just didn't

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.370 
going for ombre effect I just didn't
want<00:02:35.519> my<00:02:35.670> roots<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> same<00:02:36.810> color<00:02:36.989> I

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
want my roots to be the same color I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.710 
want my roots to be the same color I
don't<00:02:37.859> know<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.160> didn't<00:02:38.370> wanted<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.609> do<00:02:38.730> it

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.699 

since<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> third<00:02:42.989> bundle<00:02:43.200> I'm<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
since the third bundle I'm just going to

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.080 
since the third bundle I'm just going to
drench<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.280> hair<00:02:44.549> just<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.850> did<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
drench the hair just like I did the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.039 
drench the hair just like I did the
other<00:02:45.239> bundles<00:02:47.359> this<00:02:48.359> one<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:48.570> bottle<00:02:48.810> started

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
other bundles this one my bottle started

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.630 
other bundles this one my bottle started
getting<00:02:49.230> empty<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.890> mean<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.160> had<00:02:50.280> enough<00:02:50.519> to

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
getting empty but I mean I had enough to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.240 
getting empty but I mean I had enough to
do<00:02:50.790> all<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.299> three<00:02:51.530> bundles<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:53.010> closure

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
do all the three bundles and a closure

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.650 
do all the three bundles and a closure
so<00:02:53.489> if<00:02:53.549> you<00:02:53.640> have<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:54.000> than<00:02:54.120> three<00:02:54.299> bundles

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
so if you have more than three bundles

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.090 
so if you have more than three bundles
on<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> closure<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.200> might<00:02:55.590> want<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.890> get<00:02:56.040> a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
on a closure you might want to get a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.250 
on a closure you might want to get a
second<00:02:56.640> box<00:02:56.850> on<00:02:57.060> da<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.930> feel<00:02:58.079> like<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
second box on da and I feel like the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.259 
second box on da and I feel like the
only<00:02:58.350> reason<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.769> box<00:02:59.130> da<00:02:59.549> lasted<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.239> long

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
only reason this box da lasted so long

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.509 
only reason this box da lasted so long
with<00:03:00.600> me<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.780> because<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.019> had<00:03:01.319> my<00:03:02.010> own<00:03:02.160> separate

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
with me is because I had my own separate

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.099 
with me is because I had my own separate
developer<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.209> could<00:03:03.450> make<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.810> color

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
developer so I could make the color

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.520 
developer so I could make the color
stretch<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> little<00:03:04.560> bit<00:03:04.680> longer<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:07.140> when<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
stretch a little bit longer and when the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.050 
stretch a little bit longer and when the
closure<00:03:07.709> here<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.069> as<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.579> guys<00:03:08.669> can<00:03:08.790> see<00:03:08.850> I'm

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
closure here and as you guys can see I'm

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.520 
closure here and as you guys can see I'm
just<00:03:09.090> using<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.510> let's<00:03:09.660> own<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.459> plastic<00:03:11.459> bag

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
just using the let's own the plastic bag

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.220 
just using the let's own the plastic bag
to<00:03:12.980> drench<00:03:13.610> my<00:03:13.790> closure<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.450> as<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.960> guys<00:03:15.110> can

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
to drench my closure and as you guys can

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.320 
to drench my closure and as you guys can
see<00:03:15.350> was<00:03:15.590> enough<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.160> again<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.820> left<00:03:17.090> the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
see was enough and I again I left the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.850 
see was enough and I again I left the
roots<00:03:17.570> dark<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.080> my<00:03:18.170> closure<00:03:18.380> mainly<00:03:18.740> because

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
roots dark of my closure mainly because

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.500 
roots dark of my closure mainly because
I<00:03:18.980> don't<00:03:19.040> want<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.310> get<00:03:19.460> any<00:03:19.940> hair<00:03:20.210> color<00:03:20.240> on

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
I don't want to get any hair color on

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.820 
I don't want to get any hair color on
the<00:03:20.750> lace<00:03:20.930> because<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.290> didn't<00:03:21.470> want<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.620> stay

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
the lace because I didn't want to stay

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.970 
the lace because I didn't want to stay
in<00:03:21.950> my<00:03:21.980> lace

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
in my lace

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.950 
in my lace
so<00:03:24.980> yeah<00:03:25.190> it's<00:03:25.940> massaging<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.480> through<00:03:26.660> making

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
so yeah it's massaging it through making

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.300 
so yeah it's massaging it through making
it<00:03:27.020> a<00:03:27.050> little<00:03:27.170> bit<00:03:27.290> more<00:03:27.440> sporadic<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.070> kind<00:03:28.250> of
