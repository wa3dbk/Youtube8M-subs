 second album entitled in the scenery that rushes head down to the wall of 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.509
 its shameless or even the precaution yes that's what's good 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.059
 virbac-paprec 3 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.059

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.030
 everybody 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.170
 total announced at the same time called for the establishment of a corridor 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.490
 to the universe to render in the proposed options all rights on 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.280
 scene with them 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.860
 so I guess different degrees what gives a lure the mix of 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.390
 all that 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.230
 so the minister all 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.410
 it's really hard to say because 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.580
 I am told that we are going fast enough to work 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.010
 % a good way to see india to tackle our songs all this 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.190
 donations that are recent for a constant evolution the group has 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.810
 now two years 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.040
 it sounds dma not like flies finally I imagine the rock a little 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.280
 attenuated 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.360
 there is something 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.110
 maybe something the two strains isolated the something 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.660
 a small fire on the side 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.420
 after the withdrawal of the ceb raillard 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
 for 100 m there are even a few soles too 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.120
 something socoa to love himself in the many pieces 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.130
 learn term crowded push is very wide especially 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.340
 proof that 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.980
 american english cwa 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 we will say the debtor this was 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.750
 mm 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.260
 earlier we also in purposes 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.520
 many of the fina lement many big names of hard critics what 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.559
 thanks to God 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.789
 ending on September 10 with both 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.559
 of rage because a year ago 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.939
 you embody the art of the middle ages of shirts revive this raw energy

 in percentage its some 800 cm3 which will come as soon as one goes on stage 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.529
 for 100 m certainly not calculate his hours 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.459
 that's what we knew the commissioners were 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.059
 yet he tries to spend himself in concert but still we are 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.699
 perfectly 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:06.890
 no but it's a 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.890
 it's like that becomes coherent for the world 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.089
 we did not calculate at all the liquidator benefit increase 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.180
 it is quite naturally in the second set all three have found m 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.839
 but in January the band different to with pat drummer attention and 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.129
 behind google 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.590
 we're waiting we had a group together that was not at all in this 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.469
 aesthetic 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.870
 but as we wanted to go up, we were five pieces we had before 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.869
 and we wanted to go back something more weigh 100 skies here 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.300
 this is something that goes fast those who help themselves 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.300
 to touch just in case 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.969
 didier alix's there is this energy that evokes exit 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:46.849
 all this said like that
