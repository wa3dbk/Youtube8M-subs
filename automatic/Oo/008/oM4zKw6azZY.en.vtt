00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
the command line this defrag program

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:35.020 
the command line this defrag program
which<00:00:25.550> you<00:00:25.820> run<00:00:26.119> in<00:00:27.340> command<00:00:28.340> prompt<00:00:33.850> so<00:00:34.850> you

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
which you run in command prompt so you

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:44.670 
which you run in command prompt so you
download<00:00:35.330> it<00:00:35.900> from<00:00:36.430> Microsoft

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:11.330 

the<00:02:04.460> answer

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:20.740 

and<00:02:11.430> they<00:02:12.150> created

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:37.309 

Oh

00:02:45.510 --> 00:03:11.050 

let's<00:02:46.350> drag

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.980 

now

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.370 

defrag<00:03:18.920> my<00:03:19.310> entire<00:03:20.560> cedar<00:03:21.560> on

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.600 

so<00:03:24.950> does<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.520> Conte<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.210> they're<00:03:26.540> our<00:03:27.610> stop

so does the Conte and they're our stop
the<00:03:29.030> program<00:03:30.220> recording<00:03:31.220> now<00:03:32.590> see<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.770> later

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.180 

okay<00:03:38.270> I'm<00:03:38.510> back<00:03:38.960> so<00:03:39.710> after<00:03:40.490> about<00:03:41.200> an<00:03:42.200> hour<00:03:42.350> or

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
okay I'm back so after about an hour or

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.240 
okay I'm back so after about an hour or
so<00:03:44.200> my<00:03:45.200> C<00:03:45.860> Drive<00:03:46.000> been<00:03:47.000> fully

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
so my C Drive been fully

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.020 
so my C Drive been fully
defragmented<00:03:49.310> for<00:03:49.760> contig<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.950> as<00:03:52.520> you<00:03:52.820> can

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
defragmented for contig so as you can

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:03.250 
defragmented for contig so as you can
see<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.990> d<00:03:54.410> fragmented<00:03:56.950> 351<00:03:58.270> files<00:03:59.270> and<00:04:02.260> and

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
see that d fragmented 351 files and and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.480 
see that d fragmented 351 files and and
the<00:04:03.890> average<00:04:04.930> fragmentation<00:04:05.930> before<00:04:06.500> was<00:04:06.890> one

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
the average fragmentation before was one

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.190 
the average fragmentation before was one
point<00:04:07.850> zero<00:04:08.060> one<00:04:08.750> zero<00:04:09.580> for<00:04:10.580> three<00:04:10.940> tracks<00:04:11.630> per

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
point zero one zero for three tracks per

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.580 
point zero one zero for three tracks per
file<00:04:12.500> now<00:04:13.220> it's<00:04:13.250> one<00:04:14.180> fret<00:04:15.130> per<00:04:16.130> file<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:18.260> just

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
file now it's one fret per file so just

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.260 
file now it's one fret per file so just
to<00:04:18.980> tell<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.520> the<00:04:20.090> Frog<00:04:20.450> hard<00:04:21.049> drive<00:04:21.590> will

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
to tell you the Frog hard drive will

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.060 
to tell you the Frog hard drive will
contain<00:04:23.270> which<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.470> command<00:04:24.920> line<00:04:27.070> just

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
contain which is the command line just

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.610 
contain which is the command line just
differ<00:04:28.520> enter<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:30.590> have<00:04:31.010> these<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:32.620> industry

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
differ enter and have these the industry

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.570 
differ enter and have these the industry
there

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:53.820 

but<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:41.080> have<00:04:41.230> to<00:04:41.440> run<00:04:44.430> administrator<00:04:52.830> like

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
but you have to run administrator like

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.820 
but you have to run administrator like
so<00:04:55.170> run<00:04:56.170> as<00:04:57.210> administrator<00:04:58.210> so<00:04:58.780> that's<00:04:59.350> for

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
so run as administrator so that's for

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.800 
so run as administrator so that's for
watching<00:05:01.800> good
