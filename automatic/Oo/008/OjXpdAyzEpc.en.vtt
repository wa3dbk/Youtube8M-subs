00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
the Rings so it's not that bad and now

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.649 
the Rings so it's not that bad and now
we're<00:02:21.970> gonna<00:02:22.150> go<00:02:22.329> down<00:02:22.569> to<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.930> deep<00:02:23.140> mine<00:02:23.439> and

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
we're gonna go down to the deep mine and

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.619 
we're gonna go down to the deep mine and
have<00:02:25.659> a<00:02:25.689> closer<00:02:26.049> look<00:02:26.379> how<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:27.390> man<00:02:28.390> card

spiders and zombies and whatnot will

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.250 
spiders and zombies and whatnot will
disturb<00:02:35.530> us<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:37.209> we're<00:02:37.510> back<00:02:37.689> down<00:02:37.959> at<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
disturb us so we're back down at the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.860 
disturb us so we're back down at the
deep<00:02:38.500> mind<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.129> this<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.870> minecart

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
deep mind and this is the minecart

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.849 
deep mind and this is the minecart
station<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:42.359> can<00:02:43.359> reach<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.959> globe<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.409> stress

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
station I can reach the globe of stress

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.220 
station I can reach the globe of stress
adamo<00:02:45.549> stress<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:47.159> minecart<00:02:48.159> boost<00:02:48.549> it<00:02:48.849> and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
adamo stress so minecart boost it and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.690 
adamo stress so minecart boost it and
let's<00:02:50.230> set<00:02:50.409> out<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.799> didn't<00:02:51.159> change<00:02:51.400> anything

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
let's set out I didn't change anything

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.720 
let's set out I didn't change anything
in<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> tunnels<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.989> caves<00:02:53.950> below<00:02:54.250> here

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
in the tunnels and the caves below here

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.690 
in the tunnels and the caves below here
because<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.239> think<00:02:55.389> yeah<00:02:56.459> they<00:02:57.459> are<00:02:57.519> really

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
because I think yeah they are really

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.800 
because I think yeah they are really
nice<00:02:58.319> that's<00:02:59.319> nothing<00:02:59.639> need<00:03:00.639> it<00:03:00.790> down<00:03:01.000> here<00:03:01.299> so

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
nice that's nothing need it down here so

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.910 
nice that's nothing need it down here so
we<00:03:01.840> go<00:03:02.139> up<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:03.780> soon<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:05.049> will<00:03:05.170> reach<00:03:05.439> two<00:03:05.769> and

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
we go up and soon we will reach two and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.240 
we go up and soon we will reach two and
the<00:03:06.129> world<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.430> minecart<00:03:06.879> right<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:08.189> take<00:03:09.189> a

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
the world a minecart right and take a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.420 
the world a minecart right and take a
look<00:03:10.290> yeah<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.609> let<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.569> rings<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:14.430> one

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
look yeah that's it let the rings of one

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.369 
look yeah that's it let the rings of one
light<00:03:15.879> stone<00:03:16.209> source<00:03:16.599> block<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:17.019> top<00:03:19.379> one

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
light stone source block on top one

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.619 
light stone source block on top one
light<00:03:20.590> stone<00:03:20.859> block<00:03:21.129> on<00:03:21.310> top<00:03:21.340> for<00:03:21.970> lighting

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
light stone block on top for lighting

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.930 
light stone block on top for lighting
and<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:23.590> looks<00:03:23.799> really<00:03:23.889> cool<00:03:24.340> with<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.699> new

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
and it looks really cool with the new

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.640 
and it looks really cool with the new
smooth<00:03:25.540> sliding<00:03:26.010> feature<00:03:27.010> yeah<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:28.480> it

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
smooth sliding feature yeah I like it

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.770 
smooth sliding feature yeah I like it
and<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.829> think<00:03:29.889> it<00:03:30.250> gives<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.579> rider<00:03:30.790> kind<00:03:31.690> of

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
and I think it gives the rider kind of

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.729 
and I think it gives the rider kind of
more<00:03:31.989> structure<00:03:32.620> some<00:03:32.919> kind<00:03:33.159> of<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.459> warp<00:03:34.060> gate

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
more structure some kind of a warp gate

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.710 
more structure some kind of a warp gate
feeling<00:03:36.269> yeah<00:03:37.769> turned<00:03:38.769> out<00:03:38.919> nicely<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.730> on

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
feeling yeah turned out nicely and on

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.479 
feeling yeah turned out nicely and on
top<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:40.989> can<00:03:41.260> see<00:03:41.319> I<00:03:41.560> added<00:03:41.889> those<00:03:42.040> lanterns

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489

well I'm might underwater to pier is not
very<00:03:52.989> deep<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.979> basically<00:03:54.909> there's<00:03:55.180> only<00:03:55.329> one

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
very deep and basically there's only one

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.319 
very deep and basically there's only one
blog<00:03:55.870> above<00:03:56.229> it<00:03:56.409> and<00:03:56.530> then<00:03:56.769> there's<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.329> water

blog above it and then there's the water

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.640 
blog above it and then there's the water
surface<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.650> I<00:04:00.190> had<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.349> go<00:04:02.349> for<00:04:02.620> some

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
surface so I had to go for some

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.550 
surface so I had to go for some
compromise<00:04:03.389> to<00:04:04.389> make<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:04.690> look<00:04:04.870> cool<00:04:05.139> excuse

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.969 
the rings then you can or will
understand<00:04:47.909> why<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.870> did<00:04:48.960> him<00:04:49.229> like<00:04:49.439> that<00:04:49.650> and

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
understand why I did him like that and

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.070 
understand why I did him like that and
not<00:04:50.270> like<00:04:51.919> continuous<00:04:53.449> circle<00:04:54.449> wrapping

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
not like continuous circle wrapping

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.059 
not like continuous circle wrapping
around<00:04:55.199> or<00:04:55.710> something<00:04:55.860> like<00:04:56.159> that<00:04:56.990> see

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
around or something like that see

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.189 
around or something like that see
there's<00:04:59.069> only<00:04:59.310> one<00:04:59.699> block<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.419> then<00:05:00.810> we<00:05:00.990> got

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
there's only one block and then we got

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.029 
there's only one block and then we got
the<00:05:01.460> channel<00:05:02.460> on<00:05:02.849> a<00:05:02.909> tunnel<00:05:03.529> so<00:05:04.529> I<00:05:04.560> had<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.860> do

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
the channel on a tunnel so I had to do

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.399 
the channel on a tunnel so I had to do
it<00:05:05.129> like<00:05:05.340> this<00:05:07.099> lava<00:05:08.099> goes<00:05:08.400> around<00:05:08.759> and<00:05:09.409> I

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
it like this lava goes around and I

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.640 
it like this lava goes around and I
close<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.710> off<00:05:11.009> with<00:05:11.490> those<00:05:11.729> half<00:05:12.120> slabs<00:05:12.650> and

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
close it off with those half slabs and

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.689 
close it off with those half slabs and
then<00:05:13.909> thought<00:05:14.909> maybe<00:05:15.949> well<00:05:16.949> you<00:05:17.159> can<00:05:17.370> see<00:05:17.580> it

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
then thought maybe well you can see it

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.540 
then thought maybe well you can see it
now<00:05:17.729> anyway<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:19.050> let's<00:05:19.259> give<00:05:19.529> it<00:05:19.560> some<00:05:19.680> better

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
now anyway so let's give it some better

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.790 
now anyway so let's give it some better
look<00:05:20.930> that's<00:05:21.930> why<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.139> added<00:05:22.819> the<00:05:23.819> torches

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
look that's why I added the torches

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.249 
look that's why I added the torches
order<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:26.039> lanterns<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:27.020> who<00:05:28.020> knows<00:05:28.199> maybe

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
order the lanterns and who knows maybe

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.079 
order the lanterns and who knows maybe
in<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.860> future<00:05:29.009> if<00:05:29.370> there<00:05:29.550> are<00:05:29.639> some<00:05:29.909> new

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
in the future if there are some new

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:31.640 
in the future if there are some new
water<00:05:30.360> mops<00:05:30.659> or<00:05:30.839> something<00:05:31.229> maybe<00:05:31.349> they<00:05:31.560> will

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
water mops or something maybe they will

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.309 
water mops or something maybe they will
get<00:05:31.830> caught<00:05:32.129> in<00:05:32.310> there<00:05:32.490> or<00:05:32.699> or<00:05:32.940> whatnot<00:05:33.330> but

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
get caught in there or or whatnot but

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:37.879 
get caught in there or or whatnot but
turned<00:05:35.190> out<00:05:35.339> well<00:05:35.639> and<00:05:35.879> they're<00:05:36.810> all<00:05:37.050> ten

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
turned out well and they're all ten

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.740 
turned out well and they're all ten
blocks<00:05:38.129> apart<00:05:38.400> i<00:05:38.759> guess<00:05:38.969> if<00:05:39.300> i<00:05:39.449> remember

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
blocks apart i guess if i remember

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.899 
blocks apart i guess if i remember
correctly<00:05:40.349> but<00:05:40.650> i<00:05:40.710> think<00:05:41.069> it<00:05:41.219> was<00:05:41.339> ten<00:05:41.610> blocks

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
correctly but i think it was ten blocks

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.890 
correctly but i think it was ten blocks
and<00:05:42.270> now<00:05:42.900> we<00:05:42.960> are<00:05:43.169> gonna<00:05:43.319> head<00:05:43.529> straight<00:05:43.800> and

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
and now we are gonna head straight and

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.529 
and now we are gonna head straight and
towards<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:45.990> light<00:05:46.259> tower<00:05:46.969> i<00:05:47.969> tella<00:05:48.240> sort<00:05:48.479> of

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
towards the light tower i tella sort of

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.159 
towards the light tower i tella sort of
signal<00:05:48.900> tower<00:05:49.339> passing<00:05:50.389> the<00:05:51.389> remains<00:05:51.750> of<00:05:51.960> one

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
signal tower passing the remains of one

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.110 
signal tower passing the remains of one
of<00:05:52.199> the<00:05:52.409> islands<00:05:52.860> that<00:05:53.009> were<00:05:53.039> around<00:05:53.550> here<00:05:53.879> and

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
of the islands that were around here and

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.439 
of the islands that were around here and
i<00:05:54.539> basically<00:05:54.750> chop<00:05:55.259> them<00:05:55.469> all<00:05:55.650> down<00:05:56.300> or<00:05:57.300> the

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
i basically chop them all down or the

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.309 
i basically chop them all down or the
sand<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:58.080> send<00:05:58.379> some<00:05:58.650> sand<00:05:59.099> stone<00:05:59.430> and<00:06:00.319> glass

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
sand to send some sand stone and glass

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.809 
sand to send some sand stone and glass
and<00:06:01.379> stuff<00:06:02.009> and<00:06:04.310> didn't<00:06:05.310> change<00:06:05.550> too<00:06:05.789> much

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
and stuff and didn't change too much

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.570 
and stuff and didn't change too much
around<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.870> shore<00:06:07.169> site<00:06:07.500> here<00:06:07.740> i<00:06:07.830> want<00:06:08.039> to

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
around the shore site here i want to

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.529 
around the shore site here i want to
keep<00:06:08.759> the<00:06:08.939> natural<00:06:09.120> look<00:06:09.629> and<00:06:10.219> there<00:06:11.219> we<00:06:11.310> go

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
keep the natural look and there we go

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:18.469 
keep the natural look and there we go
it's<00:06:12.539> the<00:06:12.719> tower<00:06:14.150> really<00:06:15.150> nice<00:06:15.360> i<00:06:17.300> did<00:06:18.300> some

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
it's the tower really nice i did some

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.869 
it's the tower really nice i did some
diagonal<00:06:20.330> building<00:06:21.330> styles<00:06:21.960> some<00:06:22.289> waterfalls

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:22.879 
diagonal building styles some waterfalls

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.350 
diagonal building styles some waterfalls
sunlight<00:06:23.879> stone<00:06:24.330> and<00:06:25.370> TM

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
sunlight stone and TM

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.020 
sunlight stone and TM
the<00:06:27.990> objective<00:06:28.590> of<00:06:28.860> this<00:06:29.219> thing<00:06:29.490> is<00:06:29.669> to<00:06:29.849> make

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
the objective of this thing is to make

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.899 
the objective of this thing is to make
it<00:06:30.210> visible<00:06:30.419> from<00:06:31.409> longer<00:06:31.770> distances<00:06:32.400> so

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
it visible from longer distances so

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:36.200 
it visible from longer distances so
because<00:06:33.479> yeah<00:06:33.750> this<00:06:34.139> is<00:06:34.259> eSport<00:06:34.830> so<00:06:35.759> when<00:06:36.060> we

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
because yeah this is eSport so when we

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.040 
because yeah this is eSport so when we
go<00:06:36.360> head<00:06:36.629> out<00:06:37.099> towards<00:06:38.099> this<00:06:38.250> direction<00:06:39.050> we

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
go head out towards this direction we

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.719 
go head out towards this direction we
need<00:06:40.199> some<00:06:40.409> orientation<00:06:40.889> and<00:06:41.340> where<00:06:41.610> I'm

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
need some orientation and where I'm

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.390 
need some orientation and where I'm
gonna<00:06:42.030> make<00:06:42.240> a<00:06:42.270> compass<00:06:42.840> and<00:06:43.110> we<00:06:43.949> gotta<00:06:44.159> leave

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
gonna make a compass and we gotta leave

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.909 
gonna make a compass and we gotta leave
the<00:06:44.460> spawning<00:06:44.879> point<00:06:45.330> around<00:06:46.259> here<00:06:46.620> and

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
the spawning point around here and

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.149 
the spawning point around here and
basically<00:06:47.340> it's<00:06:47.759> up<00:06:47.879> the<00:06:48.210> tower<00:06:48.479> I<00:06:49.159> haven't

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159 
basically it's up the tower I haven't

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.640 
basically it's up the tower I haven't
talked<00:06:50.400> about<00:06:50.520> that<00:06:50.699> I<00:06:51.150> used<00:06:51.810> a<00:06:51.990> trick<00:06:52.349> called

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
talked about that I used a trick called

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.520 
talked about that I used a trick called
moving<00:06:53.039> up<00:06:53.159> to<00:06:53.340> spawn<00:06:53.639> and<00:06:53.909> and<00:06:54.900> basically

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
moving up to spawn and and basically

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.070 
moving up to spawn and and basically
moved<00:06:56.129> the<00:06:56.520> spawn<00:06:56.789> part<00:06:57.030> up<00:06:57.180> on<00:06:57.449> this<00:06:57.629> hill<00:06:57.900> and

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
moved the spawn part up on this hill and

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.230 
moved the spawn part up on this hill and
when<00:06:58.650> I<00:06:58.680> was<00:06:58.919> building<00:06:59.129> I<00:06:59.400> did<00:06:59.639> it<00:06:59.759> again<00:06:59.879> and

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
when I was building I did it again and

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.649 
when I was building I did it again and
finally<00:07:00.599> it<00:07:01.110> was<00:07:01.259> up<00:07:01.469> on<00:07:01.710> the<00:07:02.639> tower<00:07:02.909> it<00:07:03.509> was<00:07:03.629> a

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:03.659 
finally it was up on the tower it was a

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:05.390 
finally it was up on the tower it was a
big<00:07:03.930> thing<00:07:03.960> I<00:07:04.349> was<00:07:04.500> really<00:07:04.770> happy<00:07:04.949> about<00:07:05.129> it

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
big thing I was really happy about it

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.749 
big thing I was really happy about it
but<00:07:05.580> with<00:07:05.789> the<00:07:05.939> beds<00:07:06.180> well<00:07:06.779> so<00:07:07.710> far<00:07:07.979> stopped

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 
but with the beds well so far stopped

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:11.029 
but with the beds well so far stopped
and<00:07:09.060> we're<00:07:09.719> not<00:07:09.810> gonna<00:07:10.080> build<00:07:10.560> a<00:07:10.650> bed<00:07:10.830> and

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039
