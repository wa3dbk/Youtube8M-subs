00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.919
 [Music] 

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello, how are we going to learn today? 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.049
 make this cute bracelet 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.280
 we are going to need the following 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.010
 materials crystals see the accounts of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 optional silver and the transparent a 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.910
 clasp to close the bracelet here there 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.920
 many options there are some of magnets that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.920
 they are quite useful and scissors 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.759
 first of all let's take our 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.500
 transparent thread and we will fold it 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.510
 in half this way 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.170
 let's measure the approximate length of 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.120
 our bracelet 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.350
 [Music] 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.350
 thus 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.820
 and we cut the yarn quite loose 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.559
 it is quite long approximately 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.629
 double what we need what 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.640
 we cut back and keep on 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.800
 this position folded in half 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.070
 we take a part of the brooch 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.770
 we are going to insert it in the thread and 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.290
 let's put it right in the middle 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.360
 [Music] 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.050
 we make a knot that is enough 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.199
 resistant 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.740
 [Music] 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.380
 check that the knot is well made 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.780
 ready now we go to the tips 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.560
 and we take it in this position the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.370
 two tips 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.770
 the brooch is at the center 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.280
 at each point of the thread we are going to add 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280
 A crystal 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.009
 so it must be seen 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.479
 we take the tips of the thread and go 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.610
 the crystals until the end of the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.540
 bracelet 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.970
 [Music] 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.750
 again we go to the tip and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.720
 now let's take a pearl 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.870
 we insert you in one of the threads 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.080
 in this way we now take the other 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.130
 tip and we're going to insert the thread by 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.530
 above 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.610
 in such a way that a cross between 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.250
 the two threads when it's done we're going to 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.850
 go through the pearl until the end of the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.159
 bracelet 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.289
 [Music] 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.269
 let's repeat the step of the two 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.780
 crystals we take the two ends of the 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.960
 thread and insert a crystal in each 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.560
 tip 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.980
 we go through the end of the bracelet and 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.890
 we repeat the step with the pearl 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.330
 and this step we are going to repeat 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.000
 until we have the length that we need 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.460
 Bracelet 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.310
 something that I can recommend you is that 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.650
 every two simple pearls that you put 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.020
 add a silver or other pearl 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.380
 color to highlight more this is 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.380
 optional 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.480
 in this bracelet I added two pearls 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.160
 white and then more silver I'm not going 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.380
 to add the two crystals the pearl 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.270
 white two crystals a white pearl 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.270
 two crystals and again the silver one 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.520
 when you have enough length to 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.520
 your bracelet 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.280
 we are going to calculate that it is more or less 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.950
 of this length so you can close without 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.070
 problem with this type of clasp 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.070
 [Music] 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.450
 we make a knot to finish the fabric 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.430
 of the bracelet 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.470
 make sure it is well closed and that 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.960
 do not undo the knot 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.480
 and to finish we will add the other 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.489
 brooch 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.080
 we are going to insert the knot of the threads 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.209
 and with the other we are going to make a knot what 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.510
 strong enough so that it does not 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.400
 fall 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.769
 [Music] 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.460
 when ready the knot cuts the thread 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:49.730
 what about and we have the bracelet ready 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.110
 the truth is that it looks pretty elegant 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.110
 and with the crystals it stands out 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.340
 Here I show you another type of bracelet that 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.010
 make 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.440
 where I only put pearls and the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.780
 crystal is otherwise 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.760
