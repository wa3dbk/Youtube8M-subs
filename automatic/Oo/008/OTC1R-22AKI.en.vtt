00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
this one goes out with a bang and the

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.710 
this one goes out with a bang and the
ending<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.000> is<00:05:05.180> just<00:05:05.210> something

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
ending to it is just something

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.930 
ending to it is just something
absolutely<00:05:06.320> phenomenal<00:05:06.800> but<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.310> ancestors

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
absolutely phenomenal but the ancestors

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.940 
absolutely phenomenal but the ancestors
look<00:05:08.120> absolutely<00:05:08.540> frightening<00:05:09.320> as<00:05:09.500> you<00:05:09.800> can

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
look absolutely frightening as you can

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.860 
look absolutely frightening as you can
see<00:05:10.160> there<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.580> ancestor<00:05:11.120> literally<00:05:11.510> picks

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
see there the ancestor literally picks

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.320 
see there the ancestor literally picks
up<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.290> whole<00:05:12.440> team<00:05:12.740> there<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:14.000> bullets

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
up the whole team there and the bullets

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.300 
up the whole team there and the bullets
were<00:05:14.480> doing<00:05:14.780> no<00:05:14.960> damage<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.440> it<00:05:15.710> so<00:05:16.040> it<00:05:16.160> looks

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
were doing no damage to it so it looks

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.430 
were doing no damage to it so it looks
like<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.520> very<00:05:16.940> very<00:05:17.270> difficult<00:05:17.510> enemy<00:05:18.110> but
