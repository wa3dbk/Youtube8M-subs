00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.470 
isolated henchmen and one good strategic
tip<00:02:04.040> here<00:02:04.220> is<00:02:04.400> it's<00:02:04.640> much<00:02:04.760> easier<00:02:05.240> for<00:02:05.300> the

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
tip here is it's much easier for the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.910 
tip here is it's much easier for the
henchmen<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.900> jump<00:02:06.140> down<00:02:06.380> than<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.680> is<00:02:06.770> for

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
henchmen to jump down than it is for

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.560 
henchmen to jump down than it is for
them<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.100> climb<00:02:07.400> up<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.150> if<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.450> this

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570

less of them around so I can be a little

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.170 
less of them around so I can be a little
bit<00:04:17.260> more<00:04:17.470> confident<00:04:18.100> in<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.850> different

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
in range for the glide kick I'll just

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.730 
in range for the glide kick I'll just
check<00:04:31.240> no<00:04:31.390> one<00:04:31.510> else<00:04:31.630> is<00:04:31.750> around<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.440> then<00:04:32.680> I

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
can drop down lock him to the ground but

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.000 
can drop down lock him to the ground but
only<00:04:37.750> standing<00:04:38.140> for<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.320> while<00:04:38.470> so<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.710> need<00:04:38.890> to

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
only standing for a while so I need to

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.460 
only standing for a while so I need to
move<00:04:39.190> up<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.550> finish<00:04:39.789> him<00:04:39.940> off<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:41.289> then

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
move up and finish him off and then

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.590 
move up and finish him off and then
again<00:04:41.680> grapple<00:04:42.160> back<00:04:42.310> up<00:04:42.580> for<00:04:42.729> now<00:04:42.850> because

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
again grapple back up for now because

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.270 
again grapple back up for now because
that's<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.900> very<00:04:44.080> noisy<00:04:44.350> takedown<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.100> glide

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
that's a very noisy takedown the glide

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.740 
that's a very noisy takedown the glide
it's<00:04:45.700> going<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:45.880> attract<00:04:46.150> people<00:04:46.479> very

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
it's going to attract people very

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.390 
it's going to attract people very
quickly<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.350> it<00:04:47.530> so<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.890> is<00:04:47.950> a<00:04:47.979> dangerous

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
quickly to it so it is a dangerous

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.770 
quickly to it so it is a dangerous
tactic<00:04:48.789> to<00:04:48.940> use<00:04:49.150> but<00:04:49.360> it's<00:04:49.479> also<00:04:49.600> a<00:04:49.690> very

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
tactic to use but it's also a very

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.380 
tactic to use but it's also a very
effective<00:04:50.440> tactic<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.010> use<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:55.090> now<00:04:55.240> we're

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
effective tactic to use so now we're

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.300 
effective tactic to use so now we're
down<00:04:55.539> to<00:04:55.720> just<00:04:55.750> a<00:04:55.960> couple<00:04:56.110> of<00:04:56.320> henchman<00:04:56.770> larynx

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
down to just a couple of henchman larynx

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.430 
down to just a couple of henchman larynx
and<00:04:57.520> when<00:04:58.240> they<00:04:58.390> realize<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:58.840> you'll<00:04:59.260> see

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
and when they realize that you'll see

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.140 
and when they realize that you'll see
their<00:04:59.650> behavior<00:05:00.130> starts<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.550> change<00:05:00.729> as<00:05:01.000> well

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
their behavior starts to change as well

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.870 
their behavior starts to change as well
as<00:05:01.330> they<00:05:01.479> become<00:05:01.750> more<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.080> more<00:05:02.140> terrified

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
as they become more and more terrified

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.490 
as they become more and more terrified
so<00:05:03.880> again<00:05:04.150> Joker's<00:05:04.630> ordering<00:05:04.960> his<00:05:05.080> henchmen

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
so again Joker's ordering his henchmen

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.740 
so again Joker's ordering his henchmen
around<00:05:05.800> but<00:05:06.700> you'll<00:05:06.880> see<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.120> they<00:05:07.390> start<00:05:07.690> to

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
around but you'll see that they start to

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.450 
around but you'll see that they start to
become<00:05:07.990> more<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.650> more<00:05:08.740> nervous<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.280> follow

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
become more and more nervous to follow

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.820 
become more and more nervous to follow
his<00:05:09.640> orders<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:11.110> henchmen<00:05:11.500> there<00:05:11.620> has<00:05:11.710> gone

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
his orders the henchmen there has gone

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.469 
his orders the henchmen there has gone
up<00:05:11.950> but<00:05:12.100> the<00:05:12.220> second<00:05:12.520> henchman<00:05:12.850> isn't<00:05:13.060> so<00:05:13.240> keen

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
up but the second henchman isn't so keen

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.480 
up but the second henchman isn't so keen
to<00:05:13.660> follow<00:05:13.810> behind<00:05:14.050> him<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.800> this<00:05:15.190> again<00:05:15.430> is

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
to follow behind him and this again is

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.860 
to follow behind him and this again is
not<00:05:15.729> something<00:05:16.030> that's<00:05:16.150> always<00:05:16.270> predictable

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
not something that's always predictable

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.840 
not something that's always predictable
but<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.530> way<00:05:17.650> their<00:05:17.830> behavior<00:05:18.310> changes<00:05:18.760> is

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
but the way their behavior changes is

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.610 
but the way their behavior changes is
you<00:05:18.970> play<00:05:19.180> through<00:05:19.510> means<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.139> constantly

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
you play through means you constantly

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.910 
you play through means you constantly
have<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.950> adapt<00:05:21.220> your<00:05:21.400> tactics

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.070 

what<00:05:26.920> are<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:27.100> doing<00:05:27.520> need<00:05:27.820> help<00:05:28.060> you're<00:05:28.900> on

what are you doing need help you're on

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.150 
what are you doing need help you're on
