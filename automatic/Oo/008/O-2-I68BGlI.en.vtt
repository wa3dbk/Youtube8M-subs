and when you're buying a tractor you
will<00:00:09.269> need<00:00:09.450> ballast<00:00:09.960> if<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.260> use<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.769> loader

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.070 
uneven ground and want to stay stable
it's<00:00:17.760> important<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> right<00:00:18.930> amount

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
it's important I have the right amount

it's important I have the right amount
of<00:00:19.320> ballast<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> back<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> tractor

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
of ballast in the back of the tractor

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.519 
of ballast in the back of the tractor
and<00:00:20.970> there<00:00:21.630> are<00:00:21.689> basically<00:00:21.990> three<00:00:22.320> ways<00:00:22.500> you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and there are basically three ways you

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.779 
and there are basically three ways you
can<00:00:22.680> add<00:00:22.949> ballast<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
can add ballast and we're going to

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.580 
can add ballast and we're going to
discuss<00:00:24.150> those<00:00:24.510> three<00:00:24.869> today<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
discuss those three today and the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.310 
discuss those three today and the
advantages<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.430> disadvantages<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.240> both<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
advantages and disadvantages of both the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.230 
advantages and disadvantages of both the
first<00:00:28.619> thing<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> add<00:00:29.699> ballast

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
first thing you can do to add ballast

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.870 
first thing you can do to add ballast
there<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.109> actually<00:00:31.590> fluid<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.730> be

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
there is actually fluid that can be

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.630 
there is actually fluid that can be
pumped<00:00:33.149> into<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.719> rear<00:00:33.930> tires<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.460> old

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
pumped into the rear tires in the old

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
pumped into the rear tires in the old
days<00:00:35.880> there<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> calcium<00:00:36.960> chloride

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
days there was a calcium chloride

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.650 
days there was a calcium chloride
solution<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.190> tended<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> rot<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.329> rims

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
solution that tended to rot out the rims

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.690 
solution that tended to rot out the rims
and<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.410> you're<00:00:40.530> looking<00:00:40.829> at<00:00:40.950> older<00:00:41.219> tractors

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and if you're looking at older tractors

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.369 
and if you're looking at older tractors
a<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> times<00:00:42.239> you'll<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.809> whole<00:00:43.079> lot<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
a lot of times you'll see a whole lot of

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.110 
a lot of times you'll see a whole lot of
rust<00:00:43.590> around<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> rims<00:00:44.340> because<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
rust around the rims because of the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
rust around the rims because of the
fluid<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.989> was<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.559> ate<00:00:46.920> away<00:00:47.070> at

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
fluid that was in there that ate away at

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
fluid that was in there that ate away at
them<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.270> new<00:00:48.420> fluid<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.230> an

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
them the new fluid is more of an

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
them the new fluid is more of an
antifreeze<00:00:49.860> solution<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.579> non<00:00:50.789> caustic<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
antifreeze solution it's non caustic and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
antifreeze solution it's non caustic and
if<00:00:52.170> you're<00:00:52.350> near<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.860> agricultural<00:00:53.640> tire

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
if you're near and agricultural tire

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.720 
if you're near and agricultural tire
store<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.690> pump<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.050> fluid<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.309> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
store they can pump that fluid in and it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
store they can pump that fluid in and it
won't<00:00:56.940> freeze<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.660> it'll<00:00:58.260> give<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> lot<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
won't freeze and it'll give you a lot of

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.470 
won't freeze and it'll give you a lot of
weight<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.579> back<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.969> tractor

weight on the back of the tractor

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.680 
weight on the back of the tractor
and<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.250> price<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.180> varies<00:01:03.660> from

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and that that price for that varies from

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
and that that price for that varies from
time<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> time<00:01:04.320> your<00:01:04.890> tire<00:01:05.129> store<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.670> tell

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
time to time your tire store can tell

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730 
time to time your tire store can tell
you<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.420> what<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> they<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.320> pump

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you but what they do is they just pump

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.280 
you but what they do is they just pump
that<00:01:07.950> fluid<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.450> advantage<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.260> having

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that fluid in the advantage to having

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the disadvantage of fluid in the tires

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.730 
the disadvantage of fluid in the tires
is<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.759> poke<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> major<00:01:24.390> hole<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.259> rupture

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
is if you poke a major hole or rupture

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.890 
is if you poke a major hole or rupture
in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> tire<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.880> could<00:01:27.119> lose<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.360> fluid

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
in the tire you could lose that fluid

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.460 
in the tire you could lose that fluid
and<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.380> cheap<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.840> but<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.140> another

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and it's not cheap so but but another

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.140 
and it's not cheap so but but another
thing<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> fluid<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.030> you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
thing you can do with the fluid if you

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.510 
thing you can do with the fluid if you

trade tractors the tire shop can pump

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.429

the<00:01:35.670> fluid<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.540> tire<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.840> pump<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the fluid out of that tire and pump it

the fluid out of that tire and pump it
into<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.710> new<00:01:38.009> tractor<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.030> give<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.930> wait

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
into a new tractor and give you wait

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.859 
into a new tractor and give you wait
there<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.220> second<00:01:41.610> method<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:42.119> adding

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
there the second method of adding

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.359 
there the second method of adding
ballast<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> back<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> tractor<00:01:44.280> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
ballast to the back of the tractor is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.370 
ballast to the back of the tractor is
what<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.540> these<00:01:45.930> are<00:01:46.110> rear

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
what we have here and these are rear

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.370 
what we have here and these are rear
wheel<00:01:46.680> weights<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.780> add<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> lot<00:01:49.320> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
wheel weights and you can add a lot of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.749 
wheel weights and you can add a lot of
weight<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.920> back<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.310> tractor<00:01:50.520> with

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
weight to the back of a tractor with

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.539 
weight to the back of a tractor with
rear<00:01:51.210> wheel<00:01:51.240> weights<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.710> advantage<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.399> this

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
rear wheel weights the advantage of this

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.940 
rear wheel weights the advantage of this
is<00:01:53.909> you'll<00:01:54.689> never<00:01:54.930> lose<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.439> weight<00:01:55.649> they'll

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is you'll never lose the weight they'll

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.030 
is you'll never lose the weight they'll
always<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.570> two<00:01:57.930> disadvantages<00:01:58.829> of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
always be there the two disadvantages of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.399 
always be there the two disadvantages of
the<00:01:59.130> weight<00:01:59.310> the<00:02:00.119> weight<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.110> little

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the weight the weight is just a little

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.130 
the weight the weight is just a little
bit<00:02:01.530> higher<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.399> also<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.600> Bereket<00:02:03.990> if

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
bit higher and also it's a Bereket if

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.700 
bit higher and also it's a Bereket if
you<00:02:04.229> ever<00:02:04.350> have

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you ever have

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.920 
you ever have
change<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.040> tire<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.880> get<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.150> tire<00:02:06.330> on<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.780> off

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
change a tire to get the tire on and off

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.930 
change a tire to get the tire on and off
and<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.260> why<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.470> recommend<00:02:07.830> if<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.759> go

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and that's why I recommend if you go

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.969 
and that's why I recommend if you go
with<00:02:09.149> wheel<00:02:09.660> weights<00:02:09.929> buy<00:02:10.410> them<00:02:10.679> from<00:02:10.830> your

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
with wheel weights buy them from your

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.949 
with wheel weights buy them from your
local<00:02:11.160> dealer<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:12.120> them<00:02:12.330> install<00:02:12.780> them

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
local dealer have them install them

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.570 
local dealer have them install them
because<00:02:13.530> they'll<00:02:13.830> have<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> products

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
because they'll have the products

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.010 
because they'll have the products
necessary<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.270> get<00:02:15.420> them<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.810> get<00:02:15.900> them

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
necessary to get them on and get them

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.160 
necessary to get them on and get them

weights on each side for a total of six
and<00:02:46.860> will<00:02:46.950> include<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.430> weight<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.940> then<00:02:48.450> it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
and will include the weight and then it

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.860 
and will include the weight and then it
also<00:02:48.870> includes<00:02:49.350> hardware<00:02:50.300> which<00:02:51.300> if<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.630> put

also includes hardware which if you put

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.540 
also includes hardware which if you put
the<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.320> weights<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.830> yourself<00:02:53.280> you'll<00:02:53.430> have

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
the the weights on yourself you'll have

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.009 
the the weights on yourself you'll have
to<00:02:53.640> come<00:02:53.790> up<00:02:53.820> with<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.150> hardware<00:02:54.510> which<00:02:54.870> is

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
to come up with a hardware which is

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.830 
to come up with a hardware which is
usually<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> long<00:02:55.739> all<00:02:56.250> thread<00:02:56.880> stud<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.660> goes

usually a long all thread stud that goes

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.770 
usually a long all thread stud that goes
in<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.260> attaches<00:02:58.890> them<00:02:59.300> so<00:03:00.300> that's<00:03:00.510> the

in that attaches them so that's the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.420 
in that attaches them so that's the
that's<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.380> second<00:03:01.769> way<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.890> can<00:03:02.130> go<00:03:02.280> on

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
that's the second way you can go on

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.000 
that's the second way you can go on
weights<00:03:02.730> weights<00:03:03.510> vary<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.410> price<00:03:04.709> they'll

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.560 
but with fuel prices and steel prices
rising<00:03:12.900> I've<00:03:13.049> seen<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.470> higher<00:03:13.739> than<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:14.190> now

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
tractor is to make sure the wheels have

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.030 
tractor is to make sure the wheels have
holes<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:24.060> them<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.959> accommodate<00:03:25.290> mounting<00:03:25.920> of

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
holes in them to accommodate mounting of

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.550 
holes in them to accommodate mounting of
the<00:03:26.130> wheel<00:03:26.340> weights<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:27.510> tractor<00:03:27.930> has<00:03:28.170> four

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the wheel weights this tractor has four

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.509 
the wheel weights this tractor has four
holes<00:03:29.690> this<00:03:30.690> tractor<00:03:31.110> has<00:03:31.410> three<00:03:31.829> holes<00:03:32.100> which

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
holes this tractor has three holes which

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.270 
holes this tractor has three holes which
is<00:03:32.700> fine<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:34.019> this<00:03:34.230> smaller<00:03:34.530> tractor<00:03:35.010> has

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
is fine but this smaller tractor has

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.699 
is fine but this smaller tractor has
zero<00:03:35.760> holes<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:37.110> means<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.500> wheel

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
zero holes and that means that wheel

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.170 
zero holes and that means that wheel
weights<00:03:37.980> are<00:03:38.190> not<00:03:38.370> an<00:03:38.549> option<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:39.000> this

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
weights are not an option on this

weights are not an option on this
tractor<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.560> third<00:03:40.769> method<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.400> use<00:03:41.670> is

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
tractor the third method you can use is

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.750 
tractor the third method you can use is
a<00:03:42.209> rear<00:03:42.630> ballast<00:03:43.049> box<00:03:43.350> or<00:03:43.650> just<00:03:44.130> putting<00:03:44.579> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
a rear ballast box or just putting a

rear three-pointed mount implement on
the<00:03:47.070> back<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.400> your<00:03:47.519> tractor<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.480> advantages

the back of your tractor the advantages

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.660 
the back of your tractor the advantages
of<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.470> when<00:03:49.680> you're<00:03:49.799> not<00:03:49.950> using<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.459> when

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
of that when you're not using it when

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.190 
of that when you're not using it when
you're<00:03:50.790> on<00:03:50.880> flat<00:03:51.090> ground<00:03:51.480> are<00:03:51.600> not<00:03:51.750> using<00:03:52.079> your

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
you're on flat ground are not using your

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.810 
you're on flat ground are not using your
loader<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.620> can<00:03:52.769> take<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.130> off<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
loader you can take it off the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.569 
loader you can take it off the
disadvantages<00:03:54.690> are<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.620> sometimes<00:03:56.220> you

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
disadvantages are that sometimes you

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.030 
disadvantages are that sometimes you
want<00:03:56.820> both<00:03:57.359> weight<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.560> three-point

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
want both weight and the three-point

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.160 
want both weight and the three-point
implement<00:03:59.519> at<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.730> same<00:03:59.940> time<00:04:00.209> but<00:04:00.810> those<00:04:00.989> are

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
implement at the same time but those are

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.900 
implement at the same time but those are
the<00:04:01.260> three<00:04:01.470> methods<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.950> can<00:04:02.130> get<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.730> can

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
the three methods you can get you can

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.140 
the three methods you can get you can
also<00:04:03.090> use<00:04:03.390> multiple<00:04:03.920> combinations<00:04:04.920> I've<00:04:05.519> seen

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
also use multiple combinations I've seen

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.780 
also use multiple combinations I've seen
people<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.540> put<00:04:06.840> weight<00:04:07.430> fluid<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.670> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
people that put weight fluid in the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.729 
people that put weight fluid in the
tires<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.420> then<00:04:09.840> wheel<00:04:10.049> weights<00:04:10.290> on<00:04:10.530> if

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
tires and then wheel weights on if

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.110 
tires and then wheel weights on if
they're<00:04:10.890> using<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.340> loader<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:11.670> lot<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.060> they

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
they're using the loader a lot and they

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.909 
they're using the loader a lot and they
needed<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.480> extra<00:04:12.720> ballast<00:04:13.230> but<00:04:13.560> those<00:04:13.739> are

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
needed the extra ballast but those are

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.090 
needed the extra ballast but those are
your<00:04:14.070> options<00:04:14.100> for<00:04:14.699> ballast
