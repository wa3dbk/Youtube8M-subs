 The end in this motorcycle I advise you 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.599

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.989
 motorcycles 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.140
 I also advise you to watch the video of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.670
 That's good, the guy was with the hornet. 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 white today is with cbm or yellow 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 show ball but let me do the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.460
 disseminate my product here now that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.899
 he publicizes his products 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.760
 through his death 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.070
 Anyway, here's mine together in 35 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 has undergone some modifications 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.629
 making this video here now in part 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 in the morning because every time I wash it 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.710
 night to give someone a go 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.359
 I hit the bike last time it was the guy 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.400
 who hit the parking lot on the bike 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.510
 stop 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 Anyway, I'll show you some here. 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.990
 modifications were made to the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.780
 first you can see was the paralama 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.670
 What was that black paint done of? 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.080
 this was also a first accident 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.320
 that I had and I hit a van and that part 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.990
 here she joked 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.980
 so we have to sandpaper 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.170
 remove the old ink from it 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.180
 new layer of paint and I made it here to give 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.630
 one modified and those white lines 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.020
 was also painted the motorcycle wheel in color 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.190
 black and the prisoners and red did 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.380
 reflective 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:56.660
 is she was before with one with the tape 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.750
 led here in the lighthouse but I took it because 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.400
 was pulling the battery a little 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.490
 load a little more annoying than I think 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.710
 that I put here was very strong then 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.440
 ended up charging a little battery on time 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.200
 to connect xix to the look 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.970
 another modification was also made 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.050
 I think going through the other side was putting 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.030
 this damper 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.489
 this is the second place it's here 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:29.390
 a cg-150 honda out of the rone in the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.920
 Titan was made the adaptation here that was 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.090
 taken a pro 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:42.110
 he made this piece and we put it on 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.670
 ask the salute the one came out 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.370
 cost of 100 reais 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.099
 but a much better look at the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.220
 moto 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:56.030
 there it was much better for the pilot the better 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:02.150
 Passenger was very nice to see the key 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.799
 for unity is for you to see who 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.319
 Wanna see the bike on, sorry, it takes time. 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.319
 of the video but the brabo 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.079

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.689
 make the video to show you there 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.489
 Who cares to buy this bike? 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.980
 in a single problem that I had with this 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.390
 bike was really the part of the 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.370
 bumper 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.760
 I put up with all my 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.620
 problems but got taller had a 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.180
 much better performance both the pilot 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.329
 as for the ride 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.409

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.469

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:51.530
 she stayed like this has a very design 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:52.970
 much darker much more beautiful than 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.849
 that the original detail of it if it 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.299
 come with the factory black wheels already 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.040
