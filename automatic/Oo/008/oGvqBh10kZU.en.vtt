00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.580
 in which the kind of friends begins 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.920
 comment welcome to the channel of the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
 masked profession today we have a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.240
 new video and I'm going to talk about something 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.150
 They always ask me if they send me 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 many messages seeing me advice and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.700
 truth is that I do not consider it to be 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.310
 true youtuber like to give advice to 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.460
 the others because I feel that I am 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.230
 just starting but I think it 's a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 good opportunity to answer some 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.790
 concerns that sent me some 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.610
 questions from some small tips 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.950
 that for me in my personal opinion are 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.020
 important to take into account the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.710
 video and it's going to be more than anything about 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.710
 those things 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.340
 in another opportunity I'm probably going to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 to be giving advice are things 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.649
 good are the things that maybe it's good 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.410
 but today I decided to give tips for 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.410
 do not do things in my judgment 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.930
 for its spots and all those things that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.790
 some youtube say they advise and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.100
 that are obviously wrong and there is no need 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:18.240
 do them but they give you the advice that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:21.840
 they are innovative and the paper that starts 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.300
 the class of the day with sector number one 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.940
 of what not to do according to my 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.490
 What I notice is that in the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.890
 relatively small channels sometimes 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.380
 Subscribers arrive and start 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.780
 sign their videos and then they have one 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.759
 two or three five or six and good 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 comments and some videos and that they do not 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.810
 they respond to the people who 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.180
 they signed that seems like a mistake to me 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.250
 I presented it is wrong because I consider that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.680
 it does not cost anything, everyone will answer you 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.930
 it costs nothing to let him know that person 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.340
 that you gave him your comment more if it's a 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.590
 Comment good wave if it's a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.979
 comment from anima I think it's very 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.250
 important to answer me sometimes I take 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.970
 the time to answer 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.800
 I like if you review all the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.640
 comments that are good wave not so 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.400
 good ones 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 they have a little hand up and that's me 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.560
 with all comments to the extent 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.560
 as possible 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.880
 and I find it extremely important so 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.880
 I think I should keep in mind these 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.480
 videos that sign that gives us encouragement 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.510
 you have to value it, you have to answer if 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.120
 are few we answer to this whole world 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.830
 with 5 I'm going to give you this is what is 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.050
 a very personal opinion but I 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.360
 It seems extremely important to 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.700
 we have a personality that 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.629
 be nice to others 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.290
 I think it's a mistake to catalog 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.550
 fans to your followers I think but not 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.730
 I like it sounds too big to say 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.380
 so I have fans fans is a title that is 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.550
 has to moderate the person that you 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.319
 let's see not you as youtube to them that 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.980
 I do not like it, I do not like it 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.470
 catalog like that and it seems to me that as 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.870
 they will have given in 12 no it is not for that reason 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.299
 I strongly advise you that these videos 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.299
 so you have a million subscribers 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:32.180
 just tell them followers people 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.700
 that like the number three that I'm going to give you 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.709
 it's still a very personal opinion 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.140
 that just in the previous advice you 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.739
 I said that maybe not my fans to your 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.299
 fans fans and that seems ugly to me 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.709
 imagine what I think 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.870
 put a title as an object to 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.769
 your followers for example if someone 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.500
 is watching my videos if that person is 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.230
 group with others and decide to put 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.170
 the masked ones or several like that 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.260
 I think it's good barbarian but to say done 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.079
 put on this denomination do not say I heard 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.810
 to me being more grade is not very possible 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.359
 because those people who watch my videos 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.650
 do not know my videos also see the 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:22.170
 videos of month and yards of stories and what 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.150
 I know of so many other youtubers that 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.630
 they like them then I think not 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.670
 corresponds what to me is one the 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.890
 name and treat them as if they were a 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.500
 group that is only concentrated my 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.630
 channel that I do not like I do not advise 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.000
 that they do it seems to me that it is very 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.550
 Enlarged very believed with many airs 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.260
 I was a follower I did not give me 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.540
 catalog me or put me in a 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.210
 group with a denomination and story 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.480
 with you that I am going to give you that is something that 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.930
 it comes on one thing one thing that is 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.780
 extremely important and you can change 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.210
 all your life I think that when you 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.630
 start on youtube obviously self 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.760
 forever 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.970
 you have faith thinks that the channel is going 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.560
 also and all those things but I think that 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.900
 you have to think very well if you really 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.390
 you want to be known if you want to be 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.040
 popular because imagine the following 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.110
 situation where you go out with your friends 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.780
 what are you going to put aside and who 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.030
 recognize people approach you 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.770
 ask for pictures you may like you can 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.920
 sing I think there are many people 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.420
 that die to be recognized but there 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.880
 other people that there are no other people 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.890
 that require more privacy 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.200
 but you have to think that he's going to talk 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.200
 very good if you go bank or not 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.150
 because if you expose yourself to be at 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.740
 in front of a camera and approaching 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.710
 people and all those things that sometimes 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.900
 often those people who are 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.639
 recognized 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:06.150
 you can not treat a person badly 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:09.150
 example in nothing and that there are people what 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.000
 is to locate the street so what 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.580
 you should evaluate that think it well and 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.960
 good in case you do not want to put a 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.479
 mask does not approach with voice over with 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.400
 images shows your face 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.100
 you can see the train from ways but 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.770
 them whenever we have it in mind 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.780
 then mobile in anonymity and that nobody 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.820
 I recognize you once but always 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.889
 there is a possibility that the former 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.320
 block lose a reason that makes you 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:40.740
 super popular on youtube fifth and last 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.289
 advice the same class I think that 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.919
 you will have to learn a camera and 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:49.449
 filming I think it's very important that 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:52.150
 be self-critical and what 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.270
 when you feel something issues fairly 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.120
 a content that you worry about doing 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.520
 a script that you worry about 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.240
 practice it because the mars a two 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.150
 three times to see which one works best 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.759
 more than if you are burning something you look 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.520
 how the video comes out and not asking 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:14.620
 convince not to upload it were three friends 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.360
 up to 22 and the teacher of an escalation 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.270
 it can be difference 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.219
 facebook twitter impunity and easy 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.860
 because channel you will see my videos are 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:26.409
 totally invited, I also invite you 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.779
 to go through the channel of Manuel and the 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:30.719
 plane that left it ringing at the end of 

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:33.879
 this video know your topics are 

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:37.349
 very good we'll see you next week 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:39.580
 with many more of the profession of more 

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:41.800
 above 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.139
 although we do not speak both of the same 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.780
 language we are human beings in 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:50.199
 feelings and ways and is that in that 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:53.229
 we are equal own culture own 

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:55.650
 ideal only in sports we must be 

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:58.389
 rivals to the competition not close 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:01.110
 opportunities because I want alone 

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:01.110
 I seek to gather
