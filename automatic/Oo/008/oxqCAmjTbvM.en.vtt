00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.850
 again to another video channel 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.799
 always something for me today 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.730
 I have a smartphone for mine 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.309
 galaxy s 4 a navigation system or 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.800
 a navigation app better 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.189
 Downloaded the cost in the app store 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.699
 scarcely 60 to 70 euro the price fluctuates 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.460
 it is quite strong in any case 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.580
 a very good buy recommendation from me 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.500
 this is this navigation system 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.730
 really very mature and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 really works too 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.719
 reliable I am already in the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.850
 have been vacationing I have the thing 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.980
 really longer now and i can 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.870
 it really only recommend you if you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.000
 after a navigation program or after 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.910
 looking for a nation sap so you have to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.170
 not necessarily a navigation system 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.379
 but could it be on yours 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.020
 install the smartphone and then so 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.360
 Of course , the city ​​has everyone 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.399
 common features of a normal 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.320
 navigation system and a few more 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.339
 additional functions there is also if one 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.990
 would also like about 3g then additionally 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.700
 can bring traffic data can be 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.229
 so that, for example, somehow congestion 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.810
 or something can show very large 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.049
 advantage is that the system also 3d 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.610
 navigation offers that means if you 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.619
 be in big cities or something like that time 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.140
 important buildings such as 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.030
 any old museums or 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.189
 any interesting places in one 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.619
 3d animation shown 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.090
 I like that too and if you are 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.470
 for example, on the highway or drives 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.180
 but had to turn right somewhere but so 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.100
 Of course, you always become yourself 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.619
 this beautiful icons we for example is 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.329
 The 70 sign always displayed nicely and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.979
 all and that is voice were 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.939
 adjustable locations you can 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.259
 always show 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.850
 I find that very interesting too 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.350
 example is just a new city ​​and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.640
 I really want the street with the child 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.430
 I can hold me over for example 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.850
 the settings just go in mails 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.219
 and disco you are currently located that is 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.149
 It all happens in a few seconds 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.770
 and you can then choose the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.969
 regals what is closest to it because 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.729
 You can then use directly through 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.630
 leave enough woozy I give times 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.890
 an address 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.750
 and we do that by going here 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.530
 just type in the menu 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.460
 everyone comes to enter and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.140
 then of course we can do that here 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.270
 all address zip code or 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.550
 Enter something that will be short now 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.320
 make and then I'll go on so far 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.580
 like me and the address and you can 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.800
 of course beer again on foot or 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.550
 with whom I'll give you auto course 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.110
 the car 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.840
 there is now here a short survey 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.910
 shown and then you can on here 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.560
 press navigation if you do not 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.760
 needs and then after ten seconds 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.020
 In any case, it immediately 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.280
 started and how you see it 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.920
 works really smooth and 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.500
 very fast all necessary information 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.959
 presented and it was really very 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.730
 nice and very important of course 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.090
 if you stretch for example longer 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.950
 moves 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.730
 I know that, for example, in Croatia 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.320
 Direction croatia so what do you have 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.940
 really no problem at all 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.200
 unpaved roads that she knows 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.310
 really almost so i just say it 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.600
 is that in the world but me 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.070
 think this is really the biggest 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.320
 Part really that is really true 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.720
 a large part of the whole stretch on the 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.700
 world has really intused and 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.799
 That's why you're so very much so 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.000
 the cards have also secured very well 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.920
 TomTom are very similar or or 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.160
 the same skalecki card material 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.140
 is used and that is after all 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.459
 even something if any 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.590
 drove or something is to 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.000
 example lightning or no idea fixed 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.410
 blitzer something he answers, of course, 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.489
 and then you know okay then you have to 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.269
 they are watching you or you have to 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.620
 drive carefully 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.690
 if, for example, a very sharp 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.100
 curve comes or so what reports it is 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.870
 I also think that's very important 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.000
 which is why the list for example completely 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.410
 sharp curve perfect here you can see 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.380
 you have seen the little icon that you 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.280
 now a really sharp turn comes 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:51.090
 otherwise it is really good 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.170
 that's just with tomatoes and there 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.209
 will definitely come back and then 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.290
 that is, but it is really 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.640
 from me a really good buy recommendation 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.340
 I can only recommend any of 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.470
 because somehow in the direction Yourself 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.730
 before you somehow for 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.860
 big money a huge 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.540
 navigation system buys rather buys 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.890
 just the app you have it right now 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.810
 the smartphone with it anyway 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.030
 You can also load it at the same time 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.370
 let creative music pass by 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.599
 hear about cents over bluetooth so even 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.739
 no problem i hope it has you 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.150
 like 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.650
 Questions you wanted to know something 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.030
 just write in the comments or 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.960

 is our channel and until the next 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.720
