of your braking system are actually
broken<00:00:12.929> up<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.290> two<00:00:13.440> different<00:00:13.620> sections<00:00:14.219> you

behind your wheel in this system the
brake<00:00:26.070> caliper<00:00:26.869> squeezes<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.050> pad<00:00:28.260> onto<00:00:28.680> the

brake caliper squeezes the pad onto the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.859 
brake caliper squeezes the pad onto the
brake<00:00:29.340> rotor<00:00:29.640> creating<00:00:30.300> friction<00:00:30.720> which

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
brake rotor creating friction which

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.220 
brake rotor creating friction which
slows<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.349> car<00:00:31.500> down<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:33.059> second<00:00:33.690> system

would<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.950> drum<00:00:35.250> style<00:00:35.489> brake<00:00:35.790> which<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
would be the drum style brake which is

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.709 
would be the drum style brake which is
where<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> brake<00:00:38.160> shoes<00:00:38.489> actually<00:00:39.420> get

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
where the brake shoes actually get

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.780 
where the brake shoes actually get
pressed<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.170> by<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> wheel<00:00:40.649> cylinder<00:00:41.129> and

pressed out by a wheel cylinder and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.729 
pressed out by a wheel cylinder and
which<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.300> turn<00:00:42.480> also<00:00:42.780> creates<00:00:43.140> friction<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
which in turn also creates friction and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.060 
which in turn also creates friction and
slows<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:44.250> car<00:00:44.430> down<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:45.629> rotors<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
slows your car down the rotors and the

question asked about brakes well think
about<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.380> take<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> piece

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
about it like this if you take a piece

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.609 
about it like this if you take a piece

against a piece of metal sometimes

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.090 
against a piece of metal sometimes
you're<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> squealing<00:01:19.710> noise<00:01:19.860> no

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you're going to get a squealing noise no

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
you're going to get a squealing noise no
matter<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.790> substance<00:01:21.119> may<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.570> and

not every situation does a brake making
a<00:01:25.110> squealing<00:01:25.500> noise<00:01:25.740> meaning<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.400> need

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
a squealing noise meaning that you need

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
a squealing noise meaning that you need
brakes<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.960> only<00:01:28.140> time<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.500> ever

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
brakes the only time that you ever

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.289 
brakes the only time that you ever
really<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> worry<00:01:29.549> about<00:01:29.729> getting<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
really have to worry about getting a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.789 
really have to worry about getting a
noise<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:30.720> applying<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.259> brake<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.650> this

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
noise when applying the brake and this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.260 
noise when applying the brake and this
is<00:01:31.950> actually<00:01:32.340> could<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> very<00:01:33.060> dangerous

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
is actually could be a very dangerous

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
is actually could be a very dangerous
situation<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.770> should<00:01:34.920> immediately<00:01:35.100> stop

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
situation so you should immediately stop

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.179 
situation so you should immediately stop
is<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.600> you're<00:01:36.780> getting<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.140> scraping<00:01:37.829> noise

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
is if you're getting a scraping noise

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.530 
is if you're getting a scraping noise
like<00:01:38.460> you're<00:01:38.610> running<00:01:39.000> metal<00:01:39.329> across

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.040 
now the importance of that is brake
fluid<00:03:14.680> absorbs<00:03:15.010> moisture<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.600> if<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.930> have

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
fluid absorbs moisture so if you have

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.290 
fluid absorbs moisture so if you have

to start to rot your brake system from

to start to rot your brake system from
the<00:03:21.070> inside<00:03:21.100> out<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:22.270> it's<00:03:22.390> great<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.660> get<00:03:22.930> in

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050
