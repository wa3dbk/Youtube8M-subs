00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
still win the game and that's what it is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.360 
still win the game and that's what it is
about<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.910> about<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.300> objective<00:00:56.750> isn't<00:00:56.900> it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
about it about the objective isn't it

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.460 
about it about the objective isn't it
but<00:00:58.370> yeah<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.970> is<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.690> lot<00:00:59.870> of<00:00:59.930> fun<00:01:00.110> to<00:01:00.290> kill
