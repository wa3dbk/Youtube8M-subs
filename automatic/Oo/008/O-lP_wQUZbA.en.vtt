 Soft and juicy with a rich Naa healthy vegetables such as vitamin c and potassium 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.269
 It is characterized by strong Amami 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.310
 Therefore we made use of the characteristics of spring cabbage this time 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.310
 We introduce easy arrangement menu 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:28.570
 I am a lecturer at the Toho gas cooking class to have you teach 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.570
 Pro-North Island snow teacher of home cooking 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.610
 At first we can taste a lot of this spring cabbage 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:41.730
 Let's make a steak of cabbage 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.770
 Put the knives in a hard core and cut in half, and then put on the cabbage 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.070
 We will cut into combs 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:55.800
 If you season with salt and pepper, add secrecy to the cut end 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:00.989
 We will sprinkle a mixture of wheat flour and cheese powder to give an example grilling color 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.329
 It's just fine, but when this cheese comes in it is fragrant and grilled, and the sweetness of cabbage is great 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.170
 I'm leaving 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.700
 It said in the Puraipan as soon as you put the flour 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:18.280
 If you leave it for a long time on this day, water will come out of the cabbage 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:24.210
 I'm burning crisp it is those who reserve early because the woman would tap base 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.210
 If it has a delicious baking color, turn over and bake both sides 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:35.790
 Then steam over 10 minutes on low heat 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:39.390
 During this time the decisive factor of the source making taste is reflected in the flavor cabbage if strength packets of independent 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.760
 Because it just becomes delicious 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:49.310
 If you add the parsley to further consomme soup and butter coloring 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.310
 It is not possible to make a sauce for cabbage 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:02:00.580
 Steamed-baked cabbage is also completed deliciously with Amami and Umami flavor condensed 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:06.880
 You just have to put it on a plate and add the sauce 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:09.750
 Trying a hearty spring cabbage steak to sprinkle almond slices 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.750
 You will receive 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.380
 The cabbage is firm and sweet and soft and delicious 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:25.500
 I think it 's a spring cabbage unique reward 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:28.080
 Then, a standard roll using this 1/4 cut cabbage which is often seen in shops 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.490
 Create a cabbage Well do you can do with this 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.990
 Yes you point postcard Takuri child 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:40.750
 I'm looking forward to how to use starch powder- 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:43.620
 Cabbage is easily cut in hot water because it is cut by 5 6 minutes 1/4 on high heat 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.620
 It does not enter now 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.990
 When it gets soft to the axis , raise it in the colander and drain well 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.440
 And 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:03:04.360
 Because there is a straight shaft, it's a little wound so take some care with enema 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:11.220
 I cut it into pieces and knead it into the meat together 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.220
 Leaves are divided into four equally by combining large and small ones . 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.610
 Continue making 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.819
 Add good ketchup etc to minced meat and mix well until it becomes sticky 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.150
 egg 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.430
 Bread crumb soaked in milk 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.760
 Onion 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.370
 further 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.850
 Small amount of cabbage 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.420
 Well 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.420
 Use as I was without leaving axis was cut earlier 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:44.290
 I here Once you put on the divided into four equal parts species spread the leaves of the cabbage to wrap eh 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.730
 Katuri flour appears 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.280
 Shake the starch powder and wrap it in the same way as the tea squeezer . 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:04:00.900
 It is a little different from the usual cabbage roll 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:07.769
 It becomes difficult to open the small pigtails when it is boiled, because starch powder plays a role of adhesive 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:10.700
 Then make bacon and laurier leaves in consomme soup for prospective soup making and simmer 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.700
 Ok if you cut 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:20.940
 The cabbage is also finished in a round five beautiful form 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.940
 Decanted and the soup side by side in the pan in the bottom of the eyes closed 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:35.680
 The rest is about 20 minutes on medium fire with a dropping lid 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.680
 Some cabbages have thin leaves and taste good even in a short time . 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:45.020
 Rolled cabbage with a cute shape 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:50.110
 Add softened butter and grated lemon butter to eat. 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:54.580
 It further enhances the refreshing flavor of cabbage . 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.270
 There was an image that rolled cabbage takes time, but with this you can easily 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.660
 Yes 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.660
