00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.460 

me<00:00:38.520> I'm<00:00:38.670> biased<00:00:38.970> because<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.570> black<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.350> do

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
me I'm biased because I'm black but I do

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.620 
me I'm biased because I'm black but I do
think<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.280> fighter<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.390> Ray

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
think that a fighter like the Ray

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.170 
think that a fighter like the Ray
Leonard's<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.500> anyone<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.310> that<00:00:44.580> would<00:00:44.880> beat

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
Leonard's or anyone like that would beat

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.780 
Leonard's or anyone like that would beat
a<00:00:45.210> guy<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.810> Pacquiao<00:00:46.290> if<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.370> come<00:00:47.640> with

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
a guy like Pacquiao if they come with

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.520 
a guy like Pacquiao if they come with
their<00:00:47.970> game<00:00:48.150> listen<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.750> ain't<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.110> racial

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
their game listen this ain't a racial

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.550 
their game listen this ain't a racial
thing<00:00:49.560> but<00:00:50.460> then<00:00:50.580> again<00:00:50.850> maybe<00:00:51.060> it<00:00:51.240> is<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:52.380> the

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
thing but then again maybe it is but the

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.620 
thing but then again maybe it is but the
style<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.220> is<00:00:53.490> embedded<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.150> most<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.510> us

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
style that is embedded in most of us

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.600 
style that is embedded in most of us
black<00:00:54.900> fighters<00:00:55.380> that<00:00:55.590> style<00:00:56.010> could<00:00:56.400> be<00:00:56.580> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
black fighters that style could be a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:06.090 
black fighters that style could be a
problem<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.630> any<00:00:57.840> other<00:00:58.170> style<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.710> fighting

jyllian<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.909> big<00:01:11.090> issue<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.479> which<00:01:11.780> i<00:01:11.900> think

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
jyllian a big issue of which i think

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.660 
jyllian a big issue of which i think
it's<00:01:12.290> good<00:01:12.500> yeah<00:01:13.009> I<00:01:13.040> didn't<00:01:13.369> see<00:01:13.460> anything

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
it's good yeah I didn't see anything

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.190 
it's good yeah I didn't see anything
really<00:01:13.880> laying<00:01:14.150> low<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.630> was<00:01:14.840> well<00:01:15.049> it<00:01:15.170> was

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
really laying low it was well it was

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
really laying low it was well it was
alone<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:15.619> I<00:01:15.740> don't<00:01:15.920> think<00:01:16.009> it<00:01:16.130> was

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
alone but I don't think it was

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
alone but I don't think it was
intentional
