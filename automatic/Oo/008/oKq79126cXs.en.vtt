you<00:00:00.089> can<00:00:00.210> see<00:00:00.420> this<00:00:00.599> chain<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:00.960> fairly<00:00:01.350> dirty

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
you can see this chain is fairly dirty

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.210 
you can see this chain is fairly dirty
and<00:00:02.129> so<00:00:02.790> are<00:00:02.970> these<00:00:03.090> jockey<00:00:03.570> wheels<00:00:04.130> this<00:00:05.130> is

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
and so are these jockey wheels this is

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.020 
and so are these jockey wheels this is
just<00:00:05.460> one<00:00:05.730> day's<00:00:06.000> riding<00:00:06.810> on<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:07.890> trails<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.970> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
just one day's riding on on trails on a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.570 
just one day's riding on on trails on a
mountain<00:00:09.389> bike<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.809> ride<00:00:10.050> through<00:00:10.830> puddles

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
mountain bike you ride through puddles

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.490 
mountain bike you ride through puddles
and<00:00:12.030> stream<00:00:12.840> crossings<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.820> washes<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
and stream crossings and washes the

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.429 
and stream crossings and washes the
lubricant<00:00:16.500> off<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.100> then<00:00:17.430> also<00:00:17.670> dry<00:00:18.600> grit

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
lubricant off and then also dry grit

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.759 
lubricant off and then also dry grit
gets<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.980> there<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.539> just<00:00:21.539> sand<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.260> fine

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
gets in there just just sand and fine

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.029 
gets in there just just sand and fine
fine<00:00:23.699> dust<00:00:24.060> particles<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.470> want<00:00:25.920> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
fine dust particles you really want to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.620 
fine dust particles you really want to
keep<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.400> lot<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.609> lubricant<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.359> there

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
keep a lot of lubricant in there

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.290 
keep a lot of lubricant in there
obviously<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.830> gets<00:00:29.070> Messier<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> more

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
obviously it gets Messier the more

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.759 
obviously it gets Messier the more
lubricants<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.380> there<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.710> it

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
lubricants you have in there and it

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.620 
lubricants you have in there and it
picks<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.160> more<00:00:32.399> dirt<00:00:32.730> there<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.390> some

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
picks up more dirt there are some

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.450 
picks up more dirt there are some
lubricants<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.469> dry<00:00:34.710> lubricants

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
lubricants that are dry lubricants

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.830 
lubricants that are dry lubricants
wax-based<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:38.210> unless<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.420> live<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.660> a

really<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.350> dry<00:00:40.710> environment<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.550> actually

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
really really dry environment I actually

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.209 
really really dry environment I actually
don't<00:00:42.450> usually<00:00:42.780> recommend<00:00:43.140> those<00:00:43.739> because

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
don't usually recommend those because

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
don't usually recommend those because
they<00:00:44.430> tend<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.750> able<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> deal<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
they tend to not be able to deal with a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.270 
they tend to not be able to deal with a
lot<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.890> water<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> find<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.690> get<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
lot of water but I find I get a lot of

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.880 
lot of water but I find I get a lot of
chain<00:00:50.280> life<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.239> wipe<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> chain<00:00:52.590> down

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
chain life if I just wipe the chain down

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.580 
chain life if I just wipe the chain down
after<00:00:53.340> every<00:00:53.610> ride<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.570> whenever<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.410> wipe

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
after every ride so whenever you wipe

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.340 
after every ride so whenever you wipe
this<00:00:55.800> down<00:00:55.860> go<00:00:56.370> ahead<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> wipe<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.840> goop<00:00:58.079> off

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this down go ahead and wipe the goop off

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.939 
this down go ahead and wipe the goop off
the<00:00:58.730> jockey<00:00:59.730> wheels<00:01:00.090> because<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.680> builds<00:01:01.680> up

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the jockey wheels because it builds up

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.100 
the jockey wheels because it builds up
really<00:01:02.190> fast<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.910> chain<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.390> well

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
really fast if your chain is well

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
really fast if your chain is well
lubricated<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:04.979> you're<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:06.030> always<00:01:06.270> going

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
lubricated then you're it's always going

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.140 
lubricated then you're it's always going
to<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.630> bringing<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.290> lot<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.460> stuff<00:01:08.760> into<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
to be bringing a lot of stuff into the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.140 
to be bringing a lot of stuff into the
jockey<00:01:09.540> wheels<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.110> well<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:11.340> pinch<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.970> them

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
jockey wheels as well just pinch on them

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.960 
jockey wheels as well just pinch on them
usually<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> upper<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.799> turn<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> other

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
usually the upper one you turn the other

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.810 
usually the upper one you turn the other
direction<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.650> you're<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.340> trying<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
direction and just you're just trying to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
get you know the moving parts wiped down

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.170 
get you know the moving parts wiped down
pretty<00:01:21.450> well<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.979> just<00:01:22.979> keep<00:01:23.189> gloves<00:01:23.610> next<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180

this is all I do and I don't even have

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.660 
this is all I do and I don't even have
to<00:02:07.720> have<00:02:07.870> a<00:02:07.930> bike<00:02:08.260> stand<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.860> do<00:02:09.010> this<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.430> just

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
to have a bike stand to do this I just

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.510 
to have a bike stand to do this I just
lean<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.600> up<00:02:10.690> against<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.170> wall<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.400> it

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
lean it up against the wall and it

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.340 
lean it up against the wall and it
doesn't<00:02:12.790> have<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.120> be<00:02:13.150> beautiful<00:02:13.480> it's<00:02:14.050> just

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
doesn't have to be beautiful it's just

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.080 
doesn't have to be beautiful it's just
going<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.560> get<00:02:14.740> dirty<00:02:15.070> again<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.640> first<00:02:15.880> time

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
going to get dirty again the first time

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.420 
going to get dirty again the first time
you<00:02:16.240> ride<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:17.080> what<00:02:17.350> I'm<00:02:17.530> interested<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:18.190> is

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
you ride but what I'm interested in is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.760 
you ride but what I'm interested in is
not<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.970> external<00:02:19.540> look<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.260> much<00:02:20.440> as

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
not the external look of it so much as

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.280 
not the external look of it so much as
what's<00:02:21.160> going<00:02:21.520> on<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.850> between<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.450> chain

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
what's going on in between the chain

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.350 
what's going on in between the chain
plates<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.980> just<00:02:24.840> run<00:02:25.890> chain<00:02:26.890> lube<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.550> like

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
plates I just run chain lube in like

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.980 
plates I just run chain lube in like
this<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:30.130> can<00:02:30.190> actually<00:02:30.520> go<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.180> put<00:02:31.960> a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
this and you can actually go and put a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.580 
this and you can actually go and put a
put<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.830> drip<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.400> each<00:02:33.580> link<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.930> just

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
put a drip on each link like that I just

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.860 
put a drip on each link like that I just
run<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:36.160> on<00:02:36.370> one<00:02:37.000> edge<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.570> chain<00:02:37.840> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
run it in on one edge of the chain and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.680 
run it in on one edge of the chain and
then<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.530> other<00:02:38.560> edge<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.280> then<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.540> can

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
then on the other edge and then you can

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.500 
then on the other edge and then you can
do<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.870> little<00:02:41.170> reef<00:02:41.920> wipe<00:02:42.400> on<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> outside<00:02:43.240> but

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
do a little reef wipe on the outside but

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.300 
do a little reef wipe on the outside but
I<00:02:43.720> don't<00:02:44.050> usually<00:02:44.170> even<00:02:44.530> bother<00:02:44.740> doing<00:02:45.010> this

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
I don't usually even bother doing this

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.100 
I don't usually even bother doing this
or<00:02:45.550> just<00:02:45.580> leave<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:45.940> overnight<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.810> next

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110

day when I ride it I'm ready to go and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.960 
day when I ride it I'm ready to go and
the<00:02:49.450> chain<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.900> clean<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.560> also<00:02:51.100> do<00:02:51.550> wipe<00:02:51.760> the

literally<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.400> do<00:03:06.610> this<00:03:06.820> in<00:03:07.120> less<00:03:08.050> than

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
literally you can do this in less than

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.550 
literally you can do this in less than
two<00:03:08.470> minutes<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.950> would<00:03:09.010> say<00:03:09.340> your<00:03:09.850> drivetrain

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
two minutes I would say your drivetrain

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.010 
two minutes I would say your drivetrain
will<00:03:11.560> always<00:03:12.070> be<00:03:12.459> running<00:03:12.610> smoothly<00:03:13.090> shifting

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
will always be running smoothly shifting

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.010 
will always be running smoothly shifting
will<00:03:14.170> be<00:03:14.700> will<00:03:15.700> be<00:03:15.730> great<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.360> your<00:03:16.900> whole

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
will be will be great and your whole

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.459 
will be will be great and your whole
drivetrain<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.650> going<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.860> last<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.250> lot<00:03:18.400> longer
