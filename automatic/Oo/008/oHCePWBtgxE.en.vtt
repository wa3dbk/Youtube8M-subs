00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you now want to use this up here to turn

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:09.320 
you now want to use this up here to turn
on<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:02.390> hydraulic<00:01:03.390> pump<00:01:05.450> crank<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:08.330> tube

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
on the hydraulic pump crank it up tube

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.990 
on the hydraulic pump crank it up tube
out<00:01:09.630> there<00:01:12.080> see<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.110> turns<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:14.060> pressure

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
out there see that turns on pressure

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.720 
out there see that turns on pressure
about<00:01:17.800> 22<00:01:18.800> 23<00:01:19.670> bar

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
about 22 23 bar

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.600 
about 22 23 bar
and<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.600> where<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.900> want<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:25.610> now

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and that's where we want to be and now

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.680 
and that's where we want to be and now
in<00:01:27.300> terms<00:01:27.510> of<00:01:27.630> movement<00:01:29.540> this<00:01:30.540> controls<00:01:31.080> the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
in terms of movement this controls the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.750 
in terms of movement this controls the
bucket<00:01:34.910> down<00:01:35.910> brings<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.510> in<00:01:36.860> up<00:01:37.860> sends<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.580> out

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.740 

left<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:41.910> right<00:01:43.160> controls<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.400> turret<00:01:47.750> so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
left and right controls the turret so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.530 
left and right controls the turret so
that's<00:01:48.960> left<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> right<00:01:49.800> here<00:01:50.550> controls

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that's left and right here controls

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:00.860 
that's left and right here controls
turret<00:01:52.550> over<00:01:53.550> here<00:01:54.920> up<00:01:56.930> sends<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:59.330> arm<00:02:00.330> out

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
turret over here up sends the arm out

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.260 
turret over here up sends the arm out
and<00:02:02.030> down<00:02:03.030> brings<00:02:03.480> it<00:02:03.660> in<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:06.120> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
and down brings it in so that's up and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.150 
and down brings it in so that's up and
down<00:02:06.480> and<00:02:06.690> then<00:02:07.160> left<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.950> boom

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
down and then left and right is the boom

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.059 
down and then left and right is the boom
itself

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.050 

so<00:02:14.670> right<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.209> up<00:02:15.859> left<00:02:16.859> is<00:02:17.040> down<00:02:20.060> that's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
so right is up left is down that's

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.690 
so right is up left is down that's
pretty<00:02:21.239> much<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.510> whole<00:02:21.659> one<00:02:21.959> if<00:02:22.469> you<00:02:23.249> were<00:02:23.459> in

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
pretty much the whole one if you were in

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580 
pretty much the whole one if you were in
the<00:02:24.120> configuration<00:02:24.450> where<00:02:25.079> you<00:02:25.200> could<00:02:25.379> use

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
the configuration where you could use

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.170 
the configuration where you could use
the<00:02:25.739> tracks<00:02:26.989> these<00:02:27.989> on<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.319> side<00:02:28.999> would<00:02:29.999> allow

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
the tracks these on the side would allow

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.949 
the tracks these on the side would allow
you<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.329> do<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:32.420> since<00:02:33.420> we're<00:02:33.659> not<00:02:33.780> in

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
you to do that and since we're not in

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.269 
you to do that and since we're not in
that<00:02:34.049> configuration<00:02:34.670> those<00:02:35.670> are<00:02:35.819> not<00:02:35.969> mapped
