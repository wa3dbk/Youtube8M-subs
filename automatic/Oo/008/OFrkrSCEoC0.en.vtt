00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.160
 alexandra logistician like sport at 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.620
 bring up of an almost perfect 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.929
 will tell you about a foil 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.290
 that not a single foot down this time 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.389
 there is not a single one 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.609
 Bubble was underneath which one did not get out 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.939
 get the product would have here is the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.400
 smart from Enke this is this one 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.289
 Relieves protector I know that correctly 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.550
 is not so optimal but it can 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.930
 I understand it's more about that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.660
 her a bit massive a bit 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.200
 learn a protector I was five exactly 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.510
 when he only that is the matte variant 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.910
 but let's see something else like her 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.190
 is as always completely charged 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.570
 everything she needs you have then 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.000
 Talk about turning the case 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.340
 get a tip the film is also this 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.020
 case out of it because it just before and 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.160
 Do something then you have even less 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.020
 fluff at the whole thing it looks like 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.789
 So, stop just before 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.530
 This protective cover is around it 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.059
 out then you have no merge 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.010
 still on the back of the case 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.019
 on it and then you have so I did 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.080
 stop in there is in it 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.240
 just under 36 page is down it would have to be yes 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.950
 no uncooked so just pretend 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.200
 that's the bottom of it, too 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.240
 blade on it and then it's actually 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.790
 the film and if your desk 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.920
 this protective film of the shell rausholt and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.049
 lives somewhere from yes then sucks 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.299
 park city diffuse you too you have to 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.180
 So put a time on display 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.770
 so get out before it uses 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.630
 and then watch it a bit 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.470
 no fussel are on the back are 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.159
 Blow with even giotto click 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.900
 be as if you put it and all 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.159
 have seen the game down here 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.380
 down here on the row 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.570
 fix exactly with a bit of theme 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.549
 if it wants to and exactly 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.619
 then the back of the film 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.840
 starting to get a bit complicated 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.700
 probably because this is the first one 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.189
 reasonably done 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.469
 Tip it just fix each one on one side 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.329
 really fit with this movie 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.369
 found and then behind the film 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.390
 subtract and then afterwards 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.189
 drauflegen 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.420
 that 's a bit you can not do it 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.270
 again point as she already has to 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.819
 to begin 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.420
 class ok now I'm doing the dect 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.500
 so be careful before deducting 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.680
 because that's wearing a protective film 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.720
 discovers foil well here is one 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.700
 small team is pushing a small bubble 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.849
 I did not get that fat 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.040
 and kept me infused 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.680
 otherwise was born 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.680
 okay but understanding so we 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.019
 had downstairs 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.110
 that would be as if he this as a protective film 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.390
 I like that in between that the dect 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.780
 film that made the connection that we 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.290
 from sandwich you would go and 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.709
 would fix the sample so fix 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.690
 there are once so high and fix 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.230
 makes behind practically ensures that is yes 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.230
 worth something 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:06.370
 fixed the money and then the back 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:10.510
 the back protective film from so from where 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.489
 the whole thing looks so supported 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.600
 the foals go out and 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:20.049
 You can see her behind protective film 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.430
 tell now can also get 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.060
 if it does not work then there was no 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.519
 problem 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.250
 Watch the video 15 times and then 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.319
 has understood the film too 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.150
 beware, I'll see how 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.090
 now this anti reflex 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.299
 Coating is what I look like 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.220
 keep your spa for the nose so you notice 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.930
 not that close to the reflex the mat 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.690
 on it is and very translucent and 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.440
 but are much less fat 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.859
 reflection as i can not get inside 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.859
 see 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.060
 that could be like outside use 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.370
 be more pleasant 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.500
 yes so it is a slightly mat 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.480
 So I had my first economist from 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.340
 done right but this is here 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.560
 a light matte foil I think it is quite 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.109
 pleasant and always so the 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.700
 camera so diagonally not on it keeps you 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.130
 already noticed that a matte foil on it 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.049
 is 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.120
 you can see that in this 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.509
 view you can see that the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.889
 matt foil is on it and also the 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.620
 lateral viewing angle is one 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.600
 Bit then minimal reported than now 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.120
 normal , maybe you have to roma 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.340
 test that was fun left below 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.600
 if you get the shiny and the 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.940
 getting mat does not matter 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.509
 these are all high quality few 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.240
 foal because it is so deep in it 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:45.340
 here is such a sticker in it whether 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.880
 the fuselage in polished clock is in it 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:55.500
 have seen not need the 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.500
 it was government of anchor and at
