up<00:05:37.880> now<00:05:38.210> now<00:05:39.140> I'm<00:05:39.230> gonna<00:05:39.350> substitute<00:05:40.040> on<00:05:40.250> his

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
up now now I'm gonna substitute on his

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.020 
up now now I'm gonna substitute on his
predicted<00:05:40.970> T<00:05:41.180> wave<00:05:42.160> if<00:05:43.160> he<00:05:43.370> goes<00:05:43.520> into<00:05:43.760> heat

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
predicted T wave if he goes into heat

ran<00:05:44.530> with<00:05:45.530> a<00:05:45.560> quiver<00:05:45.950> dance<00:05:45.980> up<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:46.730> should<00:05:47.390> be

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
ran with a quiver dance up I should be

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.559 
ran with a quiver dance up I should be
in<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.020> clear

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.329 

but<00:05:52.229> I'm<00:05:52.319> just<00:05:52.439> gonna<00:05:52.589> start<00:05:52.919> setting<00:05:53.159> up

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:53.339 
but I'm just gonna start setting up

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:58.309 
but I'm just gonna start setting up
multiple<00:05:53.550> quiver<00:05:54.059> dances<00:05:56.869> and<00:05:57.869> unless<00:05:58.050> yes

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319

something<00:05:58.740> weird<00:05:58.979> like<00:05:59.460> hidden<00:06:00.419> power<00:06:00.749> frock

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
something weird like hidden power frock

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.049 
something weird like hidden power frock
he's<00:06:02.279> gonna<00:06:02.429> switch<00:06:02.699> right<00:06:02.969> out<00:06:03.439> okay

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:05.059 
he's gonna switch right out okay

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:08.149 
he's gonna switch right out okay
well<00:06:06.059> this<00:06:06.209> heat<00:06:06.419> ran<00:06:06.749> I'm<00:06:07.499> gonna<00:06:07.709> try<00:06:07.860> to<00:06:07.919> get

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
well this heat ran I'm gonna try to get

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.889 
well this heat ran I'm gonna try to get
it<00:06:08.279> with<00:06:08.309> some<00:06:08.699> confusion<00:06:09.240> hacks<00:06:09.449> that's<00:06:09.809> the

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:09.899 
it with some confusion hacks that's the

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:11.959 
it with some confusion hacks that's the
only<00:06:10.050> thing<00:06:10.229> I<00:06:10.319> can<00:06:10.469> really<00:06:10.619> do<00:06:10.889> since<00:06:11.849> its

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
only thing I can really do since its

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.389 
only thing I can really do since its
offensive<00:06:12.800> might<00:06:13.800> work

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:14.399 
offensive might work

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.369 
offensive might work
maybe<00:06:14.610> I'll<00:06:14.759> get<00:06:14.849> a<00:06:14.909> pair<00:06:15.179> of<00:06:15.209> hacks<00:06:15.479> he

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
maybe I'll get a pair of hacks he

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.679 
maybe I'll get a pair of hacks he
shouldn't<00:06:16.800> have<00:06:16.860> roar<00:06:17.309> since<00:06:17.909> he's<00:06:18.059> offensive

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
shouldn't have roar since he's offensive

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:20.499 
shouldn't have roar since he's offensive
but<00:06:18.959> you<00:06:19.080> never<00:06:19.259> know

now<00:06:55.379> I'm<00:06:55.529> gonna<00:06:55.709> sub<00:06:56.479> just<00:06:57.479> sub<00:06:57.719> urges<00:06:57.959> quiver

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
now I'm gonna sub just sub urges quiver

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:04.519 
now I'm gonna sub just sub urges quiver
dance<00:06:58.409> I<00:07:01.969> think<00:07:02.969> the<00:07:03.749> best<00:07:03.990> thing<00:07:04.229> to<00:07:04.259> do<00:07:04.409> would

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:04.529 
dance I think the best thing to do would

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:07.069 
dance I think the best thing to do would
be<00:07:04.680> just<00:07:04.709> a<00:07:04.979> quiver<00:07:05.249> dance<00:07:05.839> so<00:07:06.839> that's<00:07:06.959> what

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:07.079 
be just a quiver dance so that's what

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:11.929 
be just a quiver dance so that's what
I'm<00:07:07.169> gonna<00:07:07.259> do<00:07:08.749> because<00:07:10.189> bug<00:07:11.189> buzz<00:07:11.399> does<00:07:11.699> more

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:11.939 
I'm gonna do because bug buzz does more

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.449 
I'm gonna do because bug buzz does more
to<00:07:12.059> hit<00:07:12.180> pal<00:07:12.389> Don<00:07:12.629> there's<00:07:13.289> a<00:07:13.379> good<00:07:13.589> chance<00:07:13.829> it

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:14.459 
to hit pal Don there's a good chance it

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:16.999 
to hit pal Don there's a good chance it
was<00:07:14.610> like<00:07:14.699> a<00:07:14.729> 25%<00:07:15.599> chance<00:07:15.659> he<00:07:15.990> has<00:07:16.139> to<00:07:16.289> attack<00:07:16.619> I

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:17.009 
was like a 25% chance he has to attack I

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:20.239 
was like a 25% chance he has to attack I
think<00:07:17.189> the<00:07:17.759> odds<00:07:18.439> so<00:07:19.439> I'm<00:07:19.589> gonna<00:07:19.680> go<00:07:19.829> for<00:07:20.009> a

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:20.249 
think the odds so I'm gonna go for a

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:23.089 
think the odds so I'm gonna go for a
