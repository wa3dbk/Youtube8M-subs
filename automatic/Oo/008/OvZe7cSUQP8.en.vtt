00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
think that's more down to the fish their

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.070 
think that's more down to the fish their
last<00:02:16.970> two<00:02:17.120> games<00:02:17.150> we've<00:02:17.540> got<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.780> know<00:02:17.900> we've

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
last two games we've got you know we've

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.740

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
so we've got that confident believe that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.120 
so we've got that confident believe that
we<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:22.910> jog<00:02:23.450> job<00:02:23.810> points<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.410> games<00:02:24.830> and
