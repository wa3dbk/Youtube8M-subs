00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.380
 hello to all i'm back in 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.480
 the seat card with my friend sadie the 83 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.730
 06 remember we had done the night 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.920
 jump actually this fifth nigel of this 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.080
 map that actually achieved 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.279
 inside a balcony this time I 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.590
 do them but I do not make it in 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.350
 balcony you see I land on the on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.350
 these laurel species here and there 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 actually already it makes you a spot 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.649
 in height of course but what 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.379
 is interesting it's from there 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.329
 two sets this 2-2 this point there you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.190
 will be able to return you went to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.840
 the edge of the building just for 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.789
 to be able to see wayne bridge so see 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.629
 that a player returns I'm not on the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.879
 balcony 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.789
 I'm really outside the balcony 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.890
 see position on the left side 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.609
 outside and that's where actually 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.439
 I'll have to go along the palco 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.880
 made sure there is not too much 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.060
 front obstacles to be able to see 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 advanced and pulis and where the water is with 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.450
 it says he you see below 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.310
 which gives me some indications because 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.909
 that he sees me necessarily under a 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.280
 other angle 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.130
 and so here is the border of this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.630
 building and from there already there is the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.430
 wayne bridge who what is done 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 to appear who will go what will emerge 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.790
 you will see since after we see it 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.820
 better a little bit when I'm in 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.799
 down below so actually the wall and one to 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.560
 right so here I am we'll say on 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.540
 a small ledge outside see 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.659
 so now is I going to move forward 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.340
 and when I shift I see right and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.369
 well here this time I get into the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.530
 wall of the wall so we are in version 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.850
 updated 1 032 gosselin I the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.799
 remember so this is not home to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.960
 this day is so see we distinguish the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.439
 already dic the map guide homes on 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.750
 the right 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.040
 so here now this time i'm going 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.460
 shift me a little bit and I'm going 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.439
 moving forward 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.850
 see I fell below and there 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.399
 we realize that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.530
 I go see in the wall that is there one 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.670
 is in the old bridge and we see see 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.840
 all the to building and the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.209
 the map the empty of the map this is it 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.739
 interestingly enough it was discovered I 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.110
 would say inadvertently by my friend 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.920
 precisely what has he 83 zarti there he has 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.930
 could not do it because he had a 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.640
 man problem is so actually 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.709
 I got stuck but see it 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.420
 interesting enough and send I 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.770
 back up again let's go back hoy 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.390
 flash in the dark part so at 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.000
 right the left in the wall dropped to 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.130
 outside I go well and here is 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.550
 Anyway for this veil bridge seats 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.550
