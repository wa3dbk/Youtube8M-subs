studio<00:00:02.159> you<00:00:02.340> know<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.610> UI<00:00:02.760> like<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:03.120> said<00:00:03.389> is

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
studio you know the UI like I said is

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.650 
studio you know the UI like I said is
it's<00:00:04.200> programmer<00:00:04.680> art<00:00:05.520> right<00:00:05.730> now<00:00:05.910> but<00:00:06.540> that's

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
it's programmer art right now but that's

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.110 
it's programmer art right now but that's
what<00:00:06.779> exactly<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.500> tool<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.010> so<00:00:08.370> you

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
what exactly is the tool for that so you

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.030 
what exactly is the tool for that so you
know<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.300> saw<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.540> TDC<00:00:10.050> was<00:00:10.230> very<00:00:10.500> very<00:00:10.800> rough

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
know you saw the TDC was very very rough

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.980 
know you saw the TDC was very very rough
it's<00:00:11.280> slightly<00:00:11.759> left<00:00:12.059> rough<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.630> idea<00:00:12.929> is

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
it's slightly left rough the idea is

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.810 
it's slightly left rough the idea is
that<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.170> can<00:00:13.349> actually<00:00:13.500> lay<00:00:13.769> out<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.190> make

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
that you can actually lay out and make

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.519 
that you can actually lay out and make
an<00:00:15.030> entire<00:00:15.330> small<00:00:15.719> game<00:00:15.929> using<00:00:16.260> nothing<00:00:16.410> but

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
an entire small game using nothing but

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.700 
an entire small game using nothing but
your<00:00:16.650> iPad<00:00:17.630> so<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.750> actually<00:00:18.900> kind<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.410> scrap

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
your iPad so we actually kind of scrap

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.900 
your iPad so we actually kind of scrap
the<00:00:19.890> original<00:00:20.279> idea<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> oh<00:00:20.609> you're<00:00:20.760> going<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the original idea of oh you're going to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.029 
the original idea of oh you're going to
write<00:00:21.060> code<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.410> push<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> button<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
write code and you can push a button to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.000 
write code and you can push a button to
run<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.460> that's<00:00:24.269> okay<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.689> all<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.410> Apple

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
run it and that's okay and all but Apple

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.920 
run it and that's okay and all but Apple
would<00:00:26.070> never<00:00:26.250> approve<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.699> obviously<00:00:27.240> because

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
would never approve it obviously because

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.269 
would never approve it obviously because
heaven<00:00:28.230> forbid<00:00:28.470> anything<00:00:28.830> get<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.130> there

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
heaven forbid anything get out there

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.040 
heaven forbid anything get out there
that<00:00:29.400> they<00:00:29.490> can't<00:00:29.760> keep<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.029> eye<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.960> we

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
that they can't keep an eye on so we

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.420 
that they can't keep an eye on so we
change<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.380> idea<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.189> even<00:00:32.309> easier

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
change this idea one make it even easier

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
change this idea one make it even easier
so<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.149> idea<00:00:33.300> scene<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.050> I'm<00:00:34.110> going

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
so we have this idea scene so I'm going

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.770 
so we have this idea scene so I'm going
to<00:00:34.320> load<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.649> current<00:00:34.950> scene<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.690> you

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
to load up my current scene and so you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.510 
to load up my current scene and so you
can<00:00:36.899> load<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> scene<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.129> know<00:00:38.250> everything

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
can load a scene and you know everything

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.889 
can load a scene and you know everything
in<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> scene<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.420> sprite<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
in the scene is just a sprite and you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.150 
in the scene is just a sprite and you
can<00:00:40.050> move<00:00:40.140> them<00:00:40.260> around<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.950> play<00:00:41.100> some

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
can move them around you can play some

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.010 
can move them around you can play some
wherever<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.550> want<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:42.750> play

something<00:01:30.510> like<00:01:30.710> Game<00:01:31.710> salad<00:01:32.160> or<00:01:32.280> something

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
something like Game salad or something

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.390 
something like Game salad or something
like<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.910> mean<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.330> it<00:01:33.770> feature<00:01:34.770> wise<00:01:35.040> one

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
like that I mean is it feature wise one

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.609 
like that I mean is it feature wise one
so<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.760> is<00:01:35.940> so<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.780> engine<00:01:37.050> behind<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.530> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
so this is so the engine behind it is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.190 
so this is so the engine behind it is
actually<00:01:37.830> incredibly<00:01:38.580> robust<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:40.080> do

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
actually incredibly robust it can do

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.630 
actually incredibly robust it can do
almost<00:01:40.410> everything<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:41.100> powered<00:01:41.400> by<00:01:41.430> an

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
almost everything is powered by an

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.070 
almost everything is powered by an
awesome<00:01:41.970> Lua<00:01:42.149> scripting<00:01:42.240> back<00:01:42.660> in<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.960> we

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
awesome Lua scripting back in that we

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.990 
awesome Lua scripting back in that we
may<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.410> may<00:01:43.560> not<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.890> able<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.340> expose<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
may or may not be able to expose the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.480 
may or may not be able to expose the
Pentagon<00:01:45.960> apples<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.560> days<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.340> come

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
Pentagon apples of days so you can come

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.920 
Pentagon apples of days so you can come
here<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.910> script<00:01:48.210> editor<00:01:48.540> where<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.780> can

here to the script editor where you can

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
here to the script editor where you can
actually<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:49.410> know<00:01:49.530> line<00:01:49.770> by<00:01:49.950> line<00:01:50.100> edited

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
actually you know line by line edited

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.330 
actually you know line by line edited
right<00:01:51.060> lua<00:01:51.240> code<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.720> save<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.050> out<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
right lua code and save it out and that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.830 
right lua code and save it out and that

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.860 
button but I'm not going to do that for
now<00:02:22.610> watching<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.239> then<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.720> have

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
now watching and then you know we have

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.770 
now watching and then you know we have
our<00:02:26.480> secured<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.660> instance<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.140> arm<00:02:28.500> asset

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
our secured for instance that arm asset

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.949 
our secured for instance that arm asset
it<00:02:30.709> was<00:02:30.860> am<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.520> pray<00:02:31.760> instead<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.270> standard

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
it was am to pray instead of standard

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.800 
it was am to pray instead of standard
and<00:02:33.140> treatment<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.690> actual

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
and treatment and this is the actual

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.600 
and treatment and this is the actual
cool<00:02:36.110> thing<00:02:36.290> here<00:02:36.319> is<00:02:36.500> calling<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.220> visual

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
cool thing here is calling the visual

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.780 
cool thing here is calling the visual
editor<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:38.780> i'm<00:02:38.870> actually<00:02:38.930> not<00:02:39.140> load<00:02:39.380> up

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
editor and so i'm actually not load up

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.480 
editor and so i'm actually not load up
put<00:02:40.790> up<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:40.970> arm<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.040> side<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.310> writing

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
put up that arm and so side of writing

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.920 
put up that arm and so side of writing
code<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.880> actually<00:02:44.150> have<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.420> entire<00:02:44.720> like

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
code you actually have this entire like

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.570 
code you actually have this entire like
float<00:02:45.230> simple<00:02:45.680> flow<00:02:45.890> chart<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.340> actual

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
float simple flow chart of actual

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.770 
float simple flow chart of actual
actions<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.090> everything<00:02:47.390> take<00:02:47.569> place

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
actions that everything take place

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.570 
actions that everything take place
really<00:02:48.319> need<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:48.709> in<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:48.860> case<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.520> know

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
really need so in this case you know

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.340 
really need so in this case you know
when<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.790> arm<00:02:49.910> is<00:02:50.000> initialized<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.810> calls<00:02:51.140> set

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
when the arm is initialized it calls set

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.830 
when the arm is initialized it calls set
animation<00:02:51.860> which<00:02:52.160> obviously<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.480> needs<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.750> be

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
animation which obviously it needs to be

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.050 
animation which obviously it needs to be
cleaned<00:02:54.080> up<00:02:54.200> knees<00:02:54.440> documentation<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:55.340> all

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
cleaned up knees documentation but all

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.940 
cleaned up knees documentation but all
this<00:02:56.270> says<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.569> that<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.110> know<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.650> laid<00:02:57.920> out

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
this says is that you know it's laid out

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.570 
this says is that you know it's laid out
in<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.370> 2<00:02:58.760> by<00:02:58.940> one<00:02:59.230> sprite<00:03:00.230> sheet<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.739> playing

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
in a 2 by one sprite sheet and playing

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.640 
in a 2 by one sprite sheet and playing
frame<00:03:01.880> 0<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.300> 1<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.750> wait<00:03:03.200> four<00:03:03.440> frames

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
frame 0 to 1 and wait four frames

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.600 
frame 0 to 1 and wait four frames
between<00:03:03.860> animation<00:03:04.870> we<00:03:05.870> actually<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.610> the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
between animation we actually have the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.310 
between animation we actually have the
soldier<00:03:08.060> which<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.330> slightly<00:03:08.570> more<00:03:08.900> complex

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
soldier which is slightly more complex

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.130 
soldier which is slightly more complex
you<00:03:09.590> make<00:03:09.739> some<00:03:09.920> self<00:03:10.130> control<00:03:11.019> they're<00:03:12.019> like

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
you make some self control they're like

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.330 
you make some self control they're like
the<00:03:12.260> bee<00:03:12.410> gees<00:03:12.440> were<00:03:12.620> probably<00:03:13.040> more

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
the bee gees were probably more

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.430 
the bee gees were probably more
interesting<00:03:13.940> actually<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.900> was<00:03:14.930> kind<00:03:15.260> of

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
interesting actually it was kind of

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.470 
interesting actually it was kind of
slightly<00:03:16.010> more<00:03:16.340> complex<00:03:16.700> flow<00:03:16.970> chart<00:03:17.239> going

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
slightly more complex flow chart going

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.000 
slightly more complex flow chart going
on<00:03:17.630> it's<00:03:18.110> really<00:03:18.319> interesting<00:03:18.620> oh<00:03:18.830> that's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
on it's really interesting oh that's

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.860 
on it's really interesting oh that's
handled<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.430> mean<00:03:19.550> it's<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:20.720> you

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
handled I mean it's and so and so you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.240 
handled I mean it's and so and so you
actually<00:03:21.050> you<00:03:21.440> know<00:03:21.530> leaking<00:03:21.800> advocated

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
actually you know leaking advocated

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.160 
actually you know leaking advocated
stuff<00:03:22.430> they<00:03:22.580> managed<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.480> make<00:03:23.630> really<00:03:23.930> so

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
stuff they managed to make really so

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.720 
stuff they managed to make really so
again<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:24.800> idea<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.340> I'll<00:03:25.430> show<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.610> I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
again this idea here I'll show you I

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.960 
again this idea here I'll show you I
mean<00:03:25.880> monthly<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.470> again<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.640> will<00:03:28.850> be

mean monthly so you again this will be
prettier<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.360> promise<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:29.870> its<00:03:30.620> program<00:03:31.040> our

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
prettier I promise but its program our

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.920 
prettier I promise but its program our
agent<00:03:31.550> progress<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.510> can<00:03:32.690> literally

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
agent progress so you can literally

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.479 
agent progress so you can literally
actually<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:33.560> do<00:03:33.709> things<00:03:33.890> like<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.340> say

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
what I want to get the position of this

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.039 
what I want to get the position of this
thing<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.370> we<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.090> drag<00:03:38.329> out<00:03:38.630> from<00:03:38.930> this

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
thing and we just drag out from this

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.410 
thing and we just drag out from this
little<00:03:39.230> node<00:03:39.440> down<00:03:39.680> here<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.150> literally

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
little node down here and you literally

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.069 
little node down here and you literally
can<00:03:41.720> just<00:03:41.900> change<00:03:43.180> these<00:03:44.180> famous<00:03:44.540> works<00:03:44.900> like

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
can just change these famous works like

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.080 
can just change these famous works like
a<00:03:45.110> like<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> version<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.370> Automator<00:03:46.820> for

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
a like a version of Automator for

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.330 
a like a version of Automator for
websites<00:03:47.510> they<00:03:48.380> put<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.590> lot<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:49.040> took<00:03:49.190> from

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
websites they put a lot it took from

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.770 
websites they put a lot it took from
that<00:03:49.400> there's<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.060> number<00:03:50.269> of<00:03:50.329> tools<00:03:50.480> out<00:03:50.750> there

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
that there's a number of tools out there

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.750 
that there's a number of tools out there
all<00:03:51.079> of<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.320> big<00:03:51.560> game<00:03:52.010> engines<00:03:52.370> have<00:03:52.549> this

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
all of the big game engines have this

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.970 
all of the big game engines have this
functionality<00:03:52.910> in<00:03:53.299> there<00:03:53.390> AI<00:03:53.540> editors<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.440> so

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
functionality in there AI editors and so

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.289 
functionality in there AI editors and so
we<00:03:55.100> thought<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.430> would<00:03:55.489> be<00:03:55.549> interesting<00:03:55.670> if

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
we thought it would be interesting if

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.970 
we thought it would be interesting if
well<00:03:56.540> let's<00:03:56.810> say<00:03:57.049> we<00:03:57.260> do<00:03:57.410> something<00:03:57.799> very

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
well let's say we do something very

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.069 
well let's say we do something very
similar<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.519> this<00:03:58.640> only<00:03:59.450> let's<00:03:59.690> make<00:03:59.930> it

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
similar to this only let's make it

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.250 
similar to this only let's make it
usable<00:04:00.530> on<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.430> iPad<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.000> let's<00:04:02.480> actually<00:04:02.690> do

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
usable on the iPad and let's actually do

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.099 
usable on the iPad and let's actually do
cool<00:04:03.859> game<00:04:04.070> with<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:05.060> two<00:04:05.239> we<00:04:05.390> can<00:04:05.510> do<00:04:05.660> well

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
cool game with it the two we can do well

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.500 
cool game with it the two we can do well
no<00:04:06.400> what's<00:04:07.400> he<00:04:07.519> like<00:04:07.760> if<00:04:07.940> you've<00:04:08.120> invested

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
no what's he like if you've invested

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.060 
no what's he like if you've invested
hours<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:08.930> hours<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.170> hours<00:04:09.350> into<00:04:09.709> this<00:04:09.829> like

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
hours and hours and hours into this like

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.890 
hours and hours and hours into this like
how<00:04:10.280> do<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.459> get<00:04:10.640> your<00:04:10.850> game<00:04:11.150> off<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.780> your

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
how do you get your game off of your

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.740 
how do you get your game off of your
iPad<00:04:12.350> so<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.880> one<00:04:14.030> good<00:04:14.239> thing<00:04:14.269> about<00:04:14.420> doing

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
iPad so the one good thing about doing

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.590 
iPad so the one good thing about doing
this<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.609> even<00:04:16.609> though<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.789> generates<00:04:17.239> actual

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
this is even though it generates actual

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.000 
this is even though it generates actual
code<00:04:17.810> based<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.229> this<00:04:18.350> don't<00:04:18.560> on<00:04:18.680> top<00:04:18.769> of<00:04:18.890> that

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
code based on this don't on top of that

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.520 
code based on this don't on top of that
it<00:04:19.640> is<00:04:19.910> all<00:04:20.209> technically<00:04:20.690> just<00:04:20.900> loading<00:04:21.140> XML

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
it is all technically just loading XML

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.590 
it is all technically just loading XML
files<00:04:21.769> which<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.820> one<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.060> those<00:04:23.150> files<00:04:23.390> that

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
files which is one of those files that

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.969 
files which is one of those files that
we<00:04:23.690> can<00:04:23.840> convince<00:04:24.080> Apple<00:04:24.410> look<00:04:24.560> it's<00:04:24.770> just

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
we can convince Apple look it's just

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.400 
we can convince Apple look it's just
data<00:04:25.220> it's<00:04:25.490> not<00:04:25.640> code

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
data it's not code

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.830 
data it's not code
so<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:27.550> actually<00:04:27.760> connects<00:04:28.210> through<00:04:28.450> through

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
so it actually connects through through

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.500 
so it actually connects through through
itunes<00:04:29.170> but<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:30.220> can<00:04:30.430> grant<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.910> can<00:04:31.270> all

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
itunes but you can grant you can all

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.120 
itunes but you can grant you can all

those sprites i dragged on weren't drawn

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.950 
those sprites i dragged on weren't drawn
in<00:04:33.310> this<00:04:33.430> because<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.940> image<00:04:34.270> editor<00:04:34.600> kind<00:04:34.900> of

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
when i came in here and said well I want

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.670 
when i came in here and said well I want
to<00:04:43.300> add<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.420> nice<00:04:43.570> right<00:04:43.840> there's<00:04:44.440> all<00:04:44.560> the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
to add a nice right there's all the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.520 
to add a nice right there's all the
sprites<00:04:44.920> I<00:04:45.040> could<00:04:45.190> pick<00:04:45.340> from<00:04:45.900> ok<00:04:46.900> great<00:04:47.290> and

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
sprites I could pick from ok great and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.160 
sprites I could pick from ok great and
so<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.980> idea<00:04:48.010> is<00:04:48.340> that<00:04:48.450> we're<00:04:49.450> we're<00:04:49.900> trying

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
so the idea is that we're we're trying

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.870 
so the idea is that we're we're trying
to<00:04:50.230> hear<00:04:50.350> exactly<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.860> best<00:04:51.040> way<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.370> going<00:04:51.790> to

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
to hear exactly the best way is going to

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.490 
to hear exactly the best way is going to
happen<00:04:52.180> but<00:04:52.330> effectively<00:04:52.900> you'll<00:04:53.140> be<00:04:53.260> able<00:04:53.380> to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
happen but effectively you'll be able to

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.070 
happen but effectively you'll be able to
either<00:04:54.100> export<00:04:54.760> out<00:04:54.970> a<00:04:55.000> bundle<00:04:55.510> directly<00:04:55.930> from

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
either export out a bundle directly from

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.230 
either export out a bundle directly from
game<00:04:56.470> student<00:04:56.860> here<00:04:57.040> or<00:04:57.550> just<00:04:57.700> copy<00:04:57.970> all<00:04:58.210> the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
game student here or just copy all the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.530 
game student here or just copy all the
files<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:58.810> whipped<00:04:59.140> them<00:04:59.260> up<00:04:59.410> and<00:05:00.540> again

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
files that whipped them up and again

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.400 
files that whipped them up and again
that's<00:05:01.660> one<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:01.990> things<00:05:02.020> we're<00:05:02.230> trying<00:05:02.290> to

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
that's one of the things we're trying to

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.750 
that's one of the things we're trying to
feel<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.680> detail<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.130> idea<00:05:03.400> that<00:05:03.460> we'll<00:05:03.730> be

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
feel the detail the idea that we'll be

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.100 
feel the detail the idea that we'll be
able<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:04.000> ship<00:05:04.210> you<00:05:04.360> back<00:05:04.390> like<00:05:04.780> here's<00:05:04.990> an

when<00:05:19.510> little<00:05:19.750> 24-hour<00:05:20.230> projects<00:05:20.860> not<00:05:20.980> need<00:05:21.130> to

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
when little 24-hour projects not need to

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.250 
when little 24-hour projects not need to
lug<00:05:21.370> my<00:05:21.400> laptop<00:05:21.880> around<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:22.870> because<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.140> mean

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
lug my laptop around and because I mean

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.930 
lug my laptop around and because I mean
the<00:05:23.320> cool<00:05:23.500> thing<00:05:23.650> about<00:05:23.710> this<00:05:24.010> is<00:05:24.070> you<00:05:24.850> know

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
the cool thing about this is you know

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.610 
the cool thing about this is you know
you<00:05:25.000> can<00:05:25.210> test<00:05:25.420> here<00:05:25.720> you<00:05:25.870> can<00:05:26.020> look<00:05:26.440> at<00:05:26.530> the

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
you can test here you can look at the

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.470 
you can test here you can look at the
various<00:05:26.860> objects<00:05:27.280> in<00:05:27.370> your<00:05:27.400> scene<00:05:27.520> we<00:05:28.360> can

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
various objects in your scene we can

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.580 
various objects in your scene we can
also<00:05:28.600> just<00:05:28.810> look<00:05:28.990> around<00:05:29.140> here<00:05:29.410> and<00:05:29.470> play

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
also just look around here and play

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.220 
also just look around here and play
fullscreen<00:05:29.800> like<00:05:30.190> you<00:05:30.340> would<00:05:30.490> normally<00:05:31.230> and

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
fullscreen like you would normally and

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.020 
fullscreen like you would normally and
so<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.920> idea<00:05:33.040> here<00:05:33.250> is<00:05:33.520> that<00:05:33.610> you<00:05:33.880> can

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
so the idea here is that you can

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.570 
so the idea here is that you can
actually<00:05:34.410> play<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.590> right<00:05:35.710> there<00:05:35.980> come<00:05:36.370> back

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
actually play it right there come back

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.670 
actually play it right there come back
stop<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.270> action<00:05:37.450> go<00:05:37.840> back<00:05:38.050> actually<00:05:38.470> edit

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
stop the action go back actually edit

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.840 
stop the action go back actually edit
one<00:05:38.800> of<00:05:38.860> your<00:05:38.950> strips<00:05:39.310> you<00:05:39.490> can<00:05:39.520> actually<00:05:39.700> just

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
one of your strips you can actually just

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.090 
one of your strips you can actually just
tweak<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:40.420> I<00:05:40.720> really<00:05:41.560> mess<00:05:41.710> with<00:05:41.740> a<00:05:41.950> hatchet

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
tweak and I really mess with a hatchet
