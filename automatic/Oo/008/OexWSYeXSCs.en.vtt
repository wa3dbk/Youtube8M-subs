00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:16.490 
to use your finger just make sure that
your<00:01:57.530> hair<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:57.950> smooth<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.850> flexi<00:01:59.210> rod

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.540 

so<00:02:17.500> what's<00:02:17.680> my<00:02:17.800> whole<00:02:18.040> entire<00:02:18.310> head<00:02:18.489> is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
so what's my whole entire head is

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.729 
so what's my whole entire head is
complete<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.120> had<00:02:19.360> about<00:02:19.569> 60<00:02:20.140> rods<00:02:20.379> in<00:02:20.590> there

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
complete I had about 60 rods in there

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.869 
complete I had about 60 rods in there
and<00:02:20.950> I'm<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.129> going<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.340> sit<00:02:21.550> under<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
and I'm just going to sit under the

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.630 
and I'm just going to sit under the
dryer<00:02:21.910> for<00:02:22.450> two<00:02:22.870> hours<00:02:23.230> or<00:02:23.560> until<00:02:23.590> my<00:02:24.400> hair

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
dryer for two hours or until my hair

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.210 
dryer for two hours or until my hair
dries<00:02:24.879> and<00:02:25.470> then<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:26.650> on<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.010> takedown

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
dries and then it's on to the takedown

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.410 
dries and then it's on to the takedown
which<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.700> pretty<00:02:27.879> simple<00:02:28.330> and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
which is pretty simple and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.020 
which is pretty simple and
straightforward<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.190> roll<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.670> flexi

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
straightforward you just roll the flexi

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.850 
straightforward you just roll the flexi
rod<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.480> opposite<00:02:31.870> direction<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:32.530> you

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
rod in the opposite direction that you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:45.600 
rod in the opposite direction that you
rolled<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.849> in<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.379> that's<00:02:35.379> it<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.340> these<00:02:45.489> are

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
rolled it in and that's it so these are

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.039 
rolled it in and that's it so these are
what<00:02:45.700> my<00:02:45.819> curls<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.150> looking<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.569> before

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
what my curls are looking like before

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.430 
what my curls are looking like before
any<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.620> them<00:02:47.890> separating<00:02:48.549> or<00:02:48.760> fluffing<00:02:49.440> as

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
any of them separating or fluffing as

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.720 
any of them separating or fluffing as
you<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.709> see<00:02:50.890> there's<00:02:51.099> not<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.250> lot<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.519> volume

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
you can see there's not a lot of volume

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.330 
you can see there's not a lot of volume
so<00:02:52.599> I<00:02:52.630> got<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.989> take<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> next<00:02:53.980> step

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
so I got to take it to the next step

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.630 
so I got to take it to the next step
which<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.780> separating<00:02:55.780> each<00:02:55.989> curl<00:02:56.799> into<00:02:57.129> three

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
which is separating each curl into three

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.490 
which is separating each curl into three
to<00:02:57.760> four<00:02:57.970> sections<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:59.200> will<00:02:59.379> just

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
to four sections and this will just

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.430 
to four sections and this will just
create<00:02:59.799> a<00:02:59.860> lot<00:03:00.040> more<00:03:00.250> volume<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:01.140> bigness<00:03:02.140> and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
create a lot more volume and bigness and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.430 
create a lot more volume and bigness and
that's<00:03:03.129> what<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.370> love<00:03:03.579> so<00:03:03.819> yeah<00:03:04.780> keep<00:03:05.170> going

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
that's what I love so yeah keep going

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.080 
that's what I love so yeah keep going
until<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.829> achieve<00:03:05.920> your<00:03:06.400> desired<00:03:06.730> look

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090
