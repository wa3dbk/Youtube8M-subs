each other with bones and rocks very

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.830 
each other with bones and rocks very
exciting<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:03.000> wasn't<00:01:03.329> hard<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.570> accomplish

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
exciting so it wasn't hard to accomplish

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
exciting so it wasn't hard to accomplish
this<00:01:04.110> feat<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.799> only<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.250> big<00:01:05.549> black

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

very easy to render we've got big black

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.109 
very easy to render we've got big black
rectangle<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.500> big<00:01:22.680> red<00:01:22.890> dot<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.700> can

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
rectangle and a big red dot you can

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.820 
rectangle and a big red dot you can
