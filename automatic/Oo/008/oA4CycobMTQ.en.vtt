00:00:10.117 --> 00:00:15.033
Santa’s Christmas

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:17.867
By Lavina Tien

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:20.033
It was a beautiful

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:21.783
December day,

00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:23.283
with clear blue skies

00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:30.200
and snow-covered treetops.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.117
Christmas was in the air!

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:35.117
But up

00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:37.783
in Santa’s lodge,

00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:41.617
all was quiet.

00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:43.200
The usual hustle and bustle

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.867
of preparing Christmas presents

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:48.867
was gone,

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:50.367
for Santa had fallen ill.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:54.783
for Santa had fallen ill.

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:58.450
“Oh dear,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.117
what will the children say

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:01.700
when they don’t receive presents

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.367
this year?”

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:06.867
Santa

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.450
wondered sadly,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.033
as he lay on his bed.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.200
Suddenly, he heard a noise

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.783
from outside.

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:25.867
He looked out of the window

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:27.950
and saw his four reindeer

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.533
standing patiently as usual.

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.033
standing patiently as usual.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:34.117
But they seemed

00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:37.200
quite out of breath,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.283
as if they had just finished

00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:44.617
a long trip.

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:46.283
And as Santa took

00:01:46.283 --> 00:01:47.700
a closer look,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.117
he could not believe what he saw.

00:01:54.117 --> 00:01:55.700
For

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.533
behind the reindeer was

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:01.200
a long train of sleds,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.450
carrying little children

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.533
dressed in all sorts of colors.

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:11.700
One by one,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.867
they hopped out

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.533
onto the snow

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.617
and headed towards

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:20.283
Santa’s lodge.

00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:21.200
Soon

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.367
came a knock on the door.

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:26.700
“Come in!”

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.283
Santa called out,

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:34.283
for he was extremely curious.

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:36.367
In came a little girl,

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:38.033
hugging

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:42.117
something soft in her arms.

00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:44.033
“I heard that you were sick,

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:47.450
Mr. Santa,” she began.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.450
“So I’m giving you

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.617
my teddy bear,

00:02:50.617 --> 00:02:54.200
to keep you company.”

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.617
“Why, thank you little Emma!”

00:02:56.617 --> 00:02:58.200
said Santa,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.367
for he knew every child

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:06.450
by name.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.117
Then entered a young boy

00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:14.700
with a red package in his arms.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.617
“We knew that you were ill,

00:03:16.617 --> 00:03:18.617
Papa Santa,” he said.

00:03:18.617 --> 00:03:20.117
“So my family

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:21.533
knitted this

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.033
quilt for you,

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:24.283
to keep you warm

00:03:24.283 --> 00:03:27.200
in the winter days.”

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.867
“Why,

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:29.783
what a wonderful thought

00:03:29.783 --> 00:03:30.950
Paul!”

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.867
beamed Santa,

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:36.617
patting him on the head.

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.200
And one by one

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.283
the children

00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:41.033
came in through

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:42.450
Santa’s door,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.033
each with a special gift

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:46.367
to wish Santa

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:50.283
well.

00:03:50.283 --> 00:03:52.950
There were cookies,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.200
pies,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.617
socks, mittens,

00:03:57.617 --> 00:03:59.533
books,

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:01.617
jigsaw puzzles,

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:02.367
and even

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:06.367
a small Christmas tree!

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:10.033
“Christmas delivered to my doorstep!”

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.533
exclaimed Santa.

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:13.867
“Come; let us all share

00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:19.117
these wonderful gifts.”

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:21.200
And he gathered the children around him

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.700
in a big circle.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.117
“Santa, which present do you

00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:27.700
like best?”

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.783
Emma soon piped up.

00:04:31.783 --> 00:04:33.450
“My dear little ones,”

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.950
Santa replied,

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.950
smiling.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.617
“It is the love

00:04:38.617 --> 00:04:40.283
and kindness that each

00:04:40.283 --> 00:04:42.533
of you have shown to me today

00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:51.200
that is the best present of all.”

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.283
He looked fondly

00:04:52.283 --> 00:04:53.617
at all the eager faces

00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:56.200
at all the eager faces

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.117
around him.

00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:02.033
“This, my little ones,

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:08.033
is the true meaning of Christmas.”

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:09.533
And with that,

00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:11.117
Santa gave

00:05:11.117 --> 00:05:12.033
each of the children

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:13.783
a big, warm

00:05:13.783 --> 00:05:16.450
holiday hug.
