00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
rails are actually pretty much

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.139 
rails are actually pretty much
symmetrical<00:01:40.249> they're<00:01:40.340> not<00:01:40.429> identical<00:01:41.119> but

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
symmetrical they're not identical but

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.940 
symmetrical they're not identical but
they're<00:01:41.329> symmetrical<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.049> enough<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.799> can

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
they're symmetrical and enough so I can

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.099 
they're symmetrical and enough so I can
use<00:01:43.189> that<00:01:43.399> but<00:01:43.670> it's<00:01:44.450> very<00:01:44.630> similar<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:44.960> the

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
use that but it's very similar to the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.559 
use that but it's very similar to the
brine<00:01:45.409> clutch<00:01:45.619> elite<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.909> insides<00:01:47.359> are

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
brine clutch elite the insides are

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.809 
brine clutch elite the insides are
shaped<00:01:48.380> making<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.009> stronger<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.490> lighter

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
shaped making it stronger and lighter

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.160 
shaped making it stronger and lighter
and<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.210> actually<00:01:50.329> matches<00:01:50.719> the<00:01:50.749> outside

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
and it actually matches the outside

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.279 
and it actually matches the outside
really<00:01:51.920> really<00:01:52.340> an<00:01:52.490> elegant<00:01:52.969> head<00:01:53.179> and<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:54.140> the

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
really really an elegant head and in the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.779 
really really an elegant head and in the
Pioneer<00:01:54.829> and<00:01:54.859> this<00:01:55.159> thing<00:01:55.369> it's<00:01:55.549> just<00:01:55.700> going

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
Pioneer and this thing it's just going

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.669 
Pioneer and this thing it's just going
to<00:01:55.880> be<00:01:56.030> absolutely<00:01:56.869> amazing<00:01:57.049> it's<00:01:57.469> got<00:01:57.560> that

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
to be absolutely amazing it's got that

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.440 
to be absolutely amazing it's got that
really<00:01:57.920> great<00:01:58.159> channel<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:58.969> a<00:01:59.270> really

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
really great channel to it and a really

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.200 
really great channel to it and a really
really<00:01:59.600> deep<00:02:00.049> nice<00:02:00.439> pocket<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.639> mid<00:02:01.850> load<00:02:02.060> to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
really deep nice pocket that mid load to

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.489 
really deep nice pocket that mid load to
it<00:02:02.299> and<00:02:02.450> probably<00:02:02.600> my<00:02:02.840> favorite<00:02:03.289> thing<00:02:03.469> about

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:03.499 
it and probably my favorite thing about

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:05.469 
it and probably my favorite thing about
this<00:02:03.770> head<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.100> they<00:02:04.219> really<00:02:04.520> took<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:05.270> best

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
this head is they really took the best

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.899 
this head is they really took the best
components<00:02:05.810> from<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.229> Evo<00:02:06.590> 3<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.369> Evo<00:02:07.729> X

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
components from the Evo 3 and the Evo X

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.400 
components from the Evo 3 and the Evo X
which<00:02:08.119> are<00:02:08.210> two<00:02:08.450> very<00:02:08.750> popular<00:02:08.960> heads

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
which are two very popular heads

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.260 
which are two very popular heads
currently<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.039> kind<00:02:10.459> of<00:02:10.550> put<00:02:11.000> them<00:02:11.150> together

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
currently and kind of put them together

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.540 
currently and kind of put them together
in<00:02:11.660> one<00:02:11.720> head<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:12.830> can<00:02:13.100> see<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.370> head

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
in one head and I can see this head

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.250 
in one head and I can see this head
being<00:02:13.790> very<00:02:14.120> successful<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.990> lot<00:02:15.140> of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
being very successful and a lot of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.770 
being very successful and a lot of
people<00:02:15.470> really<00:02:15.740> really<00:02:15.860> loving<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
people really really loving it so the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.930 
people really really loving it so the
biggest<00:02:17.990> difference<00:02:18.280> besides<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.640> throat

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
biggest difference besides the throat

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.960 
biggest difference besides the throat
and<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.150> sim<00:02:20.330> technology<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:22.550> head<00:02:22.700> got

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
and the sim technology is the head got

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.390 
and the sim technology is the head got
it<00:02:23.210> was<00:02:23.540> shortened<00:02:23.960> in<00:02:24.650> many<00:02:24.890> ways<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.280> also

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
it was shortened in many ways and also

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.890 
it was shortened in many ways and also
widens<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.090> little<00:02:26.240> bit<00:02:26.330> more<00:02:26.480> stump

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
widens a little bit more stump

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.479 
widens a little bit more stump
like<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.140> Evo<00:02:27.319> X<00:02:27.439> you<00:02:27.560> guys<00:02:27.680> have<00:02:27.860> heard<00:02:28.280> me

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
like the Evo X you guys have heard me

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.069 
like the Evo X you guys have heard me
say<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:29.209> stuffiness<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> e<00:02:29.900> before

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
say that the stuffiness of the e before

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.259 
say that the stuffiness of the e before
makes<00:02:30.379> it<00:02:30.500> great<00:02:30.769> for<00:02:31.040> attack<00:02:31.400> attack<00:02:32.120> man

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
makes it great for attack attack man

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.030 
makes it great for attack attack man
with<00:02:32.420> min<00:02:32.569> low<00:02:32.750> pockets<00:02:33.200> because<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.890> gives

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
with min low pockets because it gives

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.979 
with min low pockets because it gives
you<00:02:34.189> a<00:02:34.220> really<00:02:34.760> wide<00:02:35.000> head<00:02:35.269> for<00:02:35.480> catching<00:02:35.840> and

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
you a really wide head for catching and

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.509 
you a really wide head for catching and
then<00:02:36.379> since<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.680> heads<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:36.920> bit<00:02:37.099> shorter

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
then since the heads a bit shorter

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.460 
then since the heads a bit shorter
there's<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.239> very<00:02:38.450> quick<00:02:38.720> release<00:02:39.019> in<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.319> and

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
there's a very quick release in it and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.020 
there's a very quick release in it and
then<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.980> other<00:02:40.189> really<00:02:40.519> awesome<00:02:40.579> part<00:02:41.000> about

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
then the other really awesome part about

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.970 
then the other really awesome part about
is<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.299> flare<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:42.140> can<00:02:42.260> really<00:02:42.530> generate<00:02:42.920> an

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
is the flare you can really generate an

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.220 
is the flare you can really generate an
amazing<00:02:43.459> pinch<00:02:43.700> point<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.840> stick<00:02:45.079> to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
amazing pinch point and the stick to

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.229 
amazing pinch point and the stick to
have<00:02:45.379> a<00:02:45.409> low<00:02:45.709> whip<00:02:45.980> stick<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:46.730> has<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:46.879> lot<00:02:47.150> of

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
have a low whip stick that has a lot of

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.479 
have a low whip stick that has a lot of
hold<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.750> probably<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.829> other<00:02:48.950> greatest

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
hold and probably the other greatest

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.770 
hold and probably the other greatest
feature<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.879> totally<00:02:50.090> forgot<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.480> I

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
feature that I totally forgot and I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.330 
feature that I totally forgot and I
should<00:02:50.959> have<00:02:51.079> I<00:02:51.230> pointed<00:02:51.620> out<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.069> amount

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
should have I pointed out is the amount

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.270 
should have I pointed out is the amount
of<00:02:52.400> sidewalls<00:02:52.939> are<00:02:53.090> on<00:02:53.239> here<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:54.079> on<00:02:54.290> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
of sidewalls are on here it's on the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.679 
of sidewalls are on here it's on the
level<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:55.700> clutch<00:02:55.909> and<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.299> has<00:02:56.390> really

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
level of the clutch and that has really

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.420 
level of the clutch and that has really
been<00:02:56.810> lacking<00:02:57.049> out<00:02:57.379> of<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.620> Eva<00:02:57.920> market<00:02:58.250> for<00:02:58.400> a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
been lacking out of the Eva market for a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.580 
been lacking out of the Eva market for a
very<00:02:58.489> long<00:02:58.790> time<00:02:59.030> because<00:02:59.810> they<00:03:00.079> are<00:03:00.109> very

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
very long time because they are very

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.280 
very long time because they are very
wide<00:03:00.980> kind<00:03:01.639> of<00:03:01.730> stumpy<00:03:02.150> big<00:03:02.389> heads<00:03:02.659> and<00:03:02.810> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
wide kind of stumpy big heads and the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.780 
wide kind of stumpy big heads and the
more<00:03:03.500> sidewall<00:03:03.920> options<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.519> have<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
more sidewall options you have the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.970 
more sidewall options you have the
better<00:03:05.150> for<00:03:05.389> that<00:03:05.450> shape<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.870> head<00:03:06.019> so<00:03:06.440> really

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
better for that shape of head so really

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.699 
better for that shape of head so really
love<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.329> just<00:03:08.599> I<00:03:08.840> think<00:03:09.349> it's<00:03:09.500> gonna<00:03:09.590> be

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
love it and I just I think it's gonna be

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.110 
love it and I just I think it's gonna be
amazing<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.099> I<00:03:10.190> just<00:03:10.459> can't<00:03:10.670> express<00:03:11.000> how

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
amazing and I just can't express how

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.479 
amazing and I just can't express how
much<00:03:11.659> I<00:03:12.049> like<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.470> Stumpf<00:03:12.739> enos<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.189> it<00:03:13.340> and

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
much I like the Stumpf enos of it and

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.250 
much I like the Stumpf enos of it and
then<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:13.939> overall<00:03:14.239> face<00:03:14.480> shape<00:03:14.720> when<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.019> first

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
then the overall face shape when I first

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.410 
then the overall face shape when I first
picked<00:03:15.439> it<00:03:15.590> up<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.829> did<00:03:16.010> seem<00:03:16.220> very<00:03:16.579> wide<00:03:16.879> but

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
picked it up it did seem very wide but

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.360 
picked it up it did seem very wide but
after<00:03:17.659> checking<00:03:17.689> out<00:03:18.049> an<00:03:18.260> Evo<00:03:18.500> X<00:03:18.650> they're<00:03:19.159> very

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
after checking out an Evo X they're very

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.460 
after checking out an Evo X they're very
similar<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:19.819> it<00:03:19.970> has<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.659> upgraded<00:03:21.079> features

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
similar but it has the upgraded features

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.750 
similar but it has the upgraded features
with<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.799> new<00:03:21.980> throat<00:03:22.310> it's<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.489> little<00:03:22.519> bit

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
with the new throat it's a little bit

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.970 
with the new throat it's a little bit
stiffer<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.150> believe<00:03:23.569> it's<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.780> new<00:03:23.900> plastic<00:03:24.379> the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
stiffer I believe it's a new plastic the

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.740 
stiffer I believe it's a new plastic the
new<00:03:25.099> SIM<00:03:25.310> rail<00:03:25.489> technology<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.299> more<00:03:26.450> holes

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
new SIM rail technology the more holes

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.750 
new SIM rail technology the more holes
and<00:03:27.079> just<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.349> better<00:03:27.530> scoop<00:03:27.950> from<00:03:28.099> the<00:03:28.189> Evo<00:03:28.519> 3

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
and just the better scoop from the Evo 3

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.699 
and just the better scoop from the Evo 3
pretty<00:03:28.939> much<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.150> identical<00:03:29.480> scoop<00:03:29.780> just

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
pretty much the identical scoop just

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.449 
pretty much the identical scoop just
absolutely<00:03:31.160> love<00:03:31.310> it

Pioneer and the Evo 4x awesome I'm
actually<00:03:42.620> thinking<00:03:42.919> about<00:03:43.159> putting<00:03:43.340> one

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
actually thinking about putting one

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.909 
actually thinking about putting one
together<00:03:43.639> for<00:03:43.940> myself<00:03:44.060> for<00:03:44.419> the<00:03:44.480> summer<00:03:44.919> just

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
together for myself for the summer just

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.259 
together for myself for the summer just
it<00:03:46.129> would<00:03:46.340> be<00:03:46.400> something<00:03:46.579> different<00:03:46.699> you<00:03:47.180> know

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
it would be something different you know

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.580 
it would be something different you know
I<00:03:47.299> always<00:03:47.480> go<00:03:47.690> for<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.930> more<00:03:48.109> pinched<00:03:48.440> head

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
I always go for a more pinched head

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.099 
I always go for a more pinched head
right<00:03:48.769> now<00:03:48.889> I'm<00:03:49.069> using<00:03:49.190> an<00:03:49.400> x6<00:03:49.849> and<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.930> might

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
right now I'm using an x6 and it might

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:51.699 
right now I'm using an x6 and it might
be<00:03:51.230> fun

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
be fun

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.860 
be fun
actually<00:03:52.250> next<00:03:52.400> 6<00:03:52.639> Evo<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.659> kind<00:03:53.810> of

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
actually next 6 Evo and this is kind of

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.180 
actually next 6 Evo and this is kind of
like<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.109> complete<00:03:54.440> opposite<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:54.949> that<00:03:55.099> in

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
like the complete opposite of that in

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.009 
like the complete opposite of that in
terms<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.519> face<00:03:55.699> shape<00:03:55.970> but<00:03:56.449> it<00:03:56.659> might<00:03:56.780> be<00:03:56.900> cool

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
terms of face shape but it might be cool

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.780 
terms of face shape but it might be cool
to<00:03:57.139> go<00:03:57.229> to<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.379> little<00:03:57.500> bit<00:03:57.650> bigger<00:03:57.799> head<00:03:58.069> it's

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
to go to a little bit bigger head it's

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.979 
to go to a little bit bigger head it's
always<00:03:58.909> fun<00:03:59.180> messing<00:03:59.510> around<00:03:59.599> with<00:03:59.780> them<00:03:59.870> and
