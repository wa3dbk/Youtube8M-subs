00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
all the manufacturing of the Sphero like

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.410 
all the manufacturing of the Sphero like
yeah<00:00:57.380> they<00:00:58.250> pretty<00:00:58.580> much<00:00:58.790> scrapped<00:00:59.270> that

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
yeah they pretty much scrapped that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.870 
yeah they pretty much scrapped that
whole<00:00:59.750> design<00:01:00.170> they've<00:01:00.890> got<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.100> clean<00:01:01.550> sheet

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
whole design they've got a clean sheet

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.459 
whole design they've got a clean sheet
design<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.480> this

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
design of this

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.999 
design of this
this<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.309> product<00:01:04.600> who<00:01:05.600> are<00:01:06.140> 11<00:01:06.530> Cuba<00:01:06.770> game

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.649 

got<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.340> solid<00:01:09.759> steel<00:01:09.969> solid<00:01:10.680> port<00:01:11.680> or<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:12.009> shaft

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.690 

six-speed<00:01:15.659> transmission<00:01:16.590> fuel<00:01:17.100> injection

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
six-speed transmission fuel injection

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.830 
six-speed transmission fuel injection
and<00:01:18.110> internal<00:01:19.110> wall<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:20.479> pretty<00:01:21.479> nice<00:01:21.600> action

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and internal wall for pretty nice action

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.840 
and internal wall for pretty nice action
woohoo<00:01:22.560> can't<00:01:22.979> wait<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.190> see<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> boy

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
woohoo can't wait to see the boy

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.540 
woohoo can't wait to see the boy
so<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.630> pushrod<00:01:25.020> engine<00:01:25.170> yes<00:01:26.010> push<00:01:26.310> rod

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
so it's a pushrod engine yes push rod

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.600 
so it's a pushrod engine yes push rod
with<00:01:26.940> regular<00:01:27.330> Springs<00:01:27.750> okay<00:01:28.470> hey<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.340> was

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
with regular Springs okay hey I was

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.370 
with regular Springs okay hey I was
bringing<00:01:29.790> good<00:01:30.030> he's<00:01:30.360> got<00:01:30.510> hydraulic<00:01:30.960> lifters

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
bringing good he's got hydraulic lifters

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.200 
bringing good he's got hydraulic lifters
in<00:01:31.410> here<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.890> got<00:01:31.979> roller<00:01:32.250> rockers<00:01:32.760> up<00:01:32.940> here

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
in here it's got roller rockers up here

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.170 
in here it's got roller rockers up here
it's<00:01:33.780> got<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> three<00:01:34.259> camshaft<00:01:34.860> design<00:01:35.369> middle

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it's got a three camshaft design middle

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.760 
it's got a three camshaft design middle
camshafts<00:01:36.660> your<00:01:36.840> intakes<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.410> once<00:01:37.619> your

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
camshafts your intakes out once your

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.240 
camshafts your intakes out once your
exhaust<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:39.240> got<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> chain<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:39.900> here

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
exhaust it's got a chain on here

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.040 
exhaust it's got a chain on here
so<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.119> could<00:01:42.300> probably<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> little

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
so I think we could probably do a little

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.380 
so I think we could probably do a little
bit<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.369> cam<00:01:44.369> indexing<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.270> more

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
bit of cam indexing a little more

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.730 
bit of cam indexing a little more
performance<00:01:45.690> out<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.289> we<00:01:46.410> need<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
performance out of this that we need to

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.410 
performance out of this that we need to
it's<00:01:47.280> got<00:01:47.369> plenty<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.729> power<00:01:47.910> it's<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.240> under

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it's got plenty of power it's got under

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.690 
it's got plenty of power it's got under
15<00:01:48.780> foot-pounds<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.289> torque<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.770> shook<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> up

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
15 foot-pounds of torque so shook it up

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:00.730 
15 foot-pounds of torque so shook it up
and<00:01:50.880> move<00:01:51.030> yeah<00:01:54.530> yeah<00:01:55.640> stuff

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.680 

when<00:02:01.670> he<00:02:01.729> walked<00:02:01.940> over<00:02:02.150> here<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.360> was<00:02:02.450> like<00:02:02.510> I

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
when he walked over here I was like I

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.760 
when he walked over here I was like I
know<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.900> but<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.290> don't<00:02:05.200> stand<00:02:06.200> right<00:02:06.440> next<00:02:06.590> to

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
know you but I don't stand right next to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.499 
know you but I don't stand right next to
