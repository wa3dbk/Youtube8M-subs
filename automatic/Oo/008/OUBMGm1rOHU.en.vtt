00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.560 
out and then these buttons are soft
enough<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.560> rubber<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:03.180> they<00:02:03.360> work

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
enough with the rubber that they work

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.230 
enough with the rubber that they work
well<00:02:04.009> along<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.369> button<00:02:05.700> across<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
well along with this button across the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.719 
well along with this button across the
top<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.500> that's<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:07.979> too<00:02:08.280> deep<00:02:08.520> so

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
top and then that's not too deep so

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.040 
top and then that's not too deep so
that's<00:02:08.879> easy<00:02:09.149> enough<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
that's easy enough to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.810 
that's easy enough to
adjust<00:02:10.620> their<00:02:11.360> just<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.450> great<00:02:12.660> case<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.260> also

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
adjust their just a great case it also

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.330 
adjust their just a great case it also

protection if you drop it still going to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.620 
protection if you drop it still going to
protect<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.170> screen<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:24.150> that's<00:02:24.300> really

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
protect that screen so that's really

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
nice and this rubber around the edge

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.820 
nice and this rubber around the edge

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
that's going to give you just a little

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.740 
that's going to give you just a little
bit<00:02:29.010> more<00:02:29.280> drop<00:02:29.580> protection<00:02:29.820> than<00:02:30.360> say<00:02:30.540> with

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
bit more drop protection than say with

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.580 
bit more drop protection than say with
the<00:02:30.930> incase<00:02:31.440> slider<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:32.730> material<00:02:32.940> also

holds<00:02:34.590> up<00:02:34.680> pretty<00:02:34.710> well<00:02:35.040> from<00:02:35.400> scratching

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
holds up pretty well from scratching

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.960 
holds up pretty well from scratching
this<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> gloss<00:02:36.660> material<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.650> gloss<00:02:38.250> plastic

this is a gloss material a gloss plastic

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.500 
this is a gloss material a gloss plastic
and<00:02:39.800> some<00:02:40.800> other<00:02:41.010> cases<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.670> example<00:02:41.700> speck

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
and some other cases for example speck

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.840 
and some other cases for example speck
kind<00:02:42.960> of<00:02:43.050> scratch<00:02:43.350> up<00:02:43.590> pretty<00:02:43.830> easily<00:02:44.040> this

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
kind of scratch up pretty easily this

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.520 
kind of scratch up pretty easily this
case<00:02:45.120> seems<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.570> do<00:02:45.690> better<00:02:45.870> than<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.290> speck

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
case seems to do better than the speck

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.460 
case seems to do better than the speck
candyshell<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.580> that's<00:02:47.790> something<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.470> you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
candyshell so that's something that you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.890 
candyshell so that's something that you
need<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.860> think<00:02:50.760> about<00:02:50.940> here<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.570> have<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> in

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
need to think about here you have the in

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.650
