00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 about this news 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.310
 is sleeping 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.069
 if not 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.849
 Euro on 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.759
 You can never do that 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.250
 Orbis 2001 appeared almost not enough 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 a mess 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.880
 that's so 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 on the map 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.050
 central are likely then the hardest 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.340
 take part 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 five injured students 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 you do it is z 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Pick 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.050
 here 8 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 the Swiss stood and then we did it 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 in it survived here 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.180
 there 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 made 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.730
 that's nice 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.870
 cover a day 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.870
 under contract 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.060
 we want 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.640
 I like that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 have fun at the next Kazim 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.520
 looks good on it 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.150
 the defenders will be the first wave of attack 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
 but more and more give burned life 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.899
 while among the many bad news foundation 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.209
 No help is expected from the yellow ones 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.759
 retired 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.199
 clearly he touched me 70 000 tons back 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.199
 around the enemy 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.509
 6 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.339
 marry 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.559
 Video so 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.809
 and the next mission 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.529
 I know everyone as an honor killing 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.249
 tickets 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:57.109
 That's what I found the Ties mission throughout the game that gave me that 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.719
 who have finished the most terrible and hardest 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.790
 because that's a big camp to advise a big barrel in it 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.509
 on the ground in Berlin one more place 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.049
 and there are three lines of attack Biedermann 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.699
 the two dealers are networks Yes one has equal rights for all 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.699
 Cologne 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:22.949
 that is normal 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.549
 us it is still somehow come from behind you 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.959
 wear these works 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.959
 because then all wore out mainly that you already worn 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:35.919
 Moscow 11 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.379
 are back again 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.119
 not just the office costs 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.919
 and have to give these weird other banks and their steps right now 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:51.309
 but Dirk I believe in any case no nonsense of us here 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.909
 that is already going on or 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.099
 but I play well 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.099
 I say goodbye to one of these jobs 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.379
 Jones said she will see you next time
