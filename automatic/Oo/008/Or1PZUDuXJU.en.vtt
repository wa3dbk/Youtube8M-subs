color<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:42.030> first<00:00:42.270> technique<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.020> would

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
color the first technique I would

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.430 
color the first technique I would
recommend<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> try<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.730> using<00:00:45.600> software<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
recommend you try is using software a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.020 
recommend you try is using software a
couple<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> software<00:00:47.309> programs<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.850> I'm

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
couple of software programs that I'm

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.979 
couple of software programs that I'm
familiar<00:00:48.270> with

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
familiar with

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.150 
familiar with
the<00:00:49.260> first<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.420> UD<00:00:51.420> pixel<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:53.010> other

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the first one is UD pixel and the other

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.939 
the first one is UD pixel and the other
one<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.000> J<00:00:54.809> screen<00:00:55.260> fix<00:00:55.620> you

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
one I really like is J screen fix you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.500 
one I really like is J screen fix you
can<00:00:56.100> visit<00:00:56.460> them<00:00:56.640> at<00:00:58.100> WWJ<00:00:59.100> screen<00:00:59.430> fix<00:00:59.730> comm

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
can visit them at WWJ screen fix comm

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.470 
can visit them at WWJ screen fix comm
now<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> other<00:01:01.500> two<00:01:01.829> techniques<00:01:02.520> could

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
now the other two techniques could

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.770 
now the other two techniques could
damage<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.680> LCD<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.519> possibly<00:01:06.150> cause<00:01:06.390> more

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
damage your LCD and possibly cause more

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.560 
damage your LCD and possibly cause more
stuck<00:01:07.260> pixels<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.400> thought<00:01:09.180> I'd<00:01:09.299> tell<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
stuck pixels so thought I'd tell you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.760 
stuck pixels so thought I'd tell you
that<00:01:09.799> before<00:01:10.799> telling<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.820> how<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:13.140> these

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that before telling you how to do these

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.679 
that before telling you how to do these
different<00:01:14.070> techniques<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.119> first<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
different techniques the first one is a

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.780 
different techniques the first one is a
pressure<00:01:16.110> technique<00:01:16.650> all<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.979> need<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> pen

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pressure technique all you need is a pen

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.929 
pressure technique all you need is a pen
or<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> pencil<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> sharp<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.549> though

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
or a pencil now with a sharp and though

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.289 
or a pencil now with a sharp and though
ideally<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.140> stylus<00:01:22.740> pen<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> tablet<00:01:23.970> pen

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
ideally a stylus pen or a tablet pen

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.690 
ideally a stylus pen or a tablet pen
would<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.540> perfect<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:26.220> damn<00:01:26.400> cloth

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
would be perfect and the damn cloth

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.460 
would be perfect and the damn cloth

should be on stock it isn't you can try
this<00:02:09.899> technique<00:02:10.349> again<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.520> other<00:02:11.670> one<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
this technique again the other one is a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.800 
this technique again the other one is a
tapping<00:02:12.599> technique

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
tapping technique

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.660 
tapping technique
for<00:02:14.350> this<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:15.340> can<00:02:15.520> use<00:02:16.020> this<00:02:17.020> end<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
for this you can use this end of a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.090 
for this you can use this end of a
sharpie<00:02:19.209> marker<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.810> perfect<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.950> can

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
sharpie marker is perfect and you can

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.670 
sharpie marker is perfect and you can
just<00:02:21.340> win<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.330> win<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> monitor<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:22.990> on<00:02:23.170> just

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
just win the win the monitor is on just

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.300 
just win the win the monitor is on just
tap<00:02:24.100> on<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.370> stock<00:02:25.300> pixel<00:02:25.870> repeatedly<00:02:26.830> again

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
tap on the stock pixel repeatedly again

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.280 
tap on the stock pixel repeatedly again
fairly<00:02:27.940> hard<00:02:28.209> but<00:02:28.480> not<00:02:28.660> hard<00:02:28.870> enough<00:02:29.110> to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
fairly hard but not hard enough to

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.440 
fairly hard but not hard enough to
damage<00:02:29.740> or<00:02:29.890> cause<00:02:30.069> any<00:02:30.340> more<00:02:30.760> stock<00:02:31.030> pixels

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
damage or cause any more stock pixels

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.100 
damage or cause any more stock pixels
and<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.890> might<00:02:33.370> possibly<00:02:33.700> work<00:02:34.150> hope<00:02:34.989> this

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
and that might possibly work hope this

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.840 
and that might possibly work hope this
