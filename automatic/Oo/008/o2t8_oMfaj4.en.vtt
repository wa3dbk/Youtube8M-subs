00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
some of the cons behind this spot is

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.039 
some of the cons behind this spot is

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
going to be there a lot if you're in a

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.280 
going to be there a lot if you're in a
high<00:01:27.579> populated<00:01:28.180> server<00:01:28.360> there's<00:01:28.780> probably

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
high populated server there's probably

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.530 
high populated server there's probably
going<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.650> be<00:01:29.770> people<00:01:30.220> there<00:01:30.250> check<00:01:31.060> anyways

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
going to be people there check anyways

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.870 
going to be people there check anyways

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
but if there are a lot of people there

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.940 
but if there are a lot of people there
then<00:01:34.329> what<00:01:34.869> you<00:01:34.990> might<00:01:35.170> have<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.470> do<00:01:35.619> is<00:01:35.920> a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
locations that I will locate for you on

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.850 
locations that I will locate for you on
the<00:03:17.180> map<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.840> know<00:03:18.080> exactly<00:03:18.230> where<00:03:18.710> to<00:03:18.740> go

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
the map so you know exactly where to go

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.100 
the map so you know exactly where to go
it's<00:03:19.430> not<00:03:19.550> very<00:03:19.610> tough<00:03:20.090> know<00:03:20.330> exactly<00:03:20.780> what<00:03:20.990> do

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
it's not very tough know exactly what do

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.580 
it's not very tough know exactly what do
you<00:03:21.200> do<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.710> this<00:03:22.220> situation<00:03:22.480> now<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.540> can<00:03:23.990> tag

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
you do in this situation now you can tag

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.410 
you do in this situation now you can tag
the<00:03:24.830> mobs<00:03:25.070> but<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.580> really<00:03:25.880> tough<00:03:26.090> because

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
the mobs but it's really tough because

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.420 
the mobs but it's really tough because
there's<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:26.840> many<00:03:27.110> mobs<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.010> be<00:03:28.100> you'd

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
there's so many mobs and it be you'd

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.120 
there's so many mobs and it be you'd
probably<00:03:28.700> die<00:03:29.120> very<00:03:29.600> often<00:03:30.140> if<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.680> did<00:03:31.100> that

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130
