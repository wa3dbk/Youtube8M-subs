00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
is like what the purest form a protein

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.850 
is like what the purest form a protein
that<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.650> can<00:03:11.770> get<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:14.200> this<00:03:14.320> case<00:03:14.530> they

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
that you can get but in this case they

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.680 
that you can get but in this case they
started<00:03:15.220> out<00:03:15.310> with<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.520> concentrate<00:03:16.090> which<00:03:16.570> is

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
started out with a concentrate which is

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.800 
started out with a concentrate which is
not<00:03:16.840> bad<00:03:17.520> right<00:03:18.520> on<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> back<00:03:19.000> though<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.420> says

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
not bad right on the back though it says

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.460 
not bad right on the back though it says
uh<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:21.400> has<00:03:21.459> 25<00:03:22.000> digestive<00:03:22.570> enzymes<00:03:23.080> in<00:03:23.350> it

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
uh it has 25 digestive enzymes in it

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.840 
uh it has 25 digestive enzymes in it
some<00:03:23.800> bcas<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.790> it's<00:03:24.880> aspartame<00:03:25.360> free<00:03:25.709> by

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
some bcas and it's aspartame free by

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.640 
some bcas and it's aspartame free by
bioavailable<00:03:27.850> multiplan<00:03:28.450> protein<00:03:29.050> so

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
bioavailable multiplan protein so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.110 
bioavailable multiplan protein so
basically<00:03:29.950> it's<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.160> protein<00:03:30.489> bin<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:30.880> think

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
basically it's a protein bin and I think

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.630 
basically it's a protein bin and I think
that<00:03:31.239> they<00:03:31.330> um<00:03:32.070> make<00:03:33.070> this<00:03:33.190> protein<00:03:33.550> in

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
that they um make this protein in

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.610 
that they um make this protein in
comparison<00:03:34.180> with<00:03:34.209> synthesis<00:03:35.080> convey<00:03:35.380> along

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
comparison with synthesis convey along

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.530 
comparison with synthesis convey along
the<00:03:35.770> same<00:03:36.040> lines<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:36.820> if<00:03:36.910> you're<00:03:37.030> set<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.270> six

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
the same lines so if you're set to six

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.910 
the same lines so if you're set to six
fan<00:03:37.750> you'll<00:03:37.930> probably<00:03:38.140> like<00:03:38.350> this<00:03:38.530> protein

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
fan you'll probably like this protein

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.570 
fan you'll probably like this protein
okay<00:03:39.520> now<00:03:39.940> as<00:03:40.150> far<00:03:40.390> as<00:03:40.450> I'm<00:03:40.780> just<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:42.360> recovery

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
okay now as far as I'm just a recovery

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.440 
okay now as far as I'm just a recovery
taking<00:03:45.580> this<00:03:45.640> protein<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.090> was<00:03:46.209> able<00:03:46.300> to

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
taking this protein I was able to

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.199 
taking this protein I was able to
recover<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:47.140> little<00:03:47.350> bit<00:03:47.820> i<00:03:48.820> want<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.120> say

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
recover a little bit i want to say

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.280 
recover a little bit i want to say
better<00:03:49.420> than<00:03:49.570> any<00:03:49.660> other<00:03:49.840> protein<00:03:50.020> that<00:03:50.230> I

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
better than any other protein that I

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.050 
better than any other protein that I
bhavish<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:50.860> I've<00:03:50.980> actually<00:03:51.190> taken<00:03:51.489> but<00:03:51.880> a

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
bhavish that I've actually taken but a

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.640 
bhavish that I've actually taken but a
little<00:03:52.720> bit<00:03:52.810> better<00:03:52.959> than<00:03:53.140> some<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.530> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
little bit better than some of the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.920 
little bit better than some of the
proteins<00:03:54.310> I've<00:03:54.489> sampled<00:03:54.790> in<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.150> past<00:03:55.390> I'm

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
proteins I've sampled in the past I'm

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.000 
proteins I've sampled in the past I'm
not<00:03:56.020> gonna<00:03:56.170> say<00:03:56.350> any<00:03:56.470> names<00:03:56.500> cuz<00:03:56.830> I<00:03:56.860> don't<00:03:56.920> like

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
not gonna say any names cuz I don't like

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.740 
not gonna say any names cuz I don't like
to<00:03:57.100> downgrade<00:03:57.370> too<00:03:57.820> many<00:03:58.030> proteins<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.660> too

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
to downgrade too many proteins and too

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.040 
to downgrade too many proteins and too
many<00:03:58.840> supplements<00:03:59.640> but<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:01.570> recovery<00:04:01.989> on

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
many supplements but the recovery on

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.740 
many supplements but the recovery on
this<00:04:02.200> was<00:04:02.350> pretty<00:04:02.560> decent<00:04:02.769> I<00:04:03.190> liked<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.820> I<00:04:04.030> felt

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
this was pretty decent I liked it I felt

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.840 
this was pretty decent I liked it I felt
normal<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.260> mean<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:05.590> was<00:04:05.800> going<00:04:06.100> I<00:04:06.250> would<00:04:06.430> do<00:04:06.580> and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
normal I mean I was going I would do and

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.940 
normal I mean I was going I would do and
this<00:04:07.180> is<00:04:07.239> just<00:04:07.390> being<00:04:07.600> honest<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:08.019> normally<00:04:08.800> do

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
this is just being honest I normally do

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.520 
this is just being honest I normally do
about<00:04:09.160> its<00:04:10.060> finna<00:04:10.239> sound<00:04:10.480> weird<00:04:10.750> man<00:04:10.990> but<00:04:11.290> I

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
about its finna sound weird man but I

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.350 
about its finna sound weird man but I
know<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.250> from<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.460> say<00:04:12.580> oh<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.180> guy

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
know you from to say oh this guy

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.410 
know you from to say oh this guy
but<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.930> do<00:04:14.460> about

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
but I do about

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.930 
but I do about
30<00:04:17.260> sets<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.920> chest<00:04:18.220> man<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.640> I'm<00:04:18.700> not<00:04:18.820> gonna

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
30 sets the chest man and I'm not gonna

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.970 
30 sets the chest man and I'm not gonna
even<00:04:19.030> lock<00:04:19.270> but<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:19.960> break<00:04:20.140> it<00:04:20.260> up<00:04:20.350> into<00:04:20.500> two<00:04:20.620> of

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
even lock but I break it up into two of

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.620 
even lock but I break it up into two of
two<00:04:21.430> sessions<00:04:21.670> so<00:04:21.910> I<00:04:21.940> was<00:04:22.090> going<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.360> morning

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
two sessions so I was going to morning

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.450 
two sessions so I was going to morning
time<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:22.930> hit<00:04:23.020> 15<00:04:23.380> sets<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.740> chest<00:04:23.980> they're

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
time and hit 15 sets of chest they're

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.680 
time and hit 15 sets of chest they're
not<00:04:24.550> going<00:04:24.790> to<00:04:24.850> even<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.150> time<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.540> sometimes

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
not going to even the time and sometimes

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.410 
not going to even the time and sometimes
and<00:04:26.260> even<00:04:26.680> 08<00:04:26.980> to<00:04:27.070> do<00:04:27.160> between<00:04:27.340> 15<00:04:27.880> or<00:04:28.030> maybe<00:04:28.180> 10

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
and even 08 to do between 15 or maybe 10

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.940 
and even 08 to do between 15 or maybe 10
sets<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.750> chest<00:04:28.960> just<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.410> go<00:04:29.530> back<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.770> touch

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
sets the chest just to go back to touch

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.800 
sets the chest just to go back to touch
it<00:04:29.980> up<00:04:30.190> but<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.610> only<00:04:30.760> do<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.030> once<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.390> week<00:04:31.570> so

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
it up but I only do that once a week so

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.070 
it up but I only do that once a week so
that<00:04:32.080> would<00:04:32.410> be<00:04:32.440> Monday<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:33.160> would<00:04:34.000> do<00:04:34.150> chest<00:04:34.810> I

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
that would be Monday I would do chest I

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.020 
that would be Monday I would do chest I
probably<00:04:35.980> won't<00:04:36.160> touch<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.580> on<00:04:36.700> monday<00:04:36.790> but

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
probably won't touch it up on monday but

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.520 
probably won't touch it up on monday but
they're<00:04:37.150> not<00:04:37.240> come<00:04:37.480> back<00:04:37.630> on<00:04:37.690> Friday<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.470> do

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
they're not come back on Friday and I do

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.990 
they're not come back on Friday and I do
chest<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:38.980> touch<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.160> up<00:04:39.340> twice<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:39.820> that

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
chest and touch it up twice so that

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.490 
chest and touch it up twice so that
means<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.300> do<00:04:40.360> chest<00:04:40.720> almost<00:04:40.900> three<00:04:41.170> times<00:04:41.290> a

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
means I do chest almost three times a

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.710 
means I do chest almost three times a
week<00:04:41.530> if<00:04:41.800> that<00:04:42.190> makes<00:04:42.370> sense<00:04:42.550> um<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.450> the

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
week if that makes sense um and the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.420 
week if that makes sense um and the
recovery<00:04:43.990> on<00:04:44.230> that<00:04:44.260> was<00:04:44.770> great<00:04:44.980> and<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.190> do<00:04:45.250> that

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
recovery on that was great and I do that

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.640 
recovery on that was great and I do that

i<00:06:34.780> would<00:06:35.110> say<00:06:35.200> the<00:06:35.260> nutritional<00:06:35.800> value<00:06:36.130> is

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
i would say the nutritional value is

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.010 
i would say the nutritional value is
decent<00:06:37.060> it's<00:06:37.150> only<00:06:37.300> a<00:06:37.330> hundred<00:06:37.450> 90<00:06:37.720> calories

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
decent it's only a hundred 90 calories

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.080 
decent it's only a hundred 90 calories
per<00:06:38.169> service<00:06:38.530> so<00:06:38.620> that's<00:06:38.770> not<00:06:38.919> bad<00:06:39.130> syntha-6<00:06:39.760> I

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
per service so that's not bad syntha-6 I

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.600 
per service so that's not bad syntha-6 I
think<00:06:40.240> it's<00:06:40.360> like<00:06:40.450> 220<00:06:40.990> um<00:06:41.280> so<00:06:42.280> it's<00:06:42.430> not<00:06:42.550> that

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
think it's like 220 um so it's not that

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.250 
think it's like 220 um so it's not that
bad<00:06:42.910> in<00:06:43.090> that<00:06:43.120> aspect<00:06:43.740> sodium<00:06:45.930> 135<00:06:46.930> milligrams

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
bad in that aspect sodium 135 milligrams

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.480 
bad in that aspect sodium 135 milligrams
not<00:06:47.440> bad<00:06:47.650> cholesterol<00:06:47.860> fifty<00:06:48.340> five

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
not bad cholesterol fifty five

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.400 
not bad cholesterol fifty five
milligrams<00:06:48.730> no<00:06:49.480> I<00:06:49.510> think<00:06:49.750> the<00:06:49.990> only<00:06:50.020> downfall

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
milligrams no I think the only downfall

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.010 
milligrams no I think the only downfall
told<00:06:50.860> us<00:06:50.950> that<00:06:51.040> it's<00:06:51.190> not<00:06:51.310> a<00:06:51.750> isolate<00:06:52.750> off<00:06:52.870> the

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
told us that it's not a isolate off the

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
to give you on that other one mr to

to give you on that other one mr to
those<00:07:09.310> but<00:07:09.700> yeah<00:07:09.760> that's<00:07:09.910> all<00:07:10.090> I<00:07:10.120> got<00:07:10.330> to<00:07:10.450> say

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
those but yeah that's all I got to say

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.090 
those but yeah that's all I got to say
about<00:07:10.630> this<00:07:10.900> protein<00:07:11.290> minutes<00:07:11.620> I<00:07:11.770> think<00:07:11.800> it's

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
about this protein minutes I think it's

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.350 
about this protein minutes I think it's
just<00:07:12.130> like<00:07:12.280> any<00:07:12.490> other<00:07:12.550> protein<00:07:12.880> that<00:07:13.180> we've

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 
just like any other protein that we've

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.420 
just like any other protein that we've
all<00:07:13.510> taken<00:07:13.750> before<00:07:13.990> no<00:07:14.770> I<00:07:14.800> mean<00:07:15.010> if<00:07:15.130> you<00:07:15.220> wanted

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
all taken before no I mean if you wanted

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.710 
all taken before no I mean if you wanted
to<00:07:15.520> compare<00:07:15.850> it<00:07:15.910> to<00:07:15.970> something<00:07:16.210> else<00:07:16.419> I<00:07:16.570> would

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 
to compare it to something else I would

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.200 
to compare it to something else I would
say<00:07:16.870> go<00:07:17.350> get<00:07:17.530> your<00:07:17.680> container<00:07:18.400> syntha-6<00:07:18.760> and

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
say go get your container syntha-6 and

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.450 
say go get your container syntha-6 and
put<00:07:19.330> this<00:07:19.450> side<00:07:19.690> by<00:07:19.840> side<00:07:20.080> gets<00:07:20.350> the<00:07:20.440> same<00:07:20.650> um

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
put this side by side gets the same um

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.370 
put this side by side gets the same um
the<00:07:22.060> only<00:07:22.270> thing<00:07:22.450> that<00:07:22.630> makes<00:07:22.840> this<00:07:22.930> protein

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
the only thing that makes this protein

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.719 
the only thing that makes this protein
stand<00:07:23.680> out<00:07:23.860> a<00:07:23.890> little<00:07:24.040> bit<00:07:24.190> better<00:07:24.340> than<00:07:24.520> those

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:24.729 
stand out a little bit better than those

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:27.300 
stand out a little bit better than those
is<00:07:25.720> the<00:07:25.930> fact<00:07:26.140> that<00:07:26.200> you<00:07:26.410> get<00:07:26.560> three<00:07:26.770> pounds<00:07:27.220> of

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
is the fact that you get three pounds of

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.540 
is the fact that you get three pounds of
protein<00:07:27.700> for<00:07:28.380> the<00:07:29.380> same<00:07:29.650> price<00:07:29.860> that<00:07:29.950> you<00:07:30.310> pay

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
protein for the same price that you pay

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.770 
protein for the same price that you pay
for<00:07:30.760> like<00:07:30.850> some<00:07:31.000> gold<00:07:31.210> standard<00:07:31.570> or<00:07:31.660> whatnot

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.780 
for like some gold standard or whatnot

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.870 
for like some gold standard or whatnot
and<00:07:32.110> speaking<00:07:33.040> of<00:07:33.100> gold<00:07:33.280> standard<00:07:33.640> I<00:07:33.700> just

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880 
and speaking of gold standard I just

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.540 
and speaking of gold standard I just
bought<00:07:34.000> a<00:07:34.030> big<00:07:34.390> five<00:07:34.930> pound<00:07:35.229> tub<00:07:35.500> yesterday<00:07:36.310> so

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.550 
bought a big five pound tub yesterday so
