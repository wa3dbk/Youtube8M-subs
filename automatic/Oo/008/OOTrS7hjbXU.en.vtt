to<00:00:08.250> start<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.760> off<00:00:08.880> than<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> Bandai

6-inch<00:00:10.849> Godzilla<00:00:11.849> 1954

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
6-inch Godzilla 1954

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.359 
6-inch Godzilla 1954
alright<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.080> overall<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.590> think<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
alright so overall I think this is a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.359 
alright so overall I think this is a
pretty<00:00:17.640> good<00:00:17.880> figure<00:00:18.350> um<00:00:19.850> it's<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.240> guess<00:00:22.369> it

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
pretty good figure um it's I guess it

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.720 
pretty good figure um it's I guess it
it's<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.119> black<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.539> white<00:00:24.750> unlike<00:00:25.730> basically

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
it's in black and white unlike basically

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.650 
it's in black and white unlike basically
all<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.840> other<00:00:28.080> Godzilla<00:00:28.769> figures

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
all of the other Godzilla figures

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.089 
all of the other Godzilla figures
obviously<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.170> movie<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.920> black

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
obviously because the movie was in black

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.580 
obviously because the movie was in black
and<00:00:32.279> white<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.360> that's<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.780> nice<00:00:33.960> touch

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and white so I think that's a nice touch

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.819 
and white so I think that's a nice touch
like<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> Bandai<00:00:35.550> creations<00:00:36.290> 54<00:00:37.290> Godzilla

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
like the Bandai creations 54 Godzilla

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.560 
like the Bandai creations 54 Godzilla
which<00:00:38.129> had<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.579> red<00:00:38.820> tongue<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.270> stuff

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
which had you know red tongue and stuff

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.740 
which had you know red tongue and stuff
I<00:00:39.870> don't<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.969> saw<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:42.300> collection

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
I don't have it if you saw my collection

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.880 
I don't have it if you saw my collection
video<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.320> I've<00:00:44.160> seen<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.940> around<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.890> yeah

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
video but I've seen it around and yeah

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
video but I've seen it around and yeah
it<00:00:46.980> has<00:00:47.129> colors<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.789> stuff<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.600> this

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it has colors and stuff I just like this

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.029 
it has colors and stuff I just like this
better<00:00:49.039> because<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.370> only<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.829> black

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
better because not only is it in black

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.160 
better because not only is it in black
and<00:00:53.250> white<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.629> movie<00:00:54.989> accurate

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and white but it is more movie accurate

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
and white but it is more movie accurate
just<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.770> far<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.100> everything<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.739> look

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
just as far as everything so if you look

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.709 
just as far as everything so if you look
you<00:00:59.340> know<00:00:59.370> look<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.879> picture<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> Bandai

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
with let's start with the detail you

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.999 
with let's start with the detail you
look<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.810> scales<00:01:16.700> they're<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:17.990> pretty

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
look in and scales they're very pretty

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.940 
look in and scales they're very pretty
typical<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.610> Godzilla<00:01:21.979> scale<00:01:22.979> things<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.950> one

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
typical on Godzilla scale things and one

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.740 
typical on Godzilla scale things and one
really<00:01:26.130> real<00:01:26.700> thing<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:29.299> tells<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.540> this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
really real thing that tells you this

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
really real thing that tells you this
isn't<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.590> great<00:01:31.950> plastic<00:01:32.340> it's

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
isn't just you know great plastic it's

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.270 
isn't just you know great plastic it's
all<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.540> white<00:01:34.140> highlights<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:34.950> see

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
all these white highlights you can see

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.420 
all these white highlights you can see
here<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.720> his<00:01:36.900> knees<00:01:37.110> they're<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
here and see on his knees they're a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.870 
here and see on his knees they're a
little<00:01:39.119> bit<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.479> his<00:01:39.659> chest

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
little bit on his chest

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.319 
little bit on his chest
so<00:01:41.880> those<00:01:42.060> make<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.540> look<00:01:42.750> very<00:01:43.290> realistic<00:01:44.329> or

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
so those make it look very realistic or

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.020 
so those make it look very realistic or
at<00:01:45.899> least<00:01:46.110> close<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> movie<00:01:47.130> makes<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
at least close to the movie makes it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330 
at least close to the movie makes it
more<00:01:48.540> more<00:01:49.020> than<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.530> gray<00:01:49.740> plastic<00:01:50.250> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
more more than just gray plastic it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.039 
more more than just gray plastic it
makes<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.610> looks<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.149> look<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.930> in

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
makes it looks like it look like it's in

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
makes it looks like it look like it's in
a<00:01:52.140> black-and-white<00:01:52.350> film<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.820> love

to articulation now has articulation the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.309 
to articulation now has articulation the
legs

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
legs

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.680 
legs
they'll<00:02:09.319> go<00:02:09.500> 360<00:02:10.429> but<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.180> have<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.480> get<00:02:11.569> his

figures arms don't go in and out they go
up<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.880> down<00:02:36.160> which<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.340> something<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.269> not

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
up and down which is something that not

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.280 
up and down which is something that not
many<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.900> my<00:02:39.260> figures<00:02:39.620> do<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.180> this<00:02:41.780> figure<00:02:42.019> is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
many of my figures do so this figure is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.360 
many of my figures do so this figure is
unique<00:02:42.590> in<00:02:42.739> that<00:02:42.769> regard<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:45.290> has<00:02:45.590> no

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
unique in that regard it has no

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.150 
unique in that regard it has no
articulation<00:02:46.940> in<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.840> head<00:02:48.049> and<00:02:48.500> no

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
articulation in the head and no

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.039 
articulation in the head and no
articulation<00:02:49.850> in<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.060> tail<00:02:52.690> there<00:02:53.690> may<00:02:53.870> be<00:02:53.900> a

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
articulation in the tail there may be a

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.070 
articulation in the tail there may be a
glue<00:02:54.290> seal<00:02:54.560> there<00:02:54.799> I<00:02:55.390> don't<00:02:56.390> really<00:02:56.599> see<00:02:56.870> need

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
glue seal there I don't really see need

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.940 
glue seal there I don't really see need
for<00:02:57.319> articulation<00:02:57.830> in<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.130> tail<00:02:59.769> so<00:03:01.540> yep

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
for articulation in the tail so yep

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.800 
for articulation in the tail so yep
let's<00:03:04.060> his<00:03:05.060> feet<00:03:05.799> just<00:03:06.799> like<00:03:07.480> lots<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.630> how<00:03:08.750> the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
let's his feet just like lots of how the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.180 
let's his feet just like lots of how the
gunz's<00:03:09.230> has<00:03:09.620> has<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.340> inner<00:03:10.580> toe<00:03:11.570> thing<00:03:12.230> like

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
gunz's has has the inner toe thing like

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.550 
gunz's has has the inner toe thing like
it<00:03:13.370> should<00:03:15.820> um<00:03:17.019> overall<00:03:18.019> this<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.530> pretty

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
it should um overall this is a pretty

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.539 
it should um overall this is a pretty
good<00:03:19.010> figure<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.640> would<00:03:19.790> do<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.120> size<00:03:20.570> comparison

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
good figure I would do a size comparison

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.210 
good figure I would do a size comparison
but<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:23.780> know<00:03:23.900> there<00:03:24.230> really<00:03:24.260> wasn't<00:03:24.769> another

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
but you know there really wasn't another

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.130 
but you know there really wasn't another
monster<00:03:25.519> in<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.030> 54<00:03:26.569> movie<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:29.060> there<00:03:29.959> isn't

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
monster in the 54 movie so there isn't

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.690 
monster in the 54 movie so there isn't
much<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.590> compare<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.069> we<00:03:31.340> know<00:03:31.459> that<00:03:31.609> it

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
much to compare it to we know that it

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.449 
much to compare it to we know that it
was<00:03:31.819> 50<00:03:32.150> meters<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:33.769> doesn't<00:03:34.130> really<00:03:34.280> help

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
was 50 meters that doesn't really help

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.400 
was 50 meters that doesn't really help
us<00:03:34.640> much<00:03:34.880> in<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.209> review<00:03:35.630> because<00:03:35.959> it's<00:03:36.230> only

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
us much in this review because it's only

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.379 
us much in this review because it's only
six<00:03:36.739> inches<00:03:37.010> so<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:40.040> about<00:03:40.280> 200<00:03:40.609> more<00:03:41.209> thing

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
six inches so that about 200 more thing

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.410 
six inches so that about 200 more thing
I<00:03:41.480> forgot<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.780> mention<00:03:42.609> there's<00:03:43.609> that<00:03:44.000> little

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
I forgot to mention there's that little

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.360 
I forgot to mention there's that little
wrinkle<00:03:45.019> right<00:03:45.410> there<00:03:47.290> I'm<00:03:48.290> not<00:03:48.530> sure<00:03:48.859> what

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
wrinkle right there I'm not sure what

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.160 
wrinkle right there I'm not sure what
that<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.579> that's<00:03:50.000> supposed<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.540> be<00:03:50.630> like<00:03:50.930> part

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
that is that's supposed to be like part

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.210 
that is that's supposed to be like part
of<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.319> soup

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.550 

or<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.330> it<00:03:56.360> actually<00:03:56.840> supposed<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.440> be

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
or is it actually supposed to be

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.710 
or is it actually supposed to be
Godzilla<00:03:58.130> if<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.850> is<00:03:58.970> part<00:03:59.210> of<00:03:59.240> the<00:03:59.360> zoo<00:03:59.540> then

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
Godzilla if it is part of the zoo then

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.640 
Godzilla if it is part of the zoo then
this<00:03:59.870> is<00:04:00.050> very<00:04:00.350> movie<00:04:00.800> accurate<00:04:01.270> but<00:04:02.350> I'm<00:04:03.350> not

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
this is very movie accurate but I'm not

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.430 
this is very movie accurate but I'm not
sure<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:03.980> kind<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.340> gets<00:04:04.910> in<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.210> way

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
sure it kind of gets in the way

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.290 
sure it kind of gets in the way
sometimes<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:08.680> don't<00:04:09.680> know<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:10.790> doesn't<00:04:11.180> really

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
sometimes I don't know it doesn't really

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.960 
sometimes I don't know it doesn't really
bother<00:04:11.510> me<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:11.960> much<00:04:12.170> that<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.460> makes<00:04:13.760> me

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
bother me that much that it makes me

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.790 
bother me that much that it makes me
curious<00:04:14.210> were<00:04:14.780> they<00:04:14.930> basing<00:04:15.290> this<00:04:15.410> off<00:04:15.620> of<00:04:15.740> a

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
curious were they basing this off of a

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.050 
curious were they basing this off of a
costume<00:04:16.310> or<00:04:17.709> what<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.799> was<00:04:18.890> actually<00:04:19.310> sort<00:04:19.549> of

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
costume or what it was actually sort of

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.960 
costume or what it was actually sort of
looked<00:04:20.330> like<00:04:20.450> if<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.840> were<00:04:20.989> real<00:04:24.610> yeah<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:25.640> had<00:04:25.940> a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
looked like if it were real yeah I had a

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.490 
looked like if it were real yeah I had a
lot<00:04:26.210> more<00:04:26.420> to<00:04:26.540> say<00:04:26.720> when<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:26.960> started<00:04:27.080> to

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
lot more to say when I started to

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.830 
lot more to say when I started to
conclude<00:04:27.950> huh<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:29.360> spines<00:04:30.940> pretty<00:04:31.940> good<00:04:32.180> have

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
conclude huh the spines pretty good have

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.280 
conclude huh the spines pretty good have
a<00:04:32.870> bit<00:04:33.140> of<00:04:33.170> an<00:04:33.350> upward<00:04:33.860> angle<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:37.960> need<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.080> check

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
a bit of an upward angle I need to check

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.620 
a bit of an upward angle I need to check
if<00:04:39.440> that's<00:04:39.560> movie<00:04:39.980> accurate<00:04:40.460> but<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:41.360> looks

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
if that's movie accurate but it looks

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:49.180 
if that's movie accurate but it looks
good<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:46.510> this<00:04:47.510> one<00:04:47.720> here<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.080> a<00:04:48.350> little

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
good and this one here is a little

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.250 
good and this one here is a little
crooked<00:04:49.610> right<00:04:49.970> here<00:04:50.300> but<00:04:50.600> doesn't<00:04:51.020> really

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
crooked right here but doesn't really

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:58.150 
crooked right here but doesn't really
matter<00:04:53.230> so<00:04:54.850> um<00:04:56.020> I<00:04:57.020> think<00:04:57.200> I<00:04:57.620> would<00:04:57.770> give<00:04:57.950> this<00:04:58.100> a

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
matter so um I think I would give this a

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.070 
matter so um I think I would give this a
4<00:04:58.550> out<00:04:58.580> of<00:04:58.970> 5<00:05:00.130> it's<00:05:01.130> good<00:05:01.550> really<00:05:02.180> it's<00:05:02.630> just

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
4 out of 5 it's good really it's just

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.700 
4 out of 5 it's good really it's just
nothing<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.070> exceptional<00:05:04.820> only<00:05:05.300> has<00:05:05.710> four

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
nothing to exceptional only has four

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.020 
nothing to exceptional only has four
points<00:05:06.950> of<00:05:07.160> articulation<00:05:09.340> I'd<00:05:10.340> say<00:05:10.640> around<00:05:10.790> a

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
points of articulation I'd say around a

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.640 
points of articulation I'd say around a
four<00:05:11.240> or<00:05:11.270> four<00:05:11.600> point<00:05:11.840> five<00:05:13.300> but<00:05:14.300> overall<00:05:14.690> it's

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
four or four point five but overall it's

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.200 
four or four point five but overall it's
very<00:05:16.070> movie<00:05:16.550> accurate<00:05:17.770> um<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.520> detail<00:05:19.970> is

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
very movie accurate um the detail is

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.810 
very movie accurate um the detail is
great<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:22.669> just<00:05:22.700> looks<00:05:23.120> awesome

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.190 

so<00:05:28.820> that'll<00:05:29.330> about<00:05:29.390> do<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.660> for<00:05:29.810> this<00:05:29.990> review

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
so that'll about do it for this review
