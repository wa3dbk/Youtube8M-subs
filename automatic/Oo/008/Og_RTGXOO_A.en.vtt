00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
inside turn and there's a number of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.299 
inside turn and there's a number of
variations<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.899> i<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
variations that i can do here one of the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.830 
variations that i can do here one of the
simpler<00:00:44.910> variations<00:00:45.420> would<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
simpler variations would be the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.240 
simpler variations would be the
following<00:00:46.050> move<00:00:46.469> two<00:00:47.280> three<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.770> six<00:00:49.770> it's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
following move two three and six it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.150 
following move two three and six it's
very<00:00:50.370> nice<00:00:50.610> let's<00:00:51.059> try<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.270> again<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> i<00:00:53.010> got

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
very nice let's try that again so i got

turn we want to make sure that we have

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.770 
turn we want to make sure that we have
we<00:01:17.100> understand<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.759> basic<00:01:18.270> turn<00:01:18.540> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
we understand that this basic turn is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
we understand that this basic turn is
our<00:01:19.670> shadow<00:01:20.670> position<00:01:21.530> right<00:01:22.530> arm<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.070> right

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
our shadow position right arm to right

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.030 
our shadow position right arm to right
arm<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.080> over<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> top<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.009> half

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
arm and over the top one and a half

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.070 
arm and over the top one and a half
that's<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.780> where<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that's what this is and that's where the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.600 
that's what this is and that's where the
big<00:01:28.110> lead<00:01:28.470> comes<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.100> your<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.430> hand

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
big lead comes in and so your right hand

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.880 
big lead comes in and so your right hand
is<00:01:29.729> really<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> leader<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> addition

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
is really the leader with the addition

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.620 
is really the leader with the addition
of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> left<00:01:32.369> hand<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.060> should<00:01:33.390> come<00:01:33.540> out

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
of the left hand it should come out

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.929 
of the left hand it should come out
actually<00:01:34.049> easier<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.680> pull<00:01:35.070> her<00:01:35.159> into<00:01:35.310> again

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
actually easier to pull her into again

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.270 
actually easier to pull her into again
the<00:01:36.540> back<00:01:36.750> position<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.560> both<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.220> them

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the back position here both of them

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
the back position here both of them
going<00:01:38.520> over<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> top<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.439> then<00:01:40.439> let's<00:01:40.770> walk

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
going over the top and then let's walk

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.639 
going over the top and then let's walk
through<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.460> quick<00:01:42.259> I've<00:01:43.259> got<00:01:43.470> left

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
through that really quick I've got left

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.319
