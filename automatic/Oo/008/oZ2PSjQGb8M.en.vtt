00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.490

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:34.759
 Yes, if you press sideways it's different again 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.180
 It can stand with clock settings or usb settings

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.909
 Yes file lock 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:06.729
 That's where you split files or copy files 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:08.720
 Playback mode a little push to try Toka file list list is not now 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.940
 Open the 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.300
 Said bitterness 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.910
 with this 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.090
 a 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.320
 It is also left k recorder back to the home 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:24.160
 It is a multitrack if you do it sideways 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.969
 Because it is a multitrack, it means that multiple recording can be done 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.119
 I will return to home again 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.740
 Surge a I do not know this little had 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:32.240
 Hmm 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.420
 Metrome 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.320
 This is what you would do with a Metrome 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.430
 When play comes out by reproduction 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.430

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.630

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:01.120
 In addition better way 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:05.529
 Back to the 9 button is at the time of playback yeah 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.500
 It's a feature that can speed up or slow down 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:10.729
 Yeah yeah 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:17.990
 The best of this attraction is left and right 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:20.610
 External microphone can be connected, but the volume of the external microphone can be changed 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.729
 This is the best, for example 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.220
 While getting the left 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:29.289

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:41.409
 It 's empty left right 8 and so on. 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:44.849
 It is very useful that this can be done 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:44.849
 Hey Will not it feel good 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:51.699
 Yes 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.699
 Yes, I really felt likely to handle even for beginners 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.930
 This is when cutting 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.070
 It was cut with this 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.689
 How about that 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.529
 Olympus ls 100
