00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.320
 They had the choice I withheld 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.990
 biological belief is said to do so 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.669
 still or prosthesis why have you 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.799
 For the amputation decided at that time yes 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.810
 I was still in the hospital at that time 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.400
 in a prosthesis workshop quasi in 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.320
 let a bed move 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.330
 There was a nice staff who have 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.769
 everything tells me about prostheses what 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.259
 maybe later again 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.170
 is and from the moment I was one 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.240
 I 'm a dentist and then of course 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.790
 nevertheless weighed again and again and again 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.710
 contra leadership against amputation and 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.780
 after only this decision more and more 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.579
 matured in me amputated me 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.140
 and I really do not have it today 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.699
 repent because very much possible again 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.280
 is in today's life 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.539
 thanks to today's prosthesis technicians where 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.129
 do you still have problems in the 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.280
 Comparison with a small normal 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.199
 leg or with a prosthesis yes so must 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.410
 I already think a little bit clear 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.420
 climbing stairs takes a bit longer yes 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.769
 in the morning instead of five minutes earlier 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.590
 to put on the leg 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.980
 but otherwise year i live my life 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.360
 to 95 percent exactly as before and exactly 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.240
 so do the other guys from the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.250
 Amputee football skiing 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.590
 snowboarding swimming there is climbing 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.330
 everything is done again and yes it is already 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.560
 impressive what meanwhile with the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.750
 technology everything is possible again a 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.000
 that's exactly how we see it here 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.439
 individual training for you now 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.420
 Nevertheless, simply federal coach her good 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.579
 already praised and said I 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.579
 He wants to see why, yes 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.960
 simply because the players have to go under 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.250
 the week so if we are not 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.530
 We carry out training courses 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.180
 Of course, once a month they do theirs 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.780
 basics train and condition 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.049
 is one of them 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.659
 here of course the endurance and if on 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.610
 days or holes during the week of 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.579
 normal life uses a prosthesis 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.990
 then the players will not do exactly 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.549
 what we do on the field 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.170
 namely playing with the crutches and here 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.090
 That's why I say we have to go with the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.469
 train crutches and the two- three times 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.479
 the week methodical with one 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.770
 regeneration day in between and then 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.350
 let the players just run 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.570
 because the outsourced 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.250
 stress points are different than at 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.100
 a normal player then with the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.920
 prosthesis or running normally 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.970
 here we see pictures christian why 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.290
 did they actually go for the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.610
 football with the crutches decided because 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.140
 theoretically they could probably 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.270
 also play soccer with the prosthesis 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.190
 or yes it was so in those days 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.840
 Hospital there was a notice from 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.350
 this amputee team with 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.030
 crutches 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.700
 I immediately took care of that 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.140
 taken home yes then have two years 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000
 later, after I just live in it 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.920
 arrived again was also professional 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.230
 I reported to the coach at that time 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.550
 Lota and he said boy comes 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.800
 passing look at that 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.630
 it is everyone was welcome 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.220
 then in may last year the first time 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.590
 for training and he has immediately 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.090
 Great fun was done again 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.870
 a big feeling a football boots 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.940
 to attract 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.770
 it was so nervous in the morning 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.480
 football bag pack what i did before 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.670
 had not done for two years 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.550
 and received a warm welcome from 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.710
 the guys are all correct the guys 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.580
 and give in to the beginning already 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.860
 little underestimated this crutches goes 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.870
 Wrists then do the arms too 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.820
 a bit of a pain though 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.070
 if you have done twice , it works 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.810
 actually and again they have just 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.150
 said individual training at home 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.650
 Even then you get used to the thing 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.560
 and then it fits 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.170
 We have a campaign from the action 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.350
 found a human 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.190
 it gets a bit provocative 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.500
 Disabled Sports 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.780
 and now I want to know 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.850
 you think that's good because you just have more 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.050
 Of course, publicity should also be there 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.880
 more people maybe too 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.530
 to be made aware of because it 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.570
 is also about financial matters so 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.490
 Here we see that capitalized full 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.890
 hampered and then not all small 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.760
 to play along 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.340
 that helps them or is that too 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.390
 a lot so I think it's a good one 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.770
 thing because this sport or yes 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.900
 This handicapped sport is allowed to be calm 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.480
 while the public and how grad 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.130
 as it stands at the saying it should 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.470
 maybe this way in the future 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.420
 that non-disabled with the disabled 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.580
 with exercising or vice versa and 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.410
 as well as the brand from berliners makes in 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.660
 the free time player week by week 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.520
 with the non-disabled with the too 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.400
 can stand quite well are really good 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.810
 there as shown in the post I 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.250
 train from time to time with my old ones 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.820
 with buddies and I think it's a good one 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.139
 thing in any case 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.660
 Oscar pistorius is surely yours 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.280
 also a term successful sprinter 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.680
 who then tries again and again 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.060
 at the world championship without 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.290
 disabled people and there too 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.270
 So it's a bit successful 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.010
 role model for them and a piece far 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.290
 in any case, even then in the 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.120
 sickbed clear that's great 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.919
 personalities of disabled sports 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.500
 and where do you dress then 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.330
 of course, already high and so 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.460
 role model you take the guys 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.410
 Of course like to clear because the show what 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.260
 really possible again in life 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.790
 and yes of course you try too 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.770
 to make the most possible in life again 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.070
 yes well what sporting goals are 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.300
 on 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.380
 with the team after all clear 2014 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.660
 we should reach the world championship 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.770
 in between now so this year 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.260
 23 planned country matches a tournament 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.320
 holland is also on the plan 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.970
 france beautiful class country exactly and 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.210
 next year it goes on the 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.800
 So our highlights are athletes 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.720
 supports so that's also cost 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.850
 travel to the country games 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.950
 yes that has me at the beginning where to find me 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.600
 I asked 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.910
 this team would accompany a lot 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.380
 The boys have surprised me here 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.660
 would call it that is allowed out 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.650
 own pocket can pay for everything 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.420
 Of course you do not lift 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.890
 and here, of course, is the clear one 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.200
 support asked clearly 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.340
 also from the german soccer federation but times 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.340
 maybe there is a look 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.200
 Supporters say that would be us 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.010
 We like it here 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.450
 be 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.740
 they are welcome to contact you, of course 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.270
 they are welcome to contact me, I believe 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.030
 on facebook there is a page of 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.680
 first acting football club you 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.870
 now also founded in the last 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.670
 year that was so you find it 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.440
 every case and we hope that, of course 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.820
 they then want to be successful, perhaps 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.800
 I do not want the pressure too high 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.390
 make yes with the wm title but that one 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.400
 maybe a success then 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.540
 With home brings many thanks with pleasure 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.590
 visit here in our studio 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.910
 hopefully it will be a little bit easier 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.110
 We definitely like it 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.270
 very interesting just with the crutches 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.810
 Thank you very much for your kind regards Mr. Huth 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.810
 and get
