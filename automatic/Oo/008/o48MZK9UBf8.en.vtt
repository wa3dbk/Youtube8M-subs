00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.420
 I'm making this video for people who 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.099
 goes well with strong R to show what 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.599
 What's happening with the unlocking? 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.389
 reset law 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.360
 the new consoles seem to be the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.439
 console with the date of manufacture of the month 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.390
 eight of 2003 or connect the console here 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.390
 normal to show a defect 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.359
 This is the chip of the Greek eset and we can 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.390
 To realize that blue moon is flashing. 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:40.140
 very fast call this ass he had 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:43.980
 very fast pulse and this does not 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.350
 boot time to resolve this beyond the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.739
 chip was installed a relay and parallel 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.480
 along with a chip off the console 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:05.159
 to show the right way off 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:08.100
 how to draw it from power to power is the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.900
 chip pulsar normally and pay the time 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.330
 to boot the hacked dash 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.890
 have to think about pushing and holding the button 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.890
 power for ten seconds 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.780
 we can see that now it's the chip 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.060
 neighbor with a longer time and is 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.320
 making kind of a gringo noise 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.320
 this group is normal 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:53.750
 Let's wait a little longer, ready. 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.750
 up hadash makeup 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.710
 so to solve this problem you 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:07.140
 you have to press and hold the power button 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:08.759
 for ten seconds to switch off 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.690
 once in a while when you push the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.670
 power and does not disconnect from first has to 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.860
 push the button twice 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.720
 or else you press the second button 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:27.120
 can even assume the image do here 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:31.620
 uploaded the image you loose is in the test 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.500
 we also find that it is not every time 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.510
 that you holding down the power button 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.130
 for 10 seconds it will rise from xii 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.380
 hacked 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.590
 if the idea is if it does not work you take it 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.579
 the new box energy club and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.070
 try again and also in the test 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:59.730
 find out a lot from time to time when 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:02.010
 you do the 10 seconds or less what 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.739
 the chip with that sonorous look like a 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.190
 Greek it will stay continuous if 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:14.340
 this happens you also pug the 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:17.310
 xbox of energy and try again one 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.680
 civil all thought out of place 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.670
 because this is only a test here 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.690
 now I'll clean up and make a new one 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:32.329
 with it closed to show how 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.420
 good function with a closed xbox 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.970
 You will not be able to see the blue light. 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.720
 will be giving normal course to power 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:48.500
 boot 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:50.180
 and get up to 10 ti hacked to know if the 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.360
 Momentum is right, you have to pay 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.370
 attention in the noise that looks like a gringo 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:01.460
 if you make the owl by taking a break 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.770
 it means that it is booting in time 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.770
 sure to climb to 10 hacked 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.670
 if you do not make any noise or if you do 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.160
 a direct duel without pause 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.940
 it means you have a wrong wrist 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.130
 and will not go up to 10 other makeup 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.720
 way also to know that did not 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.920
 It's okay if it does not show up 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.520
 no image 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.890
 after two minutes on the television or 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:36.710
 A red light on the button 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:42.140
 power to recreate here some of what 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:46.240
 would be the pulse or the noise of Sunday is 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:49.940
 direct or signal no clanging noise 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:54.340
 in the first phase the right way made the 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.340
 paula button and hold for 10 seconds 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:14.810
 yesterday opel also the green paulo stopped 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.360
 new keeper if you make that noise either 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.260
 say that the pulse is in the right time 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:32.480
 so just wait to rise to 10 Dec already 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:37.010
 up to turn it off is like squeezing and 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:42.940
 hold until it is a thousand image can 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.940
 jumping I will not try to create a museum 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.700
 giving a knot or turning off I will 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.510
 try again to give an example like this 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.510
 how is she? 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.500
 this is what is not missing on the wrist 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.540
 game is on is not making noise 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:19.540
 none of the guild so to say okay 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:23.330
 with wrong time happening is this 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:27.400
 turn off and commend the club 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.400
 power back in 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:43.340
 Here I got one more mistake from him, I did. 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.530
 I thought the button less than five 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.880
 seconds and I jumped, looked at the 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.880
 continuous noise of the bureau 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.370
 If this happens, you 'll have to 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.910
 good to hang up 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:03.260
 It will not turn off, you 'll have to take it off. 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:09.310
 plug the power plug and 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:09.310
 new then these are duels
