00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.300 
because I qualify for the file in third
place<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.540> lowest<00:02:49.110> score<00:02:49.380> out<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.920> borders

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
place the lowest score out the borders

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.220 
place the lowest score out the borders

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
so I would start number one going into

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.980 
so I would start number one going into
the<00:02:52.320> final<00:02:52.770> um<00:02:53.210> went<00:02:54.210> pretty<00:02:54.360> well<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.660> missed

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990
