00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
if it was permanently rubbed and I think

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.930 
if it was permanently rubbed and I think
this<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.890> something<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.160> cool<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:08.789> this

out of the way here is hot rod kind of
bullying<00:02:33.180> himself<00:02:33.800> here<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.220> picture<00:02:36.260> so

bullying himself here in the picture so

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.970 
bullying himself here in the picture so
it<00:02:37.380> kind<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.560> gives<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:37.800> an<00:02:37.890> idea<00:02:37.920> right<00:02:38.310> there

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
now let's go ahead and get into the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.690 
now let's go ahead and get into the
transformations<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.930> want<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.709> get<00:02:43.890> into<00:02:44.220> this

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
transformations I want to get into this

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.000 
transformations I want to get into this
guy<00:02:44.910> first<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.690> one<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.049> fast<00:02:46.410> lane<00:02:46.709> he

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
guy first and this one is fast lane he

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.559 
guy first and this one is fast lane he
kind<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> turns<00:02:47.400> into<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.670> little<00:02:48.120> formula

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
kind of turns into a little formula

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.470 
kind of turns into a little formula
racing<00:02:48.989> car<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.250> probably<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.970> weakest

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
racing car this is probably the weakest

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.890 
racing car this is probably the weakest
out<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.900> four<00:02:52.310> clones<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.610> think<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.720> is

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
out of the four clones I think this is

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.380 
out of the four clones I think this is
probably<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.319> fourth<00:02:55.560> best<00:02:55.829> where<00:02:56.390> cloud

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
probably the fourth best where cloud

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.180 
probably the fourth best where cloud
raker<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.780> probably<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.349> first<00:02:58.650> best<00:02:58.950> out<00:02:59.160> of

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
raker is probably the first best out of

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.370 
raker is probably the first best out of
the<00:02:59.340> four<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.760> first<00:03:00.390> thing<00:03:00.510> we'll<00:03:00.630> do<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.840> take

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
the four so first thing we'll do is take

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.620 
the four so first thing we'll do is take
off<00:03:01.620> these<00:03:01.829> guns<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.910> you'll<00:03:03.030> see<00:03:03.209> as<00:03:03.299> far<00:03:03.510> as

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
off these guns and you'll see as far as

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.710 
off these guns and you'll see as far as
stickers<00:03:03.959> go<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:05.130> have<00:03:05.340> these<00:03:05.790> right<00:03:06.180> here<00:03:06.450> if

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
stickers go you have these right here if

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.180 
stickers go you have these right here if
you're<00:03:06.840> looking<00:03:07.110> where<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.319> place<00:03:07.620> them<00:03:07.799> those

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
flip his feet down pull this arm forward

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.590 
flip his feet down pull this arm forward
just<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:29.730> will<00:03:29.880> twist<00:03:30.239> his<00:03:30.569> head

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
just like so and you will twist his head

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.520 
just like so and you will twist his head
around<00:03:31.609> and<00:03:32.609> then<00:03:32.940> plug<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.840> now<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.380> is

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
around and then plug this in now this is

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.440 
around and then plug this in now this is
probably<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.920> other<00:03:35.280> than<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.790> weapons<00:03:36.239> this

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
probably the other than the weapons this

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.210 
probably the other than the weapons this
is<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.630> easiest<00:03:37.049> lost<00:03:37.380> accessory<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.069> you'll

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
is the easiest lost accessory so you'll

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.530 
is the easiest lost accessory so you'll
see<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.400> lot<00:03:38.579> of<00:03:38.609> these<00:03:38.730> guys<00:03:38.940> online<00:03:39.150> we're

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
see a lot of these guys online we're

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.259 
see a lot of these guys online we're
just<00:03:39.750> missing<00:03:40.079> this<00:03:40.200> piece<00:03:40.440> right<00:03:40.650> here<00:03:40.709> I

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
just missing this piece right here I

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.520 
just missing this piece right here I
didn't<00:03:42.269> really<00:03:42.450> look<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.019> see<00:03:43.139> how<00:03:43.200> much<00:03:43.319> that

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
didn't really look to see how much that

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.490 
didn't really look to see how much that
goes<00:03:43.650> for<00:03:43.920> but<00:03:44.160> like<00:03:44.940> most<00:03:45.180> things<00:03:45.389> if<00:03:46.230> it's

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
goes for but like most things if it's

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.620 
goes for but like most things if it's
something<00:03:46.769> that's<00:03:46.859> easily<00:03:47.160> lost<00:03:47.670> usually

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
something that's easily lost usually

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.660 
something that's easily lost usually
that's<00:03:48.810> what<00:03:49.019> costly<00:03:49.530> most<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:50.100> replace<00:03:50.489> it

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
that's what costly most to replace it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.099 
that's what costly most to replace it
probably<00:03:50.940> cost<00:03:51.090> even<00:03:51.299> more<00:03:51.480> than<00:03:51.630> weapons<00:03:51.810> to

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
probably cost even more than weapons to

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.020 
probably cost even more than weapons to
be<00:03:52.200> quite<00:03:52.380> honest<00:03:52.680> but<00:03:53.340> then<00:03:53.549> we're<00:03:53.670> going<00:03:53.910> to

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
be quite honest but then we're going to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.300 
be quite honest but then we're going to
put<00:03:54.299> these<00:03:54.780> guns<00:03:55.170> here<00:03:55.470> onto<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.040> sign<00:03:58.310> and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
put these guns here onto the sign and

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.830 
put these guns here onto the sign and

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
having wheels up here at the front so a

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.270 
having wheels up here at the front so a

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
little weak but again this is why this

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.850 
little weak but again this is why this
is<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.940> fourth<00:04:31.270> or<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:32.200> worst<00:04:32.380> one<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.710> guess

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
is the fourth or the worst one I guess

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.000 
is the fourth or the worst one I guess
out<00:04:32.980> of<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.130> Clones<00:04:34.530> should<00:04:35.530> give<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:35.830> guys

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
right we'll move him to the side and

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.150 
right we'll move him to the side and
we'll<00:04:41.080> get<00:04:41.230> into<00:04:41.380> my<00:04:41.560> favorite<00:04:41.770> now<00:04:42.100> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
we'll get into my favorite now the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.190 
we'll get into my favorite now the
reason<00:04:42.610> why<00:04:42.760> he's<00:04:43.450> probably<00:04:43.630> my<00:04:43.810> favorite<00:04:44.110> is

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
reason why he's probably my favorite is

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.680 
reason why he's probably my favorite is
his<00:04:44.620> off<00:04:44.890> mode<00:04:45.250> looks<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.820> best<00:04:46.000> but<00:04:46.570> it's

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
his off mode looks the best but it's

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.000 
his off mode looks the best but it's
also<00:04:46.810> probably<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.320> coolest<00:04:47.650> looking

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
also probably the coolest looking

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.790 
also probably the coolest looking
transformation<00:04:49.000> as<00:04:49.210> well<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:50.560> we'll<00:04:50.680> just

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
transformation as well so we'll just

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.170 
transformation as well so we'll just
take<00:04:51.160> these<00:04:51.700> guns<00:04:52.030> out<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:54.520> have<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.820> same

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
take these guns out you have the same

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.760 
take these guns out you have the same

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
here you don't need to rotate it because

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.900

looking jet there now with his guns you

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.410 
looking jet there now with his guns you
could<00:05:43.750> put<00:05:44.200> them<00:05:44.440> down<00:05:45.310> here<00:05:45.790> if<00:05:46.000> you<00:05:46.030> wanted

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
could put them down here if you wanted

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.840 
could put them down here if you wanted
to<00:05:46.620> if<00:05:47.620> you<00:05:47.680> wanted<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:48.130> put<00:05:48.280> his<00:05:48.370> hands<00:05:48.610> up<00:05:48.730> you

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
to if you wanted to put his hands up you

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.990 
to if you wanted to put his hands up you
didn't<00:05:49.090> want<00:05:49.360> those<00:05:49.540> showing<00:05:50.440> it<00:05:50.560> all<00:05:50.800> up<00:05:51.040> and

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
didn't want those showing it all up and

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000 
didn't want those showing it all up and
you<00:05:52.210> could<00:05:52.420> have<00:05:52.510> that<00:05:52.570> but<00:05:53.020> looks<00:05:53.200> kind<00:05:53.950> of

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
you could have that but looks kind of

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.950 
you could have that but looks kind of
like<00:05:54.130> a<00:05:54.190> bird<00:05:54.490> to<00:05:54.820> me<00:05:54.970> if<00:05:55.270> you<00:05:55.420> do<00:05:55.540> it<00:05:55.630> that<00:05:55.810> way

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
like a bird to me if you do it that way

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.450 
like a bird to me if you do it that way
you<00:05:56.470> know<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.650> looks<00:05:56.800> like<00:05:56.920> these<00:05:57.040> are<00:05:57.100> feet

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
you know it looks like these are feet

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.070 
you know it looks like these are feet
the<00:05:57.670> beak<00:05:57.910> the<00:05:58.150> wings<00:05:58.390> and<00:05:58.630> stuff<00:05:58.720> like<00:05:58.900> that

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
the beak the wings and stuff like that

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.920 
the beak the wings and stuff like that
so<00:05:59.290> I<00:05:59.470> wasn't<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.430> big<00:06:00.580> fan<00:06:00.610> of<00:06:00.820> this<00:06:01.240> way<00:06:01.450> but<00:06:01.900> I

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
so I wasn't a big fan of this way but I

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.390 
so I wasn't a big fan of this way but I
guess<00:06:02.080> you<00:06:02.260> could<00:06:02.530> do<00:06:02.740> it<00:06:02.860> that<00:06:02.980> way<00:06:03.160> if<00:06:03.340> you

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
guess you could do it that way if you

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.120 
guess you could do it that way if you
wanted<00:06:03.730> to<00:06:03.930> but<00:06:04.930> to<00:06:05.260> show<00:06:05.440> you<00:06:05.500> the<00:06:05.620> way<00:06:05.740> that<00:06:05.770> I

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
wanted to but to show you the way that I

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.590 
wanted to but to show you the way that I
actually<00:06:06.520> prefer<00:06:07.320> you<00:06:08.320> leave<00:06:08.530> the<00:06:08.680> hands<00:06:09.040> out

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
actually prefer you leave the hands out

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.540 
actually prefer you leave the hands out
and<00:06:10.600> then<00:06:11.410> you<00:06:11.500> just<00:06:11.530> put<00:06:11.770> these<00:06:11.890> guns<00:06:12.160> in<00:06:12.400> his

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
and then you just put these guns in his

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.540 
and then you just put these guns in his
hands<00:06:12.790> just<00:06:13.090> like<00:06:13.150> so<00:06:13.480> I<00:06:13.870> think<00:06:14.320> you<00:06:15.040> know<00:06:15.100> that

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
hands just like so I think you know that

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.330 
hands just like so I think you know that
looks<00:06:15.820> so<00:06:16.480> much<00:06:16.600> better<00:06:16.810> you<00:06:17.110> know<00:06:17.980> just<00:06:18.220> my

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
looks so much better you know just my

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.160 
looks so much better you know just my
opinion<00:06:18.700> so<00:06:18.910> you<00:06:19.120> can<00:06:19.270> do<00:06:19.450> whatever<00:06:19.750> you<00:06:19.960> want

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
opinion so you can do whatever you want

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.810 
opinion so you can do whatever you want
whenever<00:06:20.500> you<00:06:20.650> pick<00:06:20.860> up<00:06:20.950> these<00:06:21.070> figures<00:06:21.280> and

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
whenever you pick up these figures and

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.980 
whenever you pick up these figures and
there's<00:06:22.000> that<00:06:22.180> other<00:06:22.360> sticker<00:06:22.660> that<00:06:22.840> I<00:06:22.900> was

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
there's that other sticker that I was

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.520 
there's that other sticker that I was
talking<00:06:23.260> about<00:06:23.320> there<00:06:25.620> looks<00:06:26.620> really<00:06:26.890> nice

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
talking about there looks really nice

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.080 
talking about there looks really nice
so<00:06:29.530> we'll<00:06:29.680> kind<00:06:29.920> of<00:06:30.100> set<00:06:30.460> him<00:06:30.490> to<00:06:30.850> the<00:06:30.910> side

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
so we'll kind of set him to the side

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.090 
so we'll kind of set him to the side
here<00:06:31.300> another<00:06:31.690> thing<00:06:31.930> that<00:06:32.140> I'm<00:06:32.680> probably

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
here another thing that I'm probably

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.010 
here another thing that I'm probably
going<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.640> do<00:06:33.760> because<00:06:34.060> as<00:06:34.360> you<00:06:34.480> can<00:06:34.600> see<00:06:34.690> with

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
going to do because as you can see with

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.480 
going to do because as you can see with
the<00:06:35.080> sticker<00:06:35.290> sheet<00:06:35.500> you<00:06:35.620> get<00:06:35.740> quite<00:06:36.100> a<00:06:36.130> bit<00:06:36.340> of

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
the sticker sheet you get quite a bit of

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.690 
the sticker sheet you get quite a bit of
silver

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
silver

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.580 
silver
there<00:06:38.060> with<00:06:38.750> him<00:06:38.900> I'm<00:06:39.110> probably<00:06:39.260> gonna<00:06:39.470> just

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
there with him I'm probably gonna just

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.470 
there with him I'm probably gonna just
cut<00:06:39.890> out<00:06:39.980> a<00:06:40.010> little<00:06:40.220> square<00:06:40.610> and<00:06:40.820> put<00:06:41.120> it<00:06:41.240> here

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
at the ends there and it would just do

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.450
