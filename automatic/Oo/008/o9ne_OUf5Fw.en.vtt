 She turns crimson, I do not know if it's Baires or Madrid, nothing matters to you in the City if nobody waits. 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:44.129
 And my love is not so tragic, it's this dream, it's this sun 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:01:19.649
 that yesterday seemed so strange, or at least your lips. 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:18.149
 Furious petal of salt, the same street, the same bar, nothing matters to you in the City if nobody waits. 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:35.410
 it is this dream, it is this sun, that yesterday seemed so strange, or at least your lips. 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:50.860
 I understand you well, it's like talking to the wall, and I imagine you circling in the neighborhood. 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:15.700
 Something has these years that make me put like that. And tell you that I miss you and I'll see you happy. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.950
 [Applause]
