bushings and you can see mine are
cracking<00:04:45.280> right<00:04:45.430> there<00:04:45.670> it's<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.390> same<00:04:46.540> thing

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
cracking right there it's the same thing

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.390 
cracking right there it's the same thing
on<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.020> other<00:04:47.050> truck<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.830> that's<00:04:48.070> just

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
on the other truck and that's just

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.330 
on the other truck and that's just
because<00:04:48.640> of<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.930> impacts<00:04:50.350> I<00:04:50.560> do<00:04:50.620> old<00:04:50.980> landing

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
because of the impacts I do old landing

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.780 
because of the impacts I do old landing
tricks<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.510> just<00:04:52.690> fucks<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.080> up<00:04:53.200> so<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.520> also

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
tricks and it just fucks it up so I also

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.820 
tricks and it just fucks it up so I also
think<00:04:54.940> my<00:04:55.210> kingpin<00:04:55.870> might<00:04:56.020> be<00:04:56.170> snappy<00:04:56.560> and

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
think my kingpin might be snappy and

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.070 
think my kingpin might be snappy and
also<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:57.430> don't<00:04:57.700> know<00:04:57.790> probably<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.630> impact

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
also I don't know probably the impact

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.200 
also I don't know probably the impact
cuz<00:04:59.500> these<00:05:00.190> boards<00:05:00.550> aren't<00:05:00.730> made<00:05:00.850> for<00:05:00.880> doing

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210
