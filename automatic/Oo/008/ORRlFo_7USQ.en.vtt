00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
phones captured the images but they were

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.050 
phones captured the images but they were
from<00:02:58.599> new<00:02:58.780> guitars<00:02:59.200> so<00:03:00.040> here<00:03:00.400> we<00:03:00.580> have<00:03:00.819> that

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
from new guitars so here we have that

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.360 
from new guitars so here we have that
vintage<00:03:01.420> DNA<00:03:01.989> already<00:03:02.680> built<00:03:03.040> into<00:03:03.220> the

what the numbers and figures all add up

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.190 
what the numbers and figures all add up
to<00:04:56.440> is<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.010> fact<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:58.210> neck<00:04:58.600> feels<00:04:58.930> up

here<00:04:59.800> pretty<00:05:00.460> much<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.880> way<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.030> feels<00:05:01.240> down

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
here pretty much the way it feels down

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.030 
here pretty much the way it feels down
here<00:05:01.960> we're<00:05:02.170> vice-versa

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
here we're vice-versa

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.640 
here we're vice-versa
you<00:05:03.340> notice<00:05:03.730> that<00:05:03.880> as<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:04.360> progress<00:05:04.690> upwards

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
you notice that as you progress upwards

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.580 
you notice that as you progress upwards
there's<00:05:06.010> not<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.340> lot<00:05:06.610> of<00:05:06.850> wood<00:05:07.690> not<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.230> lot<00:05:08.470> of

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
there's not a lot of wood not a lot of

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.370 
there's not a lot of wood not a lot of
meat<00:05:08.770> there<00:05:08.800> so<00:05:09.340> it's<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.640> very<00:05:09.970> trim<00:05:10.420> neck<00:05:10.840> but

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
meat there so it's a very trim neck but

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.780 
meat there so it's a very trim neck but
it's<00:05:11.530> got<00:05:11.680> that<00:05:11.830> one<00:05:12.100> in<00:05:12.220> three<00:05:12.370> quarters

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
it's got that one in three quarters

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.670 
it's got that one in three quarters
width<00:05:13.060> so<00:05:13.630> it's<00:05:13.810> real<00:05:14.020> good<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.260> get<00:05:14.470> your

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
width so it's real good to get your

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.540 
width so it's real good to get your
fingers<00:05:15.040> in<00:05:15.070> there

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
fingers in there

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.909 
fingers in there
