00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the tactical side of things I think he

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.420 
the tactical side of things I think he
installs<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:23.510> winning<00:00:24.510> ethos<00:00:25.369> mentality<00:00:26.369> is

installs a a winning ethos mentality is
about<00:00:27.060> winning<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.570> think<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.869> been

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
about winning of I think it's been

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.330 
about winning of I think it's been
really<00:00:28.230> positive<00:00:28.560> there's<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
really positive there's going to be a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
really positive there's going to be a
great<00:00:29.970> atmosphere<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.840> next<00:00:31.080> few<00:00:31.470> weeks

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
great atmosphere for the next few weeks

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.229 
great atmosphere for the next few weeks
before<00:00:31.890> obviously<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.610> tough<00:00:32.820> decision

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
before obviously the tough decision

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.360 
before obviously the tough decision
comes<00:00:33.900> a<00:00:34.370> sort<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:36.320> making<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.440> scored<00:00:37.710> 23<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
comes a sort of making that scored 23 I

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.920 
comes a sort of making that scored 23 I
think<00:00:38.640> we've<00:00:38.729> got<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> good<00:00:38.909> chance<00:00:39.059> i<00:00:39.510> think<00:00:39.809> if

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
think we've got a good chance i think if

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
think we've got a good chance i think if
you<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.470> put<00:00:41.129> our<00:00:41.250> strongest<00:00:41.580> team<00:00:41.940> out

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
you you know put our strongest team out

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.869 
you you know put our strongest team out
on<00:00:42.269> paper<00:00:42.479> then<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.589> compares<00:00:44.010> favorably

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
on paper then it's it compares favorably

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.670 
on paper then it's it compares favorably

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
team almost immediately and John Terry

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870 
team almost immediately and John Terry
as<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> leader<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.410> captain<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.640> know

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
as a leader and a captain would you know

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.550 
as a leader and a captain would you know
would<00:01:27.120> probably<00:01:27.450> make<00:01:27.570> most<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> teams<00:01:28.290> if

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
would probably make most of the teams if

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.690 
would probably make most of the teams if
you<00:01:28.620> look<00:01:28.770> through<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.100> positions<00:01:29.580> in

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
you look through all the positions in

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.980 
you look through all the positions in
our<00:01:29.820> team<00:01:30.060> we've<00:01:30.240> got<00:01:30.270> world-class<00:01:30.630> players

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
our team we've got world-class players

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.470 
our team we've got world-class players
in<00:01:31.170> most<00:01:31.350> positions<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.090> depends<00:01:33.360> on

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
in most positions it just depends on

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.030 
in most positions it just depends on
injuries<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.440> better<00:01:34.590> look<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
injuries I think in a better look at the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.920 
injuries I think in a better look at the
right<00:01:35.190> time<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> rest<00:01:36.480> are<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.690> if<00:01:36.840> they

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
right time but the rest are so if they

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.360 
right time but the rest are so if they
do<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.260> i'll<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.470> taking<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.800> glory<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
do and i'll be taking the glory with the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.220 
do and i'll be taking the glory with the
team<00:01:38.580> now<00:01:39.330> look<00:01:39.540> around<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.780> players<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.200> think

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
team now look around the players I think

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.050 
team now look around the players I think
we<00:01:40.440> go<00:01:40.530> into<00:01:40.680> games<00:01:40.920> expected<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.550> win<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.820> even

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
we go into games expected to win I even

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
we go into games expected to win I even
when<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.390> gold<00:01:42.659> down<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:43.050> we<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.440> we

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
when we go gold down up we you know we

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.830 
when we go gold down up we you know we
didn't<00:01:43.860> against<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> Egyptian<00:01:45.120> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
didn't against the Egyptian you know I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
didn't against the Egyptian you know I
think<00:01:45.900> we've<00:01:46.380> always<00:01:46.530> got<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.800> belief<00:01:47.190> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
think we've always got that belief and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
think we've always got that belief and
that<00:01:47.670> winning<00:01:48.240> mentality<00:01:48.390> he's<00:01:48.840> brought<00:01:49.050> in

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that winning mentality he's brought in

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.450 
that winning mentality he's brought in
and<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.440> think<00:01:49.650> you<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.130> look<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.400> the

and I think you know look at the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.270 
and I think you know look at the
qualifying<00:01:50.909> campaign<00:01:51.120> with<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.100> won

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
qualifying campaign with you know won

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.360 
qualifying campaign with you know won
every<00:01:53.550> game<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.390> until<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.200> end<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> it

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
every game you know until the end and it

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.700 
every game you know until the end and it
was<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.970> fantastic<00:01:57.330> way<00:01:57.690> we<00:01:58.020> qualified<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
was in a fantastic way we qualified and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.289 
was in a fantastic way we qualified and
I<00:01:58.770> don't<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.070> we've<00:01:59.250> had<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.790> previously

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I don't think we've had that previously

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.700 
I don't think we've had that previously
and<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:01.020> we're<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.440> tournament
