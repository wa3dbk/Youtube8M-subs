my<00:00:23.910> rode<00:00:24.119> videomic<00:00:24.630> pro<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.949> this

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
my rode videomic pro now I do have this

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.390 
my rode videomic pro now I do have this
attached<00:00:26.460> onto<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.910> microphone<00:00:27.420> stand<00:00:27.650> now<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
attached onto a microphone stand now the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
attached onto a microphone stand now the
reason<00:00:29.640> why<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.060> pointed<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.990> me

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
reason why I have it pointed it to me

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.510 
reason why I have it pointed it to me
rather<00:00:31.410> than<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> hot<00:00:32.009> stream<00:00:32.279> mountain

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
rather than on the hot stream mountain

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.100 
rather than on the hot stream mountain
pointed<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> other<00:00:33.030> way<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
pointed the other way is because if you

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.660 
pointed the other way is because if you
have<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> pointed<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.190> will<00:00:35.399> pick<00:00:35.550> up

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
have it pointed to you it will pick up

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.750 
have it pointed to you it will pick up
very<00:00:35.910> clear<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.480> crisp<00:00:36.690> audio<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.520> found

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
very clear and crisp audio and I found

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.400 
very clear and crisp audio and I found
this<00:00:38.850> very<00:00:39.030> beneficial<00:00:39.300> having<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
this very beneficial having it on a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
this very beneficial having it on a
microphone<00:00:40.800> stand<00:00:40.980> because<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.879> move<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
microphone stand because I can move it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.459 
microphone stand because I can move it
around<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.510> adjust<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.140> certain

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
around and adjust it to that certain

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
around and adjust it to that certain
angle<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.920> would<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.180> perfect
