important information discuss why they
thought<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.369> was<00:01:23.520> important<00:01:23.999> and<00:01:24.149> then

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
class time is to have this discussion

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
class time is to have this discussion
that's<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.679> to<00:01:34.890> take<00:01:35.460> them<00:01:35.609> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that's going to take them to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.149 
that's going to take them to
higher-order<00:01:35.909> thinking<00:01:36.560> but<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> lot<00:01:37.859> of<00:01:37.979> times

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
higher-order thinking but a lot of times

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.580 
higher-order thinking but a lot of times
we<00:01:38.369> can't<00:01:38.549> achieve<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.299> class<00:01:39.590> when

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we can't achieve that in class when

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
we can't achieve that in class when
we're<00:01:40.859> just<00:01:41.130> hearing<00:01:41.909> from<00:01:42.090> students<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
we're just hearing from students for the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.069 
we're just hearing from students for the
first<00:01:42.899> time<00:01:43.200> about<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:44.039> reading<00:01:44.479> on<00:01:45.479> class

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
first time about the reading on class

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.639 
first time about the reading on class
day<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.219> if<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:47.909> some<00:01:48.479> work<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:49.139> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
day so if they do some work on the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.999 
day so if they do some work on the
reading<00:01:50.249> before<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:50.700> come<00:01:50.969> to<00:01:50.999> class

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
reading before they come to class

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.529 
reading before they come to class
they're<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> better<00:01:53.639> position<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.149> move

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
they're in a better position to move

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.389 
they're in a better position to move
into<00:01:54.689> say<00:01:54.990> analysis<00:01:55.679> to<00:01:55.829> move<00:01:56.009> beyond

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
into say analysis to move beyond

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.910 
into say analysis to move beyond
comprehension<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.569> move<00:01:57.810> toward<00:01:58.079> analysis<00:01:58.710> I

comprehension to move toward analysis I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
comprehension to move toward analysis I
can<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.909> them<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> focus<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.689> particular

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
can get them to focus on particular

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.559 
can get them to focus on particular
areas<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.679> that<00:02:02.069> they've<00:02:02.670> already<00:02:02.939> covered

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
areas so that they've already covered

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.169 
areas so that they've already covered
that<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.889> as<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.039> group<00:02:05.369> because<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.939> tool

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
that kind of as a group because the tool

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.480 
that kind of as a group because the tool
allows<00:02:06.509> me<00:02:06.749> to<00:02:06.840> highlight<00:02:07.289> very<00:02:07.649> small<00:02:08.009> pieces

allows me to highlight very small pieces
of<00:02:08.970> text<00:02:09.720> not<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.319> global<00:02:11.009> things<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:12.150> can<00:02:12.480> get

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
of text not just global things I can get

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.120 
of text not just global things I can get

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
them to think about language choices in

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.530 
them to think about language choices in
a<00:02:14.220> way<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.550> I've<00:02:14.670> never<00:02:14.700> been<00:02:15.090> able<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.330> do

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
a way that I've never been able to do

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.950 
a way that I've never been able to do
before

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
before

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.190 
before
I<00:02:16.170> was<00:02:16.830> able<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
I was able to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.309 
I was able to
monitor<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.829> students<00:02:20.249> discussion<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
monitor the students discussion and

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.110 
monitor the students discussion and
clear<00:02:22.319> up<00:02:22.409> misconceptions<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:23.549> needed

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
clear up misconceptions as needed

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.809 
clear up misconceptions as needed
provide<00:02:25.049> scaffolding<00:02:25.469> or<00:02:26.099> support<00:02:26.609> as

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
provide scaffolding or support as

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.989 
provide scaffolding or support as
necessary<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.930> that's<00:02:28.739> probably<00:02:29.099> what<00:02:29.879> I've

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:29.999 
necessary and that's probably what I've

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.869 
necessary and that's probably what I've
noticed<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.620> strongest<00:02:32.310> feature<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.819> I

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
noticed is the strongest feature that I

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.270 
noticed is the strongest feature that I
would<00:02:33.060> say<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.359> good<00:02:33.569> not<00:02:33.719> just<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:34.280> teaching

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
would say is good not just for teaching

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.330 
would say is good not just for teaching
a<00:02:35.340> writing<00:02:35.370> class<00:02:35.909> or<00:02:36.420> an<00:02:36.599> English<00:02:36.870> class<00:02:37.379> but

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
a writing class or an English class but

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.729 
a writing class or an English class but
it's<00:02:38.639> good<00:02:38.819> for<00:02:39.030> any<00:02:39.569> class<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.290> uses

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
it's good for any class that uses

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.020 
it's good for any class that uses
reading<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.189> what<00:02:41.340> class<00:02:41.579> doesn't<00:02:41.849> use

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
reading and what class doesn't use

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.170 
reading and what class doesn't use
reading<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.840> were<00:02:42.989> sure<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.590> include

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
reading we were sure to include

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
reading we were sure to include
unnecessary<00:02:45.180> information<00:02:45.329> so<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.079> they

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
unnecessary information so that they

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.739 
unnecessary information so that they
would<00:02:46.349> have<00:02:46.379> to<00:02:46.739> really<00:02:47.579> read<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.999> text<00:02:48.389> and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:48.749 
would have to really read the text and

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.629 
would have to really read the text and
differentiate<00:02:49.379> between<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.040> things<00:02:50.489> that

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
differentiate between the things that

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.190 
differentiate between the things that
they<00:02:50.760> needed<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.480> things<00:02:51.689> that<00:02:51.840> they<00:02:51.930> wanted

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
they needed the things that they wanted

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.240 
they needed the things that they wanted
to<00:02:52.260> throw<00:02:52.409> away<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:52.889> is<00:02:53.010> where<00:02:53.129> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
to throw away and this is where the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.059 
to throw away and this is where the
highlighting<00:02:53.730> came<00:02:53.909> into<00:02:54.060> play<00:02:54.889> there<00:02:55.889> is

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
highlighting came into play there is

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.099 
highlighting came into play there is
something<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.639> be<00:02:56.760> said<00:02:57.000> for<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.599> fact<00:02:57.840> that

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
something to be said for the fact that

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.679 
something to be said for the fact that
they<00:02:58.409> know<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:59.730> when<00:02:59.969> they<00:03:00.000> come<00:03:00.120> into<00:03:00.419> class

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
they know that when they come into class

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.339 
they know that when they come into class
I<00:03:01.169> am<00:03:02.129> gonna<00:03:02.340> open<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.969> document<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.719> is

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
I am gonna open up a document that is

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.550 
I am gonna open up a document that is
going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.709> show<00:03:05.599> whether<00:03:06.599> or<00:03:06.750> not<00:03:06.900> they<00:03:07.319> paid

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
going to show whether or not they paid

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.619 
going to show whether or not they paid
attention<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.219> the<00:03:08.489> night<00:03:08.639> before<00:03:08.669> what<00:03:09.449> we

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
attention to it the night before what we

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.809 
attention to it the night before what we
really<00:03:10.379> were<00:03:10.500> able<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.859> do<00:03:11.129> through<00:03:11.609> this

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
really were able to do through this

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.580 
really were able to do through this
software<00:03:12.180> which<00:03:12.389> we<00:03:12.569> couldn't<00:03:12.750> do<00:03:12.930> before<00:03:13.049> is

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
software which we couldn't do before is

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.830 
software which we couldn't do before is
we<00:03:14.069> were<00:03:14.189> able<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.489> collaborate<00:03:14.969> with<00:03:15.569> another

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
we were able to collaborate with another

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.830 
we were able to collaborate with another
School<00:03:16.290> District<00:03:16.829> for<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.579> first<00:03:17.790> time<00:03:18.060> we

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
School District for the first time we

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.390 
School District for the first time we
couldn't<00:03:19.199> meet<00:03:19.439> before<00:03:19.859> school<00:03:20.159> or<00:03:20.280> after

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
couldn't meet before school or after

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.490 
couldn't meet before school or after
school<00:03:20.609> so<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.329> knew<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.840> an<00:03:22.290> online

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
school so we knew that an online

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.469 
school so we knew that an online
solution<00:03:23.220> would<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.370> our<00:03:23.549> best<00:03:23.729> option

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
solution would be our best option

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.300 
solution would be our best option
so<00:03:24.840> classroom<00:03:25.259> salon<00:03:25.650> became<00:03:26.099> that

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
so classroom salon became that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.580 
so classroom salon became that
communication<00:03:27.060> tool<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.689> linked<00:03:28.169> these<00:03:28.379> two

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
communication tool that linked these two

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.819 
communication tool that linked these two
districts<00:03:29.040> together<00:03:29.189> I<00:03:30.139> surely<00:03:31.139> believe<00:03:31.290> that

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
districts together I surely believe that

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.969 
districts together I surely believe that
students<00:03:32.220> go<00:03:32.459> beyond<00:03:32.939> skimming<00:03:33.829> when<00:03:34.829> they

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
students go beyond skimming when they

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.179 
students go beyond skimming when they
use<00:03:35.159> salon<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:36.389> I<00:03:36.569> can't<00:03:37.379> guarantee<00:03:37.680> that's

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
use salon and I can't guarantee that's

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.240 
use salon and I can't guarantee that's
happening<00:03:38.849> in<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.479> same<00:03:39.689> way<00:03:39.959> when<00:03:40.859> we're<00:03:41.099> not

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
happening in the same way when we're not

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.199 
happening in the same way when we're not
using<00:03:41.669> it<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.970> was<00:03:42.569> able<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:43.430> see<00:03:44.430> what<00:03:45.090> my

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
using it I was able to see what my

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.809 
using it I was able to see what my
students<00:03:45.599> were<00:03:45.689> thinking<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.549> how<00:03:47.549> they<00:03:47.759> were

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
students were thinking and how they were

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.789 
students were thinking and how they were
verbalizing<00:03:48.509> this<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.780> one<00:03:48.930> another<00:03:49.199> and<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
verbalizing this to one another and I

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.249 
verbalizing this to one another and I
take<00:03:50.129> student<00:03:50.519> work<00:03:50.729> and<00:03:51.299> I<00:03:51.359> upload<00:03:51.659> that<00:03:51.959> and

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:52.259 
take student work and I upload that and

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.929 
take student work and I upload that and
again<00:03:52.590> making<00:03:52.859> student<00:03:53.250> work<00:03:53.370> more<00:03:53.549> visible

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
again making student work more visible
