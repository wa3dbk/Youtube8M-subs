00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.630
 halli hello people i am the eu 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.830
 100 and welcome to a new one 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
 tutorial from me 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.120
 Today I want you the secret chest 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.580
 show behind a wall and like you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.320
 see here is nowhere near 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.240
 bit of redstone or any one 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.449
 switch and the whole works without 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.640
 matt stone without bite without switch and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.529
 so on the wall you can almost see 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.789
 nothing except when you are completely 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.309
 sees the pattern looks exactly once 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.200
 one does not quite see this block 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.790
 Of course, pick one here 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.910
 straight line through does not work like this 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.329
 and here we have a double behind 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.739
 crate you just go to the wall 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.370
 press here and then you can directly 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.700
 here 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.070
 besiege this crate and a maintenance judgment 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.390
 reinfeldt without anyone sees that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.489
 whole is actually quite pretty 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.350
 simple it has something normal with one 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.440
 year no bug but just yours 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.480
 position of big stars to do or with 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.160
 other stars you can stop this turn 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.080
 This secret turn can be stopped with 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.600
 build all objects must stop stages 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.430
 So there are stages stones and the whole 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.640
 looks like this is nothing special 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.310
 behind the chest and this chest 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.900
 yes you can stop that I remove now 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.570
 Here and here behind it sees 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.640
 So here again do the chest out 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.430
 and through this bug you can speak, so to speak 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.710
 this is the one displayed here as 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.540
 original yes like that displayed as 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.950
 Bauer piece as soon as you remove this 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.810
 it is again this piece of wall and 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.650
 as soon as you put this here comes here 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.180
 a wall, though 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.610
 but this invisible and so you can 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.130
 stop by this little wall piece what 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.750
 is displayed in this chest 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.579
 to grab here I show you how that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.960
 all but built on the fast 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.409
 we will draw here now 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.189
 an example of building the wall here 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.470
 Quick two chests we'll do now 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.130
 again here here here here here 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.200
 the wall 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.700
 then we put on one side ever 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.890
 After where you want to pay one would like 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.259
 level so we face each other 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.030
 Behind them, the Irish are back 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.069
 a wall over it again over it 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.929
 and we already see this on this 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.880
 looks position is all the time 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.500
 complete 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.060
 invisible that means that here 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.710
 no electricity is that you have to 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.330
 to go out just like you have it 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.910
 you do not want to and so you can not 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.050
 recognizes one then simply goes here 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.300
 click and has the chest 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.430
 yes I have the little tutorial has you 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.020
 fallen like a secret chest without 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.500
 Operation without anything behind a wall 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.210
 builds 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.710
 I would say until the next video 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.060
 if you think of something better 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.380
 write it in the comments and 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.380
