00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
of the Arkham Knight and I am guessing

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.280 
of the Arkham Knight and I am guessing
that<00:01:02.039> he<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> one<00:01:03.030> who<00:01:03.059> says<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.930> quote

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that he is the one who says this quote

now let's go over two things number one
with<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.369> quote<00:01:08.760> I'm<00:01:09.030> actually<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:10.439> of

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
with this quote I'm actually kind of

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.000 
with this quote I'm actually kind of
starting<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.189> doubt<00:01:11.670> my<00:01:12.330> theory<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.140> Arkham

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
starting to doubt my theory of Arkham

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.359 
starting to doubt my theory of Arkham
Knight<00:01:14.220> being<00:01:14.640> Jason<00:01:15.150> Todd<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:16.140> sounds<00:01:16.920> so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
Knight being Jason Todd this sounds so

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.840 
Knight being Jason Todd this sounds so
unlike<00:01:18.150> Jason<00:01:18.720> Todd<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.830> way<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.369> mean<00:01:20.640> they

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.249 
it just sounds interesting soz so from
what<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.099> sounds<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.179> quote<00:02:09.420> he<00:02:10.020> talks

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
what it sounds like the quote he talks

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.140 
what it sounds like the quote he talks
about<00:02:10.349> operation<00:02:10.950> Saviour<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:12.060> he

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
about operation Saviour and then he

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.550 
about operation Saviour and then he
continues<00:02:12.599> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
continues to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.070 
continues to
ask<00:02:13.709> people<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:14.700> he<00:02:14.819> wants<00:02:15.150> them<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.630> in

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
ask people what he wants them to do in

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.100 
ask people what he wants them to do in
terms<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.920> operation<00:02:17.489> Saviour<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.390> being<00:02:18.780> he

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
terms of operation Saviour that being he

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.199 
terms of operation Saviour that being he
wants<00:02:19.560> his<00:02:19.709> hands<00:02:20.250> wrapped<00:02:20.790> tight<00:02:21.180> around

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
wants his hands wrapped tight around

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.979 
wants his hands wrapped tight around
Gotham's<00:02:22.020> throat<00:02:22.440> within<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.550> hour<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.540> I

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
Gotham's throat within the hour so I

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.809 
Gotham's throat within the hour so I
mean<00:02:25.230> unless<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.099> that<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.610> that's

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
mean unless that that was like that's

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.910 
mean unless that that was like that's
literally<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.330> which<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.140> highly<00:02:28.530> doubt<00:02:28.860> I

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
literally it which I highly doubt I

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.589 
literally it which I highly doubt I
think<00:02:29.310> there's<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.550> lot<00:02:29.610> more<00:02:29.790> depth<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.330> this

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
think there's a lot more depth to this

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.750 
think there's a lot more depth to this
operation<00:02:30.810> Saviour<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.610> be

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
operation Saviour and it's going to be

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.500 
operation Saviour and it's going to be
kind<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> big<00:02:33.450> thing<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.220> Arkham<00:02:35.220> um

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
kind of the big thing in Arkham um

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.839 
kind of the big thing in Arkham um
Arkham<00:02:36.510> Knight<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.720> almost<00:02:37.019> at<00:02:37.170> Arkham<00:02:37.380> origins

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
Arkham Knight I almost at Arkham origins

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.920 
Arkham Knight I almost at Arkham origins
yeah<00:02:38.849> it's<00:02:39.000> going<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.209> be<00:02:39.269> like<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.510> big<00:02:39.690> thing

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
yeah it's going to be like the big thing

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.870 
yeah it's going to be like the big thing
in<00:02:40.050> Arkham<00:02:40.319> Knight<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.739> could<00:02:41.550> be<00:02:41.580> very

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
in Arkham Knight and that could be very

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.089 
in Arkham Knight and that could be very
likely<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:42.930> at<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.140> same<00:02:43.349> time<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:43.769> could<00:02:43.980> be

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
likely but at the same time we could be

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.860 
likely but at the same time we could be
over<00:02:44.220> exaggerating<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.330> could<00:02:45.540> literally

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
over exaggerating and it could literally

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.289 
over exaggerating and it could literally
just<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.319> he<00:02:46.799> just<00:02:46.980> wants<00:02:47.310> Gotham<00:02:47.700> locked<00:02:47.940> down

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
just be he just wants Gotham locked down

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.940 
just be he just wants Gotham locked down
and<00:02:48.600> that's<00:02:48.870> operation<00:02:49.470> Saviour<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.769> that's

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and that's operation Saviour and that's

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.039 
and that's operation Saviour and that's
it<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> highly<00:02:51.150> doubt<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.720> think

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
it but I highly doubt that I think

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.330 
it but I highly doubt that I think
there's<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> lot<00:02:52.410> more<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.830> especially

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
there's a lot more to this especially

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.160 
there's a lot more to this especially
because<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.610> seems<00:02:53.790> very<00:02:53.910> cryptic<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.540> them<00:02:54.660> to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
because it seems very cryptic of them to

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.320 
because it seems very cryptic of them to
upload<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.830> picture<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.580> quote<00:02:56.940> out

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
upload this picture with this quote out

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.570 
upload this picture with this quote out

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
of nowhere they the facebook page does

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.059 
of nowhere they the facebook page does
usually<00:03:00.090> upload<00:03:00.330> quotes<00:03:00.750> but<00:03:01.319> they<00:03:01.860> all<00:03:02.040> seem

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
usually upload quotes but they all seem

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.800

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
