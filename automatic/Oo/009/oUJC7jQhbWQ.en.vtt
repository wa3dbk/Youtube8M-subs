point guard that's what I've played my
whole<00:01:36.880> life<00:01:37.120> but<00:01:37.690> I<00:01:37.750> know<00:01:38.230> and<00:01:38.620> I<00:01:38.680> think<00:01:38.740> I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
whole life but I know and I think I

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.730 
whole life but I know and I think I
could<00:01:39.130> play<00:01:39.220> know<00:01:39.760> many<00:01:40.030> other<00:01:40.240> positions<00:01:40.840> you

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
could play know many other positions you

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.080 
could play know many other positions you
know<00:01:41.860> on<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.160> floor<00:01:42.430> so<00:01:42.730> you<00:01:42.760> know<00:01:42.970> I<00:01:43.000> don't

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
know on the floor so you know I don't

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.610 
know on the floor so you know I don't
really<00:01:43.240> like<00:01:43.480> to<00:01:43.600> limit<00:01:43.750> myself<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.320> just

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
really like to limit myself to just

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.470 
really like to limit myself to just
being<00:01:44.800> a<00:01:44.950> point<00:01:45.130> guard<00:01:45.280> you<00:01:46.000> know<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.120> think<00:01:46.240> I

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
being a point guard you know I think I

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.060 
being a point guard you know I think I
could<00:01:46.540> play<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.960> three<00:01:47.290> or<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.470> floor<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.010> I

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
could play the three or the floor and I

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.410 
could play the three or the floor and I
think<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.370> shot<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.730> ball<00:01:48.880> pretty<00:01:49.090> well<00:01:49.330> this

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
think I shot the ball pretty well this

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.790 
think I shot the ball pretty well this
year<00:01:49.480> I<00:01:49.630> think<00:01:49.720> I<00:01:49.870> completed<00:01:50.200> two<00:01:55.710> passing<00:01:56.710> the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
year I think I completed two passing the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.040 
year I think I completed two passing the
ball<00:01:56.980> if<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:57.940> watch<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.240> lot<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.510> good<00:01:58.660> teams<00:01:58.900> in

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
ball if you watch a lot of good teams in

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.500 
ball if you watch a lot of good teams in
the<00:01:59.140> playoffs<00:01:59.530> this<00:01:59.710> year<00:01:59.940> they<00:02:00.940> do<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.150> very

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
the playoffs this year they do a very

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.940 
the playoffs this year they do a very
good<00:02:01.630> job<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:02.140> making<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:02.650> extra<00:02:02.830> pass

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
good job of making the extra pass

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.730 
good job of making the extra pass
sharing<00:02:03.730> the<00:02:03.850> ball<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:05.140> know<00:02:05.230> just<00:02:05.410> overall

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
sharing the ball you know just overall

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.470 
sharing the ball you know just overall
passing<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.220> ball<00:02:06.430> I<00:02:06.520> think<00:02:06.760> that's<00:02:06.940> know<00:02:07.330> one

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
passing the ball I think that's know one

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.590
