00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello there will be a speech today 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.960
 this box is easy from the company 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.530
 new 2014 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.599
 knife and vespa that with fright in translation from 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.680
 spanish means 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.470
 wasp let's say this is the same ontario 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.750
 rat 1 in common rat only with 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.019
 fraem varnish of a few changed 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.970
 blade geometry let's see my 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.130
 here is such a greenback 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.840
 my mind if you put two knives in so 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.270
 that's near the closed state they are 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.750
 practically will not differ well 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.280
 let's look at the knife in profile a 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.899
 vespa has a very thin profile on 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.059
 my opinion is more interesting more 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.850
 nice clip that is rearranged 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.390
 on all four sides as a frame 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.500
 we have a stainless stonvosh different here 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 we have g10 under g10 we are flush with you 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.489
 It is worth it now the steel liner I know, I can not see 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.350
 it is seen 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.239
 show me the same side ask 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.520
 forgiveness in commercial vice versa for a long time 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 did not shoot here you drive to that with the reverse 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.810
 side we have a flush liner team but 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.350
 we actually have 1 cogs 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.670
 in rats m5 cogs and there are four in total 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.439
 by force let's look at the blade itself 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.640
 here is the same sleeve as the rat 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.790
 here is such a blade profile 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.670
 the blade here is such a contour means the most 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.540
 a similar option is probably knives 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.409
 Victorianx 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.829
 and wenger is actually one of the most 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.220
 comfortable one of the most 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.790
 the correct forms of the blade 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.010
 these are the ones I used here because 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.470
 what is very convenient first is and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.810
 tum in the second it drop point and 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.430
 butts descents 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.800
 the main thing that I like the difference from rats 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.590
 and look here is powerful enough 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.780
 tip who does not know the characteristics 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.260
 This knife is a knife made in Taiwan 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.320
 from the same steel aus-8 and even on 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.070
 the same factory as the rat in the butt with us 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.410
 here with you 2 and 7 millimeters length 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:17.780
 Blade 89 millimeter lock enough 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.780
 powerful hard enough because it 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.330
 stainless steel manufacturer stated that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.130
 our weighs 125 grams I would like it 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.080
 check for that but really very 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.420
 fun well in my case it's 127 grams 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.760
 there may be an error in the scales 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.260
 a specific model I do not know is insignificant 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.200
 the knife is really very pleased 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.830
 I recently left my darling from 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.410
 knives 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.040
 I drove the car gerber gator made 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.500
 154 seeds with a similar geometry of the blade, he 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.190
 went to my friend andrew did not return 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.269
 my in the cradle show and steel index well there 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.920
 multi-way gas exchange for this is not 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.320
 I will tell in all details 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.720
 as for knives yes maybe 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.760
 surely someone will say that the knife is thin 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.580
 it will be convenient for me to work like a rat 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.170
 I completely agree with you but at the same time 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.670
 for all this one can wear 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.790
 more comfortable because it is flatter 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.769
 that's what he thinks about 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.230
 more interesting let's say this if you 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.640
 right handed carry it in that position yes and 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.070
 in principle, at least in this 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.959
 position then your jeans will be somewhat 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.150
 goals than you will wear on 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.010
 call even there and this plastic here but he 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.170
 rubs on both sides 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.220
 here everything is very comfortable to hold 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.750
 the knife is not 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.549
 I can not say that he is extreme 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.209
 a thin piece it is absolutely uncomfortable 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.700
 it will work quite well to work 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.530
 but the rats will do this trick on 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.860
 factory staging immediately 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.970
 moreover, according to the words, in general, we are not bad 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.910
 I will repeat again 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.260
 that the main thing is of course this one here 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.910
 powerful enough tip because 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.810
 literally last night we are not calling 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.630
 dragging 3 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.820
 asks the traffic policeman 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.740
 rat straighten blade centimeters game 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.930
 which means straighten well and so stubbornly 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.510
 bent them tried to open the door there are 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.270
 same such eccentrics here I think that here in 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.900
 principle can be the same but 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.870
 I got caught a little better 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.810
 almost the same 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.770
 sharpened on a solid four with a plus 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.870
 that's why here is such an interesting knife 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.090
 so I do not know if you can say that di si 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.980
 for foresters but something like that 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.920
 than i'm very welcome this is awesome 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.640
 a hole in which you can push 2 550 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.770
 paracord here well, in general, I was pleased with the knife 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.150
 In the hands of this held only the youngest 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.620
 brother deputy mosquito code but this one 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.110
 may not please me very much 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.120
 in fact the logo is nothing 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.260
 like it looks very cool that she 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.720
 on the blade 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.040
 what is on the box is impressive 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.780
 so here is such a leg 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.070
 hopefully you were interested in the video 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.070
 thank you all bye
