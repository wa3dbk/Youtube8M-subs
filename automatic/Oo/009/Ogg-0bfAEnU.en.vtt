00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.000
 this is the first type of speed camera that 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.639
 was used in Italy 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.200
 equipment is from 1962 and the 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.790
 car on which a fiat is installed 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.740
 124 of 1969 antonio d'ambrosio therefore 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.510
 already in the sixties began the 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.840
 police to use these tools 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.420
 yes indeed today the modern speed cameras 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.490
 they are tested and approved in 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.320
 laboratories that the various companies year 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.970
 extended also in Italy at the time instead 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.650
 this was not possible these are of 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.750
 German manufacture of the Ministry 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.790
 bought it mounted on the cars and us in 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.840
 effects we had to try like 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.670
 this one worked a system that 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.550
 still used today by the timekeepers 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.980
 current with the system attested status 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.559
 that is, the cable was stretched rather than 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.350
 earth is nailed with nails 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.629
 connected with this cable that allowed 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.019
 to be able to drive that car away 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.970
 is a speed camera that allowed you to 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.860
 calculate the car passing by 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.860
 tubes lent are from the sixties 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.390
 so what speed they did this is 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.820
 set for 120 kilometers per hour 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.650
 at that time they were already very high speeds 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.479
 what we used a lot though was 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.610
 this other equipment than an account 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.380
 and selector of vehicles allowed us to 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.750
 calculate in a given range of 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.520
 time how many vehicles passed and to which 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.229
 speed passed then yes 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.850
 classified the roads according to 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.369
 traffic and intervened with 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.549
 the appropriate signage on the front 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.360
 instead there is the classic machine 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.240
 photographic that still comes today 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.009
 used as a speed camera as he is 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 on the dashboard but then already at the time 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.950
 you have done so many fines over the years 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.840
 sixty 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.539
 we say that practically more than anything else 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.240
 they were experimenting for the new 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.850
 used to experiment I don't love 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.130
 in short, however, bad things began 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.890
 already approve these first types of way 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.509
 equipment and this fiat 124 is 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.579
 still in service so it never is 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.179
 was canceled by the use of the ministry 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.679
 interior 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.990
 in fact, I wanted to emphasize that 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.700
 this type of car is still in charge 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.280
 to the ministry therefore has equal dignity 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.350
 of modern cars can perform service 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.600
 traffic police like our cars 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.440
 modern and is still used today 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.140
 to carry out this it is 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.940
 physiologically we do not use it in the in 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.800
 modern traffic but we use it 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.030
 to do police services in these 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.530
 manifestations that in these 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.600
 events this type of vehicle 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.510
 still one of its features and here we are 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.400
 managed to give one more purpose to 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.780
 still being able to keep this alive 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.780
 the only specimen left to us
