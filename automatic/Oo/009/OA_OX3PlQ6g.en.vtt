00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
engines but the problem is even with the

says<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> cherokee<00:01:11.189> says<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> develops

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
says on the cherokee says it develops

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.810 
says on the cherokee says it develops
more<00:01:12.240> horsepower<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:13.260> 0<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.530> 60<00:01:13.920> s<00:01:13.979> 9<00:01:14.159> seconds

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
more horsepower but 0 to 60 s 9 seconds

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149 
more horsepower but 0 to 60 s 9 seconds
that's<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.360> slow<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> compact<00:01:16.680> car<00:01:16.920> right

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that's as slow as a compact car right

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.179 
that's as slow as a compact car right
now<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.530> better

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
now so you are you do have a better

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.210 
now so you are you do have a better
