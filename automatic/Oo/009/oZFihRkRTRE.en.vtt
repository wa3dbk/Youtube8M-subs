00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.789 
go right here it will get him to the
core<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:01.020> base<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
core and you have over the base and the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.139 
core and you have over the base and the
second<00:02:02.159> jump<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.850> dropped

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
second jump is going to be dropped

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.219 
second jump is going to be dropped
somewhere<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:06.509> Valkyries<00:02:07.049> are

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
somewhere here and the Valkyries are

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
somewhere here and the Valkyries are
gonna<00:02:07.350> make<00:02:07.560> their<00:02:07.860> way<00:02:08.129> through<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> base

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
gonna make their way through the base

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.290 
gonna make their way through the base
and<00:02:09.300> take<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.349> out<00:02:10.730> while<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.760> Queen<00:02:12.209> is

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
from the outside the fences so the plan

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.180 
from the outside the fences so the plan
is<00:02:15.569> very<00:02:15.720> simple<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.410> much<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.920> talk<00:02:17.129> about

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
is very simple not much to talk about

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
is very simple not much to talk about
let's<00:02:18.090> see<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:21.019> explain<00:02:22.019> some<00:02:22.260> more

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
let's see it and explain some more

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.030 
let's see it and explain some more
during<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.920> attack<00:02:24.379> so<00:02:25.379> here<00:02:25.650> goes<00:02:25.860> the

defenses<00:02:35.010> are<00:02:35.250> pretty<00:02:35.790> much<00:02:36.060> centered<00:02:36.660> and

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
defenses are pretty much centered and

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.570 
defenses are pretty much centered and

shooter<00:03:20.700> her<00:03:20.880> together<00:03:21.440> she<00:03:22.440> won't<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.769> much

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
shooter her together she won't have much

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.569 
shooter her together she won't have much
chance

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579
