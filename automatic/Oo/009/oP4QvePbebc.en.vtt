00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hey people what's up with you patrick 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.990
 atx gaming here and welcome 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.940
 to my next video today something 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.769
 other 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.049
 it's about the fifa points in ultimate 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.910
 Team this is something like a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.010
 tutorial i want to help you a bit 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.800
 or the truth about you 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.689
 the fifa points tell if he has such 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.279
 If you want to have fan points you have to have them 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.410
 buy for real money 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.230
 I mean that's okay in the end 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 would have to decide for yourself what you do 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.710
 Alternatively, you can also coin 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.020
 Playing by playing yourself sounds 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.300
 but I was logical to you today 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.100
 show is that the price of fifa 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.340
 points in relation to what you are on 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.989
 end does not get true some know 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.120
 what now come already but 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.960
 I would also like to be ignorant 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.300
 inform 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.340
 so please share this video with hearing 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.410
 your friends if you inform them 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.960
 would like to see her world like that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.670
 it can help a lot so that 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 The following example is with the prices 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.739
 from the season ticket that's why they are 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.170
 a bit lower than yours if you do not 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.339
 season ticket did change that though 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.860
 nothing to the result 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.470
 it looks at first glance higher 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.619
 the price the more fifa points so far 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.200
 correct but the relation to the price 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.400
 wrong front and back 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.040
 now a little explanation with 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.750
 a bit of mathematics I'll show you something 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.360
 I mean here is a table that I 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.890
 created with office lime alternatively 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.500
 also microsoft excel 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.600
 you see the fifa from left to right 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.240
 points then the price for this 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.960
 variant and then you see how much fifa 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.000
 Points you would get for a euro 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.920
 in the back there is still a ranking if 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.380
 they have a different currency or not 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.939
 The season ticket then adds these values 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.280
 in your own table 1 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.500
 you can see how it works when 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.960
 your the price per unit here one 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.689
 you want to find out euro then you have to 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.310
 share it through the fifa points like that 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.630
 back to the example and what we see 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.020
 here exactly the 2200 variant is totally 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.250
 overpriced with just under 20 euros on the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.140
 At first sight you might see it 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.300
 but not with a bit of mathematics 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.790
 it becomes clearer i think most 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.940
 buy a psn card for 20 euros 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.980
 and think 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.510
 boah gaal a possibility the full 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.150
 to exhaust the volume of the card 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.880
 three two one mine but you would have 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.200
 rather just once the 1050 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:30.550
 to get for 8 euros and the 1575 for 12 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.390
 euro that makes under the line 2625 coins 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.180
 for 20 euros compared to 2200 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.330
 offer are the whole 400 people the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.480
 you have almost three premium gold 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.000
 packs more so without the season ticket 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.090
 I think the same principle 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.170
 Just tried it yourself 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.090
 summarized one can say that 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.260
 if you want to invest 20 euros 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.690
 you should offer the 1050 and 1575 offer 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.610
 take and with everything over it that goes 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.280
 4600 offer 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.860
 Here you have the best price performance 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.290
 relationship so people we are almost 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.270
 At the end of this video here should be one 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.550
 to be little enlightenment to you before that 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.800
 save money pointlessly spend 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.360
 it provides you also were quiet table 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.300
 and look like you with yours 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.590
 can save investment best so 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.110
 in the end I can only say 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.670
 that I thank you for watching and 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.209
 I'm very happy about a thumbs up 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.640
 would 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.260
 if they do not would be even abonnent since 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.540
 It's nice if you continue to follow me 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.510
