software<00:00:07.140> from<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.830> mac<00:00:08.010> app<00:00:08.040> store<00:00:08.309> and

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
software from the mac app store and

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.509 
software from the mac app store and
today<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.139> be<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> utility<00:00:11.160> piece

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
today it's going to be a utility piece

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.789 
today it's going to be a utility piece
of<00:00:11.700> software<00:00:12.059> called<00:00:12.210> daisy<00:00:13.139> disk<00:00:13.530> now

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
of software called daisy disk now

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.430 
of software called daisy disk now
essentially<00:00:14.759> what<00:00:14.880> Daisy<00:00:15.089> this<00:00:15.330> does<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:16.199> as

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
essentially what Daisy this does is as

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.640 
essentially what Daisy this does is as
you<00:00:16.560> can<00:00:16.680> see<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.940> sees<00:00:18.570> all<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.199> mounted

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
you can see here it sees all the mounted

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.580 
you can see here it sees all the mounted
drives<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.580> Macintosh<00:00:21.060> hard<00:00:21.300> drive<00:00:21.570> my<00:00:22.199> even

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
drives the Macintosh hard drive my even

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.250 
drives the Macintosh hard drive my even
a<00:00:22.680> DVD<00:00:23.039> Drive<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> TRX<00:00:24.119> basic<00:00:24.900> training

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
a DVD Drive like the TRX basic training

a DVD Drive like the TRX basic training
DVD<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.859> even<00:00:26.760> my<00:00:27.029> mobileme<00:00:27.480> disc<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:29.390> besides

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
DVD and even my mobileme disc so besides

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.970 
DVD and even my mobileme disc so besides
that<00:00:30.510> too<00:00:30.779> when<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.500> today<00:00:31.710> is

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that too when we're going to do today is

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.200 
that too when we're going to do today is
we're<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> scan<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> folder<00:00:33.059> because

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
we're going to scan a folder because

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.700 
we're going to scan a folder because
it's<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.899> take<00:00:34.079> quite<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> bit<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.559> time

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
it's going to take quite a bit of time

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.240 
it's going to take quite a bit of time
to<00:00:35.520> scan<00:00:35.820> my<00:00:35.850> Macintosh<00:00:36.540> hard<00:00:36.989> drive<00:00:37.320> so

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
to scan my Macintosh hard drive so

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.549 
to scan my Macintosh hard drive so
essentially<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.300> Daisy<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.989> does<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.440> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
essentially what Daisy this does is it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.069 
essentially what Daisy this does is it
shows<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:41.129> nice<00:00:41.399> visual<00:00:42.079> representation

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
shows a very nice visual representation

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.799 
shows a very nice visual representation
of<00:00:43.260> hell<00:00:44.070> you're<00:00:44.340> using<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.879> disk<00:00:45.149> space<00:00:45.539> on

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
of hell you're using your disk space on

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.250 
of hell you're using your disk space on
the<00:00:46.379> drive<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:46.950> even<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> folder<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.450> stuff

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the drive or even on a folder so stuff

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.840 
the drive or even on a folder so stuff
like<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> tea<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.129> live<00:00:50.430> shows<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
like with the tea for live shows and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819 
like with the tea for live shows and
stuff<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.449> we've<00:00:51.840> record<00:00:52.289> stuff<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
stuff like that we've record stuff and

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.229 
stuff like that we've record stuff and
then<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.070> usually<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.370> QuickTime<00:00:53.879> movie

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
then there's usually a QuickTime movie

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.630 
then there's usually a QuickTime movie
that's<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> movies<00:00:55.410> folder<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.309> have

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that's in the movies folder and I have

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.349 
that's in the movies folder and I have
forgotten<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:58.579> empty<00:00:59.579> I'd<00:00:59.730> folder<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.210> it's

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
forgotten to empty I'd folder so it's

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.240 
forgotten to empty I'd folder so it's
probably<00:01:00.750> taking<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.590> space<00:01:01.920> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
probably taking up a bit of space and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.009 
probably taking up a bit of space and
I've<00:01:02.760> used<00:01:02.969> Daisy<00:01:03.239> disk<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.899> could

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I've used Daisy disk and as you could

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
I've used Daisy disk and as you could
see<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> Macintosh<00:01:04.949> hard<00:01:05.220> drive<00:01:05.430> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
see here on the Macintosh hard drive I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.630 
see here on the Macintosh hard drive I
now<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.600> almost<00:01:07.350> half<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:07.619> harddrive<00:01:08.280> free

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
now have almost half my harddrive free

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.780 
now have almost half my harddrive free
which<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:08.970> great<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.869> wasn't<00:01:10.790> wasn't

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
which is great because it wasn't wasn't

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.100 
which is great because it wasn't wasn't
anywhere<00:01:12.150> close<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.479> four<00:01:12.810> hundred<00:01:12.869> ninety

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
anywhere close to four hundred ninety

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
anywhere close to four hundred ninety
seven<00:01:13.590> gigs<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.920> were<00:01:14.100> free<00:01:14.400> before<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:15.000> so

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
seven gigs that were free before that so

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.230 
seven gigs that were free before that so
it's<00:01:15.840> good<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:17.130> try<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> utilize<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.939> space

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it's good to try to utilize your space

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.359 
it's good to try to utilize your space
especially<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:18.990> an<00:01:19.170> imac<00:01:19.350> which<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
especially if you have an imac which is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.219 
especially if you have an imac which is
an<00:01:20.490> internal<00:01:20.759> drive<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.330> quite<00:01:21.780> frankly<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
an internal drive that quite frankly is

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.219 
an internal drive that quite frankly is
a<00:01:22.320> pain<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.770> neck<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.330> upgrade<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.630> also

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
a pain in the neck to upgrade and also

from full shows like up here you can see
this<00:02:13.459> stuff<00:02:13.790> here<00:02:14.000> my<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.480> know<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:14.720> 700<00:02:15.230> I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
this stuff here my you know it's 700 I

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.440 
this stuff here my you know it's 700 I
mean<00:02:15.500> it's<00:02:15.620> averaging<00:02:16.100> at<00:02:16.250> least<00:02:16.459> half<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:17.090> gig

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
mean it's averaging at least half a gig

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.410 
mean it's averaging at least half a gig
so<00:02:18.440> what<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.220> would<00:02:19.430> do<00:02:19.520> is<00:02:19.670> obviously<00:02:19.790> go<00:02:20.209> into

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
so what I would do is obviously go into

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.070 
so what I would do is obviously go into
that<00:02:20.540> folder<00:02:20.750> I<00:02:20.930> don't<00:02:21.170> see<00:02:21.350> any<00:02:21.530> way<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.930> do

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
that folder I don't see any way to to do

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.840 
that folder I don't see any way to to do
that<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.560> can<00:02:24.709> even<00:02:24.800> preview<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:25.670> if<00:02:25.790> i

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
that and I can even preview it so if i

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.940 
that and I can even preview it so if i
wanted<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> preview<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.900> could<00:02:27.530> hit<00:02:27.680> preview

movie and see what projects I don't need

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.000 
movie and see what projects I don't need
I<00:03:50.630> know<00:03:50.810> that's<00:03:51.140> eating<00:03:51.380> up<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.560> lot<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:51.799> space

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
I know that's eating up a lot of space

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.390 
I know that's eating up a lot of space
but<00:03:52.250> that's<00:03:52.430> media<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.060> always<00:03:53.390> use<00:03:53.900> so

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
but that's media that I always use so

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.069 
but that's media that I always use so
it's<00:03:55.400> definitely<00:03:55.940> something<00:03:56.209> it's<00:03:56.510> nineteen

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
it's definitely something it's nineteen

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.289 
it's definitely something it's nineteen
dollars<00:03:57.260> 99<00:03:57.769> cents<00:03:58.280> which<00:03:58.730> is<00:03:58.880> very<00:03:59.060> expensive

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
dollars 99 cents which is very expensive

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.910 
dollars 99 cents which is very expensive
but<00:03:59.900> I<00:04:00.170> think<00:04:00.890> this<00:04:01.070> gives<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.609> a<00:04:01.820> very<00:04:02.420> good

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
but I think this gives you a very good

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.670 
but I think this gives you a very good
way<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:03.950> use<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.549> very<00:04:04.820> simple<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.660> it's<00:04:06.440> one

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
way to use this very simple and it's one

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.110 
way to use this very simple and it's one
of<00:04:06.769> those<00:04:06.829> things<00:04:06.890> once<00:04:07.370> you<00:04:07.459> start<00:04:07.670> using<00:04:07.850> it

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
of those things once you start using it

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.540 
of those things once you start using it
I<00:04:08.329> can<00:04:08.510> see<00:04:08.810> how<00:04:09.019> this<00:04:09.230> utility<00:04:09.830> can<00:04:10.129> be<00:04:10.280> very

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
I can see how this utility can be very

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.890 
I can see how this utility can be very
essential<00:04:10.940> and<00:04:11.239> if<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.450> have<00:04:11.540> more<00:04:11.720> than<00:04:11.780> one

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
essential and if you have more than one

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.449 
essential and if you have more than one
Mac<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.379> want<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.620> save<00:04:12.739> space<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.280> have<00:04:13.430> a

Mac you want to save space on I have a

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:13.870 
Mac you want to save space on I have a

pro<00:04:14.090> as<00:04:14.270> well<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.750> will<00:04:15.350> definitely<00:04:15.530> be<00:04:16.250> able<00:04:16.310> to

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
pro as well I will definitely be able to

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.370 
pro as well I will definitely be able to
use<00:04:16.640> this<00:04:16.820> on<00:04:17.030> both<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:17.750> essentially<00:04:18.200> it's

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
use this on both so essentially it's

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.720 
use this on both so essentially it's

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
like a universal app you can use it

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.790
