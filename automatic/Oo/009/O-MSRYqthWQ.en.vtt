00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 his goalkeeper involved in a strike 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.059
 then it usually rappels in its own 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.130
 housing so also went beckdorf stone 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.580
 theaters ball is a little 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.980
 Adversity His Power Could 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.830
 small faux pas but hardly diminish 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.660
 in the last part of the year against 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.119
 the handball friends jump in the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.279
 third handball league north developed 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.070
 the Latvian goalkeeper is already in 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.489
 the first half to the best man 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 he made the plate with 22 parades 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.230
 not only the sv beckdorf to the winner 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.719
 but also created a good mood 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.680
 the trainerbank 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.239
 he also stayed in last week 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.420
 flensburg requires self-confidence 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.170
 brought back and gets natural today 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.960
 Excellent because we have one for you 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.309
 Cover with theory and tim folk 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.350
 have a leg work in there 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.910
 Medium range afford that the throw 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.680
 also do not have many options 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.710
 that also has the combination today 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.180
 defense simply goalkeeper Voted 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.539
 Already at the beginning of the game was the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.790
 favorite role at the mountain villages the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.560
 guests from jump were rarely 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.610
 graduation 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.040
 and if they do have a chance 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.170
 earned denied them markus ball 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.200
 the goal cheers 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.590
 Barely was the ball stopped ringing 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.720
 it's already on the other side with 17 too 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.000
 13 guests were still in the break 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.350
 very well served 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.640
 So with the team effort can 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.920
 we be satisfied 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.600
 our goalkeeper super suited ours 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.670
 We worked hard at the defense 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.220
 was there that was great then 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.930
 We attacked quickly and without 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.399
 The things met as well as possible 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.549
 and the whole team also the gates 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.830
 scored well in the second half 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.500
 dominated the beckdorfer and fired 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.720
 from all the places next to the gates h 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.509
 put it on top of that for springers 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.460
 Circle runner Nicolas de France in the 40th 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.470
 minute still the red card the the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.270
 failed guests are still the crown 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.729
 touched as in the final phase hennig 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.479
 Wood and Christian with their gates 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.459
 The 35 24-victory clarification also disappeared 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.259
 the last jumper buggers 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.600
 the laugh 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.510
 We are already on the table 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.370
 favorite gone into the game though 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.620
 the springer on the highest budget of the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.299
 league and from there but not quite so 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.519
 clear that we so clearly win so 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.530
 We are happier that worked 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.209
 We already have and have confidence 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.400
 since the beginning of the season actually us 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.040
 worked out and that should be in the second half 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.060
 a clear success continues 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.799
 end of year 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.200
 and even if not everything is perfect 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.060
 is trainer lars there with one 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.470
 good feeling in the christmas break 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.989
 we have the best round here in 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.150
 Beck village recorded for years but we 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.159
 Also know where our problems still 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.140
 Lies we know have thin squad 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.970
 We know that we are still in touch 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.329
 work would have to turn off errors 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.780
 because he was certainly some games 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.400
 which one could have won where we were 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.769
 have left points where we exactly 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.200
 that did not translate what we do today 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.599
 have shown and so on 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.370
 We want the next step as 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.530
 I make team believe that we 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.819
 can grow together even stronger and 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.150
 if everyone does not pay either way 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.580
 intertwined like today also the 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.750
 case was then the way can at least 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.800
 do not lead down and we want 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.950
 internet will make you more together 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.950
 defend 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.170
 the short winter break does not leave much 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.300
 time to exercise 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.730
 already on the 12th of january the beckdorfer have to 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.770
 ran in GroÃŸburgwedel and then 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.000
 hopefully with such a strong one again 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.000
 us cinemas
