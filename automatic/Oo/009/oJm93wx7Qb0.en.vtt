00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
one that kind of I guess sort of a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.810 
one that kind of I guess sort of a
combination<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.750> experience<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.830> writing

it<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.210> also<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:47.820> one<00:03:48.820> that<00:03:48.970> kind<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.150> moves

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
it and also the one that kind of moves

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.230 
it and also the one that kind of moves
me<00:03:49.950> maybe<00:03:50.950> more<00:03:51.220> than<00:03:51.250> some<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.820> others<00:03:52.000> is

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
me maybe more than some of the others is

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.180 
me maybe more than some of the others is
um<00:03:52.630> it's<00:03:53.050> perfect<00:03:53.410> it's<00:03:53.680> not<00:03:53.770> called<00:03:54.010> perfect

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.340 
series of little things well over a long
period<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:29.050> time<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.730> I<00:04:30.730> think<00:04:31.120> it's<00:04:31.240> not<00:04:31.450> it's

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
period of time and I think it's not it's

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.560 
period of time and I think it's not it's
not<00:04:32.470> always<00:04:32.680> sensational<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.640> I<00:04:33.760> was<00:04:34.030> dramatic

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
not always sensational so I was dramatic

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.930 
not always sensational so I was dramatic
but<00:04:35.050> if<00:04:35.290> you<00:04:35.440> find<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:36.070> way<00:04:36.220> too<00:04:36.280> big<00:04:36.580> right

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
but if you find the way too big right

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.510 
but if you find the way too big right
now<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.510> keep<00:04:37.720> doing<00:04:38.080> that<00:04:38.230> that<00:04:39.160> leads<00:04:39.400> to

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
now you keep doing that that leads to

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.590 
now you keep doing that that leads to
more<00:04:39.760> things<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:40.300> you<00:04:40.570> get<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.750> do<00:04:40.990> more

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
more things that you get to do more

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.290 
more things that you get to do more
things<00:04:41.960> like<00:04:42.140> that<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:42.590> I<00:04:42.920> mean<00:04:43.610> it's<00:04:43.730> not<00:04:43.940> I

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
things like that so I mean it's not I

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.390 
things like that so I mean it's not I
don't<00:04:45.050> think<00:04:45.080> we<00:04:45.260> have<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.440> convince<00:04:45.800> God<00:04:46.160> to

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
don't think we have to convince God to

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.010 
don't think we have to convince God to
include<00:04:46.670> us<00:04:46.760> his<00:04:47.000> planet<00:04:47.420> and<00:04:47.570> God's<00:04:47.720> pretty

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
include us his planet and God's pretty

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.630 
include us his planet and God's pretty
convinced<00:04:48.380> about<00:04:48.470> that<00:04:48.800> in<00:04:49.100> doing<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.490> for

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
convinced about that in doing it for

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.550 
convinced about that in doing it for
thousands<00:04:49.970> of<00:04:50.000> years<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.420> think<00:04:51.170> all<00:04:51.290> we<00:04:51.410> need

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
thousands of years I think all we need

thousands of years I think all we need
to<00:04:51.590> do<00:04:51.740> is<00:04:51.860> just<00:04:51.890> do<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.940> things<00:04:53.120> that<00:04:53.210> he's
