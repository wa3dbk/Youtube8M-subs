 throughout the country and millions of viewers are waiting 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.920
 All too party this Alexander Poles 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 We meet I was engaged in skating 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.190
 sport and was in it a very successful sport 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.190
 threw when you talk motorcycle 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.990
 I understood that my parents didn't waste me 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.910
 forced to study music school 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.990
 to make music I decided to devote 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.990
 this whole life 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.750
 to uncover 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.810
 newbies 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.480
 he is worthy of all the same about 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.330
 go ahead and we have already decided 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.790
 I think so very pleased that 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.130
 Konstantin Meladze felt that I 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.200
 I wanted to say from the stage and what I got 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.360
 Konstantin Meladze perhaps it was 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.870
 the most positive the most unexpected 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.760
 emotions 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.579
 who survived so far on this project 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.140
 Alexander Balykov 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.470
 surprised with all his talent and he 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.540
 very very modest very me 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.980
 seems smart 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.700
 he would rather have a good taste 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.650
 all your energy to the audience load from the shoulders 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.650
 and then he let the producers decide 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:36.750
 Lift up your eyes to Make a Christmas 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:44.009

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.009

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.000

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.080

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.489

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.489

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.640
 since christmas 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.709
 instead of lying 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.650
 with us 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.840
 petals sang 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.000
 our but 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.489
 the truth 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.099
 love crazy 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.880
 Yes 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.569
 usa 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.870
 excerpt 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.100
 I put on 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.590
 better and 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.590
 everything 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.819
 Mad 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:20.249
 song is sung by alexander balyk 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:21.139
 he loved ecstasy it pleases but what 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.860
 will say 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:28.499
 real professionals we know well 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.509
 this song performed by alexander 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:33.509
 erased Sergei Mazaeva 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:36.330
 and in all texts interpretations there are much 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:39.809
 more everything is brutal there with the afterburner 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.710
 with a break like this shirt on chest 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:44.819
 aorta 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.879
 yes, and here I just liked it 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:52.339
 this benefit was all much softer and 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:55.080
 and in general, and this also has its meaning 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.979
 because the mood was created 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.120
 wonderful room 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:03.449
 wonderful couples of ages it all 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.849
 was somehow whole convincingly you 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.639
 Alexander not just sang well and you 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:11.279
 we were saved because last time 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.770
 when we evaluated previous singers and 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.889
 all and found and no one really could 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.620
 nothing to say i felt like on 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:24.330
 exam in roman korsakov where 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:27.629
 take vocalists and so already say 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:31.469
 you tell her that here you are Sergey Zakharov 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:34.860
 this is edward gil this is a mass of artists 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:39.899
 who were with us and whom we 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:42.899
 for some reason we lose and not and not in executable 

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:45.419
 by the way maybe this is the chance 

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:47.819
 by the way now I understand why 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.550
 did not want to say anything for the first time 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:53.279
 and why you want to admire the hour and even 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.199
 if the scarf were pink i would all 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:56.129
 it didn't scare you because 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.089
 really 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.689
 man singer and I wish you great 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:03.919
 of the future 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:08.189
 leps leave me alone man i axali 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:10.409
 corrected the scarf if you want to say 

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:12.569

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:16.399

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:22.649
 Konstantin Meladze 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:25.639
 Sasha brilliant just brilliant real 

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:29.129
 man and in essence and in form he 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:35.069
 coped with excitement sang better than 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:39.569
 rehearsals are more emotional and it seems to me 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:42.149
 Well, these artists are not enough for us 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:45.000
 I really enjoyed just moved here 

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:46.950
 Thank you, Sasha, well done 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.510
 Well, thanks to Alexander and the most 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.860
 time to remind that during the final in 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.860
 live and Yury Mikhailov
