00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
before that was a handheld spotlight but

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.319 
before that was a handheld spotlight but
I<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:33.720> -<00:01:35.090> it's<00:01:36.090> been

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
I have it up here on my - it's been

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:50.300 
I have it up here on my - it's been
sitting<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:36.720> about<00:01:36.990> five<00:01:37.229> minutes<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:49.310> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
sitting here about five minutes now it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.990 
sitting here about five minutes now it's
on<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.180> coming<00:01:51.479> on

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.060
