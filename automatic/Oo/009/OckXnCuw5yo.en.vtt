FIFA 13 yet to use him on this game he
seems<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.630> decent<00:01:03.810> player<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.650> he's<00:01:04.799> only

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
seems like a decent player and he's only

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.890 
seems like a decent player and he's only
21<00:01:05.220> years<00:01:05.339> old<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.759> well<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.150> we're<00:01:06.810> actually

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
21 years old as well so we're actually

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.420 
21 years old as well so we're actually
going<00:01:07.170> enough<00:01:07.409> better<00:01:07.590> quarters<00:01:08.009> wall<00:01:08.250> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
going enough better quarters wall so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.010 
going enough better quarters wall so
it's<00:01:08.520> no<00:01:08.610> real<00:01:08.759> orders<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.360> beam<00:01:09.900> I've

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
it's no real orders to this beam I've

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.210 
it's no real orders to this beam I've
seen<00:01:10.259> from<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> thumbnail<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:10.979> did<00:01:11.100> have

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
seen from the thumbnail we did have

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.039 
seen from the thumbnail we did have
Manuel<00:01:11.580> Neuer<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> other<00:01:12.929> one

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
Manuel Neuer and I think the other one

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.330 
Manuel Neuer and I think the other one
was<00:01:13.079> caught<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.649> well<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.009> you<00:01:14.070> know<00:01:14.189> they're

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
was caught as well so you know they're

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.830 
was caught as well so you know they're
going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.579> in<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.299> called<00:01:15.539> piece<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
going to be in this called piece of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.359 
going to be in this called piece of
video<00:01:16.079> so<00:01:16.320> next<00:01:16.859> play<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.039> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.249> be<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
video so next play is going to be a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
video so next play is going to be a
player<00:01:17.700> called<00:01:17.909> Christian<00:01:18.359> vanilla<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.899> he

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
player called Christian vanilla and he

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.840 
player called Christian vanilla and he
seems<00:01:19.649> tough<00:01:19.770> some<00:01:19.920> decent<00:01:20.249> stuffs<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.609> think

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
seems tough some decent stuffs I think

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.959 
seems tough some decent stuffs I think
he's<00:01:20.969> rated<00:01:21.179> around<00:01:21.570> about<00:01:21.689> 72<00:01:22.320> 72<00:01:22.920> 75<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:23.850> some

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
he's rated around about 72 72 75 or some

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.880 
he's rated around about 72 72 75 or some
other<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:24.600> he<00:01:24.840> gets<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> potential<00:01:25.560> around<00:01:25.710> by

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
other and he gets to potential around by

a status at all is that sir you can see

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:36.919 
a status at all is that sir you can see
us<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:35.909> because<00:01:36.030> he's<00:01:36.420> obviously<00:01:36.569> one<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
us that's because he's obviously one of

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.599 
us that's because he's obviously one of
the<00:01:37.020> biggest<00:01:37.259> players<00:01:37.469> in<00:01:37.679> the<00:01:38.100> world<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
the biggest players in the world one the

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.340 
the biggest players in the world one the
biggest<00:01:38.880> goal<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.149> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.359> world<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:39.719> he<00:01:40.170> gets

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
biggest goal is in the world and he gets

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.679 
biggest goal is in the world and he gets
to<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.499> potential<00:01:40.770> wait<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.429> 87<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.569> that's

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
to a potential wait for it 87 so that's

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.120 
to a potential wait for it 87 so that's
a<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:42.960> good<00:01:43.049> potential<00:01:43.319> gone<00:01:43.619> up<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.859> think

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
a really good potential gone up I think

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.489 
a really good potential gone up I think
+1<00:01:44.579> since<00:01:45.149> FIFA<00:01:45.329> 13<00:01:45.479> he's<00:01:45.810> got<00:01:45.929> good<00:01:46.049> diving

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
+1 since FIFA 13 he's got good diving

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.379 
+1 since FIFA 13 he's got good diving
good<00:01:46.920> kicking<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:47.520> basically<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:47.969> the<00:01:48.149> stats

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
good kicking but basically all the stats

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.419 
good kicking but basically all the stats
will<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.780> go<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.200> sorry<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.859> you<00:01:50.100> remember

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
will go up go up sorry and you remember

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.340 
will go up go up sorry and you remember
he<00:01:50.939> these<00:01:51.389> players<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.780> actually<00:01:51.990> I'll<00:01:52.109> pass

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
he these players can actually I'll pass

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.899 
he these players can actually I'll pass
also<00:01:52.740> word<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.249> they<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.490> grow<00:01:53.670> past

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
also word for it they can grow past

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.029 
also word for it they can grow past
their<00:01:54.149> potential<00:01:54.389> so<00:01:55.020> say<00:01:55.259> for<00:01:55.289> example<00:01:55.469> the

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
their potential so say for example the

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.129 
their potential so say for example the
hair<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.369> get<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> 87<00:01:57.060> he<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.630> well<00:01:57.780> easily

00:01:58.129 --> 00:01:58.139 
hair can get to 87 he can well easily

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:59.749 
hair can get to 87 he can well easily
get<00:01:58.319> to<00:01:58.409> 90<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:59.369> mean<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
get to 90 I really mean that

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.489 
get to 90 I really mean that
so<00:02:00.270> unless<00:02:00.479> we're<00:02:00.689> our<00:02:00.929> fourth<00:02:01.139> player<00:02:01.350> of

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
so unless we're our fourth player of

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.169 
so unless we're our fourth player of
this<00:02:01.649> episode<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.459> Diego<00:02:02.850> others

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
this episode is going to be Diego others

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.059 
this episode is going to be Diego others
I<00:02:03.359> was<00:02:03.780> thinking<00:02:04.079> he's<00:02:04.200> 28<00:02:04.469> years<00:02:04.560> old<00:02:04.799> he's

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
I was thinking he's 28 years old he's

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.800 
I was thinking he's 28 years old he's
not<00:02:05.219> gonna<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.490> too<00:02:05.579> good<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.789> potential<00:02:06.179> but

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
not gonna have too good of potential but

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.090 
not gonna have too good of potential but
goalkeepers<00:02:07.289> are<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.529> bit<00:02:07.709> different<00:02:07.889> because

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
goalkeepers are a bit different because

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.490 
goalkeepers are a bit different because
goalkeepers<00:02:08.850> don't<00:02:09.000> retire<00:02:09.240> turn<00:02:09.869> around<00:02:10.380> by

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
goalkeepers don't retire turn around by

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.250 
goalkeepers don't retire turn around by
36<00:02:11.039> 37<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.060> other<00:02:12.180> hand<00:02:12.360> plays<00:02:12.900> retire<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
36 37 on the other hand plays retire a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.110 
36 37 on the other hand plays retire a
couple<00:02:13.590> years<00:02:13.830> earlier<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.670> they<00:02:14.880> don't

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
couple years earlier so they don't

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.670 
couple years earlier so they don't
really<00:02:15.360> go<00:02:15.510> down<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:15.900> much<00:02:16.080> because<00:02:16.409> obviously

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
really go down as much because obviously

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.140 
really go down as much because obviously
they<00:02:16.950> don't<00:02:17.129> do<00:02:17.250> as<00:02:17.310> much<00:02:17.370> running<00:02:17.730> as<00:02:17.909> players

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
they don't do as much running as players

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.910 
they don't do as much running as players
and<00:02:18.420> they<00:02:18.870> don't<00:02:19.049> really<00:02:19.200> lose<00:02:19.349> anything<00:02:19.650> so

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
and they don't really lose anything so

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.250 
and they don't really lose anything so
that<00:02:19.980> kind<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> thing<00:02:20.459> if<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.640> know<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.790> mean

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
that kind of thing if you know I mean

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.470 
that kind of thing if you know I mean
so<00:02:21.530> his<00:02:21.620> potential<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.129> around<00:02:22.400> about<00:02:22.580> 86<00:02:23.060> 87

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
so his potential is around about 86 87

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.210 
so his potential is around about 86 87
which<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.840> really<00:02:24.080> good<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:24.379> well<00:02:24.890> he's<00:02:25.040> got

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
which is really good as well he's got

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.949 
which is really good as well he's got
really<00:02:25.400> good<00:02:25.519> reflexes<00:02:26.030> which<00:02:26.569> remember

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
really good reflexes which remember

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.750 
really good reflexes which remember
includes<00:02:27.349> 13<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:27.860> next<00:02:28.040> two<00:02:28.250> goalies<00:02:28.459> are

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
includes 13 so next two goalies are

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.670 
includes 13 so next two goalies are
gonna<00:02:29.150> be<00:02:29.269> first<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.780> Mosley<00:02:30.019> was<00:02:30.319> actually

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
gonna be first and Mosley was actually

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.500 
gonna be first and Mosley was actually
moved<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:30.890> athletic<00:02:31.400> um<00:02:31.519> druid<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:32.239> gala

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
moved from athletic um druid to gala

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.300 
moved from athletic um druid to gala
tesserae<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.930> think<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.260> was<00:02:33.409> and<00:02:33.860> this<00:02:34.069> player

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
tesserae I think it was and this player

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.130 
tesserae I think it was and this player
was<00:02:34.489> 87<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.180> our<00:02:35.299> second<00:02:35.659> goal<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.019> to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
was 87 and our second goal is going to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.930 
was 87 and our second goal is going to
be<00:02:36.170> really<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.830> he<00:02:37.040> plays<00:02:37.250> for<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.610> team<00:02:37.849> I

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
be really and he plays for a team I

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.059 
be really and he plays for a team I
can't<00:02:38.150> pronounce<00:02:38.330> but<00:02:38.690> he's<00:02:39.110> 21<00:02:39.560> years<00:02:39.830> old<00:02:39.950> he

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
can't pronounce but he's 21 years old he

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.100 
can't pronounce but he's 21 years old he
starts<00:02:40.459> off<00:02:40.549> around<00:02:40.849> boss<00:02:41.060> 68<00:02:41.599> I<00:02:41.720> think<00:02:41.959> he's

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
starts off around boss 68 I think he's

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.990 
starts off around boss 68 I think he's
and<00:02:42.590> he<00:02:42.799> gets<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.069> potential<00:02:43.430> run<00:02:43.610> but<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:43.910> a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
and he gets to potential run but it's a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.539 
and he gets to potential run but it's a
four-member<00:02:44.599> he<00:02:44.959> can<00:02:45.140> get<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.440> around<00:02:45.680> 86<00:02:46.069> 87

like him but in my opinion he's a great
goalie<00:04:04.160> used<00:04:04.730> him<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:04.940> couple<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.209> times<00:04:05.299> an

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
goalie used him a couple of times an

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.819 
goalie used him a couple of times an
awesome<00:04:05.840> team<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.139> he<00:04:06.200> seems<00:04:06.410> like<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.590> really

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829

Lee's gonna feature in today's episode
you've<00:04:12.200> probably<00:04:12.500> guessed<00:04:12.919> that<00:04:13.129> because<00:04:13.400> his

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
you've probably guessed that because his

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.000 
you've probably guessed that because his
potential<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.419> again<00:04:14.720> like<00:04:14.930> Poland<00:04:15.260> 87<00:04:15.829> that's

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
potential is again like Poland 87 that's

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.129 
potential is again like Poland 87 that's
just<00:04:16.220> insane<00:04:16.519> 20<00:04:17.209> years<00:04:17.479> old<00:04:17.630> goalkeepers

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
just insane 20 years old goalkeepers

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.719 
just insane 20 years old goalkeepers
were<00:04:18.349> obviously<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:18.919> he's<00:04:19.400> got<00:04:19.579> good

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
were obviously and he's got good

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.189 
were obviously and he's got good
goalkeeping<00:04:20.209> reflexes<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.870> don't<00:04:21.019> know<00:04:21.139> too

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
goalkeeping reflexes you don't know too

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.439 
goalkeeping reflexes you don't know too
many<00:04:21.410> of<00:04:21.560> us<00:04:21.680> that's<00:04:21.919> because<00:04:22.550> he's<00:04:22.669> only<00:04:22.820> 68

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
many of us that's because he's only 68

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.760 
many of us that's because he's only 68
or<00:04:23.599> some<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.050> which<00:04:24.229> is<00:04:24.260> really<00:04:24.620> low

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
or some like that which is really low

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.080 
or some like that which is really low
maybe<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.280> bit<00:04:25.460> higher<00:04:25.669> than<00:04:25.699> that<00:04:25.880> by

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
maybe a bit higher than that by

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.350 
maybe a bit higher than that by
roundabout<00:04:26.479> 60<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.110> about<00:04:27.139> 75<00:04:27.860> I<00:04:28.130> think<00:04:28.729> so<00:04:28.940> as

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
roundabout 60 to about 75 I think so as

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.209 
roundabout 60 to about 75 I think so as
I<00:04:29.419> said<00:04:29.719> his<00:04:29.840> potential<00:04:30.110> weighs<00:04:30.289> around<00:04:30.409> by<00:04:30.710> 87

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:31.219 
I said his potential weighs around by 87

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:32.920 
I said his potential weighs around by 87
so<00:04:31.430> when<00:04:32.000> this<00:04:32.090> goal<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:32.419> going<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:32.659> be<00:04:32.690> with

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
so when this goal is going to be with

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.029 
so when this goal is going to be with
Patricia<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.380> was<00:04:33.500> kind<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.680> looking<00:04:33.800> around

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
Patricia I was kind of looking around

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:34.430 
Patricia I was kind of looking around
from

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
from

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.990 
from
singing<00:04:34.680> where's<00:04:34.800> potential<00:04:35.250> was<00:04:35.400> yes<00:04:35.880> she

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
singing where's potential was yes she

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.300 
singing where's potential was yes she
starts<00:04:36.300> off<00:04:36.450> as<00:04:36.660> an<00:04:36.810> 81<00:04:37.290> and<00:04:37.710> he<00:04:37.920> gets<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.280> a

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
starts off as an 81 and he gets to a

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.910 
starts off as an 81 and he gets to a
potential<00:04:38.700> around<00:04:38.880> by<00:04:39.030> 85<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.690> 86<00:04:40.230> which<00:04:40.710> again

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
potential around by 85 to 86 which again

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.560 
potential around by 85 to 86 which again
is<00:04:41.070> fantastic<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.700> he's<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:41.850> bit<00:04:42.150> cheaper<00:04:42.480> as

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
is fantastic and he's a bit cheaper as

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.420 
is fantastic and he's a bit cheaper as
well<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.960> think<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.470> worth<00:04:43.620> around<00:04:43.830> about<00:04:44.160> 6

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
well I think is worth around about 6

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.430 
well I think is worth around about 6
million<00:04:44.640> which<00:04:44.850> is<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> bit<00:04:45.150> cheaper<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.630> he's

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
million which is a bit cheaper and he's

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.930 
million which is a bit cheaper and he's
won<00:04:46.620> those<00:04:46.740> players<00:04:46.950> which<00:04:47.130> will<00:04:47.340> surpass

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
won those players which will surpass

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.100 
won those players which will surpass
their<00:04:48.150> potential<00:04:48.420> you'll<00:04:48.690> get<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.930> around

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
their potential you'll get to around

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.380 
their potential you'll get to around
beta<00:04:49.320> 7<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.770> guess<00:04:50.010> so<00:04:50.640> on<00:04:50.790> this<00:04:50.910> goal<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.210> going

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
beta 7 I guess so on this goal is going

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.180 
beta 7 I guess so on this goal is going
to<00:04:51.450> be<00:04:51.510> cool<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.780> are<00:04:51.960> on<00:04:52.200> live<00:04:52.650> from<00:04:52.740> Chelsea<00:04:53.160> I

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
to be cool to are on live from Chelsea I

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.370 
to be cool to are on live from Chelsea I
think<00:04:53.460> once<00:04:53.640> he's<00:04:53.940> back<00:04:54.180> at<00:04:54.300> Chelsea<00:04:54.660> check

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
think once he's back at Chelsea check

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.720 
think once he's back at Chelsea check
one<00:04:55.530> be<00:04:55.650> used<00:04:55.830> too<00:04:55.950> much<00:04:56.070> in<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.310> future<00:04:56.610> maybe
