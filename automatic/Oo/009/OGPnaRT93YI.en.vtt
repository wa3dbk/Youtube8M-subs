00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.259
 I like to read I love books 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.910
 I have the library full of books 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.560
 that are stacked on their shelves in 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.179
 horizontal vertical shape shot 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.030
 I like the other one very much 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.009
 stephen king master stephen king I have everything 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.139
 a shelf over which he no longer enters 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.210
 that already overflows and I like comics 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.779
 I was reading a little bit too 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.300
 a lot of girls I was reading 12 and people 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.910
 to see also before that he lives from 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 vendetta watchmen when he was younger 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.390
 I read allan poe I like ray bradbury 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.059
 I also read from a very young age I write 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.850
 from a very young and currently my work 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.649
 it's based on writing I write scripts like that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.300
 that I'm reading all day or 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.070
 writing substitute of the day in the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.020
 collective trains reading something 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.789
 again I just run out of a book I buy 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 a new one a comic or whatever it is always 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.750
 I'm reading something I really prefer 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 read that listening to music with my 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.949
 headphones this prelude comes to that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.620
 it seems that it is fashionable that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.750
 youtubers take out books I take out the book 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.329
 'the blonde I think was the first in the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.689
 book that troll I think it's called 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.830
 and then they pulled out several more joists 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.600
 willy rex auron play vi he got one 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.970
 I think that I do not get the name of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.130
 the girl the Spanish blogger 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.950
 Make yourself eyes forget me the name even 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.890
 we have here to 46 who took out his facebook 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.869
 here in argentina and I really see everything 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.630
 that led me to ask me if it's okay 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.869
 that these books come out or not sincerely 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.970
 I did not read any, there would not be any and I would not 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.619
 I can judge them why if I had read 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.090
 Someone would judge him, he would say yes 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.500
 it seemed good it seemed bad to me 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.210
 I remember when I worked in the shop and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.039
 in the toy store several years ago 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.659
 it was fashionable cumbio and had taken a 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.850
 book that I took that was a failure 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.399
 really because the floggers were not going to 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.409
 read it and the question is it 's fine that 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.640
 the youtubers take out books are fine 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.300
 those books are good or they're done 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.280
 simply because of selling something 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.620
 for the fact of saying if I took out a book 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.590
 and the content is null 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.480
 I repeat I did not read any so maybe 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.100
 some of those books that I named are 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.540
 well that's why I have the benefit of 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.160
 I doubt I keep the benefit of the doubt 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.480
 I'm not generalizing, I'm not 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.280
 saying that everyone is bad 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.080
 misunderstand there are cases that books 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.950
 maybe they are not so good but 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.700
 encourage children to start reading 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.830
 Nowadays , the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.930
 teen literature all those sagas 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.200
 of the hunger games before that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.780
 it was twilight and good 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.000
 mayweather and all those and it seems to me that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.890
 those books if they are good pulling 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.300
 'twilight' the rest yes it seems to me that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.340
 yes they are fine because they lead to a 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.170
 boy start reading with that already 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.310
 from there he starts to read other things 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.860
 Over there 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.140
 reading the games the hunger shoots them 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.470
 to battle royal and they start reading the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.349
 manga battle royal and that shoots them to 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.120
 the long march of stephen king and he 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.980
 put to read the long march stephen 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.959
 king who go more or less about the same 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.700
 Thematic is hooked with Stephen Kim 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.530
 they start reading and then they come to another 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.660
 author and so but really the youtubers 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.519
 everyone who took out books did it 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.110
 to tell a story really what 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.510
 they did to collaborate with the 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.910
 literature they did so in order that 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.400
 to promote reading or they did 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.829
 just to fill your pockets 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.959
 they have a story to tell or 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.760
 they are books that tell something they are books 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.730
 that promote something or are books 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.069
 holes simply for the sake of saying 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.349
 If I have a book and you sell a book 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.360
 how they sell you a shirt as they sell you 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.530
 a pin as they sell you a poster I'm not 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.720
 saying that all books have to 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.269
 be profound literature that talks about 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.909
 life and about death and I make you 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.239
 think side because junk literature 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.799
 sometimes also it serves comics are 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.650
 well I love kick-ass for 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:53.609
 example in girls is a super content 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.140
 violent super grotesque from people 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.359
 that each shot if they appear 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.940
 quartered and there are decapitations and 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.530
 all that kind of things I love and I do not 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.720
 it's classic literature that's my 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.090
 reflection of today 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.740
 I would like you to tell me that 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.970
 think if they had opportunities to 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.200
 read any of these books and 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.390
 it seemed that it is good is that they 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.250
 it seemed that it brings something or they seemed 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.519
 entertaining he found books 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.350
 elaborated and hood that justify that 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.579
 opinion and I would also like that 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.260
 answer if you had the 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.590
 opportunity wrote a book what kind 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.230
 book would be something romantic or something 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.850
 suspense of terror a phrase book a 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.530
