you can going straight up it doesn't it
doesn't<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.720> matter<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.260> point

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
doesn't really matter at this point

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.520 
doesn't really matter at this point
because<00:01:07.850> here<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.600> most<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.380> than
