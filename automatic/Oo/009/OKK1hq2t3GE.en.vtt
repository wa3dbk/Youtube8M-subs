00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
maybe the last time we played and I just

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.599 
maybe the last time we played and I just
knew<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.590> there<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:19.920> something<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.460> I

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
knew that that there is something that I

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.330

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
know and that's a good thing because I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.959 
know and that's a good thing because I
have<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.449> lot<00:00:57.660> more<00:00:57.690> matches<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:59.550> play

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
have a lot of a lot more matches to play

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.779 
have a lot of a lot more matches to play
that<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.899> always<00:01:01.170> improve<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.550> was

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that I can always improve but it was

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.270 
that I can always improve but it was
pretty<00:01:03.030> good<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.830> said<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
pretty good you know it's as I said it's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.100 
pretty good you know it's as I said it's
important<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.030> such<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> challenge<00:01:06.900> at

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
important to have such a challenge at

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.950 
important to have such a challenge at
the<00:01:07.260> beginning<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.659> it<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.780> good

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the beginning you know and it was good

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530 
the beginning you know and it was good
for<00:01:10.110> me<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> felt<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.970> things<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.420> I've

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
for me I felt like the things that I've

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.560 
for me I felt like the things that I've
been<00:01:12.750> working<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.290> are<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:15.090> they

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
been working on are there there they

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.090 
been working on are there there they
could<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.900> better<00:01:16.110> also<00:01:16.439> with<00:01:16.799> playing

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
could be better also with playing

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.130 
could be better also with playing
matches<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.700> getting<00:01:17.970> into<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> competitive

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
matches and getting into the competitive

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.190 
matches and getting into the competitive
groove<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.299> happy<00:01:21.600> where<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:21.990> right

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
groove but I'm happy where I'm at right

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:32.920 
groove but I'm happy where I'm at right
now<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:29.600> think<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.960> completely<00:01:31.170> different<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
now I think is completely different and

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.840 
now I think is completely different and
well<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.140> mean<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.189> take<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
well I mean I don't really take it that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.660 
well I mean I don't really take it that
way<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.380> cannot<00:01:37.590> compare<00:01:38.100> two

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
way you know you cannot compare two

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
way you know you cannot compare two
players<00:01:38.970> even<00:01:39.299> though<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.570> hit<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.409> ball

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
players even though they hit the ball

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.889 
players even though they hit the ball
hard<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.430> gonna<00:01:41.579> become<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.450> way<00:01:42.600> completely

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
hard it's gonna become my way completely

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.310 
hard it's gonna become my way completely
different<00:01:43.470> game<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> good<00:01:45.320> good

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
different game but it was a good good

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.730 
different game but it was a good good
first<00:01:46.700> task<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.820> me

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.319 

I<00:01:56.439> actually<00:01:57.549> don't<00:01:58.549> really<00:01:59.000> look<00:01:59.119> at

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
I actually don't really look at

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.810 
I actually don't really look at
defending<00:01:59.960> anything<00:02:00.200> I'm<00:02:01.040> just<00:02:01.100> looking<00:02:01.790> to

defending anything I'm just looking to

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.200 
defending anything I'm just looking to
