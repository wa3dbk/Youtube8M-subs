 Today I want to show you which 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.290
 different types of gate closures 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.150

 Click or the link in the video 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.960
 description will follow so i will now 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.000
 as always with the control of the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.100
 different types start afterwards 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 I'll show you related examples 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.420
 and then there are the perfect tips 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.399
 easy and successful to score goals 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
 I think you all know that he is with the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.059
 left stick aims keep the left 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.309
 stick as long as you want 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.770
 direction until the ball is the foot of a ball 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.480
 player has left beyond that 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.280
 could the force of the shot with the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 Duration of printing the shot button 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.210
 define the longer she pushes the more 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.800
 harder and higher will be the shot this 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.320
 otherwise applies to all types of 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.670
 Complete a normal powerful 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.010
 shot could with the press of the b 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.200
 key on the xbox and the circle button 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.720
 Run on the playstation if you like 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.460
 while rb on the xbox and he once on 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.409
 the playstation keeps you going 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.299
 cut shot the so-called 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.490
 finesse shot and if you older on 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.610
 the xbox or l 2 on the playstation 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.780
 think he makes a trick shot 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.790
 For example, a case where adorn 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.009
 in addition, could lupfer out 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.290
 lead by lb on the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.790
 xbox and l1 on the playstation at 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.070
 Press the key to hold 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.170
 So you see there are different types 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.780
 of conclusions and this I show you 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.340
 now with a few examples of 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.470
 normal shot is the easiest and 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.030
 most powerful new player will be in 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.729
 then shoot with his foot 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.290
 if the ball is not too high 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.570
 the ball is in the air it stops 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.850
 on whether he is a volley or a header 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.040
 Of course everything depends on that 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.720
 situation but this conclusion art 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.909
 especially useful if you with 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.530
 wanted to complete a lot of strength this 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.110
 is especially suitable for long-distance shots 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.240
 if you have a tutorial for fans 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.189
 I am interested in this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.840
 tutorial here in the heart simply the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.310
 Click on the screen or the link in 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.709
 follow the video description 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.540
 sometimes it is better with one 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.239
 to act more precisely 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.219
 here the Treasury offers itself with help 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.870
 that could make the ball wonderful around the ball 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.000
 keeper and just like me 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.340
 There is also a special one 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.180
 tutorial you know we are coming there 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.370
 have fun with it 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.180
 A swab is also a good one 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.040
 option 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.450
 this offers itself when the goalkeeper 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.609
 something stands in front of his gate or 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.980
 Come out here I can give you 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.870
 give a good tip if you sideways 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.329
 running towards the gate offers a 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.010
 lupfer perfect if he is correct 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.689
 Timed is the keeper stands 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.730
 usually at the short post and 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.170
 thus could the ball be beautiful in the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.480
 sink long corner 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.250
 A challenging way to aim at goal 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.109
 but in my eyes a very 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.599
 more effective if you have the right timing 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.700
 Last but not least, there are still some 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.349
 the special shots for example one 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.659
 flying-headball as seen here 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.700
 but also if you have fallen and 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.950
 so on are possible a nice one 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.870
 feature now i will focus on 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.879
 Simple gates set many of you 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.349
 Wanted a few tips about this and these 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.750
 I will show you now 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.340
 my first tip looks like if you 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.319
 in the middle of the gate and hers 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.940
 Goalkeeper opposite makes one 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.220
 little step to the side before you 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.930
 completes load in sprint rast off 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.609
 move the left stick to the side 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.209
 step and shoot the ball 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.190
 purely 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.510
 for some reason, these go 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.120
 high probability shots 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.919
 always another thing would be the net 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.310
 her just tapped the shot button 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.690
 this will make you a low shot 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.190
 really just tap the shot button 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.930
 and do not aim to press the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.849
 shoulder buttons and so on and then 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.019
 Do you also have a safe variant around 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.849
 to score a goal 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.560
 in situations where he is laterally on the 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.359
 I have personally reached the gate 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.669
 experience made that the conclusion in 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.319
 the longest corner is most effective when 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.359
 you have a powerful player through 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.109
 Just the shot button and aim 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.879
 in the long corner 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.650
 and if you have a player the ball 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.090
 You can do this well, too 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.919
 Loosen with a fine shot 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.870
 a general tip when you are straight ahead 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.030
 to the gate to still would be natural 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.099
 Always close in the corner where 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.349
 the strong foot of your player is located 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.239
 is he right foot shoots in the 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.430
 right corner and if he is left footed 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.169
 do the opposite if you do it then 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.880
 still used the finesse shot increased 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.419
 the effect of the ball around the keeper 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.120
 scoop 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.860
 if he wants that then I still have 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.110
 a tip re flank 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.740
 if he makes a flank no matter if 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.419
 with the head 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.000
 or with the foot always shoots in the 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.130
 corner from where the flank comes from 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.349
 that is always contrary to the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.449
 Completing directional goalkeeper 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.030
 that's super effective and I can do it 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.190
 Generally only friends like that 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.840
 That's it for today if it was 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.370
 you liked it then let one 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.560
