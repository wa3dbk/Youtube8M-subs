00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.080
 we are going to prepare Swedish cake and that she dares 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.230
 the ingredients we need are bread 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.049
 Swedish round mustard sweet gherkins 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.450
 pickles salmon caviar substitute 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.529
 smoked and cream cheese type 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.230
 philadelphia normal or with herbs and 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.230
 let's start placing in our 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.939
 round bread on a plate that you see 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.490
 we have bought in the store 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.200
 ikea feed and that if you do not 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.450
 we always find easily 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.280
 we can substitute for the typical bread 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.010
 Swedish rectangular that they sell in 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.840
 any supermarket and we can do 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.820
 the pie instead of round shape 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.280
 rectangular the rest of the ingredients 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.789
 although we bought in the ikea 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.739
 They are also very easy to find 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.180
 we cover the round bread with a first 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.480
 thin layer of cream cheese in this case 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.239
 it is of normal flavor 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.050
 and we are going to place the minitas of 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.400
 sweet pickled gherkin 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.400
 for the whole cake 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:17.160
 we put a first layer of salmon 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.160
 smoked let's cover completely 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.700
 and we are going to continue with a second layer 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.100
 to which we are going to spread a little 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.710
 sweet mustard herbs that also 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.780
 we bought at the ikea store but 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.759
 that you can replace with a mustard 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.450
 sweet from the one they sell at any 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:41.570
 supermarket we ask generously 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.570
 to then turn it around 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.630
 we place well and now anoint again 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.900
 on the other side another layer of cheese 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.050
 philadelphia 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.210
 us half of coverage more or 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.280
 least we were a bit scarce like this 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.230
 that we took a pot of cheese from 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.200
 herbs that also gives a very 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.270
 special and he's doing very well with this what 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.090
 what we're going to get is that the bread with 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.020
 the passage of time will soften a 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.720
 little bit and stay tender and tasty 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.360
 palate we are covering again with 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.120
 sheets of smoked salmon but this time 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.390
 dropping by the edges to cover 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.580
 our cake 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.740
 we cover it completely and 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.230
 generously because that's how 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.150
 we will achieve an optimal result of 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.459
 taste 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.390
 finally we are going to decorate it with a 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.329
 little bit of chopped dill and substitute 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.159
 of caviar we put it in the center but 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.430
 you can put it as you want 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:48.340
 You can even put balls around 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.519
 of the pie to divide the portions 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.609
 what are you going to cut and ready we have 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.409
 our Swedish cake and that has you like 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.150
 you see is nothing but an inspiration with 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.280
 the ingredients they sell in the store 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.829
 of ikea but that we can reproduce in 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.560
 house with some ingredients bought in 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:09.099
 the supermarket same or very similar 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.129
 the result is canapÃ© type but 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.889
 much more juicy is very easy to 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.739
 do a lot and it's ideal for 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:21.900
 parties or meetings and of course os 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.900
 I assure that it is delicious
