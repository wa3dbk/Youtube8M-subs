wheels<00:03:42.720> there's<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.590> clever<00:03:43.800> rubber<00:03:44.160> which

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
wheels there's the clever rubber which

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.509 
wheels there's the clever rubber which
is<00:03:44.970> held<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.330> by<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.570> design<00:03:46.080> of<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.320> wheel

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
is held in by the design of the wheel

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.860 
is held in by the design of the wheel
well<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.640> best<00:03:47.820> way<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.000> show<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.420> model<00:03:48.750> is

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
well the best way to show this model is

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.210 
well the best way to show this model is
to<00:03:48.989> show<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.440> going<00:03:49.800> around<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:50.130> little

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
to show you it going around a little

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.830 
to show you it going around a little
test<00:03:50.550> track<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.180> other<00:03:51.300> very<00:03:51.690> good

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
test track and the other very good

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.570 
test track and the other very good
aspect<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:52.470> model<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.160> makes<00:03:53.310> a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
aspect of this model is it makes a

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.520 
aspect of this model is it makes a
whirring<00:03:54.060> sound<00:03:54.090> as<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.720> goes<00:03:54.959> around<00:03:55.110> that's

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
whirring sound as it goes around that's

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.110 
whirring sound as it goes around that's
I<00:03:55.709> don't<00:03:55.769> know<00:03:55.950> whether<00:03:56.130> it's<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> gears<00:03:56.640> but

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
I don't know whether it's the gears but

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.490 
I don't know whether it's the gears but
anyway<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.420> does<00:03:57.540> sort<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.870> sound<00:03:58.110> like<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
anyway it does sort of sound like the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.160 
anyway it does sort of sound like the
turbine<00:03:58.890> spinning<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.519> I<00:04:00.300> quite<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
turbine spinning and I quite like the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.110 
turbine spinning and I quite like the
sound<00:04:01.410> that's<00:04:01.739> made

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.490 

to<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.239> honest<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.569> feel<00:04:09.750> both<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.200> these<00:04:10.260> models

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
to be honest I feel both of these models

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.559 
to be honest I feel both of these models
that's<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> power<00:04:11.400> Thomas<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.030> this<00:04:12.150> jet<00:04:12.390> one

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
that's the power Thomas and this jet one

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.509 
that's the power Thomas and this jet one
really<00:04:13.290> needed<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.620> better<00:04:13.800> gearing<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.400> give

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
really needed a better gearing to give

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.589 
really needed a better gearing to give
them<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.640> little<00:04:14.790> bit<00:04:14.879> more<00:04:15.030> speed

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
them a little bit more speed

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.120 
them a little bit more speed
personally<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.079> come<00:04:16.320> in<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.560> as<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.739> better<00:04:16.889> top

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
personally I come in it as a better top

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.979 
personally I come in it as a better top
speed<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.850> change<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.239> gear<00:04:18.510> ratios

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
speed and change the gear ratios

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.620 
speed and change the gear ratios
especially<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.919> power<00:04:20.190> thomas<00:04:20.609> is<00:04:20.790> crawling

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
especially that power thomas is crawling

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.360 
especially that power thomas is crawling
along<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:22.260> think<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.500> snail<00:04:22.770> will<00:04:22.889> be<00:04:22.979> faster

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
along I think a snail will be faster

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.430 
along I think a snail will be faster
than<00:04:23.490> him<00:04:23.669> but<00:04:24.030> anyway<00:04:24.360> maybe<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.110> them

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
than him but anyway maybe you like them

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.230 
than him but anyway maybe you like them
to<00:04:25.590> crawl<00:04:25.800> along<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.040> speed<00:04:26.490> he<00:04:26.669> told<00:04:26.940> me<00:04:27.060> he

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
to crawl along the speed he told me he

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.360 
to crawl along the speed he told me he
liked<00:04:27.419> them<00:04:27.600> fast<00:04:27.840> or<00:04:28.110> slow

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.280 

[Music]

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
[Music]

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.330 
[Music]
now<00:04:38.290> it's<00:04:38.470> time<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.830> have<00:04:38.920> a<00:04:38.950> little<00:04:39.010> bit<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.280> a

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
now it's time to have a little bit of a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.980 
now it's time to have a little bit of a
peek<00:04:39.580> into<00:04:39.760> how<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.030> opening<00:04:40.510> sequence<00:04:40.900> is

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
peek into how the opening sequence is

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.110 
peek into how the opening sequence is
made<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.860> call<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:42.250> foul<00:04:42.520> reel<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.970> can

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
made and I call it a foul reel you can

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.940 
made and I call it a foul reel you can
call<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.390> whatever<00:04:43.510> you<00:04:43.690> want<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.260> this<00:04:44.740> way

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
call it whatever you want and this way

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.800 
call it whatever you want and this way
you<00:04:45.010> get<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.340> see<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:46.120> little<00:04:46.360> tricks<00:04:46.600> that<00:04:46.750> I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
you get to see the little tricks that I

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.020 
you get to see the little tricks that I
do<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:47.290> pull<00:04:47.560> stuff<00:04:47.770> off<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.190> basically<00:04:48.550> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
do to pull stuff off and basically the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.600 
do to pull stuff off and basically the
video<00:04:49.150> is<00:04:49.510> sped<00:04:49.780> up<00:04:49.810> by<00:04:50.200> three<00:04:50.500> times<00:04:50.770> so<00:04:51.460> it's

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
video is sped up by three times so it's

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.430 
video is sped up by three times so it's
three<00:04:51.850> times<00:04:52.030> faster<00:04:52.540> than<00:04:52.690> normal<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.230> I

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
three times faster than normal and I

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.690 
three times faster than normal and I
kept<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.800> audio<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.130> love<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.580> little

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
kept the audio I love that little

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.790 
kept the audio I love that little
whirring<00:04:55.330> sound<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:55.840> that's<00:04:55.900> double<00:04:56.410> speed

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
whirring sound and that's double speed

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.140 
whirring sound and that's double speed
that<00:04:57.220> you're<00:04:57.370> hearing<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.670> little<00:04:57.760> whirring

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
that you're hearing a little whirring

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.090 
that you're hearing a little whirring
sound<00:04:58.360> getting<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:58.840> made<00:04:59.050> sure<00:04:59.320> that<00:04:59.620> when<00:04:59.950> you

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
sound getting I made sure that when you

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.890 
sound getting I made sure that when you
heard<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.460> jitter<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:00.850> get<00:05:01.030> was<00:05:01.150> far<00:05:01.360> away<00:05:01.450> it

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
heard the jitter to get was far away it

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.870 
heard the jitter to get was far away it
was<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.470> sound<00:05:02.680> as<00:05:02.890> if<00:05:03.010> it<00:05:03.100> was<00:05:03.220> far<00:05:03.430> away<00:05:03.670> it

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
was the sound as if it was far away it

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.730 
was the sound as if it was far away it
was<00:05:03.910> up<00:05:04.210> close<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.840> was<00:05:04.990> nice<00:05:05.170> and<00:05:05.200> loud<00:05:05.470> and<00:05:05.650> up

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
was up close it was nice and loud and up

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.620 
was up close it was nice and loud and up
close<00:05:06.010> and<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:06.610> put<00:05:06.760> them<00:05:06.820> a<00:05:06.910> few<00:05:07.090> sound<00:05:07.330> effects

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
close and I put them a few sound effects

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.540 
close and I put them a few sound effects
along<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.930> way<00:05:08.050> as<00:05:08.170> well<00:05:08.380> more<00:05:09.010> of<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:09.220> comic

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
along the way as well more of a comic

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.180 
along the way as well more of a comic
type<00:05:09.940> sound<00:05:10.300> effect<00:05:10.600> than<00:05:10.780> an<00:05:11.290> actual<00:05:11.620> one<00:05:11.950> I

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
type sound effect than an actual one I

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.490 
type sound effect than an actual one I
think<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.790> Golden<00:05:13.120> Rule<00:05:13.150> when<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.050> do<00:05:14.140> a<00:05:14.230> toy

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
think the Golden Rule when I do a toy

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.080 
think the Golden Rule when I do a toy
review<00:05:14.530> and<00:05:15.250> this<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.520> something<00:05:15.700> I<00:05:15.880> want<00:05:16.030> to

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
review and this is something I want to

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.000 
review and this is something I want to
stick<00:05:16.300> by<00:05:16.480> is<00:05:16.990> want<00:05:17.170> to<00:05:17.260> make<00:05:17.410> sure<00:05:17.560> first<00:05:17.830> off

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
stick by is want to make sure first off

some of the the bad elements in
something<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:37.990> that's<00:05:38.290> really<00:05:38.470> important<00:05:38.890> to

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
something and that's really important to

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.770 
something and that's really important to
understand<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:40.000> I'll<00:05:40.120> show<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.390> the<00:05:40.570> little

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
understand and I'll show you the little

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.840 
understand and I'll show you the little
end<00:05:41.020> sequence<00:05:41.500> and<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.860> paths<00:05:42.280> that<00:05:42.580> go<00:05:42.640> to

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
end sequence and the paths that go to

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.460 
end sequence and the paths that go to
make<00:05:43.060> it<00:05:43.210> up<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.660> what's<00:05:43.840> really<00:05:44.020> important

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
make it up and what's really important

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.140 
make it up and what's really important
to<00:05:44.500> understand<00:05:44.950> here<00:05:45.250> is<00:05:45.310> first<00:05:45.880> off<00:05:46.030> the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
to understand here is first off the

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.390 
to understand here is first off the
video<00:05:46.390> is<00:05:46.660> sped<00:05:47.169> up<00:05:47.200> so<00:05:48.010> we're<00:05:48.130> dealing<00:05:48.370> with

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
video is sped up so we're dealing with

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.460 
video is sped up so we're dealing with
little<00:05:48.880> tiny<00:05:49.120> increments<00:05:49.570> of<00:05:49.660> time<00:05:49.840> but<00:05:50.350> also

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
little tiny increments of time but also

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.430 
little tiny increments of time but also
to<00:05:50.620> keep<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.919> edits<00:05:51.370> really<00:05:52.120> tight<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.600> have

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
to keep the edits really tight and have

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.380 
to keep the edits really tight and have
them<00:05:53.620> play<00:05:53.800> into<00:05:54.070> each<00:05:54.130> other<00:05:54.430> and<00:05:54.730> I<00:05:54.970> probably

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
them play into each other and I probably

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.970 
them play into each other and I probably
shot<00:05:55.660> an<00:05:55.810> extra<00:05:56.050> angle<00:05:56.320> I<00:05:56.410> didn't<00:05:56.650> need<00:05:56.770> on<00:05:56.919> the

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
shot an extra angle I didn't need on the

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.430 
shot an extra angle I didn't need on the
crash<00:05:57.190> scene<00:05:57.460> sometimes<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:58.690> can<00:05:58.840> you<00:05:59.290> need

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
crash scene sometimes you can you need

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.350 
crash scene sometimes you can you need
to<00:05:59.470> see<00:05:59.710> it<00:05:59.830> maybe<00:05:59.950> once<00:06:00.190> or<00:06:00.310> twice<00:06:00.550> and<00:06:00.850> move

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
to see it maybe once or twice and move

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.060 
to see it maybe once or twice and move
on<00:06:01.570> to<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:01.780> next<00:06:01.960> bit<00:06:02.140> but<00:06:02.620> when<00:06:02.770> you<00:06:02.860> see<00:06:03.040> it

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
on to the next bit but when you see it

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.070 
on to the next bit but when you see it
like<00:06:03.160> this<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:04.030> then<00:06:04.330> you<00:06:04.450> go<00:06:04.570> back<00:06:04.720> and<00:06:04.900> look

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
like this and then you go back and look

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.140 
like this and then you go back and look
at<00:06:05.169> how<00:06:05.500> it<00:06:05.620> ended<00:06:05.800> up<00:06:05.950> and<00:06:06.370> hopefully<00:06:06.820> you'll

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
at how it ended up and hopefully you'll

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.090 
at how it ended up and hopefully you'll
get<00:06:07.330> an<00:06:07.390> understanding<00:06:07.570> of<00:06:08.020> what<00:06:08.410> you<00:06:08.590> need<00:06:08.620> to

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
get an understanding of what you need to

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.460 
get an understanding of what you need to
shoot<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:09.970> get<00:06:10.120> a<00:06:10.150> good<00:06:10.360> end<00:06:10.540> result<00:06:10.690> and<00:06:11.110> now

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
shoot to get a good end result and now

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.720 
shoot to get a good end result and now
generally<00:06:11.830> people<00:06:12.070> don't<00:06:12.220> show<00:06:12.430> the<00:06:12.580> raw

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
generally people don't show the raw

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.370 
generally people don't show the raw
footage<00:06:12.940> that<00:06:13.270> goes<00:06:13.390> into<00:06:13.600> a<00:06:13.720> little<00:06:14.020> sequence

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
footage that goes into a little sequence

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.020 
footage that goes into a little sequence
but<00:06:14.560> here<00:06:14.890> I'm<00:06:14.980> laying<00:06:15.190> it<00:06:15.310> out<00:06:15.430> for<00:06:15.700> you<00:06:15.820> so

but here I'm laying it out for you so
you<00:06:16.270> can<00:06:16.390> understand<00:06:16.780> how<00:06:16.840> it<00:06:16.960> works
