00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.200
 and in this video we are going to discover the 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:14.980
 benefits of wine but not to drink it 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.830
 well if more so that our skin 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.400
 Today I present a mask for 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.400
 Oily skin 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.980
 the benefit of wine on the skin is something 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.870
 that has been discovered very recently and what 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.780
 they are using a lot especially here 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.780
 in France for treatments of all the 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.129
 body and they are also using it in 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.200
 creams and in many cosmetic products 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:44.270
 so let's see how we are going to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.270
 put on our mask linen 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.399
 they have to apply the wine on their face 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.370
 and well they have to be covered with some 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.710
 old towel or old clothes because you 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.509
 They know that wine stains costs 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.220
 a lot to take them out of clothes so they have 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.960
 Be careful not to stain your clothes 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.710
 so now let's do something to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.480
 that they can correctly apply their wine 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.780
 facial therapy 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.650
 let's leave 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.650
 the lips 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.910
 and the eyes 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.540
 the whole area of ​​the eyes 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.330
 and this is because we're going to need a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.060
 paper towel now that we have wet 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.060
 the area of ​​the eyes and the mouth we put it 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.040
 in this way and in the part where it remains 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.540
 wet then they cut out the shape of their 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.540
 mouth and eyes 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.450
 the mark of the eyes and where it was in the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.450
 mouth mark 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.020
 they will have a kind of mask 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.500
 like this now you can jump 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.500
 a bank 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.760
 well once we have this we are going to catch 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.010
 a cotton 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.010
 and we will wet it in the peak 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.340
 we apply 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.390
 on the skin avoiding 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.600
 the area of ​​the eyes 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.600
 he has his mouth 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.230
 then we take our piece of paper 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.230
 towel 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.219
 and we get 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.190
 in the face in this way 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.780
 and work 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.780
 and we continue to apply the wine 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.450
 until completely soaking the towel 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.450
 paper 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:42.300
 very well so that also the part 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.910
 of the neck and chin under the 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.390
 chin is that impregnated pineapple 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.819
 when they have impregnated 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.130
 the paper towel 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.180
 take also 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.180
 in his face 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.240
 and let it sit for 20 minutes while 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.030
 you can lie down for a while and listen 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.880
 Relaxing music 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:16.540
 I have already removed the moistened paper 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.160
 and I'm going to use lavender water and 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.440
 you can not get it can 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.280
 get the lavender flowers and they do 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:28.450
 an infusion and then put it in a 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.360
 cotton or they can also use water 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.410
 of chamomile or green tea but this is 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.880
 most of all for oily skin and then 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.550
 gently clean 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.670
 for people with oily skin 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.650
 I recommend macadamia oil or 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.660
 also the seed oil of 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.390
 apricot I know that many times it is not 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.220
 possible to find these oils but 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.030
 you can ask in stores 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.500
 naturists then this is highly recommended 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.050
 for oily skin although the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.500
 people sometimes because of having 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:07.250
 the oily skin think that the oil 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.500
 it's going to make the skin more oily but it's not 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.540
 true to the contrary this type of oils 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.630
 They regulate the skin because they are oils 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.610
 natural can also use a little 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.220
 of avocado oil that is also a 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.940
 Very light oil and it comes very well 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.800
 for all skin types, this has 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.340
 been everything for today 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.340
 taking
