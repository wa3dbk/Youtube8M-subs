00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
think it's a normal right now that is a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.910 
think it's a normal right now that is a
fast<00:00:53.120> though<00:00:53.359> it<00:00:53.839> doesn't<00:00:54.230> depend<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.710> what

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
fast though it doesn't depend on what

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.500 
fast though it doesn't depend on what
variation<00:00:55.219> that's<00:00:55.640> what<00:00:55.789> guide<00:00:55.940> they<00:00:56.120> do<00:00:56.179> so

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
variation that's what guide they do so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.119 
variation that's what guide they do so
if<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:56.780> does<00:00:56.929> sideways<00:00:57.350> look<00:00:57.530> either<00:00:57.679> stop
