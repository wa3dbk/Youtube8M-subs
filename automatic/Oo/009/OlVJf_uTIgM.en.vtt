hey<00:00:06.540> guys<00:00:06.750> wanted<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.380> show<00:00:07.590> you<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.160> unboxing

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
hey guys wanted to show you the unboxing

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.350 
hey guys wanted to show you the unboxing
of<00:00:09.090> my<00:00:09.389> vertex<00:00:10.170> alpha<00:00:10.590> 200<00:00:11.100> skimmer<00:00:11.430> bought<00:00:12.240> it

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
of my vertex alpha 200 skimmer bought it

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.930 
of my vertex alpha 200 skimmer bought it
from<00:00:12.420> bulk<00:00:12.690> reef<00:00:12.870> supply<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.709> they<00:00:14.580> really

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
from bulk reef supply and they really

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.520 
from bulk reef supply and they really
ship<00:00:15.150> quick<00:00:15.450> two<00:00:15.719> days<00:00:15.930> and<00:00:16.230> that's<00:00:16.379> pretty

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
ship quick two days and that's pretty

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.130 
ship quick two days and that's pretty
consistent<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:18.090> can<00:00:18.240> say<00:00:18.420> they<00:00:18.570> use<00:00:18.780> it

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
consistent you can say they use it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.429 
consistent you can say they use it
expanding<00:00:19.950> foam<00:00:20.280> comes<00:00:21.150> very<00:00:21.750> well<00:00:21.960> pack<00:00:22.230> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
expanding foam comes very well pack you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.529 
expanding foam comes very well pack you
know<00:00:22.529> they<00:00:22.679> squirt<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.279> foam<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.179> there<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
know they squirt the foam in there and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.570 
know they squirt the foam in there and
it<00:00:24.599> expands<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.320> envelops<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> protein

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it expands and envelops the protein

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.480 
it expands and envelops the protein
skimmer<00:00:26.960> so<00:00:27.960> I'm<00:00:28.050> looking<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> pump<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
skimmer so I'm looking for the pump I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.040 
skimmer so I'm looking for the pump I
think<00:00:29.759> it's<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.900> box<00:00:31.169> below<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.960> here<00:00:33.960> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
think it's in the box below so here it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.260 
think it's in the box below so here it
is<00:00:34.110> all<00:00:34.350> pulled<00:00:34.620> out<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
is all pulled out and you can see the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.100 
is all pulled out and you can see the
box<00:00:36.480> worthy<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:38.070> Red<00:00:38.250> Dragon<00:00:38.450> pump<00:00:39.450> will<00:00:39.899> be

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
box worthy the Red Dragon pump will be

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.950 
box worthy the Red Dragon pump will be
contained<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> bubble<00:00:42.090> bubble

contained and then the bubble bubble
wrap<00:00:43.140> around<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> skimmer<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.719> here<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
wrap around the skimmer and here it is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.110 
wrap around the skimmer and here it is
again<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.320> everything<00:00:46.739> removed<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> can

the vertex vertex alpha 200 skimmer

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.529 
the vertex vertex alpha 200 skimmer
emblem<00:01:00.440> very<00:01:01.440> heavy<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.190> acrylic<00:01:03.059> feels<00:01:03.300> like

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
emblem very heavy the acrylic feels like

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.040 
emblem very heavy the acrylic feels like
glass<00:01:04.880> very<00:01:05.880> nicely<00:01:06.120> made<00:01:06.510> there<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.870> can<00:01:07.020> see

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
glass very nicely made there you can see

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.910 
glass very nicely made there you can see
the<00:01:07.290> titanium<00:01:07.860> screws<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.500> skimmer<00:01:10.500> unit

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the titanium screws on the skimmer unit

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.450 
the titanium screws on the skimmer unit
as<00:01:11.100> well<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.509> pump<00:01:13.700> here's<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:16.460> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
as well as on the pump here's the the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.820 
as well as on the pump here's the the
tubing<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> goes<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.049> base<00:01:19.259> chamber

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
tubing that goes to the the base chamber

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.399 
tubing that goes to the the base chamber
I<00:01:22.130> had<00:01:23.130> heard<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.090> earlier<00:01:24.869> versions<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
I had heard that the earlier versions of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
I had heard that the earlier versions of
the<00:01:25.650> Alpha<00:01:26.159> skimmer<00:01:26.490> had<00:01:26.909> holes<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.659> both<00:01:27.689> ends

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the Alpha skimmer had holes on both ends

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.880 
the Alpha skimmer had holes on both ends
so<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.409> could<00:01:28.650> put<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> pump<00:01:30.409> based<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.650> how

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
so you could put the pump based on how

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.950 
so you could put the pump based on how
your<00:01:32.220> sump<00:01:32.820> was<00:01:33.000> set<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.780> one

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
your sump was set up but this one

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
your sump was set up but this one
doesn't<00:01:34.170> appear<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.369> there's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
doesn't appear to have that so there's

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.539 
doesn't appear to have that so there's
the<00:01:36.509> red<00:01:36.659> dragon<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.380> understand<00:01:38.100> they<00:01:38.250> use<00:01:38.399> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the red dragon I understand they use the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.810 
the red dragon I understand they use the
same<00:01:38.579> pump<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.540> Alpha<00:01:40.380> 250<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.430> Alpha

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
same pump on the Alpha 250 and the Alpha

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.840 
same pump on the Alpha 250 and the Alpha
300<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:43.290> heavy<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.610> see

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
300 it's very heavy and then you can see

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.139 
300 it's very heavy and then you can see
the<00:01:46.009> rubber<00:01:47.009> stand<00:01:47.369> off<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.909> looks<00:01:48.090> like

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the rubber stand off so it looks like

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.899 
the rubber stand off so it looks like
they're<00:01:48.420> really<00:01:48.659> design<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.790> you<00:01:50.790> know

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
they're really design it for you know

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.499 
they're really design it for you know
minimize<00:01:51.659> vibration<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.469> noise<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.509> that's

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
minimize vibration and noise so that's

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
minimize vibration and noise so that's
good<00:01:54.719> to<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.020> it'll<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.290> nice<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.469> see<00:01:55.680> this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
good to see it'll be nice to see this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.620 
good to see it'll be nice to see this
thing<00:01:56.159> working<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
thing working there you can see the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.130 
thing working there you can see the
German<00:01:58.549> on<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> pump<00:02:00.119> there<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
German on the pump there you can see the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.410 
German on the pump there you can see the
air<00:02:01.469> line<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.600> then<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:05.210> ozone<00:02:06.210> line

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
air line and then the the ozone line

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.270 
air line and then the the ozone line
although<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.200> don't<00:02:07.500> know<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> Ozone's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
although I I don't know what the Ozone's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.910 
although I I don't know what the Ozone's
for<00:02:08.610> I'll<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> read<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.920> there's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
for I'll have to read up on that there's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.540 
for I'll have to read up on that there's
the<00:02:11.220> top<00:02:11.430> very<00:02:12.390> heavy<00:02:12.630> again<00:02:13.400> looks<00:02:14.400> pretty

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
the top very heavy again looks pretty

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.670 
the top very heavy again looks pretty
well<00:02:14.850> made

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.309 

it's<00:02:20.680> like<00:02:20.799> it<00:02:20.920> has<00:02:21.099> some<00:02:21.780> access<00:02:22.780> holes<00:02:23.049> I

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
it's like it has some access holes I

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.960 
it's like it has some access holes I
don't<00:02:23.500> know<00:02:23.560> for<00:02:23.829> better<00:02:24.159> airflow<00:02:24.400> I'm<00:02:24.790> not

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
don't know for better airflow I'm not
