00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
experience with these machines so I had

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.539

a<00:00:12.929> few<00:00:13.110> issues<00:00:13.259> setting<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.950> up<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.370> thought

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
a few issues setting it up and thought

with<00:02:14.819> setting<00:02:15.120> up<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.269> system<00:02:15.720> was<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:17.580> motor

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
with setting up the system was the motor

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.339 
with setting up the system was the motor
drivers<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> server<00:02:19.230> driver<00:02:19.319> only<00:02:20.069> runs<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.640> a

drivers a server driver only runs on a

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.119 
drivers a server driver only runs on a
parallel<00:02:22.349> cable

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
parallel cable

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.339 
parallel cable
I<00:02:23.160> even<00:02:23.549> tried<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.849> USB<00:02:24.390> converter<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:25.049> did<00:02:25.200> not

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
I even tried a USB converter it did not

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.430 
I even tried a USB converter it did not
work<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.790> classic<00:02:27.269> old<00:02:27.540> 25<00:02:28.170> pin

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
work so it's a classic old 25 pin

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.520 
work so it's a classic old 25 pin
parallel<00:02:28.920> cable<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.400> had<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.060> buy<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> card<00:02:30.540> to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
parallel cable I had to buy a card to

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.970 
parallel cable I had to buy a card to
connect<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.549> my<00:02:32.700> machine<00:02:33.829> second<00:02:34.829> thing

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
connect it to my machine second thing

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.979 
connect it to my machine second thing
that<00:02:35.010> tripped<00:02:35.430> me<00:02:35.489> up<00:02:35.549> was<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.299> black<00:02:36.569> cable

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
that tripped me up was this black cable

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.490 
that tripped me up was this black cable
underneath<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.860> parallel<00:02:38.640> port<00:02:39.260> now<00:02:40.260> it's

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
underneath the parallel port now it's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.130 
underneath the parallel port now it's
good<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.130> USB<00:02:41.610> cable<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.450> end<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.930> just

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
good a USB cable on one end and just

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.130 
good a USB cable on one end and just
like<00:02:43.319> a<00:02:43.489> 3<00:02:44.489> volt<00:02:44.670> connector<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.540> other<00:02:45.630> now

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
like a 3 volt connector on the other now

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.800 
like a 3 volt connector on the other now
I<00:02:46.200> believe<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:47.329> there's<00:02:48.329> some<00:02:48.569> sort<00:02:48.720> of

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
I believe that there's some sort of

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.650 
I believe that there's some sort of
power<00:02:49.019> connect<00:02:49.380> through<00:02:49.799> USB<00:02:50.099> but<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:51.480> it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
power connect through USB but I know it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.300 
power connect through USB but I know it
has<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:51.930> connected<00:02:52.349> I'm<00:02:52.560> not<00:02:52.739> sure<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.220> it

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
has to be connected I'm not sure what it

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.229 
has to be connected I'm not sure what it
does<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:55.799> my<00:02:55.920> next<00:02:56.129> video<00:02:56.400> I'll<00:02:56.640> go<00:02:56.790> into<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
does in my next video I'll go into the

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.210 
does in my next video I'll go into the
software<00:02:57.930> setup

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
software setup

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.099

I<00:02:59.250> chose<00:03:00.030> Mac<00:03:00.720> 3<00:03:01.049> for<00:03:01.410> my<00:03:01.620> servo<00:03:02.430> driver

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
I chose Mac 3 for my servo driver

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.420 
I chose Mac 3 for my servo driver
because<00:03:04.109> of<00:03:04.139> the<00:03:04.290> um<00:03:04.470> support<00:03:04.829> video<00:03:05.100> as<00:03:05.250> they

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
because of the um support video as they

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.210 
because of the um support video as they

done<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.810> cutting<00:03:31.290> yet<00:03:31.470> because<00:03:31.920> there<00:03:32.609> was<00:03:32.790> a

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
done it cutting yet because there was a

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.170 
done it cutting yet because there was a
faulty<00:03:33.299> part<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.739> toolbox<00:03:35.670> set<00:03:36.000> that

faulty part this is the toolbox set that
comes<00:03:36.329> with<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:37.590> basically<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.130> bench

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
comes with it just basically the bench

clamps the three or four bits and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.409 
clamps the three or four bits and
unfortunately<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.579> chuck<00:03:44.819> which<00:03:45.030> holds<00:03:45.359> the
