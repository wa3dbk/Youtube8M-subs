because<00:07:16.690> Chanel<00:07:17.690> increases<00:07:18.560> its<00:07:18.770> prices<00:07:19.400> much

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
because Chanel increases its prices much

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.480 
because Chanel increases its prices much
faster<00:07:20.569> at<00:07:20.900> a<00:07:20.960> much<00:07:21.259> higher<00:07:21.289> rate<00:07:21.919> than<00:07:22.310> the

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
faster at a much higher rate than the

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.570 
faster at a much higher rate than the
rate<00:07:22.699> of<00:07:22.729> inflation<00:07:23.270> so<00:07:23.840> Chanel<00:07:24.680> is<00:07:25.009> ahead<00:07:25.370> of

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
rate of inflation so Chanel is ahead of

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.700 
rate of inflation so Chanel is ahead of
the<00:07:25.639> curve<00:07:25.669> when<00:07:26.330> it<00:07:26.449> comes<00:07:26.750> to<00:07:27.080> price

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710 
the curve when it comes to price

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.409 
the curve when it comes to price
increases<00:07:28.370> and<00:07:28.520> things<00:07:28.669> of<00:07:28.819> that<00:07:28.909> nature<00:07:28.970> kind

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:29.419 
increases and things of that nature kind

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.540
