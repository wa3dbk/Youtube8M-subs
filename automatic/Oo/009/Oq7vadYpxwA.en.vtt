kinoma I think it's Bremerhaven if I am
mistaken<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:35.040> usually<00:00:35.250> cause<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.350> $395

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
mistaken it's usually cause I think $395

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040 
mistaken it's usually cause I think $395
it's<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> retail<00:00:38.129> price<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.390> actually<00:00:39.750> want

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
is actually the computer section of it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.910 
is actually the computer section of it
as<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> look<00:01:18.570> inside<00:01:18.920> this

possibly place your computer but the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.990 
possibly place your computer but the
main<00:01:24.390> component<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:26.100> sure<00:01:26.250> yes<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
main component I'm pretty sure yes it is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.560 
main component I'm pretty sure yes it is
is<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.920> got

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
is in here as you can see you got

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.880 
is in here as you can see you got
complete<00:01:30.570> protection<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.409> drop<00:01:31.680> or

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
complete protection if you drop or

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.240 
complete protection if you drop or
anything

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
anything

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.789 
anything
you<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:32.790> padding<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.570> both<00:01:33.900> sides<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.680> it's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
you got padding on both sides so it's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.160 
you got padding on both sides so it's
like<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.100> classic<00:01:36.030> computer<00:01:36.509> case<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.020> got<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
like a classic computer case you got a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.550 
like a classic computer case you got a
thing<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> middle<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:40.079> hundred

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
thing in the middle but it is hundred

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.910 
thing in the middle but it is hundred
percent<00:01:41.960> what<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> say<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> hundred

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
percent what can I say it like a hundred
