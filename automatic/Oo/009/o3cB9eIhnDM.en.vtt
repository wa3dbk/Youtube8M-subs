00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.120
 here on the stove I already have a 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:10.780
 concentrate of soy milk click I'm 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.900
 waiting for you to boil so that 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.260
 then we can add the juice of 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.630
 lemon with water that is already here forming 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.330
 already three quarters of a cup was an eighth of 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.070
 lemon juice plus water to make three 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.070
 quarters cup 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.270
 as long as it does not boil I can surround you with 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.989
 spoon now that Bud made the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.790
 boil I'm just going to add the lemon well 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.790
 little by little 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.770
 I wait a little longer 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.590
 and when it starts to boil again 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.890
 time 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.190
 we add to it a little bit the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.190
 lemon 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.940
 I wait for myself again and now if not 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.640
 we return it with the spoon we hope 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.820
 let the sun or the lemon begin to cut 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.870
 and now I finish adding what 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.870
 was missing from the lemon 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.890
 if you can see , you start to see 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.890
 here as it has been cut 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.840
 if we wanted a soft tofu already 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.539
 we could put out the fire but as 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.509
 I want a tofu that looks like cheese 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:41.560
 quite firm panela I will allow that 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:46.300
 boil a minute and a half at the most 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.970
 by then already take it out and strain it 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.390
 in a cloth we always put it in a 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.960
 cloth and in a strainer to make it 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 easier 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.170
 Here we can already see how the 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.170
 tofu serum 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.970
 and we'll wait a little longer to turn off 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.970
 the stove 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.290
 can wait one minute and a half or 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.130
 two minutes to be able to turn it off and now 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.130
 I'm going to turn them off 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.389
 and can see how 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:45.109
 they separate and you could see the ground there 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.109
 separated
