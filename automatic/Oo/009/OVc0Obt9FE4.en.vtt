00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Good day, dear channel subscribers 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.919
 my name is Andrei welcome to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.500
 simulator bakers heels so we have 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.570
 small small such small 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.640
 kitchen and so we have here and a list of what we 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.130
 need to do how to make a cake 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.699
 1 or cake even heroes 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.140
 but I need to put all the ingredients in 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:33.140
 it's a good second place bowl 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.940
 the bowl in the stove is good the third 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.059
 Mr. Excellent third not anymore. to me 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.129
 more like it so guys puts such 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.020
 the guy we have hands and we have 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.070
 can move and review in general 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.010
 move back and forth 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.020
 it's from a pile of ingredients we have from an egg 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.320
 we have sugar we have flour and we 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.420
 eat butter and all we need is some 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.210
 the amount put here see the top 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.699
 up above in general yes and from our hand and and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.170
 here management still has nothing more than hardcore 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.570
 even all very probably all this 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.640
 look we have one hand mode 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.720
 which can be left and right to move 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 down-up compress in general that is 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.430
 second mode 2 hands-legs night sitting 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.020
 let's try now we put eggs there 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.210
 until vadik this only so you from world and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.220
 so good new 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.830
 No, it did not work out. 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.780
 lengthen a little bit probably or not 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.030
 it turns out to blame will have to come up yet 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.580
 closer to the day 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.020
 structures in hand mode are perfectly lowered 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.390
 and broke eggs 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.009
 your mother write there another egg 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.990
 left like let's try it 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.880
 get me it seems that hypnosis 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.610
 replay because all the eggs broke 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.330
 generally good baker good start 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:02:02.399
 give neatly slowly descend 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:02.399
 down and then this egg is calm 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.600
 so you can make videos like the second 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.560
 mass mode move here and 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.620
 move to the third mode we drop the eggs 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.510
 great doubles seem to have been even 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.330
 three eggs great guys with this we 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.730
 coped and give u five dude great 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.610
 now let's go to flour perhaps a 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.910
 Reception perhaps those type now flour 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.070
 I hope more that I correct everything 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.040
 did so here's the principle hand over flour 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.860
 It seems to be so what the hood and pour myself 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.520
 so if you put on with such a hand ok 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.030
 so grabbed flour they grabbed flour 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.160
 comes up even further it is a game 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.500
 in which it is not clear what and how well 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:01.560
 so neatly omit the letter a. 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.300

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.510

 how long can my hand be on 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:17.269
 it unfortunately can not get no cop 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.079
 but already we will have defective cakes 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:24.709
 exactly ok let's raise our lesson 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:27.250
 perhaps and come home to butter and butter 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.250

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.549
