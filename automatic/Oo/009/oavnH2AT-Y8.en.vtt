pretty much every match that he has on
there<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.479> it<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.990> they<00:01:07.890> had<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
there but it is what it is they had a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.370 
there but it is what it is they had a
tag<00:01:08.310> match<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:08.880> okay<00:01:09.210> Divas<00:01:09.930> match<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
tag match that was okay Divas match I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490 
tag match that was okay Divas match I
could<00:01:10.530> care<00:01:10.710> less<00:01:11.510> Orton<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.780> Barrett<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
could care less Orton and Barrett and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.210 
could care less Orton and Barrett and
the<00:01:13.650> tables<00:01:14.010> match<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.960> don't<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the tables match it was I don't know a I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.789 
the tables match it was I don't know a I
don't<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.970> them<00:01:18.119> having<00:01:18.540> wall<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:19.680> if

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
don't really see them having wall for if

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.190 
don't really see them having wall for if
you<00:01:19.890> watch<00:01:20.040> Smackdown<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> everything<00:01:21.200> they

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you watch Smackdown and everything they

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
you watch Smackdown and everything they
don't<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> greatest<00:01:22.920> chemistry<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
don't have the greatest chemistry in the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.050 
don't have the greatest chemistry in the
world

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
world

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.880 
world
I<00:01:24.090> thought<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.080> them<00:01:25.229> having<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> tables

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
I thought with them having a tables

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.490 
I thought with them having a tables
match<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.280> would<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.549> okay<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.110> was

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
match it would be okay it was it was

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.700 
match it would be okay it was it was
okay<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.610> finish<00:01:29.970> had<00:01:30.320> Barrett<00:01:31.320> coming<00:01:31.619> off

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
okay the finish had Barrett coming off

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.319 
okay the finish had Barrett coming off
of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.920> top<00:01:32.130> rope<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.610> Orton<00:01:33.030> hit<00:01:33.150> him<00:01:33.240> with

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
of the top rope and Orton hit him with

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.760 
of the top rope and Orton hit him with
the<00:01:33.420> RKO<00:01:33.780> through<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> table<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.500> thought<00:01:34.650> that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the RKO through the table I thought that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.410 
the RKO through the table I thought that
was<00:01:34.890> pretty<00:01:35.040> pretty<00:01:35.640> neat<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:37.439> had<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:39.270> had

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
was pretty pretty neat you had you had

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.749 
was pretty pretty neat you had you had
Kevin<00:01:39.750> Nash<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.100> Triple<00:01:41.100> H<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> ladder

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
Kevin Nash and Triple H in the ladder

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
Kevin Nash and Triple H in the ladder
match<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.110> honestly<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.229> wasn't<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.740> bad<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
match in honestly it wasn't that bad I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.499 
match in honestly it wasn't that bad I
was<00:01:44.250> expecting<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> pretty<00:01:45.030> much<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> worst

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
was expecting to pretty much the worst

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
was expecting to pretty much the worst
match<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:46.079> all<00:01:46.229> time<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:46.950> least<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> worst

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
match of all time or at least the worst

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.190 
match of all time or at least the worst
match<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.790> year<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.630> wasn't<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.990> bad

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
match of the year and it wasn't that bad

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.090 
match of the year and it wasn't that bad
did<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.860> enjoy<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.399> no<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:52.680> wasn't<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
did I enjoy it no but it wasn't the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.280
