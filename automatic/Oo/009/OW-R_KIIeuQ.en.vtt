00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
shoulders and original garden is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.529 
shoulders and original garden is
improved<00:02:00.869> slightly<00:02:01.819> so<00:02:02.819> with<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.119> feed

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
improved slightly so with that feed

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.330 
improved slightly so with that feed
configuration<00:02:04.440> which<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.800> their<00:02:05.009> idea<00:02:05.159> of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
configuration which is their idea of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.529 
configuration which is their idea of
balance<00:02:05.819> point

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.490 

so<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.049> rod<00:02:11.200> legs<00:02:11.409> always<00:02:11.620> bad<00:02:12.040> sign

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.080 

now<00:02:18.500> what<00:02:18.709> difference<00:02:19.069> did<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.280> make<00:02:19.370> when<00:02:19.940> we

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
now what difference did it make when we

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.570 
now what difference did it make when we
are<00:02:20.209> moving<00:02:20.360> this<00:02:20.690> foot<00:02:21.050> forwards<00:02:23.140> did<00:02:24.140> it

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
are moving this foot forwards did it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.360 
are moving this foot forwards did it
okay<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.750> go<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.959> bit<00:02:27.140> more<00:02:27.350> full<00:02:27.620> until<00:02:28.130> it's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
okay so go a bit more full until it's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.030 
okay so go a bit more full until it's
until<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.300> lose<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.870> stability<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.680> then<00:02:30.830> I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
until you lose that stability so then I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.550 
until you lose that stability so then I
lost<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.520> alright<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.660> go<00:02:32.690> back<00:02:33.050> all<00:02:33.410> right

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
we could do is what I found players is

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.410 
we could do is what I found players is
but<00:03:24.819> if<00:03:25.819> they're<00:03:26.290> learning<00:03:27.290> something<00:03:27.829> new

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
but if they're learning something new

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.940 
but if they're learning something new
site<00:03:29.420> brings<00:03:29.780> on<00:03:29.900> other<00:03:30.110> back<00:03:30.409> to<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.650> house

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
site brings on other back to the house

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.399 
site brings on other back to the house
or<00:03:31.250> again<00:03:32.709> pretty<00:03:33.709> hopeless<00:03:33.950> but<00:03:34.519> I<00:03:35.409> learned

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
or again pretty hopeless but I learned

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.839 
or again pretty hopeless but I learned
very<00:03:36.560> slowly<00:03:37.099> first<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:39.260> if<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.680> are<00:03:40.670> learning

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
very slowly first so if you are learning

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.759 
very slowly first so if you are learning
something<00:03:41.120> you're<00:03:41.690> introducing<00:03:42.290> something

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
something you're introducing something

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.460 
something you're introducing something

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
destruction on that bit more and that's

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.819

liner<00:06:57.559> by<00:06:57.800> and<00:06:58.990> get<00:06:59.990> down<00:07:00.169> to<00:07:00.199> the<00:07:00.319> shot<00:07:00.559> so

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
liner by and get down to the shot so

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.860 
liner by and get down to the shot so
quickly<00:07:01.159> they've<00:07:01.370> lost<00:07:01.580> it<00:07:01.789> again<00:07:01.909> so<00:07:02.719> when

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
quickly they've lost it again so when

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.659 
quickly they've lost it again so when
they<00:07:02.960> down<00:07:03.139> onto<00:07:03.379> sure<00:07:03.589> they've<00:07:03.800> got<00:07:03.830> again<00:07:04.399> to

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 
they down onto sure they've got again to

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.659 
they down onto sure they've got again to
find<00:07:04.819> their<00:07:05.059> line<00:07:05.240> of<00:07:05.389> a<00:07:05.680> very<00:07:06.680> very<00:07:07.069> important

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
find their line of a very very important

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:10.230 
find their line of a very very important
it's<00:07:08.449> almost<00:07:08.599> like<00:07:08.749> walking<00:07:09.199> on<00:07:09.259> a<00:07:09.319> tightrope

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
it's almost like walking on a tightrope

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.610 
it's almost like walking on a tightrope
imagine<00:07:11.240> you're<00:07:11.419> walking<00:07:11.509> on<00:07:11.809> Tyra<00:07:12.199> what

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
imagine you're walking on Tyra what

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.820 
imagine you're walking on Tyra what
you're<00:07:12.740> getting<00:07:12.949> damaged

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830 
you're getting damaged

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.140 
you're getting damaged
bring<00:07:15.040> the<00:07:15.360> requisite<00:07:16.360> care<00:07:16.750> needed

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
bring the requisite care needed

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:24.240 
bring the requisite care needed
effectively<00:07:20.220> so<00:07:21.220> that's<00:07:21.430> excellent<00:07:23.250> any

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
effectively so that's excellent any

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.460 
effectively so that's excellent any
other<00:07:24.520> questions<00:07:25.060> I<00:07:27.750> think<00:07:28.750> basically<00:07:28.930> to

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
other questions I think basically to

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.130 
other questions I think basically to
some<00:07:29.770> of<00:07:29.890> what<00:07:30.070> we've<00:07:30.250> done<00:07:30.460> there<00:07:30.760> the<00:07:31.300> 1230

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.140 
some of what we've done there the 1230

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.100 
some of what we've done there the 1230
is<00:07:32.590> working<00:07:32.950> very<00:07:32.980> well<00:07:33.220> in<00:07:34.150> helping<00:07:34.600> you<00:07:34.780> find

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.110 
is working very well in helping you find

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.110 
is working very well in helping you find
a<00:07:37.200> stance<00:07:38.200> shape<00:07:39.100> and<00:07:39.340> position<00:07:39.490> of<00:07:39.850> man's

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 
a stance shape and position of man's

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.220 
a stance shape and position of man's
work<00:07:40.570> to<00:07:40.750> be<00:07:40.840> here<00:07:42.210> take<00:07:43.210> that<00:07:43.360> we<00:07:43.690> prepare<00:07:44.020> the

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:44.230 
work to be here take that we prepare the

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.980 
work to be here take that we prepare the
tripod<00:07:44.740> analogy<00:07:45.340> and<00:07:46.000> eventually<00:07:46.570> you'll<00:07:46.750> be

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:46.990 
tripod analogy and eventually you'll be

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.260 
tripod analogy and eventually you'll be
stepping<00:07:47.550> same<00:07:48.550> distance<00:07:49.060> into<00:07:49.360> every<00:07:49.600> ball

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.270 
stepping same distance into every ball

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.240 
stepping same distance into every ball
into<00:07:52.270> the<00:07:52.360> same<00:07:52.600> position<00:07:53.170> i<00:07:53.200> recalled<00:07:53.680> and

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.250 
into the same position i recalled and

00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:07.740 
into the same position i recalled and
then<00:07:55.090> then<00:07:55.330> removes<00:07:55.750> a<00:07:55.930> few<00:08:06.300> okay<00:08:07.300> split<00:08:07.540> up

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:07.750 
then then removes a few okay split up

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.010 
then then removes a few okay split up
into<00:08:07.930> a<00:08:08.110> different<00:08:08.710> partner<00:08:09.010> and<00:08:09.450> I<00:08:10.450> think

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.020 
into a different partner and I think

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.290 
into a different partner and I think
we've<00:08:11.170> got<00:08:11.290> plenty<00:08:11.440> of<00:08:11.650> tables<00:08:11.860> here<00:08:12.220> and<00:08:12.460> i'll

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:13.300 
we've got plenty of tables here and i'll

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.380 
we've got plenty of tables here and i'll
call<00:08:13.510> you<00:08:13.630> improvise<00:08:13.990> for<00:08:14.200> lunch
