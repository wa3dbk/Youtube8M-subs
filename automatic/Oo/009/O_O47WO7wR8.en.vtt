00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
what you don't have on the back of this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.479 
what you don't have on the back of this
truck<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> step<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
truck is a step like you do with the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
truck is a step like you do with the
Ford<00:01:05.850> f-150<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.560> new<00:01:07.680> General<00:01:08.040> Motors

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
Ford f-150 or the the new General Motors

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.070 
Ford f-150 or the the new General Motors
trucks<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:08.970> cutaway<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
trucks have the little cutaway in the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
trucks have the little cutaway in the
bumper<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.710> that's<00:01:11.189> something<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.729> they

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
bumper so that's something that they

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.030 
bumper so that's something that they
could<00:01:12.000> definitely<00:01:12.180> work<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.869> styling<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.920> an

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
could definitely work on styling it's an

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.289 
could definitely work on styling it's an
individual<00:01:14.580> taste<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> pretty

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
individual taste I think is a pretty

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.999 
individual taste I think is a pretty
good-looking<00:01:15.540> truck<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:16.860> in

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
good-looking truck but it's look in

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.590 
good-looking truck but it's look in
North<00:01:17.220> America<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:17.970> made<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.420> North

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
North America and it's made in North

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.510 
North America and it's made in North
America<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.290> designed<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.830> North<00:01:20.040> America

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
America it's designed in North America

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
America it's designed in North America
so<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> North<00:01:21.840> American<00:01:21.990> truck

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
so this really is a North American truck

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
so this really is a North American truck

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
the shifter here on the console I like

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.490 
the shifter here on the console I like
the<00:02:23.370> old<00:02:23.459> column<00:02:23.910> one<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.300> moved<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.720> away<00:02:24.870> out

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the old column one it moved it away out

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.170 
the old column one it moved it away out
of<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.830> way<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.040> have<00:02:26.340> all<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.670> extra<00:02:26.849> space

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
of the way you have all that extra space

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.420 
of the way you have all that extra space
there<00:02:27.569> but<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.830> back<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.340> an

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
there but that really is back to an

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.190 
there but that really is back to an
older<00:02:29.760> time<00:02:30.000> when<00:02:30.239> pickup<00:02:30.599> trucks<00:02:30.840> all<00:02:30.989> had

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
older time when pickup trucks all had

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.900 
older time when pickup trucks all had
the<00:02:31.349> column<00:02:31.680> out<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.550> though

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
the column out I like it though

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.420 
the column out I like it though
massive<00:02:33.750> absolutely<00:02:34.470> massive<00:02:34.709> Center<00:02:35.220> been

massive absolutely massive Center been

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.850 
massive absolutely massive Center been
here<00:02:35.700> you've<00:02:36.090> got<00:02:36.239> plenty<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.660> cupholders<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
here you've got plenty of cupholders the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.920 
here you've got plenty of cupholders the
overall<00:02:38.370> appeal<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.450> kind<00:02:39.840> of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
overall appeal in here is kind of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.199 
overall appeal in here is kind of
simplistic<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.950> plain<00:02:41.430> when<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:41.970> look<00:02:42.090> at

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
simplistic and plain when you look at

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.240 
simplistic and plain when you look at
some<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.569> other<00:02:42.780> trucks<00:02:43.170> for<00:02:43.650> example<00:02:44.160> I

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
some of the other trucks for example I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.150 
some of the other trucks for example I
think<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.700> best<00:02:45.000> interior<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.780> Ram<00:02:46.160> beautiful

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
think the best interior is Ram beautiful

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.780 
think the best interior is Ram beautiful
on<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> inside

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.420 
on the inside
second<00:02:48.510> place<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.989> would<00:02:49.260> give<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.680> new<00:02:49.769> GMC

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
second place I would give to the new GMC

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.160 
second place I would give to the new GMC

is quite good I'm a little disappointed

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.940 
is quite good I'm a little disappointed
with<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.570> noise<00:05:06.870> level<00:05:07.380> in<00:05:07.530> here<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.800> don't

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
with the noise level in here I don't

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.850 
with the noise level in here I don't
find<00:05:08.370> it<00:05:08.550> nearly<00:05:08.820> as<00:05:09.030> quiet<00:05:09.390> as<00:05:09.710> some<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.800> the

find it nearly as quiet as some of the
domestic<00:05:11.310> manufacturers<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.330> overall<00:05:13.260> it's<00:05:14.190> a

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
domestic manufacturers so overall it's a

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.880 
domestic manufacturers so overall it's a

but<00:05:35.130> it's<00:05:35.250> limited<00:05:35.550> because<00:05:35.880> they<00:05:36.300> don't<00:05:36.510> have

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
but it's limited because they don't have

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.300 
but it's limited because they don't have
the<00:05:36.810> engine<00:05:37.169> choices<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.800> domestic
