00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello friends with you again harm 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.099
 erlenberg card 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.410
 and this is another tactical sketch i 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.830
 I am in a platoon with frebornnom he 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.020
 ride laurel isn't 155 50 and we 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.600
 we start movement to our start 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.460
 positions where we will put the first 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.949
 damage 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.119
 what good is this position there 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.640
 convenient to shoot for cleaning under a little bit 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.840
 a better angle you can throw 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.590
 and deeper there are shots for 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.379
 it is convenient to stand here 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.070
 them are there who have mounted 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.690
 the projectile flight path on t92 i don't 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.420
 I recommend to stand here a little bit 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.199
 uncomfortable stuffed jumping is also not so 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.000
 say so very much and on the first 206 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.590
 a little bit no ice 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.590
 so we wait for the first light 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.220
 and you see here stop replay 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.200
 base capture began 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.070
 less than a minute since the beginning of the battle 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.680
 it is clear that this is most likely 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.490
 a firefly rides around for arta and we 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.700
 we wash ourselves platoon make a decision 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.430
 get out of here nafig 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.290
 we cut 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.840
 because no one is likely to help 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.370
 will not be as usual and the art will be 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.830
 cut I roll 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.830
 my sovzvodny do the same here you 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.430
 see they appear from 12 tons from the center it 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.300
 is coming 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:49.650
 as we expected and starts here 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.650
 cut art here he took 212 objects 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:59.150
 in the meantime, I am bringing myself to my flank 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.320
 we go for the light 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.320
 no one yet 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.140
 afternoon for take 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.260
 here was the American bird 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.500
 110 and 4 so she sends 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.500
 projectile and do a little damage 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.600
 just a little bit more 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.990
 recharge 110 and 4 somehow not at all 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.830
 understands from where and shoot and therefore 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.830
 goes to the hangar 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:46.350
 see what else happens here 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:48.790
 t-44 is no way not to catch 110 did 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.670
 we start to calculate its trajectory 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.670
 movements where we can throw him 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.080
 successfully puts it on the harp and i 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.200
 a little bit of his prodazhil take it away 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.380
 our tanks 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.160
 in the meantime, it starts here again 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:17.260
 picks up m103 i'm trying to work on 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.590
 I think this missile did not hit the center 75 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.490
 even flew there apparently somewhere 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.130
 hooked along the path of the hill more likely 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.280
 just see that here is a little complicated 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.739
 shot constantly maneuvering red and 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.530
 Green Line well here and so the method 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.530
 all there can, in principle, stupidity 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:47.500
 and e75 goes to the hangar wonderful 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.250
 Continuing work will see that in the chat 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.100
 here we are stopped there is-7 swears 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.080
 that art we have some bad there 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.770
 words of me 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:03.720
 replaced by stars in the meantime art 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:07.920
 continues to recruit in Prague for more than 2 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.520
 bedroom thousand damage I've answered 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.300
 seventh could not resist the correct form 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.300
 of course 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.669
 I tried something here to find all 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.850
 four of course I became she thought 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:29.060
 will go over this bridge 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.060
 but she make a completely different maneuver 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.190
 110 here in the fullest bow about sowing without 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.819
 chances just you see our 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.129
 ally 100 dozen goes to help us 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:48.379
 because I noticed that the art is completely 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.379
 it's not a cover 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:05:00.300
 no light yet everything is sad 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:03.840
 and the whole four appears like this 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.319
 she shines my sovzvodnom 100 dozen 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.169
 a little bit I did not have time in the meantime 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:16.979
 throwing a little damage trying 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:19.340
 save roughly he runs away accelerates with 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.340
 slides 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.530
 but the enemy art meanly takes him 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:34.520
 but nothing we revenged for him 54 hangar 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:34.520
 and enemy art, too, get your 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:44.879
 waiting for further developments here 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:46.480
 our tanks start time over another 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:50.430
 wing 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.430
 I translate constantly 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.660
 under their light 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.280
 and here comes the enemy art and 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.790
 I send and my shell does not have time 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.150
 to fly 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.150
 e75 picks up ha 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.340
 Unfortunately 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.340
 of 3 vanilla rides 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.349
 the light disappears I throw at the entrance and 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:24.699
 the projectile slightly inaccurately falls and in general 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:29.740
 then I do not take him and here it seems 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:32.220
 everything is good send and flight nightmare 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:37.690
 you could just want to take 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:40.380
 C grade I wait for 110 to light up 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.380
 he work 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:48.820
 waiting waiting waiting where I lived there somewhere here 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.780
 glowed account should appear so forward 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.730
 waiting waiting 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.020
 now our tanks should light it 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:07:01.120
 what happens why its no business 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:06.410
 vaude this surprises wow yes 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:13.639
 went swimming his hour beggarly shot 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:16.690
 absolutely like that I missed what I want 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:21.169
 tell the guys be sure to move to 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:23.620
 these places right here get up here 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:27.050
 on b1 b2 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:30.140
 shoot to climb the houses there usually 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.000
 hiding I think that they are in the safe you will 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.580
 fine throw the same with 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.230
 the other side that's when you appear on 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:44.660
 cutting right let's say so upper respa you 

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:47.419
 can move to square and k9k 0 and 

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:51.139
 then move on to 8 and also 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:55.280
 throw a tank which is absolutely not 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:58.669
 expect damage from you in the meantime fight 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.000
 finished all thanks to new meetings 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.000
 until
