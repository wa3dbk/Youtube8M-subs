pretty budget the quality was reasonable
but<00:05:45.169> it<00:05:45.289> still<00:05:45.500> had<00:05:45.650> this<00:05:45.740> tinny<00:05:46.099> twang<00:05:46.490> to

everything I expected it to and more the

everything I expected it to and more the

massive jump inspects across the board
was<00:06:16.220> a<00:06:16.250> significant<00:06:17.000> improvement<00:06:17.120> of<00:06:17.570> one

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
competitors I think you would be

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.020 
competitors I think you would be
hard-pressed<00:06:26.900> to<00:06:27.260> find<00:06:27.289> a<00:06:27.650> better<00:06:27.860> device<00:06:28.220> the

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
design is not perfect but it's still

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.170 
design is not perfect but it's still
elegant<00:06:30.830> enough<00:06:31.130> to<00:06:31.310> grab<00:06:31.520> buyers

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
the one issue LG has at the moment is

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.689 
the one issue LG has at the moment is
the<00:06:34.909> Nexus<00:06:35.300> 4<00:06:35.630> which<00:06:36.199> is<00:06:36.349> priced<00:06:36.650> only<00:06:36.860> $50

the Nexus 4 which is priced only $50
more<00:06:37.940> expensive<00:06:38.570> for<00:06:38.750> me<00:06:38.870> here<00:06:39.169> in<00:06:39.349> Australia

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
more expensive for me here in Australia

the<00:06:40.460> main<00:06:40.700> difference<00:06:41.389> though<00:06:41.599> is<00:06:41.840> that<00:06:42.229> this

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 
the main difference though is that this

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:44.469 
the main difference though is that this
would<00:06:42.560> only<00:06:42.770> be<00:06:42.950> getting<00:06:43.460> me<00:06:43.639> an<00:06:43.849> 8<00:06:44.090> gigabyte

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
would only be getting me an 8 gigabyte
