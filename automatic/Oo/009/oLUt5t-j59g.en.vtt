as well as the entire printer and kind
of<00:00:36.790> an<00:00:36.910> interesting<00:00:37.059> way<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:37.449> see<00:00:37.750> through<00:00:37.989> it

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
of an interesting way to see through it

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.619 
of an interesting way to see through it
but<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.410> 3800<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.610> this<00:00:39.790> amazing<00:00:40.089> printer

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
but the 3800 is this amazing printer

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.119 
but the 3800 is this amazing printer
that<00:00:40.750> is<00:00:40.780> 17<00:00:41.230> inches<00:00:41.260> wide<00:00:41.710> but<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.950> lot<00:00:42.100> of

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
that is 17 inches wide but a lot of

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.470 
that is 17 inches wide but a lot of
people<00:00:42.340> when<00:00:42.579> they<00:00:42.670> first<00:00:42.879> see<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:43.149> think<00:00:43.329> it's

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
people when they first see it think it's

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.910 
people when they first see it think it's
a<00:00:43.600> 13<00:00:43.930> inch<00:00:44.110> printer<00:00:44.379> because<00:00:44.530> of<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.829> new

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
a 13 inch printer because of the new

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.040 
a 13 inch printer because of the new
compact<00:00:45.309> design<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:46.270> can<00:00:46.449> easily<00:00:46.539> see<00:00:46.899> these

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
compact design you can easily see these

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.540 
compact design you can easily see these
are<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.260> pressurized<00:00:47.739> cartridges<00:00:48.309> that<00:00:48.340> are

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
are the pressurized cartridges that are

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.360 
are the pressurized cartridges that are
80<00:00:48.789> milliliters<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:49.680> has<00:00:50.680> Auto<00:00:50.920> switching

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
80 milliliters and has Auto switching

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.529 
80 milliliters and has Auto switching
between<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.760> matte<00:00:51.910> black<00:00:52.090> and<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.360> photo

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
between the matte black and the photo

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:53.910 
between the matte black and the photo
black<00:00:52.780> ink<00:00:53.020> and<00:00:53.140> then<00:00:53.230> this<00:00:53.350> completely

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
black ink and then this completely

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.979 
black ink and then this completely
closes<00:00:54.340> down<00:00:54.520> what's<00:00:55.180> also<00:00:55.329> nice<00:00:55.570> about<00:00:55.629> this

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
closes down what's also nice about this

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.599 
closes down what's also nice about this
printer<00:00:56.350> is<00:00:56.379> it<00:00:56.739> can<00:00:56.890> go<00:00:57.010> over<00:00:57.100> anywhere<00:00:57.430> from

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
printer is it can go over anywhere from

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.779 
printer is it can go over anywhere from
4<00:00:57.879> x<00:00:58.030> 6<00:00:58.059> up<00:00:58.510> to<00:00:58.660> 17<00:00:59.170> x<00:00:59.320> 22<00:00:59.769> or<00:00:59.920> 17<00:01:00.280> inches<00:01:00.550> wide

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
4 x 6 up to 17 x 22 or 17 inches wide

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.270 
4 x 6 up to 17 x 22 or 17 inches wide
and<00:01:01.090> also<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:02.019> folds<00:01:02.379> down<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.769> a<00:01:02.859> compact

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
and also it folds down in a compact

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.400 
and also it folds down in a compact
thing<00:01:03.550> like<00:01:03.789> this<00:01:03.969> so<00:01:04.269> many<00:01:04.809> people<00:01:05.170> feel<00:01:05.350> that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
thing like this so many people feel that

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.840 
thing like this so many people feel that
it's<00:01:05.680> just<00:01:05.890> like<00:01:06.009> a<00:01:06.039> really<00:01:06.310> cool<00:01:06.580> piece<00:01:06.789> of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
it's just like a really cool piece of

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.730 
it's just like a really cool piece of
graphic<00:01:07.300> design<00:01:07.330> furniture<00:01:07.780> as<00:01:08.259> opposed<00:01:08.590> to

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
graphic design furniture as opposed to

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.620 
graphic design furniture as opposed to
some<00:01:08.979> of<00:01:09.070> our<00:01:09.130> bigger<00:01:09.369> printers<00:01:09.789> which<00:01:10.420> take

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
some of our bigger printers which take

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.109 
some of our bigger printers which take
up<00:01:10.660> a<00:01:10.960> big<00:01:11.350> part<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.649> room<00:01:11.830> now<00:01:12.670> this<00:01:12.790> uses

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
up a big part of the room now this uses

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.060 
up a big part of the room now this uses
a<00:01:13.240> new<00:01:13.390> screening<00:01:13.900> algorithm<00:01:14.409> can<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.590> talk

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
a new screening algorithm can you talk

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.480 
a new screening algorithm can you talk
about<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.369> little<00:01:15.400> bit<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.799> epson<00:01:18.310> stylus

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
about that a little bit the epson stylus

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.910 
about that a little bit the epson stylus
pro<00:01:18.840> 3800<00:01:19.840> has<00:01:20.020> incorporated<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.770> new

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
pro 3800 has incorporated a new

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.499 
pro 3800 has incorporated a new
screening<00:01:21.250> algorithm<00:01:21.909> then<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.270> know<00:01:22.330> what

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
screening algorithm then you know what

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.179 
screening algorithm then you know what
does<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.720> all<00:01:22.780> mean<00:01:22.960> it's<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.530> supercomputer

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
does that all mean it's a supercomputer

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.399 
does that all mean it's a supercomputer
was<00:01:24.340> used<00:01:24.549> in<00:01:24.759> order<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:25.000> create<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.630> math<00:01:25.840> so

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
was used in order to create the math so

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.530 
was used in order to create the math so
very<00:01:26.740> accurately<00:01:27.340> places<00:01:27.850> dots<00:01:28.090> down<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.479> a

very accurately places dots down in a
paper<00:01:29.130> there's<00:01:30.130> basically<00:01:30.670> two<00:01:30.880> different

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
paper there's basically two different

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
screening algorithms that could be used

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.280 
screening algorithms that could be used
stochastic<00:01:32.970> screening<00:01:33.970> which<00:01:34.210> came<00:01:34.509> out<00:01:34.720> as<00:01:34.930> a

stochastic screening which came out as a

stochastic screening which came out as a
way<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.650> hide<00:01:35.979> dots<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.549> comes<00:01:36.700> from<00:01:36.850> the

way to hide dots it comes from the
