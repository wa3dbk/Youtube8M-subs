00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
fine to note that you know it basically

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.209 
fine to note that you know it basically
will<00:00:50.430> last<00:00:50.670> forever<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:52.050> seems<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.100> know

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219

will last forever it seems like you know
it'll<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.579> interesting<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.360> how<00:00:54.510> long

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it'll be interesting to see how long

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
it'll be interesting to see how long
this<00:00:54.930> does<00:00:55.110> last<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.530> seems<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.980> once<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
this does last it seems like once it

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.849 
this does last it seems like once it
breaks<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.870> doesn't<00:00:58.320> seem<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.559> wear

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
breaks in it just doesn't seem to wear

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.260 
breaks in it just doesn't seem to wear
any<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.370> only<00:00:59.520> makes<00:00:59.789> sense<00:00:59.940> these

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
any and that only makes sense these

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.470 
any and that only makes sense these
shafts<00:01:00.960> are<00:01:01.260> ultra<00:01:01.739> smooth<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:03.090> wood<00:01:03.270> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
shafts are ultra smooth and the wood is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.509 
shafts are ultra smooth and the wood is
super<00:01:03.840> hard<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.320> little<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> lubricant<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
super hard a little bit of lubricant and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.300 
super hard a little bit of lubricant and
it'll<00:01:06.210> it'll<00:01:06.689> go<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> long<00:01:07.439> long<00:01:07.710> time<00:01:08.010> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
with the way it's working you know I've

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.950 
with the way it's working you know I've
got<00:01:49.500> my<00:01:49.680> dismount<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.180> what<00:01:51.540> I've<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:51.840> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
got my dismount here so what I've got to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.450 
got my dismount here so what I've got to
do<00:01:52.079> yet<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.530> I'm<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> actually<00:01:53.130> cut

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
do yet is I'm going to actually cut

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460 
do yet is I'm going to actually cut
another<00:01:53.790> disc<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.270> same<00:01:54.479> size<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
another disc the same size as this and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.310 
another disc the same size as this and
then<00:01:55.920> I'm<00:01:56.100> gonna<00:01:56.280> hollow<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.820> rate<00:01:57.329> exactly

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
then I'm gonna hollow out rate exactly

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.590 
then I'm gonna hollow out rate exactly
where<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.710> nut<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:02:00.030> when<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> put

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
where that nut is and then when I put

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
where that nut is and then when I put
this<00:02:00.719> over<00:02:00.990> top<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:01.439> that'll<00:02:01.740> disappear

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
this over top you see that'll disappear

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.050 
this over top you see that'll disappear
so<00:02:02.310> then<00:02:02.460> I'll<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.000> perfectly<00:02:03.930> flat<00:02:05.060> area

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
so then I'll have a perfectly flat area

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
so then I'll have a perfectly flat area
and<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.570> I'll<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.930> glue<00:02:07.049> my<00:02:07.320> sandpaper<00:02:07.710> on

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and then I'll just glue my sandpaper on

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.780 
and then I'll just glue my sandpaper on
this<00:02:08.580> disc<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.979> then<00:02:10.979> obviously<00:02:11.160> I'm<00:02:11.640> gonna

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
this disc so then obviously I'm gonna

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.339 
this disc so then obviously I'm gonna
have<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.090> build<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.360> little<00:02:12.540> table<00:02:12.959> here<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
have to build a little table here and I

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.760 
have to build a little table here and I
want<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.620> put

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770

some<00:02:13.950> sort<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.250> dust<00:02:14.490> collection<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.300> but

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
some sort of dust collection on this but

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.080 
some sort of dust collection on this but
it'll<00:02:16.260> still<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.620> ultra<00:02:17.220> cheap<00:02:17.250> there<00:02:17.790> there

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
it'll still be ultra cheap there there

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.790 
it'll still be ultra cheap there there
won't<00:02:18.270> be<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.420> lot<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.780> money<00:02:18.930> tied<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.560> this

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800

know clamping made a little place that I

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.700 
know clamping made a little place that I
could<00:02:45.390> slide<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.930> block<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.410> then<00:02:46.500> drill

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
could slide the block in and then drill

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.830 
could slide the block in and then drill
a<00:02:46.770> hole<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.160> had<00:02:47.400> my<00:02:47.940> holes<00:02:48.210> all<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
a hole so I had my holes all in the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.080 
a hole so I had my holes all in the
exact<00:02:49.080> same<00:02:49.290> spots<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.740> then<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.100> put<00:02:50.970> my

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
exact same spots and then I just put my

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.090 
exact same spots and then I just put my
bolt<00:02:51.390> through<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.900> put<00:02:52.380> some<00:02:52.530> glue<00:02:52.710> on<00:02:52.740> them

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
bolt through and put some glue on them

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.430 
bolt through and put some glue on them
and<00:02:53.280> just<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.910> know<00:02:54.030> set<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.480> aside<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:54.840> till

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and just you know set it aside for till

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.690 
and just you know set it aside for till
this<00:02:55.530> morning<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:56.010> then<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.280> morning<00:02:56.580> was

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
this morning and then this morning was

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.560 
this morning and then this morning was
just<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.880> matter<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.090> putting<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.330> couple<00:02:57.510> of

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
just a matter of putting a couple of

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.570 
just a matter of putting a couple of
screws<00:02:57.840> through<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.260> block<00:02:58.500> putting<00:02:59.460> my

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
screws through this block putting my

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.720 
screws through this block putting my
shaft<00:02:59.880> through<00:03:00.240> with<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> few<00:03:01.370> washers<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.580> and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
shaft through with a few washers in and

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.640 
shaft through with a few washers in and
then<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.940> took<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.270> most<00:03:03.480> time<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:04.290> took<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.500> few

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
then it took the most time it took a few

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.200 
then it took the most time it took a few
minutes<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:05.190> get<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:05.760> thing<00:03:06.000> running

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
minutes to get this thing running

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.180 
minutes to get this thing running
straight<00:03:06.600> because<00:03:07.050> when<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> tighten<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.160> down

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
straight because when I tighten it down

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.800 
straight because when I tighten it down
and<00:03:08.370> had<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.670> little<00:03:08.880> wobble<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.630> had

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and had a little wobble in it so I had

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.600 
and had a little wobble in it so I had
to<00:03:09.840> put<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.080> little<00:03:10.200> shim<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.710> behind<00:03:11.070> one<00:03:11.310> side

to put a little shim in behind one side

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.030 
to put a little shim in behind one side
but<00:03:12.270> now<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.630> running<00:03:12.750> real<00:03:13.050> nice<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.560> I'll

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
but now it's running real nice so I'll

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.860 
but now it's running real nice so I'll
just<00:03:14.220> start<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.580> up<00:03:14.700> let<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.120> run<00:03:15.240> for<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.510> second

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
just start it up let it run for a second

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.920 
just start it up let it run for a second
and<00:03:16.050> then<00:03:16.730> I've<00:03:17.730> got<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.030> get<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.209> work<00:03:18.360> on<00:03:18.600> some

kitchen so you can see now and I'm
amazed<00:03:21.420> -<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.959> has<00:03:22.140> got<00:03:22.290> quite<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.530> bit<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
amazed - this has got quite a bit of

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.650 
amazed - this has got quite a bit of
power<00:03:22.950> if<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.280> hold<00:03:23.490> against<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.270> can<00:03:24.450> tell

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
power if I hold against this I can tell

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.750 
power if I hold against this I can tell
that<00:03:24.720> I'm<00:03:25.380> gonna<00:03:25.560> actually<00:03:25.770> have<00:03:26.100> no<00:03:26.310> problem

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
sanding even though this is just a 1/3

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.530 
sanding even though this is just a 1/3
horsepower<00:03:29.640> motor<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:33.330> know<00:03:33.420> it's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
horsepower motor and you know it's

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.230 
horsepower motor and you know it's
running<00:03:33.810> real<00:03:33.959> smooth<00:03:34.290> -<00:03:34.790> then<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.910> can<00:03:36.060> see<00:03:36.209> I

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
running real smooth - then you can see I

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.630 
running real smooth - then you can see I
drilled<00:03:36.690> little<00:03:36.959> holes<00:03:37.170> on<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.530> tops<00:03:37.800> here

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
drilled little holes on the tops here

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.880 
drilled little holes on the tops here
that<00:03:38.880> run<00:03:39.090> down<00:03:39.390> into<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.020> shaft<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.680> then<00:03:40.860> I

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
that run down into the shaft and then I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.010 
that run down into the shaft and then I
can<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.310> feed<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> little<00:03:42.360> bit<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.540> oil<00:03:42.720> down

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
can just feed a little bit of oil down

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.230 
can just feed a little bit of oil down
through<00:03:43.380> into<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.490> then<00:03:44.610> I'll<00:03:45.030> just

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
through into that and then I'll just

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.240 
through into that and then I'll just
show<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.480> quickly<00:03:45.510> -<00:03:46.050> how<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.290> hooked<00:03:47.190> my

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
show you quickly - how I hooked my

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.520 
show you quickly - how I hooked my
wooden<00:03:47.670> pulley<00:03:47.910> because<00:03:48.270> this<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:49.440> a

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
wooden pulley because this is just a

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.740 
wooden pulley because this is just a
wooden<00:03:49.709> pulley<00:03:50.040> on<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.430> end<00:03:50.550> all<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.209> did<00:03:51.510> was

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
wooden pulley on the end all I did was

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.600 
wooden pulley on the end all I did was
is<00:03:51.990> I<00:03:52.050> drilled<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> hole<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:53.100> once<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.400> wooden

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
is I drilled the hole so once the wooden

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.820 
is I drilled the hole so once the wooden
pulley<00:03:53.820> was<00:03:54.000> on<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.390> just<00:03:54.930> drilled<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.320> hole<00:03:55.530> in

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
pulley was on I just drilled the hole in

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.860 
pulley was on I just drilled the hole in
this<00:03:55.980> block<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.459> wood<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.850> was<00:03:57.450> just<00:03:57.690> big

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
this block of wood that was just big

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.900 
this block of wood that was just big
enough<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.290> get<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.860> head<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.340> beat<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.760> on

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
enough to get the head to beat it on

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.900 
enough to get the head to beat it on
actually<00:04:00.410> over<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:02.100> end<00:04:02.490> of<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.700> bolt

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
actually over the the end of the bolt

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.250 
actually over the the end of the bolt
and<00:04:03.060> then<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:03.360> just<00:04:03.630> put<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> couple<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.170> screws

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
and then I just put a couple of screws

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.640 
and then I just put a couple of screws
in<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.800> then<00:04:04.890> just<00:04:04.920> drove<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> screw<00:04:05.730> into

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
in and then just drove a screw into

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.990 
in and then just drove a screw into
beside<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.830> head<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.160> bolt<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:08.790> and

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
beside the head of the bolt and it's and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.970 
beside the head of the bolt and it's and
it's<00:04:09.240> locked<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.959> in<00:04:10.080> nice<00:04:10.290> it's<00:04:10.470> not<00:04:10.590> super

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
it's locked it in nice it's not super

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.250 
it's locked it in nice it's not super
