00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello everyone today doing a video about 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.090
 how to decorate ordinary glass 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.740
 bottle and for that we will need 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.309
 contour volumetric paints which i 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.340
 did a separate video further 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.109
 take here such a pattern 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.510
 came up with it myself and will be with you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.720
 I'll figure it out on the sly 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.240
 I will do all this gradually and also 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.580
 some kind of alcohol solution to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.210
 degrease the surface of the bottle from me 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.590
 this is salicylic acid 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.360
 just need to wipe the bottle and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.790
 wait a while so she 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.879
 dried up and so for the decor I chose 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.180
 four colors red black blue and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.730
 white outline so as not to get confused I will 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 every layer i draw on chick 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.000
 Now trace these lines, this means 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.960
 mouth finished and proceed to the next 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.360
 just circled 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.609
 in fact there is nothing here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.080
 difficult now you see for yourself 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.310
 and so the beginning I already did as you see 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.409
 circled the main and 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.689
 so as not to get confused as I said I 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.579
 I drive with a pencil this is a layer that I 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.680
 I will do and the next layer we will have 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:19.430
 I try to red as much as possible 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.270
 close 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.270
 dot 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.720
 in this way 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.720
 Rossi of course do 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.140
 so on we have black color again 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.370
 oksana close 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.370
 STIT will be Russia 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.980
 so on with the white outline we draw 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.580
 such a triangle between red 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.580
 dots 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.040
 I'm trying to Douglas cap 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.489
 Between the white dots I put two wonderful 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.489
 points 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.069
 set seeds a few cultures 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:40.349
 the points are already the largest in red 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.349
 contour made 10 points 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.560
 departing from white dots which 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.690
 arranged when such a triangle and 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.520
 Do not forget of course mark on the scheme 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.569
 what you do because you can 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.049
 get confused 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.299
 further put a blue dot such 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:05.670
 big and made three rows of such 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.939
 semicircles consisting of three colors 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.810
 first beonir then red row of dots 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:15.109
 and already a black row of points. I did not count 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.750
 a certain amount of juice turned out 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:21.030
 nothing is important here yet 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.360
 accuracy again so that the drawings and just 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.690
 false right 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.690
 bottles 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.240
 So I already have to help him decorate 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.139
 A beautiful Christmas tree made sense even 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.760
 couple of shtrishkov 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.950
 drew three points 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.310
 no musical 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.070
 and here a couple more points too 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.490
 for general decor 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.490
 executioner so need to enter and 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.060
 enough such 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.550
 the original box is already just a glass 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.890
 bottle 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.040
