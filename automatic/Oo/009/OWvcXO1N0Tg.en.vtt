00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.109
 and then guys all beauty 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.840
 I'm teaching in this video how to get the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.390
 up to 400 at gta san andrÃ©s 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.380
 firstly if you can not turn 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.900
 this city 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.910
 you put the chat at km and not 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.750
 come police behind you 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.300
 and this is the location of the airplane until 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.140
 400 a plane that is very rare in gta san 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 Andreas 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.500
 People have a rpg there, I'll get it. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.530
 because I only have this m 4 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:57.149
 good now let's get the plane inside 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:59.340
 giant hangar is the one there you 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.680
 need lots of quiet to control 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.309
 this plane because it is very difficult to 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.309
 to control 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 now we have to expect it to be for 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.520
 we catch the plane 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.820
 This plane is super big mega hyper. 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.660
 You have to climb this ramp to 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.660
 get on the plane 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:41.760
 finally we got the second largest aircraft bo 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.760
 GTA San Andreas 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.710
 go turning him quietly 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.950
 now go forward 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:18.260
 not ours almost I hit my wing 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.260
 now you will see the plane that way 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:26.510
 beauty on the dam now it's just you walk 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.970
 with up to 400 out there having fun arranging 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.730
 But before you take off you need to take 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:40.799
 the wheels of the airplane you take off the wheels 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:44.750
 pressing the number key of the air 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.750
 up 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.180
 now we have the second largest airplane of the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.700
 and for those who do not know the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.430
 game airplane it calls itself a tamed 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.410
 but we can only catch this plane with fashion 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.079
 and for those who do not know what a mold is 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.090
 Because I say mode is a modification that 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.090
 do have things they do not have in the game 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.790
 I prefer this airplane a thousand times than the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.189
 angle of view is very large and 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.189
 must be more difficult to control 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.269
