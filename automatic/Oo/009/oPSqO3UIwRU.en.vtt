00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
color which is better than nothing I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.070 
color which is better than nothing I
suppose<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.299> other<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.960> are

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
suppose but there are other there are

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
suppose but there are other there are
better<00:01:13.229> ways<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.650> doing<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:13.950> warhammer

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
better ways of doing this warhammer

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.399 
better ways of doing this warhammer
online<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.210> rift<00:01:15.420> both<00:01:15.689> had<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> system

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
online and rift both had the system

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.899 
online and rift both had the system
where<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> could<00:01:16.770> die<00:01:16.950> individual<00:01:17.490> pieces<00:01:17.729> of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
where you could die individual pieces of

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.719 
where you could die individual pieces of
armor<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.330> whatever<00:01:18.600> color<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.200> liked<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.729> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
armor to whatever color you liked and I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.760 
armor to whatever color you liked and I
just<00:01:20.909> think<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> lot<00:01:21.600> better<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
just think that was a lot better of a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
just think that was a lot better of a
system<00:01:23.159> because<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.030> allows<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
system because it just allows you to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.200 
system because it just allows you to
have<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.110> customization<00:01:25.950> whereas<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
have more customization whereas now you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.539 
have more customization whereas now you
can<00:01:27.540> only<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.380> either<00:01:28.530> being<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> same

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
can only have it either being the same

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.580 
can only have it either being the same
color<00:01:29.790> as<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:29.939> chest<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> native

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
color as your chest or just the native

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.740 
color as your chest or just the native
color<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.180> armor<00:01:33.180> itself<00:01:33.509> which<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.079> ideal

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
color of the armor itself which is ideal

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
color of the armor itself which is ideal
so<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.020> ever<00:01:37.049> woken<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.979> morning<00:01:38.400> in

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
star wars and the cantina and thought

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.590 
star wars and the cantina and thought
well<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:41.490> where<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:41.880> dancer<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.390> nice

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
could do a hell of a lot better of a job

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.109 
could do a hell of a lot better of a job
