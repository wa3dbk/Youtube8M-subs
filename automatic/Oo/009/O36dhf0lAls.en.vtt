00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello everyone, guys and welcome 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.520
 within this new gameplay by 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.450
 formula 1 2015 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.330
 this is a video, so here we are, the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.070
 our dear engineer starts talking 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.020
 only our voice however this is a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 very short video just because I have 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.220
 purchased formula 1 2015 as a note 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.840
 I pointed you out on the facebook page 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 that he intended to start one 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.269
 new series a new adventure together 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.519
 to you 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.050
 I will also do the multiplayer in fact me 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.429
 I have already agreed with the command 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.740
 nor Venetian and we'll see a little bit of 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.570
 have fun together of course together with 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.940
 you if any of you were going 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.219
 to participate together we will let you know 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.809
 all the information to succeed in 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.969
 organize maybe some nice race 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.600
 all together then this is a video 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.670
 very short 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.469
 will last a maximum of 5 6 minutes 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.219
 because I want to test the audio quality 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.379
 video and game I saw that the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.000
 settings I can't keep much 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.690
 high because my video card now at 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.420
 about 5 years and the gtx 580 of the asus 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.480
 because precisely if he was asking 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.689
 fails to keep the game to the maximum 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.119
 with everything precisely set to 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.580
 maximum settings so I had to 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.590
 to diminish a little I wanted to make you 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.000
 see a first test drive so i will 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.040
 let us know your opinions on 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.130
 video quality especially on quality 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.900
 audio tell me a little low volume up 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.790
 the volume of the microphone a little yours 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.900
 usual opinions so I set for i 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.460
 video of tomorrow the day after tomorrow and so on 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.159
 obviously if the graphic quality is not there 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.590
 please I will see a little bit of taking 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.890
 a new video card because this one 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.550
 now it's a little bit 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.650
 let's say ancient and does not usually succeed a 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.310
 hold new titles precisely 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.830
 a title released this year and fails 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.290
 to hold the full if the quality 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.479
 let's say video satisfies you then it's not there 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.530
 problem otherwise I'll try to get by 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.810
 with something else 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.950
 however now I want to show you a 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.720
 po the game or not I do not want to do not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.940
 I want to explain nothing or trim nothing 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.729
 I just want to show you 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.050
 here we go to the track, here we are 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.720
 we go out I want to do the same I want to do you 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.820
 just to see a little bit the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.459
 machine we run we say in the track 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.440
 and see the video quality a little bit 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.600
 especially let me know a little bit 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.400
 if you notice differences with the old one 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.260
 formula 1 note shots something of 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.540
 something wrong right now i 'll do a lot 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.750
 test drive and let me know yours 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.019
 opinion is fine then let's get ready 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.550
 we return to the perfect 2015 formula 1 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.180
 the absence really a good guys like 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.630
 you can see 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.630
 I realized the first place son botta 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.810
 well let's put fatty mixture of not 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.810
 go full speed 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.250
 we go great and I have to repeat 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.080
 a little bit the hand but I played 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.910
 for about an hour and I managed to 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.760
 make the first position I'm playing at 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.280
 difficulty level of the expert 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.860
 that a level below the legendary 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.170
 so I'm satisfied with the place 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.620
 I managed to reach ask for 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.320
 go forward in the kids the graphics 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.050
 it's not bad but it 's nothing either 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.060
 no one really special about the medium 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.510
 something up high and there are moments 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.740
 of shots just a few shots it 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.540
 we see in the milk of the third sector 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.580
 in the third part of the circuit now 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.500
 See you in manziana while guys like 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.260
 as it seems to me so far small cut 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.240
 curve the game always quite fluid 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.100
 let me know if you got distracted 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.510
 other 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.280
 that guy who plays coppola 1 with 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.160
 some other configuration 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.710
 if you notice any differences whatsoever 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.660
 Probleino I just want to have a child like that 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.910
 very quick to show me a little as 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.440
 all the technical audio-video set was going 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.280
 here it should be some 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.980
 let's see if we slow down 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.410
 that I make my own impression I do n't make a 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.110
 another round for another test 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.310
 let's go this time, I'll concentrate on it 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.770
 diagnosis managed to improve a little 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.360
 our time and let me know girls 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.639
 you want to see the whole race weekend 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.560
 complete the race only 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.850
 know a little then why we say 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.470
 here in front of us every year we are the 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.150
 back million 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.950
 Obviously we offer braking passages 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.850
 some space 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.850
 here's a ricciardo 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.889
 the last stone Now let's see if 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.419
 we can attempt the attack on the next 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.550
 even poses 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.780
 let's see some 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.600
 let's get up see 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.350
 no, the road is blocked by ricciardo 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.820
 Mamma Mia 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.710
 to throw it out we deserved one 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.600
 penalty 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.040
 but in the meantime we managed to catch 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.600
 the pension but I do not care for 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.400
 now nothing boys only interest me 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.070
 that all the audio video equipment goes 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.620
 well I would like to know if you want to see 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.240
 just the race is or the race and 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.810
 the qualifications maybe a video of 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.490
 free tests 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.580
 I try a video of qualifying a video of 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.580
 race what you want 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.930
 then ok the curved garlic article 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.680
 as they are quite surreal we see 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.289
 as information they still have 15 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.320
 liters of fuel fat mixture 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.220
 let's see a little bit 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.040
 bring this other ass 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.420
 we have no tires for now 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.970
 they are slightly worn because I have 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.610
 already turned four laps with these tires 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.420
 soft 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.449
 flat ahead of us 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.809
 here you notice slowdowns here 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.809
 let me know 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:44.400
 unfortunately we have not done 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:47.510
 we do not have very far Okay boys 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:53.730
 I would now stop for a moment here 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:55.590
 only things so have us are sick of 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.290
 having started let's say we bought 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.030
 this game because it really looks a lot 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.370
 interesting also from the point of view 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.280
 of even if they removed his career 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.110
 they have really improved so many aspects 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.540
 I will show them to you tomorrow due but 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.910
 the day after tomorrow in the next videos 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.470
 this was just a very very video 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.850
 short to see a little bit the 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.040
 qualities now that they were touring 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.040
 box brave slowdowns like that 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.960
 look at slowdowns in the night e 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.370
 it seems to me I am not known after all 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.110
 fluid 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.090
 let me know a little bit then we'll get caught 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.390
 the next adventure guys hello a 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.390
 all
