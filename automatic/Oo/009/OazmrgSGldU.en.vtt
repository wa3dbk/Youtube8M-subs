hey guys this is going to be a review of

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.720 
hey guys this is going to be a review of
the<00:00:04.080> y<00:00:04.290> j<00:00:04.589> fisher<00:00:04.890> cue<00:00:05.310> from<00:00:06.180> cube<00:00:06.509> depot<00:00:06.839> i<00:00:07.730> got

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the y j fisher cue from cube depot i got

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.759 
the y j fisher cue from cube depot i got
this<00:00:08.880> for<00:00:08.940> my<00:00:09.240> birthday<00:00:09.269> if<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.260> haven't<00:00:10.380> seen

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
this for my birthday if you haven't seen

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.609 
this for my birthday if you haven't seen
my<00:00:11.179> unboxing<00:00:12.179> video<00:00:12.719> i<00:00:13.049> cube<00:00:13.440> debone<00:00:13.740> boxing<00:00:14.250> I

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
my unboxing video i cube debone boxing I

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.670 
my unboxing video i cube debone boxing I
got<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.580> really<00:00:18.210> like<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.600> when<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.529> it

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
got it I really like this when I got it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.050 
got it I really like this when I got it
it<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.830> really<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.850> really<00:00:21.359> really<00:00:21.510> loose

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
it was really really really really loose

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.929 
it was really really really really loose
like<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.810> much<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> pieces<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.430> mean

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
like so much that the pieces just I mean

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.490 
like so much that the pieces just I mean
I<00:00:27.119> could<00:00:27.300> pop<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.779> by<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.529> doing<00:00:28.859> like<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
I could pop it by just doing like a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.749 
I could pop it by just doing like a
simple<00:00:31.500> term<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:32.009> something<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.579> I

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
simple term like something like that I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.340 
simple term like something like that I
don't<00:00:32.910> know<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.480> really<00:00:33.719> bad<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.140> had<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
don't know it was really bad so I had to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.880 
don't know it was really bad so I had to
tighten<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:37.309> two<00:00:38.309> turns<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.350> two<00:00:40.350> full

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
tighten it to two turns of two full

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.180 
tighten it to two turns of two full
rotations<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:42.780> 360<00:00:43.559> hopefully<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.040> makes

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
rotations to 360 hopefully that makes

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.139 
rotations to 360 hopefully that makes
sense<00:00:44.280> no<00:00:44.760> no<00:00:45.020> 2<00:00:46.020> 2<00:00:46.500> 360<00:00:47.460> rotations<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
sense no no 2 2 360 rotations of the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
sense no no 2 2 360 rotations of the
screw<00:00:48.800> now<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.730> pretty<00:00:51.000> tight<00:00:51.239> tom<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.899> mean

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
screw now it's pretty tight tom I mean

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.110 
screw now it's pretty tight tom I mean
it<00:00:52.890> doesn't<00:00:53.160> feel<00:00:53.280> tight<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:53.699> I'm<00:00:53.820> solving

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it doesn't feel tight when I'm solving

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.950 
it doesn't feel tight when I'm solving
it<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.110> can't<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:58.649> can't<00:00:59.039> take<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.719> I

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it but I can't I can't take this out I

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.470 
it but I can't I can't take this out I
mean<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.350> could<00:01:01.530> try<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:03.120> don't<00:01:03.300> want

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
mean I could try but I really don't want

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.700 
mean I could try but I really don't want
to<00:01:03.570> break<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.780> home<00:01:04.880> so<00:01:06.229> anyway<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> don't

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
to break it home so anyway if you don't

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.149 
to break it home so anyway if you don't
know<00:01:07.799> anything<00:01:08.010> about<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.369> Fisher<00:01:08.729> cube<00:01:09.830> all<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
know anything about a Fisher cube all it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.780 
know anything about a Fisher cube all it
really<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.939> modded<00:01:12.479> three<00:01:12.750> by<00:01:12.900> three

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
really is is a modded three by three

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.080 
really is is a modded three by three
where<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.119> an<00:01:15.360> edge<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
where this is an edge so this is the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.740 
where this is an edge so this is the
cube<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.080> an<00:01:19.200> edge<00:01:19.970> sorry<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
cube so this is an edge sorry this is a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.320 
cube so this is an edge sorry this is a
corner<00:01:23.000> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> center<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.210> an

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
corner this is the center and this is an

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.149 
corner this is the center and this is an
edge<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:29.930> instead<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:32.900> corner<00:01:33.900> having<00:01:34.740> three

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
edge so instead of a corner having three

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.060 
edge so instead of a corner having three
colors<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.030> corner<00:01:36.299> s2<00:01:36.680> instead<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.770> an<00:01:37.890> edge

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
colors the corner s2 instead of an edge

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.140 
colors the corner s2 instead of an edge
having<00:01:38.430> two<00:01:38.579> colors<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> edge<00:01:39.150> has<00:01:39.329> three

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
having two colors the edge has three

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.760 
having two colors the edge has three
these<00:01:42.150> edges<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.689> middle<00:01:45.960> layer<00:01:46.170> only

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
these edges and the middle layer only

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.940 
these edges and the middle layer only
have<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.189> color<00:01:47.430> rather<00:01:48.240> than<00:01:48.509> two<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
have one color rather than two so it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.760 
have one color rather than two so it
makes<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> kind<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> difficult<00:01:51.530> when<00:01:52.530> solving

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
makes it kind of difficult when solving

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.550 
makes it kind of difficult when solving
and<00:01:53.100> you'll<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.399> parodies<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.299> stuff<00:01:54.659> other

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and you'll get parodies and stuff other

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.550 
and you'll get parodies and stuff other
than<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:56.549> tube<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.560> can

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
than that it's a really good tube I can

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.770 
than that it's a really good tube I can
now<00:01:58.950> solve<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.579> don't<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.540> did<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
now solve it I don't know I know I did a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.870 
now solve it I don't know I know I did a
set<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.259> seven<00:02:01.590> minutes<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:02.040> sounds<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
set of seven minutes all sounds like a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.880 
set of seven minutes all sounds like a
long<00:02:03.090> time<00:02:03.119> but

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
long time but

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.540 
long time but
it<00:02:04.340> gets<00:02:04.550> kind<00:02:04.760> of<00:02:04.820> confusing<00:02:06.400> like<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.430> said

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
it gets kind of confusing like I said

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.140 
it gets kind of confusing like I said
this<00:02:07.820> is<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.000> corner<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.670> if<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:10.819> were<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:10.970> do

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
this is a corner and so if I were to do

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:25.810 
this is a corner and so if I were to do
the<00:02:12.940> see<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.330> were<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.569> go<00:02:23.320> so<00:02:24.320> this<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.610> this

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
the see if I were to go so this and this

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.940 
the see if I were to go so this and this
same<00:02:26.630> exact<00:02:26.959> thing<00:02:28.930> confusing<00:02:29.930> huh<00:02:30.080> how's<00:02:30.920> it

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
same exact thing confusing huh how's it

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.949 
same exact thing confusing huh how's it
think<00:02:31.820> yeah<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.900> very<00:02:33.200> confusing<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.959> but

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
think yeah it's very confusing so but

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.880 
think yeah it's very confusing so but
it's<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.500> fun<00:02:39.680> cube<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.130> solve<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:42.500> can<00:02:42.650> get<00:02:42.769> it

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
it's a fun cube to solve you can get it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.180 
it's a fun cube to solve you can get it
a<00:02:42.950> cube<00:02:43.250> Depot<00:02:44.410> not<00:02:45.410> really<00:02:45.680> sure<00:02:45.920> have<00:02:46.100> a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
a cube Depot not really sure have a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:56.670 
a cube Depot not really sure have a
price<00:02:48.519> but<00:02:49.519> it's<00:02:49.970> not<00:02:50.120> all<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.750> expensive

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.240 

see<00:02:58.959> that's<00:02:59.959> eight<00:03:00.170> bucks<00:03:00.440> he's<00:03:00.800> gotta<00:03:00.950> stop

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
see that's eight bucks he's gotta stop

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.770 
see that's eight bucks he's gotta stop
right<00:03:01.489> now<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:03.040> he<00:03:04.040> might<00:03:06.160> get<00:03:07.160> more<00:03:07.310> soon

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
right now but he might get more soon

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.410 
right now but he might get more soon
other<00:03:08.780> than<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.079> it<00:03:09.350> only<00:03:09.500> comes<00:03:09.739> in<00:03:09.920> white

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
other than that it only comes in white

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.780 
other than that it only comes in white
but<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.480> like<00:03:11.720> white<00:03:11.900> cubes<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.680> bonus<00:03:13.400> for<00:03:13.700> me

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
but I like white cubes so bonus for me

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.930 
but I like white cubes so bonus for me
this<00:03:14.720> white<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.560> don't<00:03:16.280> know<00:03:16.340> if<00:03:16.459> you<00:03:16.549> can<00:03:16.700> see

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
this white I don't know if you can see

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.229 
this white I don't know if you can see
that<00:03:17.120> but<00:03:17.269> it's<00:03:17.450> like<00:03:18.350> not<00:03:18.890> white<00:03:19.640> it's<00:03:20.120> like

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
that but it's like not white it's like

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.360 
that but it's like not white it's like
this<00:03:21.010> sparkly<00:03:22.510> gray<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.870> don't<00:03:24.769> know<00:03:24.860> it's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
this sparkly gray I don't know it's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.660 
this sparkly gray I don't know it's
interesting<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.750> don't<00:03:27.290> not<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:28.400> don't

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
interesting I don't not that I don't

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.390 
interesting I don't not that I don't
like<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.090> just<00:03:29.269> different<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:33.459> yeah

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
like it it's just different and yeah

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.610 
like it it's just different and yeah
hopefully<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:37.910> helped<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:39.200> only<00:03:39.410> real

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
hopefully this helped you the only real

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.740 
hopefully this helped you the only real
problems<00:03:40.190> are<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.880> comes<00:03:41.150> really<00:03:41.420> really

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
problems are that it comes really really

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.740 
problems are that it comes really really
loose<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:43.519> have<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.760> tighten<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.390> can't

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
loose and you have to tighten it I can't

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.560 
loose and you have to tighten it I can't
really<00:03:44.870> tell<00:03:45.110> you<00:03:45.200> corner-cutting<00:03:45.920> because

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
really tell you corner-cutting because

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.800 
really tell you corner-cutting because
it's<00:03:47.570> hard<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:48.040> cut<00:03:49.040> corners<00:03:49.250> on<00:03:49.549> this<00:03:49.810> just

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
it's hard to cut corners on this just

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.920 
it's hard to cut corners on this just
because<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.380> don't<00:03:51.470> hold<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:52.570> but<00:03:53.570> other<00:03:53.750> than

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
because you don't hold it but other than

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.120 
because you don't hold it but other than
that<00:03:54.019> it's<00:03:54.860> really<00:03:55.130> cool<00:03:55.900> puzzle<00:03:56.900> acts<00:03:57.860> just

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
that it's really cool puzzle acts just

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.640 
that it's really cool puzzle acts just
like<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.549> three<00:03:58.850> by<00:03:58.970> three<00:03:59.230> like<00:04:00.230> if<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.560> were

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
like a three by three like if you were

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.050 
like a three by three like if you were
to<00:04:00.739> mess<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:00.950> up<00:04:01.160> you<00:04:01.340> can<00:04:01.459> solve<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.760> just<00:04:01.970> like

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
to mess it up you can solve it just like

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.349 
to mess it up you can solve it just like
a<00:04:02.090> three<00:04:02.359> by<00:04:02.480> three<00:04:02.510> just<00:04:03.140> got<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.380> learn

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
a three by three just got to learn

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:10.240 
a three by three just got to learn
parity<00:04:05.500> method<00:04:06.500> which<00:04:06.739> is<00:04:07.100> pretty<00:04:07.340> much<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:09.250> you

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
parity method which is pretty much a you

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.830 
parity method which is pretty much a you
perm<00:04:10.660> of<00:04:11.660> what<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.470> don't<00:04:12.860> like<00:04:12.950> is

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
perm of what I don't like is

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.430 
perm of what I don't like is
fees<00:04:14.849> this<00:04:15.849> is<00:04:16.000> absolutely<00:04:16.440> ridiculously

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
fees this is absolutely ridiculously

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.050 
fees this is absolutely ridiculously
annoying<00:04:17.769> ah<00:04:18.389> these<00:04:19.389> caps<00:04:20.549> don't<00:04:21.549> stay<00:04:21.820> on<00:04:21.850> I

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
annoying ah these caps don't stay on I

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.719 
annoying ah these caps don't stay on I
don't<00:04:22.240> know<00:04:22.300> why<00:04:22.570> they're<00:04:22.780> not<00:04:22.810> glued<00:04:23.350> in<00:04:23.729> it

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
don't know why they're not glued in it

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.219 
don't know why they're not glued in it
really<00:04:25.060> doesn't<00:04:25.479> make<00:04:25.570> any<00:04:25.750> sense<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.139> me

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
really doesn't make any sense to me

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.800 
really doesn't make any sense to me
because<00:04:27.100> they<00:04:27.580> only<00:04:27.760> have<00:04:28.060> one<00:04:28.300> color<00:04:28.510> they

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
because they only have one color they

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.500 
because they only have one color they
should<00:04:28.990> just<00:04:29.020> be<00:04:29.380> glued<00:04:29.710> in<00:04:29.919> but<00:04:30.790> they<00:04:31.150> fall

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
should just be glued in but they fall

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.980 
should just be glued in but they fall
off<00:04:31.720> ridiculously<00:04:32.680> easily<00:04:33.190> um<00:04:33.840> when<00:04:34.840> you're

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
off ridiculously easily um when you're

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.110 
off ridiculously easily um when you're
solving<00:04:35.229> it<00:04:35.590> when<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:36.100> carry<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.699> in<00:04:36.790> my<00:04:36.820> pocket

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
solving it when I carry it in my pocket

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.590 
solving it when I carry it in my pocket
the<00:04:37.840> these<00:04:38.800> things<00:04:39.070> just<00:04:39.250> like<00:04:39.460> pop<00:04:40.180> off<00:04:40.419> like

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
the these things just like pop off like

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.050 
the these things just like pop off like
I'll<00:04:41.050> be<00:04:41.260> turning<00:04:41.440> in<00:04:41.740> boom<00:04:42.040> they'll<00:04:42.370> pop<00:04:42.820> off

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
I'll be turning in boom they'll pop off

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.240 
I'll be turning in boom they'll pop off
and<00:04:43.449> then<00:04:44.199> you<00:04:44.290> have<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.500> make<00:04:44.680> sure<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:45.010> put

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
and then you have to make sure you put

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
and then you have to make sure you put
it<00:04:45.280> in<00:04:45.490> right<00:04:45.520> because<00:04:45.970> there's<00:04:46.150> like<00:04:46.240> a

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
it in right because there's like a

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.730 
it in right because there's like a
bigger<00:04:47.370> stick<00:04:48.370> whoa<00:04:49.090> down<00:04:49.990> here<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.650> a

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
bigger stick whoa down here and a

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.680 
bigger stick whoa down here and a
littler<00:04:51.100> one<00:04:51.280> up<00:04:51.400> here<00:04:51.669> you<00:04:52.450> go<00:04:52.630> there's<00:04:52.960> a

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
littler one up here you go there's a

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.210 
littler one up here you go there's a
flute<00:04:55.690> McKittrick<00:04:56.139> focuses<00:04:56.889> there's<00:04:57.130> a

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
flute McKittrick focuses there's a

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.129 
flute McKittrick focuses there's a
little<00:04:57.430> indent<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.240> got<00:04:58.419> to<00:04:58.510> put<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.690> indent

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
little indent you got to put the indent

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.580 
little indent you got to put the indent
with<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.440> bigger<00:05:00.030> clip<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.990> I'll<00:05:02.229> stay<00:05:02.470> in

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
with the bigger clip and I'll stay in

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.700 
with the bigger clip and I'll stay in
for<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:02.830> while<00:05:05.340> yeah<00:05:06.340> oh<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.330> then<00:05:07.479> I<00:05:07.780> showed

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
for a while yeah oh and then I showed

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.650 
for a while yeah oh and then I showed
you<00:05:08.860> this<00:05:09.070> in<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.460> end<00:05:09.639> of<00:05:09.789> my<00:05:09.910> unboxing<00:05:10.180> but

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
you this in the end of my unboxing but

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.650 
you this in the end of my unboxing but
these<00:05:11.110> are<00:05:11.289> this<00:05:11.500> is<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.710> center<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.880> they

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
these are this is the center and they

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.260 
these are this is the center and they
just<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:14.560> much<00:05:14.680> easier<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:15.130> take<00:05:15.820> off<00:05:16.030> the

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
just so much easier to take off the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.320
