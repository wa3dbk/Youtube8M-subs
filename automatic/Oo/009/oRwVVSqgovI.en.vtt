00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.800
 so as a base for ice cream 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.090
 need cream milk yolks and 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.609
 sweetener sugar or in this case 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.640
 i will take honey and any supplements i take 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.369
 such proportions on 4 yolks of chicken eggs 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.909
 200 milliliters of milk 200 milliliters 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.149
 cream 

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:38.219
 you can vary making ice cream 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.409
 less fatty add less cream and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.210
 less yolks yolks in this case 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.039
 it is better to replace with a part as little too 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.519
 can corn not only take starch 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.199
 not potato to give thickness 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.339
 because yolks give not only 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.039
 other fatty ice cream and sugar thickness 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:59.190
 take honey or honey better add oil 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.110
 when boiling do not bring to boil 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.739
 milk and then a little into the cooled mass and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.380
 quality 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.079
 Matiz you and most often taken vanillin 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.430
 maybe cocoa anything I take 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:18.270
 this case is vanillin and i will make up 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.979
 amaretto dipped raisin butterfly 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.750
 there was such an australian ice cream rum with 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.020
 raisin or something to me she is so 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.719
 I remember very tasty thunder me 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.740
 nope but i will make no less fragrant 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:37.790
 fragrant amaretto stunned 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.080
 I will add to vision because a couple of canteens 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.270
 spoons is 30 milliliters approximately 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.210
 enough 20 maximum 40 milliliters 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.060
 for an additive on that amount 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.280
 products not only in yuma even if you 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.880
 add ice cream enough 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:07.869
 I will mix a little something 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:10.810
 and leave the yolks and milk 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.370
 first niv now i'm a little bit 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.370
 I mix well homogeneous mass 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:29.120
 add the rest of the milk turn on 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.860
 small or medium fire and when 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.370
 constant stirring will bring to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.890
 thickening to boil no need to bring 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.489
 creepy thicken much earlier here 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.560
 you see 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.549
 if you bring to a boil help 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.400
 curl up in some recipes 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.670
 more precisely even more often immediately add 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.239
 cream with milk but I prefer 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.940
 whip cream separately cold and already 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.640
 solidified in a milky vein 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.769
 to drive little by little cream and then 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.769
 your ice cream will be more airy 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:13.609
 here to such a state thickened 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:18.260
 mass remove it from heat mass stirring 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:21.170
 need to cool somewhere to 40 45 degrees 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.310
 and only then add vanilla 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.000
 powder and honey because honey 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.520
 converted to not good substances 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.860
 after 45 degrees by heating though and 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.860
 ice cream as a little too useful 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.460
 it remains but at least not harmful and 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.860
 can be more natural than sugar to 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.020
 the same taste of honey with these options 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:51.540
 Supplements that I chose very well 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:54.350
 mix gently 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.510
 ingredients until completely dissolved 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:05.310
 cooled to room temperature mass 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:07.680
 we put a freezer and 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.480
 time we get out of the fridge well 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:17.000
 chilled cream is very good 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.000
 chilled and with a volume of their strong foam 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.400
 cream ready gone half an hour I 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.040
 pulled out of the freezer 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.800
 our freezing mixture will add to it 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:42.000
 part of the cream we need to add in 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:49.880
 three or four receiving slivochki carefully 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:54.890
 mix and put the mixture again 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:05:00.570
 freezer and cream 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:12.110
 fridge after another thirty minutes 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:12.110
 get out again add some more cream 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:23.179
 and mix again in half an hour 

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:27.759
 freezer again 

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:32.989
 take out go freeze already 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:39.909
 shuffle and I'll probably add already 

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:39.909
 the rest of the cream finally knead and 

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:46.369
 put the freezer on 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.179
 opportunity a couple of times 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:49.179
 I will mix 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.240
 after adding the remaining cream I still 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.600
 mixed a couple of times with breaks 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.290
 ice cream and see it came to such 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:13.110
 consistency thick enough cream 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:18.320
 Now I will add to it a raisin which is 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:22.440
 all this time well absorbed liquor 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:27.830
 mix and put already freeze 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:32.510
 for a few hours three or four hours 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.510
 shifted more suitable container and 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.580
 put finally freezer 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.180
 So
