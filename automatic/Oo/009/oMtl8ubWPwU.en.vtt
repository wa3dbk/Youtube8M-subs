00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
for that I'm going to give it a solid

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.949 
for that I'm going to give it a solid
eight<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:17.120> know<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.239> just<00:04:17.390> can't<00:04:17.690> give<00:04:17.840> it

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
any more than that but that's just

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.039 
any more than that but that's just
because<00:04:19.340> there<00:04:19.669> was<00:04:19.820> very<00:04:20.060> little<00:04:20.269> exposition

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
because there was very little exposition

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.290 
because there was very little exposition
in<00:04:21.169> this<00:04:21.289> chapter<00:04:21.910> even<00:04:22.910> though<00:04:23.030> there<00:04:23.180> is

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
in this chapter even though there is

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.100 
in this chapter even though there is
very<00:04:23.570> little<00:04:23.810> too

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
very little too

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.689 
very little too
have<00:04:24.259> but<00:04:24.860> I'd<00:04:24.949> still<00:04:25.159> like<00:04:25.219> to<00:04:25.400> learn<00:04:25.639> a

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:26.980 
have but I'd still like to learn a
little<00:04:25.939> bit<00:04:26.060> more<00:04:26.389> about<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.840> whole

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990

substitute shinigami thing and I'm sure

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.330 
substitute shinigami thing and I'm sure
that<00:04:30.199> you<00:04:30.439> guys<00:04:30.590> want<00:04:30.800> to<00:04:30.860> know<00:04:30.979> that<00:04:31.189> too

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
that you guys want to know that too

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.439

because they're being very vague about

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.469 
because they're being very vague about
it<00:04:32.750> even<00:04:33.020> byakuya<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.159> this<00:04:34.280> chapter<00:04:34.699> was<00:04:34.939> you

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
it even byakuya and this chapter was you

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.179 
it even byakuya and this chapter was you
know<00:04:35.599> he<00:04:35.870> brushed<00:04:36.409> it<00:04:36.560> aside<00:04:36.680> when<00:04:37.099> they

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:37.189 
know he brushed it aside when they

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:38.350 
know he brushed it aside when they
started<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.550> talk<00:04:37.729> about<00:04:37.879> it<00:04:38.150> at<00:04:38.240> the
