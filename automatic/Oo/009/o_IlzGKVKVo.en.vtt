00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
my USB turntable so on the front here we

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.490 
my USB turntable so on the front here we
have<00:00:29.370> our<00:00:29.700> speed<00:00:30.090> button<00:00:30.450> which<00:00:30.990> allows<00:00:31.170> you

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500

have our speed button which allows you
to<00:00:31.620> choose<00:00:31.890> between<00:00:31.969> 33<00:00:32.969> rpm<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.690> 45

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to choose between 33 rpm and 45

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.830 
to choose between 33 rpm and 45
revolutions<00:00:34.559> per<00:00:35.219> minute<00:00:35.450> then<00:00:36.450> obviously

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
revolutions per minute then obviously

you've got your up-and-down for your
needle<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.530> by<00:00:44.010> pressing<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.490> either<00:00:44.760> moves

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
needle so by pressing this either moves

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.569 
needle so by pressing this either moves
the<00:00:45.750> needle<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.440> off<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> record<00:00:47.220> or

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the needle up so off the record or

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
the needle up so off the record or
pressing<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> again<00:00:48.690> will<00:00:48.840> actually<00:00:49.230> bring<00:00:50.040> it

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
pressing it again will actually bring it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
pressing it again will actually bring it
down<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.579> put<00:00:50.790> it<00:00:50.820> back<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.540> record<00:00:51.840> to

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
have a size select so obviously

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.060 
have a size select so obviously
selecting<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> size<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.079> records<00:00:58.500> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
selecting the size of your records so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.819 
selecting the size of your records so
your<00:00:59.430> 30<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.660> 30<00:01:00.930> centimeters<00:01:01.590> which<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
your 30 here is 30 centimeters which is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
your 30 here is 30 centimeters which is
obviously<00:01:02.280> your<00:01:02.460> 12<00:01:02.790> inch<00:01:02.940> records<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.690> then

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
obviously your 12 inch records and then

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.260 
obviously your 12 inch records and then
you've<00:01:04.199> got<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.470> 1770<00:01:05.430> our<00:01:05.640> centimeters

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you've got your 1770 our centimeters

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.620 
you've got your 1770 our centimeters
here<00:01:06.420> which<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:06.990> seven-inch<00:01:07.770> records

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
here which is your seven-inch records

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.090 
here which is your seven-inch records
okay<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.689> I'll<00:01:10.139> give<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.439> some<00:01:10.499> of<00:01:10.679> the<00:01:10.799> specs

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
okay so I'll give you some of the specs

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.700 
okay so I'll give you some of the specs
here<00:01:11.249> so<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.999> weighs<00:01:12.240> roughly<00:01:12.509> around<00:01:12.960> 2.5

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
here so it weighs roughly around 2.5

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.209 
here so it weighs roughly around 2.5
kilos<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:14.880> relatively<00:01:15.389> robust<00:01:16.219> it's

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
kilos so it's relatively robust it's

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.029 
kilos so it's relatively robust it's
going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> turntable<00:01:18.060> platter<00:01:18.329> of<00:01:19.039> 195

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
going to turntable platter of 195

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.190 
going to turntable platter of 195
millimeters<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.880> diameter<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.359> it's<00:01:21.929> got<00:01:22.109> an

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
millimeters in diameter and it's got an

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.999 
millimeters in diameter and it's got an
SN<00:01:22.619> ratio<00:01:23.069> of<00:01:23.459> more<00:01:23.789> than<00:01:24.030> 50<00:01:24.569> decibels<00:01:25.009> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
SN ratio of more than 50 decibels and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.010 
SN ratio of more than 50 decibels and
the<00:01:26.490> best<00:01:26.700> thing<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.939> all<00:01:27.149> obviously<00:01:27.420> it's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the best thing of all obviously it's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.980
