like that , yeah
both<00:01:13.170> use<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.610> well<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> can't<00:01:15.360> connect

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
both use so well if you can't connect

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
both use so well if you can't connect

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
probably the colors right there let's go

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.950 
probably the colors right there let's go
get<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> fuse<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.100> popping<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.450> like

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
broke look at its label - it's like it's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.950 
broke look at its label - it's like it's
cooked<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> edges<00:01:33.860> it's<00:01:34.860> too<00:01:35.040> hot<00:01:35.220> here

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
cooked on the edges it's too hot here

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.179 
cooked on the edges it's too hot here
that's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.049> problem<00:01:37.409> lights<00:01:37.770> off

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
that's a problem lights off

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.249 
that's a problem lights off
oh<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.520> why<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> light<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.329> so

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
oh you know why the light was on so

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.260 
oh you know why the light was on so
we'll<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.829> around<00:01:40.920> around<00:01:41.340> here

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.040 

this

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.260 

like<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:50.090> not<00:01:51.090> tight<00:01:51.330> gas<00:01:51.780> cap<00:01:52.080> is<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.409> tight

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
like that not tight gas cap is not tight

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.030 
like that not tight gas cap is not tight
on<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.330> you've<00:01:54.630> app<00:01:56.150> you've<00:01:57.150> got<00:01:57.180> system

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
on that you've app you've got system

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.990 
on that you've app you've got system
tested<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.160> circuit<00:01:59.520> or<00:02:01.490> purge<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.760> tank

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
tested the circuit or purge your tank

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.230 
tested the circuit or purge your tank
rather<00:02:03.770> probably<00:02:04.770> had<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.010> massive<00:02:05.280> leak<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
rather probably had a massive leak so it

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.990 
rather probably had a massive leak so it
triggered<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.570> light<00:02:07.340> gas<00:02:08.340> cap<00:02:08.580> late

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
triggered the light gas cap late

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360 
triggered the light gas cap late
probably<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.869> small<00:02:10.110> evap<00:02:10.679> leak<00:02:10.920> or<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.130> large

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
probably a small evap leak or a large

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.690
