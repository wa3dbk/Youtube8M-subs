00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.130
 Digital cameras are advancing with higher functionality and lower prices 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.240
 The way to enjoy digital cameras has also expanded during the partnership 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.759
 is 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.490
 Opportunity interval photography and light with shift photo 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.109
 We introduce two interesting expressions using the theme of today 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.130
 But that means interval shooting 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.199
 In the English language or speed is called the shooting image 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.330
 Even if we can do this together, recently 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.390
 It is grabbing the garden of this 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.660
 Adoption is expected by recording the growth of plants etc. 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.320
 Right 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.370
 If it could be once in 5 seconds of the movie 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.540
 I can not do anything about business hours 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.640
 Harada which is attractive for animation by connecting annual 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.159
 Wipe your eyes 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.650
 30 days in the field of times that has become US Mira 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.200
 In some cases it can be taken over a year 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.060
 That's right 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.570
 That means that the town is getting tired of it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.640
 It's not that I can get in a lot of short time 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.970
 I want to try 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.260
 I will not give up again 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.910
 For example, set the development interval once every 10 minutes 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.860
 Start shooting just by pressing 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.490
 Photos are recorded as a video file in usb memory 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.000
 Will be 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.110
 Let's fix it so that previous work takeshita does not move 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.970
 On the other hand, single-lens reflex cameras 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.370
 Use and shoot 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.530
 Here's a shot by video editing software 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.910
 Practice side by side 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.990
 Then start shooting 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.990
 Then just wait for a while 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.260
 Pictures that there is no mini-ground 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.660
 There is a form that you can see in commercials and posters recently 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.390
 A site where you can make photos like this 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.660
 It was 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.840
 Choose a picture of the earth if you ask and make a simple setting January photo 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.690
 Finished 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.870
 It works well when you prepare photos such as Mihara 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.870
 That's right 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.219
 Well what kind of image was taken of interval photography 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.339
 Is not it 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.339
 From there 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.189
 After all what's fun is it up to now 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.030
 Sun opened 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.680
 Let's play in any form or play Bancroft 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.080
 It is becoming a player, but the player who was doing is to the end 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.290
 It's a still image, but I took the vacant time that was held in front 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.569
 It is necessary but Yamashita Matsuko what kind of thing 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.890
 I knew it was or something was taken into consideration 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.269
 I want to learn something that came out somehow 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.899
 But you can get it 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.409
 I was active with that there
