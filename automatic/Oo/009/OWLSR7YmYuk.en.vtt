00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
hey this David with the Shepherd school

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.749 
hey this David with the Shepherd school
and<00:00:15.350> let's<00:00:15.920> show<00:00:16.039> you<00:00:16.100> how<00:00:16.219> to<00:00:16.279> make<00:00:16.519> some

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:16.759 
and let's show you how to make some

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.700 
and let's show you how to make some
sugar<00:00:16.999> solution<00:00:17.630> for<00:00:17.869> feeding<00:00:18.259> your<00:00:18.410> beads

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
sugar solution for feeding your beads

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.909 
sugar solution for feeding your beads
now<00:00:19.669> there's<00:00:20.119> all<00:00:20.269> sorts<00:00:20.570> of<00:00:20.659> recipes<00:00:20.919> for

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
now there's all sorts of recipes for

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.370 
now there's all sorts of recipes for
feeding<00:00:22.279> sugar<00:00:22.550> solution<00:00:23.239> and<00:00:23.449> a<00:00:23.960> lot<00:00:24.109> of<00:00:24.259> it

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
feeding sugar solution and a lot of it

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.790 
feeding sugar solution and a lot of it
depends<00:00:24.859> on<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.189> time<00:00:25.519> of<00:00:25.550> year<00:00:26.230> how<00:00:27.230> thick

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
depends on the time of year how thick

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.269 
depends on the time of year how thick
you<00:00:28.009> want<00:00:28.039> it<00:00:28.339> to<00:00:28.489> be<00:00:29.619> we're<00:00:30.619> gonna<00:00:30.859> we're

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
you want it to be we're gonna we're

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.820 
you want it to be we're gonna we're
gonna<00:00:31.399> do<00:00:31.849> about<00:00:32.029> two<00:00:32.630> to<00:00:32.810> one<00:00:33.050> here<00:00:33.560> about

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
gonna do about two to one here about

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.570 
gonna do about two to one here about
half<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.280> half<00:00:34.810> which<00:00:36.010> you<00:00:37.010> know<00:00:37.160> some<00:00:37.430> people

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
half and half which you know some people

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.370 
half and half which you know some people
could<00:00:37.850> disagree<00:00:38.180> with<00:00:38.480> but<00:00:38.720> my<00:00:38.930> bees<00:00:39.170> are

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
could disagree with but my bees are

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
could disagree with but my bees are
liking<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:39.890> they're<00:00:39.980> doing<00:00:40.220> real<00:00:40.370> good

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
liking it and they're doing real good

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.670 
liking it and they're doing real good
now<00:00:41.240> some<00:00:41.660> people<00:00:41.990> are<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.110> hundred<00:00:42.410> percent

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
now some people are a hundred percent

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.880 
now some people are a hundred percent
against<00:00:43.400> feeding<00:00:44.270> sugar<00:00:44.660> solution<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.500> bees

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
against feeding sugar solution to bees

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.860 
against feeding sugar solution to bees
and<00:00:46.160> you<00:00:46.790> know<00:00:46.910> typically<00:00:47.360> I'd<00:00:47.630> probably

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
and you know typically I'd probably

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.200 
and you know typically I'd probably
agree<00:00:48.050> with<00:00:48.500> them<00:00:48.650> it's<00:00:48.830> a<00:00:48.950> lot<00:00:49.130> better<00:00:49.430> for

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
agree with them it's a lot better for

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.470 
agree with them it's a lot better for
them<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.660> get<00:00:51.350> natural<00:00:51.620> ill<00:00:52.040> you<00:00:52.970> know<00:00:53.090> natural

them to get natural ill you know natural

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.330 
them to get natural ill you know natural
nectar<00:00:53.810> and<00:00:53.930> stuff<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.350> eat<00:00:54.830> honey

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
nectar and stuff and eat honey

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.620 
nectar and stuff and eat honey
rather<00:00:55.850> than<00:00:56.150> sugar<00:00:56.980> but<00:00:57.980> in<00:00:58.250> this<00:00:58.910> case<00:00:59.210> we've

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
rather than sugar but in this case we've

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.170 
rather than sugar but in this case we've
had<00:00:59.870> an<00:00:59.990> unusually<00:01:00.140> mild<00:01:00.560> winner<00:01:01.160> right<00:01:01.910> and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
had an unusually mild winner right and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.229 
had an unusually mild winner right and
my<00:01:02.450> bees<00:01:03.309> they<00:01:04.309> all<00:01:04.489> came<00:01:04.670> through<00:01:04.730> the<00:01:04.970> winter

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
my bees they all came through the winter

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.570 
my bees they all came through the winter
didn't<00:01:05.750> have<00:01:05.900> any<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.680> know<00:01:06.710> colony<00:01:07.250> failures

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
didn't have any you know colony failures

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.820 
didn't have any you know colony failures
or<00:01:07.760> whatever<00:01:08.090> but<00:01:08.570> now<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:08.990> it's<00:01:09.140> warm<00:01:09.530> the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
or whatever but now that it's warm the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.910 
or whatever but now that it's warm the
bees<00:01:10.070> are<00:01:10.340> just<00:01:10.640> swarming<00:01:11.210> like<00:01:11.420> crazy<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.440> we

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
bees are just swarming like crazy and we

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.649 
bees are just swarming like crazy and we
checked<00:01:13.190> our<00:01:13.340> bees<00:01:13.610> yesterday<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.330> they<00:01:14.450> have

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
checked our bees yesterday and they have

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.540 
checked our bees yesterday and they have
totally<00:01:15.110> ate<00:01:15.320> through<00:01:15.590> all<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.010> sugar<00:01:16.310> stores

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
totally ate through all the sugar stores

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.370 
totally ate through all the sugar stores
there's<00:01:16.790> no<00:01:17.060> honey<00:01:17.560> in<00:01:18.560> in<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.780> boxes<00:01:20.780> at<00:01:20.960> all

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
there's no honey in in the boxes at all

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.730 
there's no honey in in the boxes at all
but<00:01:22.070> there's<00:01:22.310> not<00:01:22.520> really<00:01:22.790> enough<00:01:23.270> blooms<00:01:23.780> for

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
but there's not really enough blooms for

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.210 
but there's not really enough blooms for
them<00:01:25.010> to<00:01:25.870> get<00:01:26.870> enough<00:01:27.170> honey<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.560> survive<00:01:27.920> so

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
them to get enough honey to survive so

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.190 
them to get enough honey to survive so
we're<00:01:28.370> feeding<00:01:28.610> them<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.780> they<00:01:29.960> don't

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
we're feeding them so that they don't

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.160 
we're feeding them so that they don't
die<00:01:30.620> okay<00:01:31.120> so<00:01:32.120> you<00:01:32.180> can<00:01:32.630> disagree<00:01:32.900> with

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
die okay so you can disagree with

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.039 
die okay so you can disagree with
feeding<00:01:33.409> them<00:01:33.530> sugar<00:01:33.640> but<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.880> really<00:01:35.299> I'm<00:01:35.780> not

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
feeding them sugar but I really I'm not

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.080 
feeding them sugar but I really I'm not
buying<00:01:36.500> honey<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.220> feed<00:01:37.400> them<00:01:37.549> that's<00:01:37.820> just

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
buying honey to feed them that's just

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.940 
buying honey to feed them that's just
too<00:01:38.540> expensive<00:01:38.840> okay<00:01:39.440> so<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:40.970> pretty<00:01:41.240> simple

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
too expensive okay so it's pretty simple

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.160 
too expensive okay so it's pretty simple
we<00:01:42.950> buy<00:01:43.159> our<00:01:43.220> sugar<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.030> twenty<00:01:44.659> five<00:01:44.840> pound

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
we buy our sugar and twenty five pound

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.810 
we buy our sugar and twenty five pound
bags<00:01:45.440> because<00:01:45.770> it's<00:01:45.950> cheaper<00:01:46.400> if<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.520> make<00:01:46.790> a

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
bags because it's cheaper if you make a

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.510 
bags because it's cheaper if you make a
lot<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.180> wine<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.690> do<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.229> lot<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.530> sugar

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
lot of wine you do a lot of sugar

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.890 
lot of wine you do a lot of sugar
solution<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.090> need<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.299> cheap<00:01:50.570> way<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.750> do

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
solution you need a cheap way to do

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.320 
solution you need a cheap way to do
sugar<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.799> just<00:01:52.130> keep<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.430> in<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.760> food<00:01:53.000> grade

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
sugar so I just keep it in a food grade

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.770 
sugar so I just keep it in a food grade
bucket<00:01:54.290> with<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.470> gamma<00:01:54.770> seal<00:01:55.100> lid<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:56.479> my<00:01:56.600> wife

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
bucket with a gamma seal lid and my wife

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.539 
bucket with a gamma seal lid and my wife
in<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.110> background<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.710> going<00:01:57.740> nuts<00:01:58.310> because

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
in the background is going nuts because

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.090 
in the background is going nuts because
she<00:01:59.000> hates<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.510> when<00:01:59.540> I<00:01:59.689> do<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.200> because<00:02:00.530> I

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
she hates it when I do this because I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.820 
she hates it when I do this because I
get<00:02:01.610> sugar<00:02:01.970> all<00:02:02.150> over<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.540> place<00:02:02.840> she

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
get sugar all over the place she

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.100 
get sugar all over the place she
normally<00:02:04.340> makes<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.729> sugar<00:02:04.970> solution<00:02:05.540> for<00:02:05.869> me

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
normally makes the sugar solution for me

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.710 
normally makes the sugar solution for me
but<00:02:07.070> when<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.280> came<00:02:07.400> home<00:02:07.820> today<00:02:08.060> she'd<00:02:08.509> already

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
but when I came home today she'd already

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.140 
but when I came home today she'd already
done<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.670> because<00:02:10.670> she's<00:02:10.880> good

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
done it because she's good

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.069 
done it because she's good
that<00:02:11.420> way<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:13.329> came<00:02:14.329> home<00:02:14.450> with<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:14.780> idea

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
that way and I came home with the idea

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:20.440 
that way and I came home with the idea
to<00:02:15.200> make<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.379> video<00:02:15.799> so<00:02:16.519> we<00:02:17.450> have<00:02:17.659> to<00:02:19.450> compromise

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
to make a video so we have to compromise

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.929 
to make a video so we have to compromise
and<00:02:21.110> since<00:02:21.620> she<00:02:21.799> doesn't<00:02:22.040> want<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.459> get<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
and since she doesn't want to get on the

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.000 
and since she doesn't want to get on the
tape<00:02:23.180> because<00:02:24.049> you<00:02:24.170> might<00:02:24.379> see<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.769> she's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
tape because you might see that she's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.679 
tape because you might see that she's
pregnant<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:26.680> hadn't<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.769> do<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.040> right<00:02:31.569> so<00:02:32.569> we
