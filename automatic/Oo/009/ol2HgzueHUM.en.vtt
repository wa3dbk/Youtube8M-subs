dimension<00:00:07.890> mod<00:00:08.069> called<00:00:08.460> Arriba's<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.360> believe

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
dimension mod called Arriba's I believe

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.820 
dimension mod called Arriba's I believe
that's<00:00:10.080> how<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.230> pronounce<00:00:10.290> it

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
that's how you pronounce it

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.070 
that's how you pronounce it
but<00:00:11.370> anyway<00:00:11.700> what<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.450> it's<00:00:12.840> kind<00:00:13.049> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
but anyway what it is is it's kind of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.589 
but anyway what it is is it's kind of
like<00:00:13.290> basically<00:00:13.980> oh<00:00:14.370> it's<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.150> dimension

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
like basically oh it's a dimension

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.760 
like basically oh it's a dimension
that's<00:00:15.750> kind<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:15.990> like<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.289> looks<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
that's kind of like that looks like the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.470 
that's kind of like that looks like the
nether<00:00:16.980> except<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.580> basically<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.970> cave<00:00:18.210> you

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
nether except it's basically a cave you

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210 
nether except it's basically a cave you
go<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.320> then<00:00:19.590> there's<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:19.890> all<00:00:20.070> these

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
go in it and then there's like all these

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.460 
go in it and then there's like all these
bugs<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.730> stuff<00:00:20.820> there's<00:00:21.210> ores<00:00:21.510> there's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
bugs and stuff there's ores there's

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.170 
bugs and stuff there's ores there's
different<00:00:22.980> biomes<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.730> now<00:00:23.850> there's<00:00:24.029> only

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
different biomes as of now there's only

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.480 
different biomes as of now there's only
the<00:00:24.390> jungle<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.199> we'll<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.890> into<00:00:26.099> more<00:00:26.400> than

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the jungle but we'll get into more than

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.640 
the jungle but we'll get into more than
that<00:00:26.609> later<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.990> yeah<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.289> pretty<00:00:28.410> cool

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
that later and so yeah it's pretty cool

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to say how you make the portal basically

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.760 
to say how you make the portal basically
the<00:00:32.520> way<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.669> make<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> portal<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.510> give

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
the way you make the portal is you give

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.930 
the way you make the portal is you give
the<00:00:34.770> same<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.309> another<00:00:35.550> portal

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the same way you make another portal

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.220 
the same way you make another portal
with<00:00:36.559> cobblestone<00:00:38.210> not<00:00:39.210> cobblestone<00:00:39.719> mossy

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
with cobblestone not cobblestone mossy

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
with cobblestone not cobblestone mossy
brick<00:00:40.860> stone<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.059> place<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.360> all

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
brick stone and then you place it all

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.880 
brick stone and then you place it all
down<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.809> then<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.989> use<00:00:43.170> what's<00:00:43.379> called<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
down and then you use what's called a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.580 
down and then you use what's called a
portal<00:00:44.550> activator<00:00:45.030> which<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.020> made<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.469> two

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
portal activator which is made with two

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
portal activator which is made with two
sticks<00:00:47.190> placed<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.329> spider<00:00:48.660> eye

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
sticks placed like so and a spider eye

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.930 
sticks placed like so and a spider eye
at<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> top<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
at the top and that and then you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.979 
at the top and that and then you
right-click<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.840> would<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
right-click it just like you would a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.119 
right-click it just like you would a
splint<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.350> steel<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.860> makes<00:00:52.980> your

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
splint and steel and then it makes your

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.920 
splint and steel and then it makes your
portal<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.000> once<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.510> within<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
portal but once you are within the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.330 
portal but once you are within the
dimension<00:00:55.410> you'll<00:00:55.620> realize<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:56.309> are

they would be you can also notice that
there's<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> lot<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.990> glowstone<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
there's a lot of glowstone now I I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550 
there's a lot of glowstone now I I
looked<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.240> mod<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.840> apparently<00:01:25.259> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
looked on the mod and apparently this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350 
looked on the mod and apparently this
glowstone<00:01:26.070> will<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.759> forever<00:01:27.000> they

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
glowstone will not be here forever they

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.520 
glowstone will not be here forever they
will<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.630> using<00:01:27.900> their<00:01:28.020> own<00:01:28.200> light<00:01:28.500> source

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
will be using their own light source

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.679 
will be using their own light source
eventually<00:01:29.520> not<00:01:30.060> sure<00:01:30.240> where<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.450> gonna<00:01:30.600> be

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
eventually not sure where it's gonna be

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
eventually not sure where it's gonna be
but<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:31.590> there<00:01:31.860> will<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.040> glowstone

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
but as for now there will be glowstone

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
but as for now there will be glowstone
now<00:01:33.299> within<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.720> mod<00:01:33.960> there<00:01:34.320> are<00:01:34.350> many

amber in a row it makes one amber break
and<00:02:13.540> with<00:02:14.109> that<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.319> mean<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.739> kind<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:14.920> cool

you could like make a houses that cause

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.509 
you could like make a houses that cause
it's<00:02:16.420> like<00:02:16.540> see-through<00:02:17.049> so<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.920> acts<00:02:18.250> kinda

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
it's like see-through so it acts kinda

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.330 
it's like see-through so it acts kinda
like<00:02:18.609> glass<00:02:18.849> but<00:02:19.299> actually<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.950> smelt

like glass but actually if you smelt
amber<00:02:21.849> you<00:02:22.209> will<00:02:22.359> get<00:02:22.540> amber<00:02:22.930> glass<00:02:23.140> which<00:02:23.530> is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
amber you will get amber glass which is

amber you will get amber glass which is
a<00:02:24.040> little<00:02:24.579> bit<00:02:24.670> more<00:02:24.790> see-through<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.659> for

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.800 
couldn't find out where else you get the
silk<00:02:41.889> from<00:02:42.159> but<00:02:42.879> whenever<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.269> kill<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.659> only

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
silk from but whenever I kill it I only

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.710 
silk from but whenever I kill it I only
get<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.129> killed<00:02:45.129> maggot<00:02:45.669> and<00:02:45.819> then<00:02:46.209> there<00:02:46.480> is

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
get a killed maggot and then there is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.929 
get a killed maggot and then there is
the<00:02:47.019> fly<00:02:47.379> which<00:02:47.709> takes<00:02:48.010> place<00:02:48.159> of<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.669> bats

the fly which takes place of the bats
which<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.959> actually<00:02:50.290> really<00:02:50.560> cool<00:02:50.739> they

actually are really small and hard to
hit<00:02:52.540> though<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.019> gotta<00:02:53.650> be<00:02:53.769> careful<00:02:53.950> if<00:02:54.189> you
