00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
lot of the TCM kills come from euro he

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.140 
lot of the TCM kills come from euro he
seems<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> really<00:02:49.860> quiet<00:02:50.190> game<00:02:50.550> was<00:02:51.030> up

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
seems like a really quiet game was up

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.820 
seems like a really quiet game was up
just<00:02:51.209> because<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.020> guys<00:02:52.200> were<00:02:52.470> actually

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
just because the guys were actually

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.170 
just because the guys were actually
getting<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.190> fraction<00:02:53.580> before<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:53.970> could

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
getting the fraction before you could

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.290 
getting the fraction before you could
get<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.570> didn't<00:02:55.110> have<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.260> chance<00:02:56.300> basically

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
get it didn't have a chance basically

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.390 
get it didn't have a chance basically
the<00:02:57.870> guys<00:02:58.050> would<00:02:58.230> when<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.560> get<00:02:58.680> any<00:02:58.800> kills<00:02:59.070> I

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the guys would when you get any kills I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.550 
the guys would when you get any kills I
felt<00:02:59.940> like<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.239> setup<00:03:00.480> was<00:03:00.720> where<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.290> was

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
felt like the setup was where I was

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.729 
felt like the setup was where I was
sitting<00:03:01.739> way<00:03:02.010> too<00:03:02.070> high<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:04.140> did<00:03:04.320> affect<00:03:04.590> my

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
sitting way too high so it did affect my

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.370 
sitting way too high so it did affect my
game<00:03:04.800> but<00:03:05.810> what<00:03:06.810> makes<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.260> well<00:03:08.030> wasn't

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
game but what makes the well wasn't

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.110 
game but what makes the well wasn't
necessarily<00:03:12.040> dad<00:03:13.040> says<00:03:13.340> semen<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.940> had<00:03:14.090> a

could challenge

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.650 
could challenge
the<00:04:55.780> more<00:04:56.260> established<00:04:56.670> teams<00:04:57.670> at<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.450> top<00:04:58.630> of

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
the more established teams at the top of

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.740 
the more established teams at the top of
the<00:04:58.810> game<00:04:59.250> definitely<00:05:00.250> I<00:05:00.280> mean<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.730> think<00:05:01.300> when

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
the game definitely I mean I think when

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.840 
the game definitely I mean I think when
we<00:05:01.840> get<00:05:02.020> back<00:05:02.260> was<00:05:02.440> going<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.650> be<00:05:02.820> take<00:05:03.820> a

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
we get back was going to be take a

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.850 
we get back was going to be take a
little<00:05:04.060> bring<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.510> our<00:05:04.540> next<00:05:04.900> official<00:05:05.140> and

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
little bring to our next official and

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.590 
little bring to our next official and
then<00:05:06.190> we'll<00:05:06.370> be<00:05:06.460> practicing<00:05:06.700> hard<00:05:07.150> again<00:05:07.390> for

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
then we'll be practicing hard again for

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.910 
then we'll be practicing hard again for
next<00:05:07.720> language<00:05:08.110> that<00:05:08.290> I<00:05:08.410> think<00:05:08.620> it's<00:05:08.740> just

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
next language that I think it's just

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.520 
next language that I think it's just
next<00:05:09.100> month<00:05:09.370> is<00:05:09.550> over<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.820> next<00:05:10.060> one<00:05:10.290> we're<00:05:11.290> in

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
next month is over the next one we're in

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.950 
next month is over the next one we're in
front<00:05:11.830> so<00:05:12.160> I<00:05:12.460> think<00:05:13.390> you'll<00:05:13.690> be<00:05:13.780> practicing

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
front so I think you'll be practicing

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.480 
front so I think you'll be practicing
hard<00:05:14.410> and<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.590> think<00:05:14.800> we<00:05:14.890> can<00:05:15.010> challenge<00:05:15.250> them

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
hard and I think we can challenge them

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.280 
hard and I think we can challenge them
there<00:05:15.730> we<00:05:16.210> don't<00:05:16.570> think<00:05:16.780> we<00:05:16.840> need<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:17.020> lot<00:05:17.260> of

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
there we don't think we need a lot of

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.680 
there we don't think we need a lot of
time<00:05:17.530> really<00:05:17.740> we've<00:05:18.430> had<00:05:18.700> been<00:05:19.300> here<00:05:19.540> for<00:05:19.660> a

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
time really we've had been here for a

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.020 
time really we've had been here for a
