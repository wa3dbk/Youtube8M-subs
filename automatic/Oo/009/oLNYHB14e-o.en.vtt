00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.400
 everyone will be welcome back to this 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.309
 new video here I am finally here with the 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.089
 video preview where we will go to see 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.870
 better the design and the novelties of this 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.720
 new macbook and unboxing attention 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:25.010
 of the spacegrey version then the regio 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.080
 sidereal is a version that I say immediately 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.780
 you will already see from the video I tried to 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.320
 make them appreciate even more than that 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.980
 gold simply because it is one 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.420
 color that I personally find 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.910
 hallucinating I find it really beautiful 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.370
 spectacular close up see one 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.200
 coloring of the genus maybe have some 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.370
 like gold the end the difficulty 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.649
 of gold is that it tends to tire out like 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.360
 color also because it is beautiful alive as 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.070
 color while obviously us for the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.300
 phones are also used to colors 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.280
 clearer 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.809
 or completely anonymous like the 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.620
 black really is a computer 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.860
 beautiful from the design point of view 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.530
 in the coming weeks we will see instead 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.620
 such as how fast it is ceva 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.280
 slow if I can get a minimum of one 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.290
 in short, winemaking for those who intend 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.630
 I will go and see the features 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.549
 in every phase of use to see that 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.040
 this computer can be destined e 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.760
 consequently then among your canvases 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.340
 conclusions 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.950
 as you see inside the package 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.189
 we find these films that they are 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.560
 Satin finish are opaque, no more shiny like 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.080
 we always have lists 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.700
 we also find I want to see between the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.530
 end of video tried to make clips 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.189
 on that gold that I recorded 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.040
 previously and then we'll see 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.110
 however in detail this on 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.299
 new lighting network on the new 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.720
 usb port cin only i searched for some 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.400
 to show you the novelties of this of 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.290
 this macbook that I repeat we will go to 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.759
 see in the coming weeks with 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.280
 obviously it goes after several days of 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.110
 usage is more in-depth in its own right 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.360
 advance that 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.200
 and truly a show brings citron 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.670
 this computer 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.800
 then of course they are the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.600
 more powerful features for that 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.910
 there is another type of category of 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.620
 products but then as usual do the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.620
 my android video review 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.890
 how to say subjective impressions 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.060
 both subjective for which we will do 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.850
 that complete review 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.040
 as you can see it is really really 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.080
 spectacular perhaps because the correction 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.180
 new as well as for gold I repeat 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.090
 but it is precisely what we have always been 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.570
 accustomed except for the macbook yet of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.150
 several years ago and had it completely 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.040
 black what we have always been 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.320
 accustomed to the lightest color of all 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.430
 computer projectos of what they are 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.630
 arrived they were in this color 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.580
 except just a few models for which vi 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.190
 I can assure you that I have tried again 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.900
 to do shots up close but 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.959
 the combination of the black black of the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.670
 keyboard or dark gray shell 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.270
 it's really really great 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.130
 let's lose the apple behind luminescent 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.300
 but okay it's a detail in my opinion 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.120
 neglected that it is very very beautiful 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.830
 all silver we say as now 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.660
 here it will not light up anymore and that is 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.190
 the only problem 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.750
 as you can see i slowed down by i 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.730
 video with backlight is in fact 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.750
 much smarter in my opinion that is 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.190
 then there is always used to 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.230
 backlight as well as all 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.170
 other markets from other companies to 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.300
 determination around the key but in 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.600
 reality if you think about it like I do 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.740
 on my pro 13 echo networks currently 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.470
 it's not a hundred percent thing 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.040
 functional ie the key lights up 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.380
 little 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.720
 I do not give you the heart the invitation letter from 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.550
 white part over right letter 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.730
 if instead m brightness at most that 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.960
 point I see it though it's not that I can 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.880
 ensure that this new network 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.440
 lighting and a hundred times better 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.140
 compared to the previous one we have 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.560
 always used for which we would miss 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.710
 other 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.560
 and so to say that it is clearly superior 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.720
 such as 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.330
 how to say as a community because it goes to 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.270
 illuminate the character the letter 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.620
 not the whole key that I don't care about 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.959
 I am interested in seeing the letter 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.230
 basically right so I have to 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.549
 say that one thing absolutely 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.220
 improved inside the package 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.500
 because I love the USB cable there from two meters 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.060
 obviously the inconvenience is the fact of 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.110
 always having to connect adapters 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.090
 we'll talk about it later in the review and it is 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.890
 really the screen is the screen 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.620
 beautiful obviously a retina display 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.060
 and always in the package we must also 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.470
 that the power supply from 9 watts and losers 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.960
 from the size of an ipad 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.460
 practically told this guys if 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.500
 you have questions about the computer does fear 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.260
 not even because I repeat will deepen with 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.150
 more videos in the coming days and nothing 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.970
 delivered you enjoyed this 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.800
 review first impressions e 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.270
 above all I would say the cost of coloring 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.740
 let me know also with a comment what 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.430
 it is the color that most prefers this 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.930
 new macbook 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.890
 having said that an upcoming video has to do with it 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.890
 greetings to all bye bye
