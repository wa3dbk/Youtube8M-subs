trend to help with weight loss problems

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.580 
trend to help with weight loss problems
and<00:00:23.000> for<00:00:23.510> many<00:00:23.660> people<00:00:23.810> that's<00:00:24.170> going<00:00:24.349> to<00:00:24.439> work

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
and for many people that's going to work

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.950 
and for many people that's going to work
very<00:00:24.650> well<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.460> it's<00:00:26.119> not<00:00:26.270> a<00:00:26.300> dangerous<00:00:26.720> diet

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
very well and it's not a dangerous diet

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.470 
very well and it's not a dangerous diet
to<00:00:27.140> be<00:00:27.290> on<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:27.740> grain<00:00:28.460> is<00:00:28.640> not<00:00:28.790> essential<00:00:29.150> in

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
to be on and grain is not essential in

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.229 
to be on and grain is not essential in
the<00:00:29.570> human<00:00:29.900> diet<00:00:29.930> so<00:00:30.640> there's<00:00:31.640> no<00:00:31.850> harm<00:00:32.150> done

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
the human diet so there's no harm done

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.270 
the human diet so there's no harm done
with<00:00:32.480> going<00:00:33.110> on<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.260> gluten-free<00:00:33.620> diet<00:00:33.770> for

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
with going on a gluten-free diet for

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.670 
with going on a gluten-free diet for
weight<00:00:34.309> loss<00:00:34.989> however<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:36.140> think<00:00:36.290> it's<00:00:36.590> more

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
weight loss however I think it's more

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.490 
weight loss however I think it's more
important<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.309> touch<00:00:37.580> on<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.750> muscle<00:00:39.260> loss

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
important to touch on the muscle loss

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.830 
important to touch on the muscle loss
that<00:00:39.890> can<00:00:40.070> occur<00:00:40.400> when<00:00:40.699> people<00:00:41.090> do<00:00:41.239> eat<00:00:41.420> gluten

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
that can occur when people do eat gluten

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.500 
that can occur when people do eat gluten
or<00:00:42.019> gluten<00:00:42.410> sensitive<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.129> we<00:00:43.280> have<00:00:43.510> gluten

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
or gluten sensitive so we have gluten

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.240 
or gluten sensitive so we have gluten
can<00:00:44.690> be<00:00:44.930> detrimental<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:45.769> can<00:00:45.980> cause

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
can be detrimental and can cause

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.189 
can be detrimental and can cause
inflammation<00:00:46.610> in<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.239> muscle<00:00:47.629> that<00:00:47.780> can<00:00:48.019> lead

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
inflammation in the muscle that can lead

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.710 
inflammation in the muscle that can lead
to<00:00:48.229> muscular<00:00:48.890> loss<00:00:49.159> or<00:00:49.519> muscle<00:00:49.940> atrophy<00:00:50.150> and

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
to muscular loss or muscle atrophy and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.630 
to muscular loss or muscle atrophy and
then<00:00:51.470> that<00:00:51.589> muscle<00:00:51.920> atrophy<00:00:52.129> can

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
then that muscle atrophy can

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.490 
then that muscle atrophy can
subsequently<00:00:53.210> lead<00:00:53.629> to<00:00:53.839> joint<00:00:54.199> dysfunction

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
subsequently lead to joint dysfunction

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.009 
subsequently lead to joint dysfunction
and<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:55.850> what<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.120> end<00:00:56.299> up<00:00:56.420> with<00:00:56.479> is<00:00:56.870> the

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
and so what you end up with is the

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.500 
and so what you end up with is the
person<00:00:57.500> who<00:00:57.549> over<00:00:58.549> years<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:59.059> gluten<00:00:59.390> exposure

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
person who over years of gluten exposure

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.829 
person who over years of gluten exposure
has<00:01:00.260> weakened<00:01:00.739> muscles<00:01:01.040> has<00:01:01.909> lower<00:01:02.330> muscle

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
has weakened muscles has lower muscle

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.649 
has weakened muscles has lower muscle
mass<00:01:03.519> maybe<00:01:04.519> they're<00:01:04.729> overweight<00:01:05.210> but<00:01:05.510> they

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
mass maybe they're overweight but they

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.270 
mass maybe they're overweight but they
just<00:01:05.840> don't<00:01:06.049> have<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.500> muscle<00:01:06.710> tone<00:01:07.070> that

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
just don't have the muscle tone that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.340 
just don't have the muscle tone that
they<00:01:07.460> need<00:01:07.760> and<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.570> problem<00:01:08.960> with<00:01:09.140> this<00:01:09.290> is

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
they need and the problem with this is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.410 
they need and the problem with this is
that<00:01:09.560> muscle<00:01:10.190> is<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:10.520> important<00:01:11.000> for<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:11.299> many

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
that muscle is so important for so many

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.600 
that muscle is so important for so many
different<00:01:11.630> functions<00:01:12.320> your<00:01:13.010> muscle<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.580> a

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
different functions your muscle is a

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.910 
different functions your muscle is a
reserve<00:01:14.210> for<00:01:14.540> your<00:01:14.690> immune<00:01:14.960> system<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.740> when

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
reserve for your immune system so when

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.350 
reserve for your immune system so when
your<00:01:16.070> immune<00:01:16.190> system<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.790> in<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.970> weakened

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
your immune system is in a weakened

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.779 
your immune system is in a weakened
state<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:18.320> can<00:01:18.619> pull<00:01:18.860> from<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.280> muscle<00:01:19.640> to

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
state it can pull from the muscle to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.639 
state it can pull from the muscle to
make<00:01:19.969> antibodies<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.750> other<00:01:20.869> proteins<00:01:21.409> to

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
make antibodies and other proteins to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.950 
make antibodies and other proteins to
help<00:01:21.799> defend<00:01:22.159> against<00:01:22.640> invaders<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.840> help

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
help defend against invaders to help

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.649 
help defend against invaders to help
defend<00:01:24.259> against<00:01:24.680> allergens<00:01:25.240> muscle<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.359> also

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
defend against allergens muscle is also

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.109 
defend against allergens muscle is also
important<00:01:27.170> because<00:01:27.259> it's<00:01:27.829> a<00:01:28.009> pump<00:01:28.820> for<00:01:29.090> the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
important because it's a pump for the

what we see is we see a state of
weakened<00:01:48.259> immune<00:01:48.619> function<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.490> we<00:01:49.520> see<00:01:50.329> a

weakened immune function and we see a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.050 
weakened immune function and we see a
greater<00:01:50.840> predilection<00:01:51.590> toward<00:01:52.060> infection

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060

floor so all in all muscle was very

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.899 
floor so all in all muscle was very
important<00:01:59.719> issue<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:01.189> going<00:02:01.429> gluten-free

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
important issue and so going gluten-free

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.739 
important issue and so going gluten-free
oftentimes<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.229> not<00:02:03.920> enough<00:02:04.369> for<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> person<00:02:05.509> to

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
oftentimes is not enough for a person to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.660 
oftentimes is not enough for a person to
fully<00:02:05.990> recover<00:02:06.350> because<00:02:06.829> going<00:02:07.340> gluten-free

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
fully recover because going gluten-free

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.210 
fully recover because going gluten-free
doesn't<00:02:08.270> build<00:02:08.479> muscle<00:02:08.990> so<00:02:09.560> we<00:02:09.740> really<00:02:10.039> want

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
doesn't build muscle so we really want

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.180 
doesn't build muscle so we really want
to<00:02:10.280> talk<00:02:10.520> about<00:02:11.110> how<00:02:12.110> when<00:02:12.470> we<00:02:12.590> go<00:02:12.770> gluten-free

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
to talk about how when we go gluten-free

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.110 
to talk about how when we go gluten-free
how<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.940> restore<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.260> muscle<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.069> was<00:02:16.730> lost

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
how to restore the muscle that was lost

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.210 
how to restore the muscle that was lost
as<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> result<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.960> gluten<00:02:18.319> induced<00:02:18.680> muscular

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
as a result of gluten induced muscular

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.510 
as a result of gluten induced muscular
inflammation<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.030> gluten

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
inflammation and gluten

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.970 
inflammation and gluten
to<00:02:20.700> atrophy<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> only<00:02:22.320> way<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.830> can

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
to atrophy in the only way that can

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.770 
to atrophy in the only way that can
really<00:02:23.160> be<00:02:23.370> done<00:02:23.400> aside<00:02:24.060> from<00:02:24.240> getting<00:02:24.480> gluten

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
really be done aside from getting gluten

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.510 
really be done aside from getting gluten
out<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.080> diet<00:02:25.320> as<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> person<00:02:26.040> has<00:02:26.280> to

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
out of the diet as a person has to

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.180 
out of the diet as a person has to
actually<00:02:26.700> work<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.450> muscle<00:02:27.870> muscle<00:02:28.620> responds

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
actually work the muscle muscle responds

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.000 
actually work the muscle muscle responds
based<00:02:29.490> on<00:02:29.700> external<00:02:30.060> pressures<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.830> have

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
based on external pressures so we have

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.030 
based on external pressures so we have
to<00:02:32.160> add<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.850> exercise<00:02:33.720> now<00:02:34.290> some<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.890> most

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
to add in exercise now some of the most

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.430 
to add in exercise now some of the most
core<00:02:35.400> basic<00:02:35.970> fundamental<00:02:36.480> exercises<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.350> a

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
core basic fundamental exercises that a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.800 
core basic fundamental exercises that a
person<00:02:37.800> should<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:38.070> able<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.520> do<00:02:38.670> are<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.940> push

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
person should be able to do are the push

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.260 
person should be able to do are the push

up the pull-up the squat the lunge in
the<00:02:42.360> sit-up<00:02:42.750> those<00:02:43.530> five<00:02:43.890> exercises

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
the sit-up those five exercises

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.450 
the sit-up those five exercises
represent<00:02:45.420> basic<00:02:45.990> body<00:02:46.260> movements<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.160> work

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
represent basic body movements that work

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.610 
represent basic body movements that work
the<00:02:47.880> majority<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.450> muscles<00:02:48.960> within<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.440> body

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
the majority of muscles within the body

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.130 
the majority of muscles within the body
and<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:51.090> doesn't<00:02:51.510> require<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.900> lot<00:02:52.110> of

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
and it doesn't require a lot of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.930 
and it doesn't require a lot of
expensive<00:02:52.830> gym<00:02:53.010> equipment<00:02:53.580> or<00:02:53.670> doesn't

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
expensive gym equipment or doesn't

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.030 
expensive gym equipment or doesn't
require<00:02:54.180> chip<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.750> trip<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.440> gym<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.860> just

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
require chip to trip to the gym it just

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.480 
require chip to trip to the gym it just
basically<00:02:56.340> requires<00:02:57.090> some<00:02:58.490> coordination

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
basically requires some coordination

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.730 
basically requires some coordination
some<00:02:59.970> skill<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.630> some<00:03:00.960> effort<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.440> your<00:03:01.620> own

exercises and in this case the pull-up
without<00:03:19.770> injuring<00:03:20.130> yourself<00:03:20.640> because<00:03:20.880> this

without injuring yourself because this
is<00:03:21.270> one<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.660> big<00:03:21.870> factors<00:03:22.530> as<00:03:22.950> well<00:03:22.980> when

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
is one of the big factors as well when

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.949 
is one of the big factors as well when
your<00:03:23.520> muscles<00:03:23.850> are<00:03:24.000> atrophied<00:03:24.510> if<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.750> get

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
your muscles are atrophied if you get

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.650 
your muscles are atrophied if you get
into<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.350> too<00:03:25.560> quickly<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:27.090> create

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
into this too quickly you can create

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.230 
into this too quickly you can create
trauma<00:03:28.560> or<00:03:28.860> injury<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.580> muscle<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.120> then

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
trauma or injury to the muscle and then

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.960 
trauma or injury to the muscle and then
with<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.110> new<00:03:31.380> pain<00:03:31.709> comes<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.670> lack<00:03:32.940> of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
with that new pain comes a lack of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.580 
with that new pain comes a lack of
exercise<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:33.900> certainly<00:03:34.110> don't<00:03:34.380> want

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
exercise and we certainly don't want

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.340 
exercise and we certainly don't want
that<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:34.950> happen<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.459> either<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:36.720> go<00:03:37.140> grab
