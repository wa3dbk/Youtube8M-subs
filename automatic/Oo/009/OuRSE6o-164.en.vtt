my<00:00:28.369> aerial<00:00:29.480> video<00:00:30.480> ship<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.260> guess<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.430> say

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.209 

so<00:00:35.940> we're<00:00:36.690> gonna<00:00:36.840> reset<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.530> right<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:40.219> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
so we're gonna reset it right now and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.060 
so we're gonna reset it right now and
then<00:00:41.489> we're<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> arm<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.899> motors<00:00:46.070> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
then we're going to arm the motors and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.520 
then we're going to arm the motors and
we're<00:00:47.309> gonna<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.730> how<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> flies<00:00:48.320> this<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
we're gonna see how it flies this is

we're gonna see how it flies this is
maiden<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.190> got<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> GoPro<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.180> there

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.680 

switch<00:01:02.829> it<00:01:02.860> in<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.489> what's<00:01:03.790> called<00:01:04.030> stable

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
switch it in to what's called stable

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.920 
switch it in to what's called stable
mode<00:01:04.870> that's<00:01:05.140> just<00:01:05.590> right<00:01:05.770> there<00:01:06.330> stay<00:01:07.330> that's

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
mode that's just right there stay that's

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.469 
mode that's just right there stay that's
just<00:01:08.170> what<00:01:08.530> they<00:01:08.979> call<00:01:09.190> normal<00:01:09.790> or<00:01:09.940> manual

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
just what they call normal or manual

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.170 
just what they call normal or manual
mode<00:01:11.070> which<00:01:12.070> basically<00:01:12.580> has<00:01:13.030> no

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
mode which basically has no

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.980 
mode which basically has no
stabilization<00:01:16.180> at<00:01:16.330> all<00:01:18.300> now<00:01:19.300> we'll<00:01:19.510> flip<00:01:19.780> in

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
stabilization at all now we'll flip in

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:29.950 
stabilization at all now we'll flip in
the<00:01:20.110> stable<00:01:20.590> mode

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.430 

brees<00:01:30.710> we<00:01:30.979> got<00:01:31.190> going<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.640> kind<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:32.200> kicking<00:01:33.200> it

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
brees we got going is kind of kicking it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.880 
brees we got going is kind of kicking it
around<00:01:37.300> you<00:01:38.300> switch<00:01:38.750> back<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.020> forth<00:01:39.290> it<00:01:39.650> kind

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
around you switch back and forth it kind

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.830 
around you switch back and forth it kind
of<00:01:39.979> threw<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.090> off<00:01:41.270> they're<00:01:43.390> really<00:01:44.390> just<00:01:44.420> one

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
of threw it off they're really just one

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.499 
of threw it off they're really just one
to<00:01:45.110> see<00:01:45.320> how<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.680> handles<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.880> see<00:01:47.119> what<00:01:47.330> the

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
to see how it handles and see what the

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.510 
to see how it handles and see what the
GoPro<00:01:48.200> goes<00:01:48.640> see<00:01:49.640> if<00:01:49.729> my<00:01:50.440> makeshift<00:01:51.520> mount

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
GoPro goes see if my makeshift mount

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.280 
GoPro goes see if my makeshift mount
works<00:01:52.850> now<00:01:53.330> I'm<00:01:53.450> going<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.690> put<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:53.960> in<00:01:56.290> what's

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
works now I'm going to put it in what's

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:07.370 
works now I'm going to put it in what's
called<00:01:58.509> stable<00:01:59.509> with<00:01:59.780> altitude<00:02:00.320> hold

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.350 

so<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> should<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.340> able<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.729> get<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so I should be able to just get it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:19.170 
so I should be able to just get it
whatever<00:02:09.840> else<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.470> don't<00:02:10.649> want<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.009> death

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.739 

care<00:04:09.670> should<00:04:09.700> be<00:04:10.120> altitude<00:04:10.810> hole<00:04:12.749> with

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:13.749 
care should be altitude hole with

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:20.690 
care should be altitude hole with
stabilization

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.910 

so<00:04:21.270> right<00:04:21.510> now<00:04:21.540> I<00:04:21.750> don't<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.140> my<00:04:22.320> hand<00:04:22.590> on<00:04:22.740> the

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
so right now I don't have my hand on the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.890 
so right now I don't have my hand on the
throttle<00:04:23.130> at<00:04:23.580> all<00:04:23.760> i'm<00:04:24.030> still<00:04:24.420> messing<00:04:24.780> with

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
throttle at all i'm still messing with

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.740 
throttle at all i'm still messing with
my<00:04:25.080> cyclic<00:04:25.710> but<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:26.790> can<00:04:26.970> see<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.360> keeps

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
my cyclic but you can see it keeps

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.900 
my cyclic but you can see it keeps
speeding<00:04:28.140> up<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.680> slowing<00:04:28.920> down<00:04:29.340> it's<00:04:29.610> trying

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
speeding up and slowing down it's trying

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.050 
speeding up and slowing down it's trying
to<00:04:30.000> hold<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.390> same<00:04:31.220> altitude<00:04:34.640> it's<00:04:35.640> doing<00:04:36.000> a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
to hold that same altitude it's doing a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:51.020 
to hold that same altitude it's doing a
pretty<00:04:36.240> good<00:04:36.330> job<00:04:36.480> of<00:04:36.750> it

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:05:06.119 

flat<00:04:52.030> around<00:04:52.240> this<00:04:52.630> world<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.290> supplies

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:21.989 

I<00:05:07.770> just<00:05:08.770> switched<00:05:09.039> it<00:05:09.339> back<00:05:09.369> to<00:05:09.789> manual<00:05:10.330> mode

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:21.999

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
it's got flashing LEDs there and right

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.029 
it's got flashing LEDs there and right
there<00:05:49.159> I<00:05:49.370> have<00:05:49.580> single<00:05:50.590> there<00:05:51.590> have<00:05:51.740> to

in<00:05:56.740> there<00:05:56.950> had<00:05:57.150> three<00:05:58.150> flash<00:05:59.190> and<00:06:00.190> three<00:06:00.790> is

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
in there had three flash and three is

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:10.640 
in there had three flash and three is
for<00:06:04.230> the<00:06:05.730> flight<00:06:06.730> stabilization<00:06:07.260> with<00:06:09.570> the

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
for the flight stabilization with the

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.200 
for the flight stabilization with the
altitude<00:06:11.650> hold<00:06:13.080> two<00:06:14.080> is<00:06:14.500> two<00:06:15.280> blanks<00:06:15.700> is<00:06:15.880> just

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
altitude hold two is two blanks is just

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:22.080 
altitude hold two is two blanks is just
a<00:06:17.220> flight<00:06:18.220> stabilization<00:06:18.520> and<00:06:19.510> then<00:06:19.830> a<00:06:21.090> single

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
a flight stabilization and then a single

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.890 
a flight stabilization and then a single
blank<00:06:22.450> is<00:06:22.690> manual<00:06:23.290> mode<00:06:25.680> as<00:06:26.680> you<00:06:26.830> can<00:06:27.010> see<00:06:27.280> I

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
blank is manual mode as you can see I

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.420 
blank is manual mode as you can see I
made<00:06:28.900> me<00:06:29.110> a<00:06:29.730> mount<00:06:30.730> for<00:06:30.910> my<00:06:31.090> GoPro<00:06:31.980> we<00:06:32.980> did<00:06:33.220> some

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
made me a mount for my GoPro we did some

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.240 
made me a mount for my GoPro we did some
dampening<00:06:34.390> rubbers<00:06:35.230> there<00:06:35.470> in<00:06:35.620> between<00:06:36.040> the

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
dampening rubbers there in between the

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.400 
dampening rubbers there in between the
melt<00:06:36.520> and<00:06:36.820> the<00:06:36.850> frame<00:06:37.330> and<00:06:37.630> then<00:06:38.530> it's<00:06:39.520> got<00:06:39.790> a

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
melt and the frame and then it's got a

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.870 
melt and the frame and then it's got a
little<00:06:41.410> suspension<00:06:42.190> system<00:06:42.640> on<00:06:42.760> there<00:06:44.640> so<00:06:45.640> but

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
little suspension system on there so but

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.170 
little suspension system on there so but
the<00:06:46.290> GoPro<00:06:47.290> doesn't<00:06:47.710> get<00:06:48.070> any<00:06:48.220> vibration<00:06:48.940> it's

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
the GoPro doesn't get any vibration it's

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.200 
the GoPro doesn't get any vibration it's
kind<00:06:49.390> of<00:06:49.420> a<00:06:49.540> damper<00:06:50.040> so<00:06:51.040> we'll<00:06:51.880> see<00:06:52.030> how<00:06:52.060> the

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
kind of a damper so we'll see how the

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.070 
kind of a damper so we'll see how the
video<00:06:52.420> comes<00:06:52.840> out<00:06:53.020> on<00:06:53.200> that<00:06:53.440> but<00:06:54.040> anyway<00:06:55.080> then

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
video comes out on that but anyway then

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.140 
video comes out on that but anyway then
the<00:06:56.290> pup<00:06:56.890> cover<00:06:57.220> off<00:06:57.430> here<00:06:59.970> battery<00:07:00.970> goes

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
the pup cover off here battery goes

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:08.490 
the pup cover off here battery goes
right<00:07:01.390> there<00:07:04.140> all<00:07:05.140> your<00:07:05.700> electronics<00:07:07.500> that

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
right there all your electronics that

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.410 
right there all your electronics that
down<00:07:08.770> under<00:07:09.070> there<00:07:10.830> might<00:07:11.830> be<00:07:11.860> a<00:07:12.130> fly<00:07:12.460> control

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.420 
down under there might be a fly control

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.780 
down under there might be a fly control
board

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:15.790

program anything everything from your

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.690 
program anything everything from your
computer<00:07:24.460> and<00:07:25.800> it's<00:07:26.800> pretty<00:07:27.010> pretty<00:07:27.460> cool

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:27.700

pretty cool little bird looking forward
to<00:07:31.060> flying<00:07:31.510> around<00:07:31.930> getting<00:07:32.260> some<00:07:32.410> video

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
to flying around getting some video

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.600 
to flying around getting some video
thanks<00:07:34.180> for<00:07:34.240> watching<00:07:34.360> guys
