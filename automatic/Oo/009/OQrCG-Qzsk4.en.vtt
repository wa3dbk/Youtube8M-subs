00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
they actually see what they do does make

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.040 
they actually see what they do does make
a<00:00:58.710> difference<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.730> garden<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.359> pretty<00:01:00.780> cool

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
a difference the garden is pretty cool

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.560 
a difference the garden is pretty cool
there's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.940> stuff<00:01:02.940> flesh<00:01:03.180> fruits

vegetables<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.519> regular<00:01:05.970> flowers<00:01:06.450> like

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
vegetables and just regular flowers like

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.140 
vegetables and just regular flowers like
these<00:01:07.080> homes<00:01:07.460> usually<00:01:08.460> will<00:01:08.880> help<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
these homes usually will help with the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.969 
these homes usually will help with the
plants<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.689> stuff<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.710> fun

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
plants and stuff and I think it was fun

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.130 
plants and stuff and I think it was fun
because<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.369> learned<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.210> plants<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
because we learned about the plants and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.530 
because we learned about the plants and
then<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.799> helped<00:01:14.430> us<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.330> more

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
then it like helped us like be more

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.109 
then it like helped us like be more
responsible<00:01:15.990> he<00:01:16.560> makes<00:01:16.799> them<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
responsible he makes them see that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
responsible he makes them see that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
something can come from a little bit of

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.830 
something can come from a little bit of
work<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.400> bit<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.729> attention<00:01:21.210> just

like with a little bit of work and
attention<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> kids<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.630> put<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.590> big

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
attention to the kids we put it one big

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
hands-on experience of how to garden

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.830 
hands-on experience of how to garden
teach<00:01:37.900> them<00:01:38.200> different<00:01:38.380> tools<00:01:39.119> teaches<00:01:40.119> them

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
teach them different tools teaches them

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.930 
teach them different tools teaches them
responsibility<00:01:41.590> because<00:01:42.280> they<00:01:42.400> have<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:42.729> take

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
responsibility because they have to take

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.649 
responsibility because they have to take
care<00:01:43.180> of<00:01:43.240> stuff<00:01:43.570> it's<00:01:44.409> good<00:01:45.369> for<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.850> teachers

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
care of stuff it's good for the teachers

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.149 
care of stuff it's good for the teachers
in<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.050> classrooms<00:01:47.619> because<00:01:47.799> they're

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
in the classrooms because they're

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.160 
in the classrooms because they're
learning<00:01:48.340> they<00:01:48.640> can<00:01:48.850> use<00:01:49.000> math<00:01:49.330> with<00:01:49.659> graphs

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
learning they can use math with graphs

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.440 
learning they can use math with graphs
and<00:01:50.409> health<00:01:50.619> stuff<00:01:51.159> grows<00:01:51.520> in<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.940> couple<00:01:52.300> days

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
and health stuff grows in a couple days

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.440 
and health stuff grows in a couple days
to<00:01:52.509> even<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.110> week<00:01:53.320> or<00:01:53.560> month<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.119> big

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
to even a week or month it's a big

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.960 
to even a week or month it's a big
science<00:01:56.409> component<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.950> mean<00:01:57.100> here<00:01:57.280> at<00:01:57.460> any

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
science component I mean here at any

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.490 
science component I mean here at any
time<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.479> know<00:01:58.570> he<00:01:58.690> can<00:01:58.840> bring<00:01:58.990> something<00:01:59.380> in

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
time you know he can bring something in

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.190 
time you know he can bring something in
and<00:01:59.590> add<00:01:59.830> to<00:02:00.190> your<00:02:00.220> science<00:02:00.909> lesson<00:02:01.360> he<00:02:01.930> really

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200
