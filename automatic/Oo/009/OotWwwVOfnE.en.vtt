members<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.980> comet<00:03:42.310> will<00:03:42.400> form<00:03:42.670> after<00:03:43.030> all

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
members the comet will form after all

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.660 
members the comet will form after all
the<00:03:43.299> projectiles<00:03:43.750> land<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.320> if<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.400> stand

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
the projectiles land and if you stand

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.490 
the projectiles land and if you stand
close<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.180> ice<00:03:46.390> comet<00:03:46.780> it'll<00:03:47.290> not<00:03:47.470> only

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
close to this ice comet it'll not only

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.500 
close to this ice comet it'll not only
remove<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.400> stacks<00:03:48.760> of<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
remove the stacks of the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.410 
remove the stacks of the
bonus<00:03:50.470> bonus<00:03:51.400> fire<00:03:51.580> damage<00:03:51.909> from<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.239> Sun

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
bonus bonus fire damage from the Sun

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.319 
bonus bonus fire damage from the Sun
girls<00:03:52.689> win<00:03:52.989> our<00:03:53.799> yes<00:03:54.489> when<00:03:54.760> yeah<00:03:55.090> that's<00:03:55.209> right

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
girls win our yes when yeah that's right

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.899 
girls win our yes when yeah that's right
but<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.260> also<00:03:56.439> reduces<00:03:56.769> fire<00:03:57.340> damage<00:03:57.730> for

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
but it also reduces fire damage for

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.390 
but it also reduces fire damage for
players<00:03:58.150> near<00:03:58.569> it<00:03:58.689> so<00:03:59.170> if<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.829> stand<00:04:00.040> close<00:04:00.250> to

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
players near it so if you stand close to

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.890 
players near it so if you stand close to
it<00:04:00.519> you'll<00:04:00.700> actually<00:04:00.849> take<00:04:01.120> less<00:04:01.329> fire<00:04:01.540> damage

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
it you'll actually take less fire damage

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.750 
it you'll actually take less fire damage
and<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.650> will<00:04:02.739> remove<00:04:02.950> those<00:04:03.099> stacks<00:04:03.340> from<00:04:03.549> her

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
and it will remove those stacks from her

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.089 
and it will remove those stacks from her
so<00:04:04.390> just<00:04:04.420> stand<00:04:04.930> close<00:04:05.230> to<00:04:05.409> them<00:04:05.560> after<00:04:06.010> they

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
so just stand close to them after they

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.449 
so just stand close to them after they
appear<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:07.360> third<00:04:07.659> phase<00:04:08.159> happens<00:04:09.159> a<00:04:09.280> few

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
appear the third phase happens a few

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.130 
appear the third phase happens a few
minutes<00:04:09.640> into<00:04:09.879> the<00:04:09.940> game<00:04:09.970> into<00:04:10.569> the<00:04:10.659> match<00:04:10.840> and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
minutes into the game into the match and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.890 
minutes into the game into the match and
basically<00:04:11.980> it's<00:04:12.370> dusk<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.909> both<00:04:13.599> bosses

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
basically it's dusk and both bosses

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.439 
basically it's dusk and both bosses
become<00:04:14.379> active<00:04:14.739> at<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:14.860> same<00:04:14.920> time<00:04:15.329> they<00:04:16.329> have

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
become active at the same time they have

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.360 
become active at the same time they have
completely<00:04:16.870> separate<00:04:17.260> help<00:04:17.440> pools<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:18.160> if<00:04:18.280> you

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
completely separate help pools so if you

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.120 
completely separate help pools so if you
manage<00:04:18.639> to<00:04:18.669> kill<00:04:19.060> one<00:04:19.359> boss<00:04:20.169> or<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.650> other<00:04:20.829> in

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
manage to kill one boss or the other in

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.980 
manage to kill one boss or the other in
either<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.669> first<00:04:21.820> two<00:04:22.000> phases<00:04:22.330> you'll

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
either of the first two phases you'll

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.200 
either of the first two phases you'll
skip<00:04:23.199> this<00:04:23.380> phase<00:04:23.560> entirely<00:04:24.070> when<00:04:24.789> either<00:04:25.060> of

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
skip this phase entirely when either of

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.060 
skip this phase entirely when either of
these<00:04:25.389> when<00:04:26.050> either<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.260> bosses<00:04:26.620> die<00:04:26.800> you'll

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
these when either the bosses die you'll

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.260 
these when either the bosses die you'll
move<00:04:27.190> on<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.520> fourth<00:04:27.729> phase<00:04:27.940> which<00:04:28.150> is

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
move on to the fourth phase which is

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.240 
move on to the fourth phase which is
basically<00:04:28.570> an<00:04:28.750> extension<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.530> phase<00:04:29.860> 3

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
basically an extension of phase 3

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.460 
basically an extension of phase 3
without<00:04:30.789> the<00:04:30.910> other<00:04:31.030> boss<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.169> exact

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
without the other boss it's the exact

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.409 
without the other boss it's the exact
same<00:04:32.530> thing<00:04:32.770> now<00:04:33.370> phase<00:04:33.610> 3<00:04:33.880> is<00:04:33.970> pretty<00:04:34.210> simple

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
same thing now phase 3 is pretty simple

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.510 
same thing now phase 3 is pretty simple
both<00:04:34.930> bosses<00:04:35.169> are<00:04:35.470> up<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:35.770> they<00:04:36.010> do<00:04:36.070> just<00:04:36.400> a

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
both bosses are up and they do just a

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.240 
both bosses are up and they do just a
few<00:04:36.789> moves<00:04:37.060> night<00:04:37.960> girl<00:04:38.229> will<00:04:38.410> still<00:04:38.740> some<00:04:39.160> in

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
few moves night girl will still some in

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.890 
few moves night girl will still some in
the<00:04:39.310> comments<00:04:39.699> and<00:04:39.760> additionally<00:04:40.510> she'll<00:04:40.750> be

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
the comments and additionally she'll be

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.350 
the comments and additionally she'll be
doing<00:04:41.169> a<00:04:41.199> tidal<00:04:41.770> force<00:04:42.100> which<00:04:42.820> sends<00:04:43.240> out

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
doing a tidal force which sends out

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.360 
doing a tidal force which sends out
water<00:04:43.780> waves<00:04:44.080> these<00:04:44.560> are<00:04:44.710> hard<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:45.070> avoid

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
water waves these are hard to avoid

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.879 
water waves these are hard to avoid
because<00:04:45.970> they<00:04:46.090> move<00:04:46.240> kind<00:04:46.449> of<00:04:46.510> fast<00:04:46.570> but<00:04:47.380> try

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
because they move kind of fast but try

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.250 
because they move kind of fast but try
to<00:04:47.949> do<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.370> avoid<00:04:48.669> damage<00:04:49.090> now<00:04:49.660> if<00:04:49.840> at<00:04:50.169> all

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
to do so to avoid damage now if at all

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.710 
to do so to avoid damage now if at all
possible<00:04:50.530> avoid<00:04:51.010> them<00:04:51.130> now<00:04:51.850> day<00:04:52.210> girl<00:04:52.449> will<00:04:52.690> be

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
possible avoid them now day girl will be

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.500 
possible avoid them now day girl will be
doing<00:04:52.990> some<00:04:53.199> random<00:04:53.620> AOE<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.370> get<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.300> fire

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
doing some random AOE and get the fire

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.629 
doing some random AOE and get the fire
damage<00:04:55.900> buff<00:04:56.110> stacks<00:04:56.740> on<00:04:56.919> herself<00:04:57.220> but<00:04:57.490> she

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
damage buff stacks on herself but she

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.070 
damage buff stacks on herself but she
won't<00:04:57.910> be<00:04:58.000> doing<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.270> fan<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.810> flames

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
won't be doing that fan of flames

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.409 
won't be doing that fan of flames
anymore<00:04:59.530> so<00:04:59.919> no<00:05:00.099> tank<00:05:00.400> swap<00:05:00.669> is<00:05:00.820> necessary<00:05:01.240> in

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
anymore so no tank swap is necessary in

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.990 
anymore so no tank swap is necessary in
fact<00:05:01.990> if<00:05:02.169> you<00:05:02.349> have<00:05:02.740> both<00:05:02.919> bosses<00:05:03.250> available

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
fact if you have both bosses available

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
on phase 3 1 tank can be on one boss and

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:06.900 
on phase 3 1 tank can be on one boss and

not a big deal in fact they can almost
