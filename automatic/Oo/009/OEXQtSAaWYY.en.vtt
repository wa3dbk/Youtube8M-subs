 I do not like the player this time, so I'm going to invest in gold. 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:08.040
 Whether the leaves have to buy a card now, the players choose whether to buy now is very worrying to say 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.040
 It's possible 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.400

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.210
 I personally feel a little bit caught up in a lot of investment. 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.960
 So, how much investment do you usually invest in? 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:58.030
 If you have a lot of people with Tom, you are going to spend more than 10 million won. 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.270
 I have 10 million yuan, almost all the basics are almost in the fire, 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.810

 Well, how about a stable ep buy and now it's a stock. 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:47.920
 Accessories are also lacking people who'll say oh why network numbers game 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.060
 On the other hand, if you are ignorant, you are more likely to improve 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.410
 We have to go to 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.239

 He is a player who has invested in cash and is now in a squad. 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.739
 Is the burden worth

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.870
 Ability 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:36.260
 The right skills are not proportional since I finally I win 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.790
 Pirates Dacia right one word more low, but not doing anything changed in order yireogi 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.229
 Efficient and high self-esteem 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:46.860
 So what's the value of this structure? 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:50.220
 If you do not have to invest a lot of that cash investment, 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.150
 Lady city, but it is supposed jicho ships 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.050
 Hyeonjil lot and it will be a valuable high pressure 4 to 02 who are avoiding package

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.360
 So the unconditional beans are for those who have fun . 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:11.280

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.930
 I think it's advantageous. 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:32.100
 Unconditionally, the ball is buying more packages than buying blood, 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:37.310
 You have to feel the game, you have not decided on the game . 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.310
 I think the package is fast for fun. 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.710
