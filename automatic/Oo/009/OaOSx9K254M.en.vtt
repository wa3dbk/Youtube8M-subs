00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.910
 oh no what is it on the street so 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.070
 it's cold that even my character is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.070
 Maincraft could not resist 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.570
 Hello my dear friends with you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.359
 as always i'm rick paw and we go on 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.730
 We look at the mods for the minecraft in this 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.330
 video show you a mod called frost 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.980
 craft 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.009
 now everywhere everywhere winter everywhere everywhere alone 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.160
 the cold is so cold that just awful 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.329
 because we got the top indicator 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.129
 cold indicator or body temperature 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.250
 now you can know how much you are 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.789
 froze if the indicator will show 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.149
 what else a little bit and all end then you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.600
 just dying because you need to look 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.699
 always warm with this mod what else 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.980
 add this mod to this mod 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.940
 adds a little such protection from 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.910
 wool 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.920
 helps a little too anyway 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.770
 slightly yes there is craft 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.260
 very very simple just wool only 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 here's a hat here for one block 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.920
 let's take a look at how 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.740
 all the same 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.670
 heat up because as you can see 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.850
 now i'm standing in the snow and indicator 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.060
 little by little becomes little 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.380
 empty meaning the temperature goes away 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.650
 falls falls 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.570
 it's all really noticeable but you can somehow 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.180
 keep warm what can be used 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.520
 you can use lava that is to come 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.530
 clave and watch quietly indicator 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.220
 fills up body temperature 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.890
 rises and life goes on 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.530
 it is good lava running what else 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.829
 running works of course fire then 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.490
 there is if we put here this way 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.969
 so here so of course see 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.079
 how fast body temperature rises 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.950
 the indicator is becoming more and more 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.399
 so red so it rises still 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.700
 let's put it like this 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.220
 so this is how it will look now 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.220
 In general, at the maximum, everything is almost red 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.849
 body temperature is high solid 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.790
 everything is all everything is super 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:30.939
 dying all super so now let's 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:34.299
 here we go to the snow and everything starts 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:36.640
 quietly fall as guys can and 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.400
 quickly lower body temperature 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.870
 just go into the cold water 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.590
 look go here 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:49.060
 drop down and see how fast 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:53.200
 drops body temperature drops 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.269
 such a bath that you can really 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.280
 kill because if you installed this 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:02.019
 mod guys do not need to climb into the water 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.180
 undesirable because you see yourself 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.590
 how fast the temperature drops 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.269
 your body is already half already 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.799
 half how many for a few seconds 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:17.560
 half past 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.250
 so so more still okay , I think so far 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.379
 enough 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.250
 let's test some more stuff 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.269
 of course 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.069
 torch to torch glasses they work 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.500
 really work quietly here 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.730
 look so filled up 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.980
 slowly filling up 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.169
 it is very, very important all the same and the torch 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.579
 easy to craft and anyway 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:45.090
 warm you can go farther than 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.010
 but you can still warm and of course 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.400
 ordinary and the stove that is very fit 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.449
 close to something working here works 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.750
 boils and slowly well, very true 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:01.269
 little by little but that will be filled 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.269
 there is of course you need to wait but you can 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.000
 say and not fall well very very 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:13.889
 slowly filling up rises 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.959
 body temperature fills quietly 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:21.920
 fills well with that i think everything is clear 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.590
 torches fire head stove and so and 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.830
 then there is only one part as they are 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.800
 thing is lower body temperature on 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:35.060
 at the very least let's test 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.790
 so go down this bath and a little 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.730
 we wait 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:45.140
 so we have slowness weakness 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:48.200
 fatigue bad things about and bad things oh 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.260
 bad things convincing weakness so 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.660
 let's still omit so everything went dark in 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.090
 his eyes darkened 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.620
 blindness fatigue weakness 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.350
 slowness 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.100
 let's also lower body temperature and 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.980
 all all all all everything brings down brings down 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.470
 eventually death 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.530
 now in minecraft as in life cold 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.850
 leads only to one death because 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.820
 neatly basking 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.130
 and everything will be fine thank you so much 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.760
 per view and per subscription and likes before 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.760
 new meetings
