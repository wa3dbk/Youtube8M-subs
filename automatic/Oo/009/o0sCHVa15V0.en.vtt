00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.960
 The circle is closing. 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.420
 The end begins. 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.280
 You think you'll change something? 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.860
 At the end, the emperor wins. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.880
 Dark days are ahead of you. 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.620
 The darkest days. 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.300
 If my mistake is not cleared, everyone will pay the price. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.260
 If you defeat the Emperor, any sacrifices will be needed, they will not be wasted. 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.360
 Over time, it absorbs all life in the galaxy. 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.960
 Every living thing in the whole galaxy? That doesn't seem possible. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.100
 You confuse me for your own weak body. 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.560
 I have no end. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.680
 My life is a millennium, the legions have risen to try me. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:21.440
 Lived by the ranks of the dead ... I am awakened and bring with me with Death! 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.760
 You're mine. Servants, slaves, weapons ... 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.200
 A petty thing driven by its own hypocrisy 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.820
 You're the master of nothing! 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.700
 As long as the Emperor is not destroyed for good, the entire galaxy is in danger. 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.000
 If you don't give up, I'll destroy you. 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.080
 You're just a blind insect. Let your death be the same! 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.380
 The Deaths You Caused ... 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.840
 The War You Drove ... 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.580
 It's all mine! 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.180
 This galaxy is mys! 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.840
 It's time to conquer her ... again!
