name of James from P ver online
obviously<00:00:28.840> and<00:00:29.840> I'm<00:00:30.080> using<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.380> same<00:00:30.650> gravity

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
obviously and I'm using the same gravity

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.409 
obviously and I'm using the same gravity
team<00:00:31.250> as<00:00:31.490> they<00:00:31.610> used<00:00:31.760> in<00:00:31.850> my<00:00:31.940> last<00:00:32.180> battle

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
team as they used in my last battle

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.390 
team as they used in my last battle
because<00:00:33.170> it's<00:00:33.350> been<00:00:33.500> doing<00:00:33.710> pretty<00:00:33.890> well<00:00:33.980> so

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
because it's been doing pretty well so

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.880 
because it's been doing pretty well so
why<00:00:34.550> not<00:00:34.730> but<00:00:35.239> I'm<00:00:35.930> gonna<00:00:36.050> lead<00:00:36.350> off<00:00:36.380> with<00:00:36.680> my

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
why not but I'm gonna lead off with my

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.280 
why not but I'm gonna lead off with my
Dustin<00:00:37.400> are<00:00:37.520> and<00:00:37.760> man<00:00:38.090> Magnezone<00:00:38.870> this<00:00:39.080> time

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
Dustin are and man Magnezone this time

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.070 
Dustin are and man Magnezone this time
because<00:00:39.620> I<00:00:39.890> noticed<00:00:40.640> that<00:00:40.760> he<00:00:40.940> had<00:00:40.970> two<00:00:41.780> water

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
because I noticed that he had two water

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.020 
because I noticed that he had two water
types<00:00:42.320> on<00:00:42.500> his<00:00:42.590> team<00:00:42.830> and<00:00:43.070> he<00:00:43.700> will<00:00:43.850> most

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
types on his team and he will most

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.299 
types on his team and he will most
likely<00:00:44.270> use<00:00:44.540> at<00:00:44.989> least<00:00:45.230> one<00:00:45.470> of<00:00:45.590> them<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.040> I

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
likely use at least one of them so I

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.430 
likely use at least one of them so I
want<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:46.910> bring<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.420> my<00:00:47.750> electro<00:00:48.050> types<00:00:48.260> in

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
want to bring to my electro types in

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.710 
want to bring to my electro types in
there<00:00:48.620> just<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.010> be<00:00:49.129> safe<00:00:49.430> because<00:00:49.720> water

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
there just to be safe because water

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.570 
there just to be safe because water
types<00:00:51.050> can<00:00:51.320> be<00:00:51.379> pretty<00:00:51.739> dangerous<00:00:51.949> in<00:00:52.339> double

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
types can be pretty dangerous in double

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.460 
types can be pretty dangerous in double
battles<00:00:52.879> because<00:00:53.150> they<00:00:53.239> usually<00:00:53.390> carry<00:00:53.750> muddy

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
battles because they usually carry muddy

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.619 
battles because they usually carry muddy
water<00:00:54.769> and<00:00:54.920> surf<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.489> stuff<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.269> really

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
water and surf and stuff so I really

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.180 
water and surf and stuff so I really
don't<00:00:57.080> want<00:00:57.230> to<00:00:57.290> mess<00:00:57.409> around<00:00:57.530> with<00:00:57.800> that

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
don't want to mess around with that

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.520 
don't want to mess around with that
so<00:00:58.370> his<00:00:59.239> floatzel<00:00:59.750> is<00:00:59.870> gonna<00:01:00.050> go<00:01:00.170> for<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.350> ice

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
so his floatzel is gonna go for the ice

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.219 
so his floatzel is gonna go for the ice
beam<00:01:00.800> on<00:01:01.010> my<00:01:01.220> magnet<00:01:02.180> on<00:01:02.360> magnets<00:01:02.390> on<00:01:03.080> I'm

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
beam on my magnet on magnets on I'm

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.170 
beam on my magnet on magnets on I'm
sorry<00:01:03.409> it's<00:01:04.100> gonna<00:01:04.220> get<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:04.430> crit<00:01:04.790> I'm<00:01:04.970> not

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
sorry it's gonna get a crit I'm not

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.600 
sorry it's gonna get a crit I'm not
quite<00:01:05.449> sure<00:01:05.479> if<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:05.870> really<00:01:06.110> matter<00:01:06.350> because

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
quite sure if that really matter because

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.460 
quite sure if that really matter because
his<00:01:07.720> metric<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.840> just<00:01:08.990> gonna<00:01:09.140> go<00:01:09.290> straight

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
his metric is just gonna go straight

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.780 
his metric is just gonna go straight
with<00:01:09.620> it<00:01:09.710> over<00:01:09.890> here<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.159> take<00:01:10.400> me<00:01:10.550> out<00:01:10.580> of

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
with it over here and take me out of

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.850 
with it over here and take me out of
there<00:01:10.880> right<00:01:10.909> away<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:11.960> is<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.200> pretty<00:01:12.650> bad

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
there right away so that is a pretty bad

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.250 
there right away so that is a pretty bad
start<00:01:13.250> for<00:01:13.280> me<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.760> magnet<00:01:14.479> zone<00:01:14.630> goes<00:01:14.810> on<00:01:15.020> right

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
start for me a magnet zone goes on right

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.370 
start for me a magnet zone goes on right
away<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.610> not<00:01:16.820> good<00:01:16.970> at<00:01:17.060> all<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.630> get<00:01:18.350> a

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
away that is not good at all so get a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.870 
away that is not good at all so get a
set<00:01:18.560> of<00:01:18.650> gravity<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:19.130> with<00:01:19.250> my<00:01:19.430> dust<00:01:19.670> norm

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
set of gravity it with my dust norm

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.190 
set of gravity it with my dust norm
because<00:01:20.150> obviously<00:01:20.479> I<00:01:20.720> don't<00:01:20.810> need<00:01:20.990> that

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
because obviously I don't need that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.840 
because obviously I don't need that
gravity<00:01:21.590> up<00:01:21.680> as<00:01:21.830> fast<00:01:22.160> as<00:01:22.280> possible<00:01:22.700> because

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
gravity up as fast as possible because

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.240 
gravity up as fast as possible because
my<00:01:23.690> team<00:01:23.960> pretty<00:01:24.230> much<00:01:24.320> fertilizer<00:01:24.530> around

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
my team pretty much fertilizer around

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.670 
my team pretty much fertilizer around
that<00:01:25.610> gravity<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:26.300> I'll<00:01:26.960> win<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.260> ended<00:01:27.440> up<00:01:27.530> as

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
that gravity so I'll win the ended up as

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.200 
that gravity so I'll win the ended up as
fast<00:01:27.920> as<00:01:28.040> possible<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.610> then<00:01:28.730> I<00:01:28.760> get<00:01:28.910> a<00:01:28.940> set<00:01:29.090> of

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
fast as possible and then I get a set of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.230 
fast as possible and then I get a set of
Lucario<00:01:29.660> go<00:01:30.470> for<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.710> Focus<00:01:31.130> Blast<00:01:31.160> I<00:01:31.730> know<00:01:31.820> it

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
Lucario go for the Focus Blast I know it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.060 
Lucario go for the Focus Blast I know it
will<00:01:32.360> hit<00:01:32.570> because<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.990> gravity<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.950> I

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
will hit because of the gravity and I

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.890 
will hit because of the gravity and I
will<00:01:34.370> take<00:01:34.880> out<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.150> minute<00:01:35.420> trick<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:35.720> one

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
will take out that minute trick in one

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.380 
will take out that minute trick in one
shot<00:01:36.230> but<00:01:36.260> then<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:37.100> was<00:01:37.730> kind<00:01:37.970> of<00:01:38.000> surprised

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
shot but then I was kind of surprised

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.540 
shot but then I was kind of surprised
because<00:01:38.680> turns<00:01:39.680> out<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:40.040> his<00:01:40.160> floatzel

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
because turns out that his floatzel

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.940 
because turns out that his floatzel
carries<00:01:40.910> Focus<00:01:41.450> Blast<00:01:41.480> as<00:01:41.810> well<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.380> he<00:01:42.800> is

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
carries Focus Blast as well and he is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.970 
carries Focus Blast as well and he is
obviously<00:01:43.220> gonna<00:01:43.550> hit<00:01:43.790> my<00:01:44.080> Lucario<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.410> it<00:01:45.860> is

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
obviously gonna hit my Lucario and it is

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.170 
obviously gonna hit my Lucario and it is
gonna<00:01:46.190> go<00:01:46.370> down<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:46.580> one<00:01:46.820> shot<00:01:46.850> I'm

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
gonna go down in one shot I'm

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.960 
gonna go down in one shot I'm
considering<00:01:47.690> putting<00:01:47.960> on<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.460> focus<00:01:49.460> ash<00:01:49.640> on

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
considering putting on a focus ash on

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.760 
considering putting on a focus ash on
then

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
then

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.650 
then
I'm<00:01:51.770> not<00:01:51.980> Lucario<00:01:52.400> because<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.820> goes<00:01:52.970> down<00:01:53.210> way

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660

surviving<00:02:49.040> because<00:02:49.130> sceptile<00:02:49.700> has<00:02:49.880> really

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
surviving because sceptile has really

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.650
