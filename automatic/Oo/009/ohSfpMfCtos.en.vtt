00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.160 
review with Tom vassal well welcome
Dominion<00:00:20.550> addicts<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.630> those<00:00:21.840> who<00:00:22.020> were

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
Dominion addicts and those who were

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.920 
Dominion addicts and those who were
suckered<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.680> by<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.949> word<00:00:23.130> alchemy<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.150> this

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
suckered in by the word alchemy and this

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439 
suckered in by the word alchemy and this
definitely<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.770> an<00:00:25.920> expansion<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
definitely is an expansion for the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.620 
definitely is an expansion for the
addicts<00:00:27.869> not<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:28.949> think<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
addicts not that I think that it's the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.229 
addicts not that I think that it's the
best<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> series<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.099> fact<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.729> have

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
best one of the series in fact I have

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.389 
best one of the series in fact I have
quite<00:00:33.839> the<00:00:33.870> opposite<00:00:34.739> feelings<00:00:35.069> of<00:00:35.129> that<00:00:35.249> but

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
quite the opposite feelings of that but

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.829 
quite the opposite feelings of that but
I<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.639> this<00:00:35.819> is<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.179> attics<00:00:36.600> will<00:00:36.719> get

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
I think this is one of attics will get

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:38.599 
I think this is one of attics will get
because<00:00:37.319> they<00:00:37.620> want<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:38.039> complete<00:00:38.309> their

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
because they want to complete their

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.399 
because they want to complete their
collection<00:00:38.729> now<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.690> notice<00:00:39.989> this

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:40.409 
collection now if you notice this

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.950 
collection now if you notice this
expansion<00:00:40.889> for<00:00:41.219> Dominion<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.819> a<00:00:42.059> smaller<00:00:42.539> size

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
expansion for Dominion is a smaller size

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.079 
expansion for Dominion is a smaller size
than<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.409> other<00:00:43.530> ones<00:00:43.799> and<00:00:44.039> that's<00:00:44.699> because

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
than the other ones and that's because

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.879 
than the other ones and that's because
there's<00:00:45.269> quite<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.839> few<00:00:45.899> less<00:00:46.170> cards<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.709> in

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:46.889 
there's quite a few less cards in it in

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:49.099 
there's quite a few less cards in it in
fact<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.879> almost<00:00:48.089> not<00:00:48.510> worth<00:00:48.539> getting

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
fact it's almost not worth getting

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.680 
fact it's almost not worth getting
because<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.679> seems<00:00:49.949> so<00:00:50.069> small<00:00:50.699> as<00:00:50.999> opposed<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
because it seems so small as opposed to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.939 
because it seems so small as opposed to
the<00:00:51.749> other<00:00:51.869> expansions<00:00:52.409> that<00:00:52.499> I<00:00:52.589> hope<00:00:52.799> they

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the other expansions that I hope they

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.859 
the other expansions that I hope they
never<00:00:53.129> make<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.459> is<00:00:53.609> small<00:00:53.850> again<00:00:54.089> but<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:54.869 
never make one is small again but this

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:57.049 
never make one is small again but this
adds<00:00:55.139> a<00:00:55.289> completely<00:00:55.649> different<00:00:56.059> mechanic

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
adds a completely different mechanic

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.569 
adds a completely different mechanic
kind<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.869> the<00:00:57.989> game<00:00:58.170> let's<00:00:59.159> just<00:00:59.279> look<00:00:59.399> at

waste<00:02:09.049> to<00:02:09.170> have<00:02:09.229> these<00:02:09.440> potions<00:02:09.679> with<00:02:10.429> only

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
waste to have these potions with only

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.640 
waste to have these potions with only
one<00:02:10.880> card<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.360> in<00:02:11.420> fact<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.810> rules<00:02:12.049> recommend

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
one card and in fact the rules recommend

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.289 
one card and in fact the rules recommend
to<00:02:13.130> play<00:02:13.310> with<00:02:13.519> between<00:02:13.790> three<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.269> five

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
to play with between three to five

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.819 
to play with between three to five
different<00:02:14.720> alchemy<00:02:15.200> cards<00:02:15.500> while<00:02:15.650> you're

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
different alchemy cards while you're

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.650 
different alchemy cards while you're
playing<00:02:16.040> since<00:02:16.940> there's<00:02:17.180> only<00:02:17.239> twelve

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
alchemy cards in the set you can see how

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.090 
alchemy cards in the set you can see how
this<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.209> little<00:02:20.769> disconcerting<00:02:21.769> for<00:02:21.980> me

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
this is a little disconcerting for me

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.550 
this is a little disconcerting for me
because<00:02:22.519> I<00:02:22.850> want<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.600> use<00:02:23.840> as<00:02:24.049> big<00:02:24.410> as

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
because I want to use as big as

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.340 
because I want to use as big as
randomness<00:02:25.190> as<00:02:25.400> possible<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.989> use<00:02:27.170> it

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
randomness as possible but if I use it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.449 
randomness as possible but if I use it
out<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.680> me<00:02:27.769> I'm<00:02:27.859> going<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.040> have<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.250> use<00:02:28.340> at

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
out to me I'm going to have to use at

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.789 
out to me I'm going to have to use at
least<00:02:28.640> three<00:02:28.820> or<00:02:29.600> more<00:02:29.870> cards<00:02:29.930> from<00:02:30.470> alchemy

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
least three or more cards from alchemy

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.130 
least three or more cards from alchemy
to<00:02:30.890> make<00:02:31.160> these<00:02:31.310> potions<00:02:31.579> worthwhile<00:02:32.269> not<00:02:32.989> to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
to make these potions worthwhile not to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.319 
to make these potions worthwhile not to
mention<00:02:33.350> this<00:02:33.950> expansion<00:02:34.459> comes<00:02:34.790> by<00:02:34.970> itself

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
mention this expansion comes by itself

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.630 
mention this expansion comes by itself
with<00:02:35.570> only<00:02:35.720> 12<00:02:36.019> cards<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:36.590> not<00:02:36.739> sure<00:02:36.799> we'll

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
with only 12 cards so I'm not sure we'll

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.099 
with only 12 cards so I'm not sure we'll
see<00:02:37.820> many<00:02:37.970> cards<00:02:38.390> with<00:02:38.510> potions<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:39.049> the

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
see many cards with potions in the

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.349 
see many cards with potions in the
future<00:02:39.500> but<00:02:40.489> there<00:02:40.609> are<00:02:40.700> some<00:02:40.880> interesting

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
future but there are some interesting

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.180 
future but there are some interesting
cards<00:02:41.900> in<00:02:42.079> this<00:02:42.260> set<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.769> think<00:02:42.799> they'd<00:02:43.100> be

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
cards in this set and I think they'd be

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.920 
cards in this set and I think they'd be
even<00:02:43.519> more<00:02:43.670> interesting<00:02:43.910> without<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
even more interesting without the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.509 
even more interesting without the
potions<00:02:45.319> but<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.950> can<00:02:46.100> see<00:02:46.220> if<00:02:46.340> for<00:02:46.489> example

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
potions but you can see if for example

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.970 
potions but you can see if for example
transmute<00:02:47.480> where<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.019> trash<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.350> card<00:02:48.739> and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
transmute where you trash a card and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.920 
transmute where you trash a card and
depending<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.700> what<00:02:49.790> kind<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:50.000> trash<00:02:50.269> card<00:02:50.630> you

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
depending on what kind of trash card you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.809 
depending on what kind of trash card you
get<00:02:51.019> an<00:02:51.140> action<00:02:51.530> well<00:02:52.190> that's<00:02:52.340> not<00:02:52.519> quite<00:02:52.730> so

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
get an action well that's not quite so

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.539 
get an action well that's not quite so
useful<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.690> neat<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.889> mean<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.130> guess<00:02:55.430> it's

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
useful and neat I mean I guess it's

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.099 
useful and neat I mean I guess it's
useful<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:55.880> guess<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.239> not<00:02:56.329> that<00:02:56.389> interesting

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
useful I guess it's not that interesting

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.110 
useful I guess it's not that interesting
and<00:02:57.290> neither<00:02:57.440> is<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:57.889> vineyard<00:02:58.280> here<00:02:58.579> which

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
and neither is this vineyard here which

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.030 
and neither is this vineyard here which
is<00:02:59.299> worth<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.630> victory<00:02:59.959> point<00:03:00.230> for<00:03:00.769> everyone

is worth a victory point for everyone

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.890 
is worth a victory point for everyone
every<00:03:01.730> three<00:03:01.970> action<00:03:02.269> cards<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.630> your<00:03:02.660> deck

every three action cards in your deck

every three action cards in your deck
well<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.709> have<00:03:03.829> a<00:03:03.859> deck<00:03:04.040> with<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> ton<00:03:04.430> of

well if you have a deck with a ton of

well if you have a deck with a ton of
action<00:03:04.700> cards<00:03:05.180> which<00:03:05.359> this<00:03:05.540> promotes<00:03:06.019> I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
action cards which this promotes I

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.440 
action cards which this promotes I
suppose<00:03:06.650> that's<00:03:06.950> worth<00:03:07.609> it<00:03:07.819> but<00:03:08.209> with<00:03:08.359> the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
suppose that's worth it but with the

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.720 
suppose that's worth it but with the
garden<00:03:08.840> already<00:03:09.019> in<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.650> game<00:03:09.889> I'm<00:03:10.310> just<00:03:10.430> not

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
garden already in the game I'm just not

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.270 
garden already in the game I'm just not
sure<00:03:10.760> how<00:03:11.600> that<00:03:11.660> works<00:03:12.109> so<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.410> can<00:03:12.530> see<00:03:12.709> there

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
sure how that works so you can see there

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.009 
sure how that works so you can see there
are<00:03:13.400> many<00:03:13.579> different<00:03:14.000> cards<00:03:14.389> and<00:03:14.720> I'm<00:03:14.870> not

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
are many different cards and I'm not

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.240 
are many different cards and I'm not
going<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.230> go<00:03:15.319> over<00:03:15.500> all<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.709> different<00:03:15.829> cards

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
going to go over all the different cards

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.819 
going to go over all the different cards
that<00:03:16.730> are<00:03:16.850> included<00:03:17.209> with<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.690> game<00:03:17.720> this<00:03:18.560> one

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
that are included with the game this one

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.189 
that are included with the game this one
I<00:03:18.859> find<00:03:19.310> very<00:03:19.519> interesting<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.660> it's<00:03:20.750> maybe

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
I find very interesting and it's maybe

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.199 
I find very interesting and it's maybe
my<00:03:21.410> favorite<00:03:21.769> card<00:03:21.979> from<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> set<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.609> that's

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
my favorite card from the set and that's

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.690 
my favorite card from the set and that's
the<00:03:23.419> golem<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.199> lets<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.530> reveal<00:03:24.919> cards<00:03:25.400> from

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
the golem it lets you reveal cards from

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.420 
the golem it lets you reveal cards from
your<00:03:25.819> hand<00:03:26.060> until<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:27.230> reveal<00:03:27.620> two<00:03:28.010> action

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
your hand until you reveal two action

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.880 
your hand until you reveal two action
cards<00:03:28.730> other<00:03:28.970> than<00:03:29.209> go<00:03:29.450> home<00:03:29.599> cards<00:03:29.959> discard

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
cards other than go home cards discard

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.050 
cards other than go home cards discard
all<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.160> other<00:03:31.280> cards<00:03:31.550> and<00:03:31.760> play<00:03:31.879> these

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
all the other cards and play these

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.360 
all the other cards and play these
action<00:03:32.420> cards<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:32.780> any<00:03:32.900> other<00:03:33.200> order<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.280> it's

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
action cards in any other order so it's

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.809 
action cards in any other order so it's
basically<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.790> +2<00:03:35.480> action<00:03:36.200> but<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.950> can<00:03:37.129> you're

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
basically a +2 action but you can you're

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.309 
basically a +2 action but you can you're
pulling<00:03:38.269> these<00:03:38.360> other<00:03:38.540> two<00:03:38.720> action<00:03:39.050> cards<00:03:39.230> in

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
pulling these other two action cards in

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.290 
pulling these other two action cards in
the<00:03:39.379> deck<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:39.560> it's<00:03:39.769> guaranteed<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:41.090> more

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
the deck so it's guaranteed to more

the beginning of the game but as the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.060 
the beginning of the game but as the
game<00:04:21.079> progresses<00:04:21.500> it's<00:04:21.739> going<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:21.919> become

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
game progresses it's going to become

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.620 
game progresses it's going to become
more<00:04:22.370> it's<00:04:22.490> more<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:22.850> more<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.120> more<00:04:23.300> and

more it's more and more and more and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.530 
more it's more and more and more and
since<00:04:24.110> most<00:04:24.290> decks<00:04:25.070> end<00:04:25.400> up<00:04:25.580> with<00:04:25.760> 25<00:04:26.150> cards

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
since most decks end up with 25 cards

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.870 
since most decks end up with 25 cards
this<00:04:26.750> is<00:04:26.870> gonna<00:04:26.960> become<00:04:27.290> more<00:04:27.440> five<00:04:27.740> gold<00:04:28.100> you

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
this is gonna become more five gold you

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.420 
this is gonna become more five gold you
know<00:04:28.970> at<00:04:29.210> some<00:04:29.450> point<00:04:29.510> in<00:04:29.810> time<00:04:29.840> but<00:04:30.050> still<00:04:30.740> the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
know at some point in time but still the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.129 
know at some point in time but still the
fact<00:04:31.700> that<00:04:31.940> every<00:04:32.120> time<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.479> card<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:32.840> played

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.700 
fact that every time this card is played
every<00:04:33.380> single<00:04:34.690> card<00:04:35.690> in<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.900> discarded<00:04:36.289> drop

every single card in a discarded drop
out<00:04:36.919> are<00:04:37.100> counted<00:04:37.820> this<00:04:38.300> card<00:04:38.720> really<00:04:39.260> slows

out are counted this card really slows

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.190 
out are counted this card really slows
the<00:04:39.770> game<00:04:39.919> down<00:04:39.979> it's<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.370> neat<00:04:40.610> idea<00:04:41.080> but<00:04:42.080> it's

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
the game down it's a neat idea but it's

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.020 
the game down it's a neat idea but it's
not<00:04:42.229> as<00:04:42.410> hated<00:04:42.800> as<00:04:42.919> possession<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.639> possession

the<00:04:46.039> game<00:04:46.190> since<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.610> cost<00:04:47.030> six<00:04:47.720> dollars<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.590> a

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
the game since it cost six dollars and a

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.409 
the game since it cost six dollars and a
potion<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.289> when<00:04:51.289> you<00:04:51.500> use<00:04:52.190> possession<00:04:52.880> you

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
potion and when you use possession you

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.090 
potion and when you use possession you
are<00:04:53.539> attacking<00:04:53.870> another<00:04:54.169> not<00:04:54.680> it's<00:04:54.800> not<00:04:54.889> even

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
are attacking another not it's not even

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.379 
are attacking another not it's not even
attacks<00:04:55.460> there's<00:04:55.729> really<00:04:55.850> no<00:04:56.030> defense

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
attacks there's really no defense

attacks there's really no defense
against<00:04:56.660> it<00:04:56.810> but<00:04:57.289> you<00:04:57.410> basically<00:04:57.530> take

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
against it but you basically take

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.129 
against it but you basically take
another<00:04:58.220> player's<00:04:58.490> hand<00:04:59.000> of<00:04:59.180> cards<00:04:59.360> and<00:04:59.660> you

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
another player's hand of cards and you

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.629 
another player's hand of cards and you
play<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:00.770> get<00:05:00.979> all<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.430> stuff<00:05:01.610> that

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
play it and you get all the stuff that

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.029 
play it and you get all the stuff that
they've<00:05:01.940> done<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.479> comes<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.410> you<00:05:03.560> instead<00:05:03.979> of

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
they've done it comes to you instead of

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.680 
they've done it comes to you instead of
going<00:05:04.130> to<00:05:04.460> them<00:05:04.639> they<00:05:05.060> don't<00:05:05.150> really<00:05:05.419> get<00:05:05.539> in

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
going to them they don't really get in

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.909 
going to them they don't really get in
trouble<00:05:05.930> from<00:05:06.229> this<00:05:06.410> you're<00:05:06.590> basically<00:05:06.860> just

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
trouble from this you're basically just

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.279 
trouble from this you're basically just
borrowing<00:05:07.430> their<00:05:07.580> cars<00:05:07.820> for<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.090> while<00:05:08.180> but<00:05:08.900> one

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
borrowing their cars for a while but one

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.379 
borrowing their cars for a while but one
it<00:05:09.500> slows<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.950> game<00:05:10.070> down<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.340> -<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:10.880> really

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
it slows the game down a - it really

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.719 
it slows the game down a - it really
ticks<00:05:11.660> off<00:05:11.840> other<00:05:12.050> players<00:05:12.380> Isis<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.430> people

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
ticks off other players Isis and people

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.460 
ticks off other players Isis and people
has<00:05:13.820> some<00:05:13.970> really<00:05:14.150> violent<00:05:14.720> reactions<00:05:15.289> to

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
has some really violent reactions to

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.200 
has some really violent reactions to
possession<00:05:15.800> so<00:05:16.520> this<00:05:16.669> game<00:05:16.849> is<00:05:16.880> all<00:05:17.180> about

potions<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.170> I<00:06:14.620> usually<00:06:14.980> agree<00:06:15.250> because<00:06:15.520> it's

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
potions and I usually agree because it's

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.310 
potions and I usually agree because it's
a<00:06:15.760> little<00:06:15.910> bit<00:06:16.090> more<00:06:16.240> trouble<00:06:16.660> to<00:06:16.750> set<00:06:16.960> up<00:06:17.110> and

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
a little bit more trouble to set up and

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.440 
a little bit more trouble to set up and
it<00:06:17.860> doesn't<00:06:18.250> really<00:06:18.400> have<00:06:18.700> that<00:06:18.940> big<00:06:19.000> of<00:06:19.270> a

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
it doesn't really have that big of a

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.990 
it doesn't really have that big of a
payoff<00:06:19.810> this<00:06:20.080> is<00:06:20.200> by<00:06:20.590> far<00:06:20.980> the<00:06:21.310> weakest

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
payoff this is by far the weakest

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.750 
payoff this is by far the weakest
expansion<00:06:22.630> for<00:06:22.780> Dominion<00:06:23.290> because<00:06:23.920> maybe

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
expansion for Dominion because maybe

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.250 
expansion for Dominion because maybe

there's strategies in these cards that I

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.080 
there's strategies in these cards that I
get<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.560> discover<00:06:26.950> but<00:06:27.220> it's<00:06:27.370> really<00:06:27.820> just
