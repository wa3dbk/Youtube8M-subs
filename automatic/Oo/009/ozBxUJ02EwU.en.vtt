00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 arrived this long-awaited equal to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.089
 bentegodi already 59 in fact we expected it 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.990
 also here in the house a beautiful one 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.540
 satisfaction 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.780
 yes no 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.330
 in conclusion 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.670
 however, it was long awaited beyond the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.550
 goal I think it was important for today 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.820
 team win then satisfaction 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.400
 very personal but also of 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.070
 teams equally wrecked beyond the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.110
 goals indeed of the goals excuse me many occasions 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.689
 you made the department by yourself I ask you 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.009
 right away meanwhile if you find yourself better between 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.020
 quotes there alone have a certain 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 point it is played with a kind of 4 1 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.730
 4 1 and 2 propose yourself as you are 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.949
 better there in front no I am better 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.510
 any way always played more 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.039
 then modules during my career 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.929
 I always try to make myself available 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.409
 of the coach for the needs of the 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.600
 team 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.649
 if then I can do the same as today a 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.659
 in other words, to concretize so much better 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.690
 I don't have a favorite module too 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.809
 for you it would be a limit for the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.460
 my career have only a certain kind of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.220
 features for a module then 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.479
 I always try to do my best 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.520
 what the coach asks me to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.590
 week if I can also score goals 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.600
 like today is the best liked the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.600
 verona has put himself down alone 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.530
 is concentrated 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.490
 concentration 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.490
 compared to little 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.180
 in the last you feel then 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.350
 usually 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.200
 in this championship it is long and difficult 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.110
 missteps you can be 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.420
 without making drama we start again we talk 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.950
 mister sum said our state 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.840
 a choice to be very closed 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.880
 to make them puff a little bit to make them 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.500
 tire at the second half try to 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.409
 maybe hit them in theirs 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.869
 in other words, difficulty is their second 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.310
 you have voluntarily chosen of 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.069
 close so much and then look for the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.929
 second time to hurt you but not 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.439
 we see that they had prepared the 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.979
 game 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.069
 under this in these respects therefore 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.750
 then each coach to his own we say 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.310
 she will do her own ways to see the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.220
 game we see that the coach has tried 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.950
 to prepare this match hoping that 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.370
 however the first time is decided to 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.989
 finish 0 0 to 0 and then maybe attack 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.700
 putting offensive players in the 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.420
 according to how bonanni lanzafame these 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.520
 players here 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.630
 better so it went better for us 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.090
 in short, we have unlocked the game 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.170
 and therefore surely they are found 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.190
 a little in difficulty 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.840
 clearly this is a script that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.790
 we will see many other times because many 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.370
 teams will come here to make barricades 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.319
 in short, to give up playing in those 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.290
 cases of what the Verona must do where 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.930
 he must be a good boy and he must not 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.700
 be good you must surely have 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.770
 also a bit of luck because when 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.090
 find a team that closes 11 of the 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.980
 ball is difficult to score is difficult 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.319
 therefore find the hole 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.819
 you will need to think that the best solution is 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.470
 that of having a lot of patience e 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.220
 concentration because in any case during 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.959
 90 minutes 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.430
 it always happens that your opponents 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.880
 they leave a hole and that hole you owe it 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.040
 exploit 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.989
 I ask you something that maybe difficult 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.790
 let's try to explain what instinct is 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.799
 killer of an attacker who is alone 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.420
 in front of the goalkeeper who would seem a 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.819
 simple goal actually in those moments 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.739
 what's on your mind but in those 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.799
 moments I think we spend 2 million 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.440
 of things each in a second between seconds 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.670
 you spend 2 million things but maybe 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.480
 the nice thing is that it cannot be explained 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.360
 because anyway 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.380
 at least I'm right 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.030
 I always reasoned with rejected 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.350
 and then I always try to conclude how 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.360
 extinct because 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.220
 I'm not so much to think why 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.540
 otherwise when you start thinking 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.120
 in front of the door then more than once 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.190
 therefore wrong if this feature 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.020
 of instinct I try to exploit it to 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.270
 one hundred percent goal came under the 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.280
 curve I think it was even more there 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.830
 nice yes it was nice i was waiting for it below 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.200
 the curve because in short, to see a curve 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.380
 so in series b and e see that too in 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.150
 series does not have a curve like that 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.490
 in short, I think this environment is this 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.260
 curve deserves other stages beyond 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.060
 of the singular aspect of the game of 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.910
 today how difficult it is to win, that is 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.920
 have this burden on the rump 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.310
 having to win by force because it is one 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.720
 team that must win but 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.930
 perhaps that was the era of the that a 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.160
 sometimes even from outside 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.980
 the pressures that come from outside 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.090
 maybe after that the error that anyway 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.530
 it seems that every game you have to win 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.330
 and win big but it is not so because 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.580
 this championship is long and difficult 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.470
 as I have already said many times I will be 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.360
 repetitive however it is the truth and the series b 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.360
 it's long and hard you'll never find one 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.860
 team that wins a game 6 to 0 can 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.780
 happen but it will happen once during 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.100
 the year therefore all the other matches 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.620
 they will be as difficult as today 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.330
 where however 11 is weak in the ball e 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.070
 struggling to close the game as at 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.060
 second time it also risks being able to 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.590
 equalize 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.300
 this is the series be so let's go 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.940
 go on like this we're doing good one 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.300
 challenge between you and gonzalez forma no non 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.819
 I'm outdone 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.080
 if I look because it is normal that a 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.430
 in short, the player is pleased 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.669
 try to get higher 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.740
 possible, however, is a challenge between me and 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.539
 trame il verona does not tremble and gonzalez e 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.740
 I think in my house in my house I have to 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.629
 try to do well for my team 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.120
 for my for my staff for 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.319
 the coach for the fans then the 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.909
 our destiny as I have said many times 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.280
 we play it ourselves 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:19.939
 special dedications no special dedications 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.319
 of course always as early as possible 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.599
 my family permanently to my son 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.979
 so in short I think it's things 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.960
 most important to me right now 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.240
 so they will be forever too 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.530
 today I would like to tell them anyway 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.229
 know that for us who are journalists 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.849
 that we are close by anyway fans in between 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.590
 the fans there is a special emotion a 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.169
 in short, seeing you in the field is not a thing 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.879
 that happens every day here in the 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.919
 tip had been expecting for a long time I think you 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:45.460
 feel this feeling from 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.350
 fans but I don't know 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.880
 I feel that there is a lot of respect in mine 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.350
 comparisons and this surely to me me 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.650
 gives a lot of stimulation 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:56.680
 then your emotions don't know them 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.240
 I know, however, if you trust trusted series 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.680
 if I can transmit this type of 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.740
 emotions I'm glad I hope that 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.270
 may be able to send them for so long 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.310
 time not only this year but also for 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.449
 another year ago two years ago and again 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.449
 many goals and we hope
