you go through the exercises a bit you
will<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.590> all<00:00:19.830> over<00:00:20.670> these<00:00:20.820> scale<00:00:21.240> patterns<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
will be all over these scale patterns to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.560 
will be all over these scale patterns to
play<00:00:22.800> an<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.130> minor<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.609> get<00:00:24.060> your<00:00:24.210> index

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.570 
play an a minor you get your index
finger<00:00:24.960> set<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> fifth<00:00:25.949> fret<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> E

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
finger set up on the fifth fret of the E

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.080 
finger set up on the fifth fret of the E
string<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.869> then<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.380> your<00:00:28.670> fingers<00:00:29.670> set<00:00:29.910> up

string and then have your fingers set up
so<00:00:30.330> there

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
so there

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.950 
so there
one<00:00:31.320> per<00:00:31.619> fret<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.160> four<00:00:32.369> frets<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.969> then

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
one per fret for four frets and then

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.950 
one per fret for four frets and then
this<00:00:34.200> scale<00:00:34.530> pattern<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.090> index

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
this scale pattern is going to go index

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.549 
this scale pattern is going to go index
finger<00:00:37.440> ring<00:00:38.160> finger<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.910> pinky<00:00:39.110> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> same

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
finger ring finger and pinky on the same

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.720 
finger ring finger and pinky on the same
string<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:42.649> then<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> next<00:00:44.399> string

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
string and then go up to the next string

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.660 
string and then go up to the next string
and<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> same<00:00:45.629> thing

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.549 

and<00:00:49.120> then<00:00:49.269> go<00:00:49.449> up<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:49.809> next<00:00:50.109> string<00:00:50.320> and

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
and then go up to the next string and

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.250 
and then go up to the next string and
finish<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.070> off<00:00:51.250> with<00:00:51.550> index<00:00:52.449> and<00:00:52.809> ring<00:00:53.469> finger

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
finish it off with index and ring finger

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:10.110 
finish it off with index and ring finger
so<00:00:56.260> all<00:00:56.710> together

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
build up some muscle memory with it and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.250 
build up some muscle memory with it and
the<00:01:16.550> best<00:01:16.790> way<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.000> do<00:01:17.300> it<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.720> play<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.230> a
