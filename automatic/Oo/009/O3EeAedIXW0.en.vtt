00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.170
 small-war number two respectively 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.549
 video on the small-war category today 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.900
 it's all about the sound again 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.520
 I want to give you tips and tricks 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 say how we are doing 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.710
 what is the last weeks of my now 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.810
 view on the complaint already so 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.300
 has crystallized and what you have 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.609
 pay attention when we look at it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 in the statistics does not currently look 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.590
 so bright from the last small war 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.719
 quite clear defeat 31 to 71 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.030
 opponent was simple and in this case 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.730
 say completely superior already from 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.980
 small even if we look 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 on the basis of the cup for example, once 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.090
 this whole place should load where I am 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.010
 right now you realize that it's really general 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.420
 something is father or 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.949
 connection termination explains that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.760
 Of course, also Hudson's short 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.190
 kicked out 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.510
 but you just leave quickly 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.989
 load times and look directly again 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 stopped purely exactly we were there 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.210
 that the opponent is hopeless 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.670
 was superior 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.799
 we currently have 20,000 local ones again 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.049
 Opponent would be 21,000 but has louder 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.090
 players with level 100 and up almost 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.990
 Only one more main problem where I am 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.790
 not in this case me 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.200
 it's easy but what they are 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.750
 the last wars also shows where you are 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 The best time to take a look just when we 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.860
 Although we look at our statistics we 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.350
 have currently won six 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.630
 small wars and have the last 3 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 lost and generally I think must 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.930
 always were in front of the stood here 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 very tight and there I am 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.630
 really annoyed I have to say 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.509
 if you look at the map 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.659
 and then go into the clear overview 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.360
 or best attack the statistics 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.670
 about 20 pieces of the opposing plan 8 the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 The main focus is why we are 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.030
 I often lose something too 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 pity, but what is currently easy 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.630
 does not work better that is attacked 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.759
 and attacked is attacked and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.049
 use your two attacks just so can 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.210
 In the end, you really want to be clear 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.710
 help 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.880
 we're looking in here to have top players 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.909
 not attacked what a pity 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.590
 is and what matters 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.509
 So we really said that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.360
 was a really close defeat 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.310
 There was a difference with eleven and we 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.560
 had 12 fewer attacks in the relationship 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.870
 than that and if the twelve were still attacking 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.700
 had even been made 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.590
 if you bring only one star 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.510
 and have already packed everything is 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.400
 really my main things where i give you 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.590
 quite clearly can recommend that he 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.230
 the clan has the active is where everyone 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.140
 attack so far, I'll say that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.239
 Note or the question or the question 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.810
 unless and my little hearty 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.549
 welcome 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.859
 if you are really an active player 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.079
 since the faithful and the one too 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.150
 small war is active so I say 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.250
 There is still a player in clearing it 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.900
 again and again in a straight match 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.609
 the poor donate or the at 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.739
 clear war does not attack more mostly 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.500
 then I will say on duration of me 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.359
 sometimes catapulted out because that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.010
 It's just too bad that's always the case 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.840
 a reason why I do not feel like it then 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.060
 to start the small war because then 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.829
 Everyone never really attacks 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.370
 how could it be live in this 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.109
 Video 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.879
 if you see the same start again 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.400
 a new sonic already much that it 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.120
 fun and we even have 45 against 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.310
 45 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.680
 that means all current players in the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.319
 are also qualified 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.030
 sounded war 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.220
 but since you just have to hope so that there 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.530
 really also actively attacked and 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.629
 that gives you the chance to win here 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.280
 another point where i am 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.299
 or what I just need to revise 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.940
 can give a tip 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.459
 Regarding the groups troups in the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.470
 Klamm I had said recently or 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.849
 with us it is so that only mark 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.049
 to be donated 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.030
 but there I have now 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.459
 really found a new formation 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.949
 which appeals to me much more and that 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.970
 it's just witches the witches in one 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.129
 clear box a really cool 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.180
 defense unit you need forever 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.949
 until they come out 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.060
 that is, who are in the castle there 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.430
 then stay in a fortress 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.810
 already produce their skeletons for everyone 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.120
 We do not know the witches so well 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.180
 you can call here right now 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.150
 Your skeletons will produce exactly mine 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.370
 Here, there are more and more small ones coming 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.620
 out and first have to defend 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.319
 that is when I attack and 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.669
 it is in the small castle change is 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.260
 it with sony has the unit and the 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.969
 first turn off the witches 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.859
 really were lured outside 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:21.780
 so that you can then turn it off 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.290
 with sparkling clean and bow and what also 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.970
 always 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.980
 we are really very many 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.650
 troops have gone on it that is what I 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.170
 so clear witches are expensive i had 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.360
 Only recently with 250 dark alex here 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.770
 looks right now I have my old 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.130
 formation because I just that 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.320
 Duel xi wants to save 50,000 to mine 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.250
 Pigs rider at the highest level 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.040
 bring to 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.750
 there is only something missing in alexium 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.230
 7000 I should be the next days 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.510
 create 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.460
 but otherwise in the dam burghexen 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.160
 and then the remaining gaps with 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.380
 filling magic and bow would be like that right now 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.760
 my top formation I give you 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.390
 can recommend what the defense 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.730
 As for 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.870
 otherwise the complaint I do not know 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.220
 how's it going with you you're welcome 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.740
 my comments write with you 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.240
 All actively attacking tips like 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.060
 It's best to only really people 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.470
 but gets together or are active 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.780
 long I do not mind or what 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.220
 always be able to sound is only 24 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.200
 hours then I have just once a day 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.590
 then no time and does not attack 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.180
 but we are really on a permanent basis 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.920
 that simply too many do not attack 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.240
 and then it will motivate you 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.940
 the attacks have annoyed then 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.620
 accordingly and yes it should not 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.870
 How long will we have at first 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.580
 really the whole thing with us again 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.810
 a clearer active designed that 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.730
 just written more and that again 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.460
 have participated more and the like 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.750
 but it is back then again 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.610
 I would say a little bit about falling asleep 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.770
 there would be really yours 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.810
 recommend what you recommend for 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.820
 the clear get that active 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.380
 attacked it will give rewards in 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.570
 any example that if you 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.120
 permanently attacks oldest or with 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.260
 leader or whatever as easily 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.610
 some comments and hardworking 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.400
 I am curious what you are exchanging 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.480
 otherwise I have opinions 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.820
 curious what sounded out of those 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.930
 I think next video war 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.790
 I 'll just go see that 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.960
 show small war or in small war 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.310
 attacking I have vacation now 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.110
 that means I have the time too 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.660
 again nice to do more videos that 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.070
 I'll provide you with that regularly 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.300
 can 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.580
 Accordingly, I'm curious what you 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.080
 so far with getting so you have to share 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.540
 as I said active players continue 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.130
 Welcome to the sound and I am 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.930
 curious and hope that the next 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.820
 small war becomes much more successful 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.440
 just as it is infectious for the small war 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.550
 Video number two I hope you have it 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.210
 fallen and the tips do not have 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.890
 helped 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.210
 I thank you very much for watching 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.210
 will be fine until next time
