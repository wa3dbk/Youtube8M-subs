00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
half a alum system which is dual you can

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.900 
half a alum system which is dual you can
set<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.570> all<00:00:52.810> on<00:00:53.100> whether<00:00:54.100> you<00:00:54.190> want<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.640> have

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
one this is the wireless LAN controller

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.590 
one this is the wireless LAN controller
it<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.040> put<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.370> at<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.090> back<00:02:15.330> side

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
it is you can put it at the back side

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.860 
it is you can put it at the back side
and<00:02:15.900> then<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:18.000> know<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.300> wirelessly

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and then you know it's wirelessly

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.400 
and then you know it's wirelessly
connected<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.500> them<00:02:19.770> free<00:02:20.010> free<00:02:20.730> dog<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.410> then

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
connected to them free free dog and then

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.980 
connected to them free free dog and then
you<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.770> change<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.820> can<00:02:24.030> set<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.390> alarm<00:02:24.750> you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
know first and second along and then you

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.550 
know first and second along and then you
can<00:02:28.410> snow<00:02:28.710> see<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.310> want<00:02:29.550> i<00:02:29.790> guess<00:02:30.750> i<00:02:31.230> would
