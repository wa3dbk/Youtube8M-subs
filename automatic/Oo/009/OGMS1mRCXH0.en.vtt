00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.149
 hello welcome to the new tutorial 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.700
 crafts for everyone today we are going to 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.700
 show how to make a keychain for the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.300
 Father's day 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.300
 d 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.600
 and materials that we're going to need a 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.080
 small board to cut 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.680
 polymeric castle without furnace 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.340
 pin 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.340
 kater 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.960
 in clips 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.630
 or simple to model 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.680
 a keychain 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.680
 and the mold 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.050
 let's start let's take a 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.670
 green polymer clay 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.370
 Clay is in clay as a kind 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.370
 of bunny dpt 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.240
 We are going to place the mold on the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.600
 clay 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.850
 and we are going to cut according to the form 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.329
 mold can be downloaded from the link that looks 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.329
 the description 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.180
 we cut the figure in this case the re 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.180
 meditate 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.450
 The good thing about this clay 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.000
 polymer is that it dries in the air without 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.630
 need oven and apart is very very 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.660
 light really a kind of rubber 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.640
 very soft and very light of course 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.920
 the same thing we can do confirmed 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 although the rhythm needs baking 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.220
 once we cut with the shape of the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.930
 mold let's give it a little color 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.939
 and the shape of the shirt that we have 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.890
 chosen in this case I will try to 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.890
 make the mexico shirt 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.730
 we take some polymeric mastic from 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.830
 White color 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.959
 and we are going to knead and stretch according to 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.269
 need in this case I have to 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.239
 place a white strip on the 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:27.080
 shoulders and the sleeve and we're going 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.690
 working and we place it for me is more 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.489
 easy first of all to locate the chick 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.680
 of the shirt to know how far 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.930
 will come online all this depends on 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.470
 of the design that has the shirt 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.470
 what are we going to do 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.180
 here on the line goes from the beginning 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.190
 from the neck and down the edge of the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.690
 manga to the end of the mother 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.690
 we fit it well 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.580
 but what characterizes this clay is that 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.709
 adhere in an almost 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.870
 instant clay with clay and it 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.370
 then you can not take off, that's why 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.099
 to control to put it in one place 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.930
 adequate on the other hand is very good 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.349
 stuck to the wound as if it were a 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.349
 single block 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:40.040
 today we are accommodating and we continue making 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:40.040
 the details of the shirt the sleeves 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.930
 now we are going to place a piece of 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.820
 polymer clay in the neck of color 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.620
 red means that this is the design 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.650
 rower mexico 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.849
 and over this little red piece we're going to 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.849
 place white 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.810
 ah 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.530
 now to finish this side of the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.850
 T-shirt we put a white band 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.850
 also in the part of the base 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.280
 and it would look more or less like that and we turn it 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.600
 to do the back in the part 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.460
 in back they have the same places that 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.740
 go down on the sleeves and on the 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.260
 shoulders and we will also add the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.260
 number let's see 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:10.190
 A sleeve 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.190
 we cut the rest the remainder 

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:16.179
 we make the other hose 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.840
 and now let's do 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.300
 what would come from the beginning of a 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.750
 sleeve passing the neck by the shoulders 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.180
 and reaching the end of the other manga 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.280
 we were hitting well you have to take in 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.200
 account that once the 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.420
 clay is already very difficult to take off the 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.120
 impossible house and we are going to form the 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.760
 number with one step of a splash 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.660
 long clay of white color 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.660
 we make number one 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.650
 more or less we're hitting and 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.960
 controlling the form and making a chori 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.770
 cited a little longer we closed in 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.770
 form of zero 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.150
 and we 're going to paste it directly on the 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.150
 T-shirt 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.280
 to this one 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.460
 we would be more or less like this now 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.290
 we take a clip of these office and 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.790
 let's cut more or less by the 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:31.850
 half leaving a tail and 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:35.390
 let's put it on the neck part 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:38.210
 from there it's going to grab the keychain 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:41.210
 it is important of course that the clip 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.990
 do not come out that the tip does not 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.940
 excelled 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.400
 this we are doing now is maybe 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.800
 to give it a volume look as if 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.980
 rower had had to consider 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.580
 two layers of fabric this we let it dry 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.040
 least 24 hours more or maybe a little 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.920
 less 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.980
 once dry and opening a little the 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.380
 keychain that we are going to place the ring 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:09.280
 we put it in the clip that we put 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.280
 previously 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.209
 and the closed 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:23.819
 here I can show you how is another 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.819
 design in this case of Argentina 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.670
 I hope this tutorial has 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.480
 liked and see you in the next 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.480
 craft
