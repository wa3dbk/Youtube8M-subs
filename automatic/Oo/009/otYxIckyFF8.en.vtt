 guys today i will explain to you how 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:14.590
 they build a review card holder by 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:18.460
 card stock or various boxes 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:22.480
 let's start we begin to explain how it is 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.179
 make those of cardboards by taking a 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:30.659
 sheet sheet of paper more or less in 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:34.870
 mind you get the idea of ​​how the scholars 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:39.460
 of all sides of the box mi 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:42.550
 granted eight pieces of space side 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.949
 this the back is another little piece 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.000
 for the side or above 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.460
 do this then to close them later 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.859
 that you glue had to put tape 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.089
 label what you want with 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.800

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.370

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.800
 of a gift I only glued the below 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.450
