00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.410
 I have a standard in this 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.710
 Though we meet the government with security standard equally 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.100
 Yamakuni-cho and even a blog or something about this 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.779
 I changed it but 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:20.010
 Stability standard established by MHLW with restrictions on March 17 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.859
 As it is about 15 minutes when the water will be 300 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.009
 I guess 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.899
 Yaeyama That's about it, recently there is a standard last month 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.729
 Not made by country 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.910
 It was not made though 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.440
 Because it is a grouse, it's a watery song from Tokyo 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.870
 The bait does the measurement of the radioactivity every year 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.280
 f 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.940
 It wasn't that I had never been that standard 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.810
 I say 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.920
 It is the original World Health Organization's original criteria 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.190
 Japan's tap water is in the middle of 10 becquerels 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 It seems that I was making it in the name of the company 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.590
 The criteria are so well this time the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is water soluble articles 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.410
 I also corrected that to 300 Becquerol Colt 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.950
 I raised the standard even thinking 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.370
 I do not think I'm an investor 30 defeat 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.430
 It will be 300 because it will be conventional 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.890
 That's me I 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.850
 These were 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.659
 About the blog that I wrote on the internet 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.110
 There are only people who are adding layers 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.860
 Not reported in advance 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.840
 The accountability of the government also 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.150
 I think that there is a Nees will remain 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.190
 It is not only writing that blog but also that Tokyo 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.330
 Water department also 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.360
 I call it a picture book 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.520
 The conventional safety standard is designated as the root 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.820
 Yeah 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.850
 I have met that I'm doing 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.330
 A book on the body of poison and its 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.930
 There is that standard and it is after the spot and accident q The latter half 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.530
 Such as 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.470
 Yeah 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.259
 Even if you think about the movement of being stuck, I am in 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.110
 That funny thing or something 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.359
 After all the government 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.109
 Well I think I have a responsibility to explain 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.339
 If it is not, then it will be halfway 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:21.349
 Yeah 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.879
 I became 10 people 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.219
 Information from the company is said to be home 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.469
 It is a problem of 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.840
 And now it's on the net Mannet rescue 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.179
 The director is soon 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:39.259
 There is Koshida, so even if I go out of school, that means too much 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.489
 I do not think there is
