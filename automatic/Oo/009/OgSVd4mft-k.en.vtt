which<00:00:22.750> is<00:00:22.779> somewhat<00:00:23.320> of<00:00:23.410> a<00:00:23.500> niche<00:00:23.710> but<00:00:23.950> I<00:00:24.040> think

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
which is somewhat of a niche but I think

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.069 
which is somewhat of a niche but I think
it's<00:00:24.400> something<00:00:24.580> really<00:00:24.910> important<00:00:25.360> and<00:00:25.480> it

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
it's something really important and it

it irritates me and frustrates me is
that<00:00:49.620> quite<00:00:50.620> simply<00:00:51.130> if<00:00:51.280> you<00:00:51.370> have<00:00:51.670> two<00:00:51.940> guys

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
that quite simply if you have two guys

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.390 
that quite simply if you have two guys
and<00:00:52.570> they<00:00:53.260> both<00:00:53.500> have<00:00:53.740> the<00:00:53.860> same<00:00:53.890> amount<00:00:54.070> of

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
and they both have the same amount of

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.280 
and they both have the same amount of
muscle<00:00:54.760> mass<00:00:54.910> but<00:00:55.420> one<00:00:55.630> of<00:00:55.660> them<00:00:55.840> has<00:00:56.020> more

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
muscle mass but one of them has more

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.080 
muscle mass but one of them has more
body<00:00:56.560> fat<00:00:56.890> or<00:00:57.040> one<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.400> them<00:00:57.490> carries<00:00:57.850> more

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
body fat or one of them carries more

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.490 
body fat or one of them carries more
body<00:00:58.300> fat<00:00:58.390> on<00:00:58.660> that<00:00:58.780> particular<00:00:59.079> body<00:00:59.380> part

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
body fat on that particular body part

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500 
body fat on that particular body part
that<00:00:59.950> person<00:01:00.790> is<00:01:00.850> obviously<00:01:00.970> going<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.390> have<00:01:01.480> a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
that person is obviously going to have a

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.970 
that person is obviously going to have a
bigger<00:01:01.780> measurement<00:01:02.260> that<00:01:02.380> body<00:01:02.620> part<00:01:02.829> is

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
bigger measurement that body part is

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.469 
bigger measurement that body part is
going<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.130> be<00:01:03.250> bigger<00:01:03.460> than<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.150> other<00:01:04.269> guys

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
going to be bigger than the other guys

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.390 
going to be bigger than the other guys
because<00:01:05.049> he<00:01:05.290> has<00:01:05.379> more<00:01:05.560> body<00:01:05.740> fat<00:01:05.890> so<00:01:06.250> for

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
because he has more body fat so for

go with more fat it's gonna have bigger
arms<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:21.220> what<00:01:21.640> does<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:21.850> mean<00:01:22.150> you<00:01:22.240> know

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
arms but what does that mean you know

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.760 
arms but what does that mean you know
that's<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.570> that's<00:01:22.840> irrelevant<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.500> doesn't

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
that's that that's irrelevant it doesn't

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.350 
that's that that's irrelevant it doesn't
you<00:01:23.950> know<00:01:24.010> it<00:01:24.100> doesn't<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.970> shouldn't<00:01:25.270> be

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
you know it doesn't that shouldn't be

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.390 
you know it doesn't that shouldn't be
something<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:26.470> talk<00:01:26.890> about<00:01:27.040> because

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
something to to talk about because

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.620 
something to to talk about because
obviously<00:01:27.549> it's<00:01:27.790> not<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:27.940> good<00:01:28.150> thing<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.570> know

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
obviously it's not a good thing you know

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.110 
obviously it's not a good thing you know
I<00:01:28.870> mean<00:01:29.440> if<00:01:29.799> I<00:01:29.950> use<00:01:30.100> myself<00:01:30.280> as<00:01:30.520> an<00:01:30.640> example

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
I mean if I use myself as an example

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.870 
I mean if I use myself as an example
I<00:01:31.440> don't<00:01:32.440> ever<00:01:32.740> measure<00:01:33.100> my<00:01:33.250> arms<00:01:33.580> because<00:01:33.820> I

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
I don't ever measure my arms because I

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.060 
I don't ever measure my arms because I
think<00:01:33.940> it's<00:01:34.210> meaningless<00:01:34.570> but<00:01:35.020> having<00:01:35.860> a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
think it's meaningless but having a

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.280 
think it's meaningless but having a
knowing<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:36.549> was<00:01:36.670> gonna<00:01:36.760> do<00:01:36.909> this<00:01:36.970> video<00:01:37.150> I<00:01:37.510> make

lost<00:03:32.550> a<00:03:32.670> bit<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.910> muscle<00:03:33.060> mass<00:03:33.300> in<00:03:33.540> this

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
lost a bit of muscle mass in this

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.270 
lost a bit of muscle mass in this
process<00:03:34.140> but<00:03:34.290> assuming<00:03:34.650> he's<00:03:34.800> still<00:03:34.830> lifting

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280

weights his arms actually might look

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.290 
weights his arms actually might look
bigger<00:03:37.560> okay<00:03:37.920> if<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.190> lose<00:03:38.430> body<00:03:38.730> fat<00:03:38.820> and

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
bigger okay if you lose body fat and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.910 
bigger okay if you lose body fat and
your<00:03:39.660> muscles<00:03:40.080> are<00:03:40.140> more<00:03:40.320> visible<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.830> you

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
your muscles are more visible and you

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.200 
your muscles are more visible and you
become<00:03:41.220> more<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.520> know<00:03:41.640> more<00:03:41.790> ripped<00:03:42.000> and

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
become more you know more ripped and

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.090 
become more you know more ripped and
more<00:03:42.300> vascular<00:03:42.750> sometimes<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.740> gives<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
more vascular sometimes that gives the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.890 
more vascular sometimes that gives the
illusion<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.700> being<00:03:44.880> bigger<00:03:45.270> okay<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:45.720> you

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
illusion of being bigger okay so you

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.140 
illusion of being bigger okay so you
might<00:03:46.020> have<00:03:46.170> two<00:03:46.350> guys<00:03:46.590> one<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.340> them<00:03:47.550> actually

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
might have two guys one of them actually

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.110 
might have two guys one of them actually
has<00:03:48.570> more<00:03:48.780> muscle<00:03:49.020> mass<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:50.040> because<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
has more muscle mass but because the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.330 
has more muscle mass but because the
other<00:03:51.300> guy<00:03:51.510> his<00:03:51.870> must<00:03:52.110> was<00:03:52.290> more<00:03:52.500> visible<00:03:52.920> he

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
other guy his must was more visible he

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.460 
other guy his must was more visible he
actually<00:03:53.700> looks<00:03:53.910> bigger<00:03:54.210> okay<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:54.810> that's

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
actually looks bigger okay so that's

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.410 
actually looks bigger okay so that's
another<00:03:55.770> reason<00:03:55.980> why<00:03:56.280> these<00:03:56.820> measurements

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
another reason why these measurements

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.410 
another reason why these measurements
are<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:58.050> completely<00:03:58.470> irrelevant<00:03:59.060> so<00:04:00.060> to

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
are just completely irrelevant so to

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.390 
are just completely irrelevant so to
summarise<00:04:00.840> um<00:04:01.140> this<00:04:01.770> is<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:01.920> little<00:04:02.190> bit<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.340> a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
summarise um this is a little bit of a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.250 
summarise um this is a little bit of a
rant<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.760> be<00:04:02.880> fair<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.270> understand<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.050> it

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
rant to be fair I understand that but it

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.650 
rant to be fair I understand that but it
does<00:04:04.440> annoy<00:04:04.680> me<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:04.920> mean<00:04:05.240> particularly<00:04:06.240> reason

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
does annoy me I mean particularly reason
