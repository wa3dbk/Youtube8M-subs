lot more time into the game and we

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.010 
lot more time into the game and we
decided<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:05.030> he's<00:01:06.030> got<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.540> takes<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.570 
decided that he's got what it takes to
be<00:01:07.049> back<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> top<00:01:07.680> again<00:01:07.950> he's<00:01:08.189> got<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
be back at the top again he's got the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.500 
be back at the top again he's got the

and I think he just needed that talk to
him<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.430> give<00:01:14.549> him<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.850> more<00:01:15.000> motivation

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
things remember explaining things to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.719 
things remember explaining things to
little<00:01:34.200> mistakes<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> he's

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
little mistakes here and there and he's

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.399 
little mistakes here and there and he's
also<00:01:35.909> helping<00:01:36.299> us<00:01:36.390> spending<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.930> lot<00:01:37.140> of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
also helping us spending a lot of

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.100 
also helping us spending a lot of
improvements<00:01:38.009> at<00:01:38.070> our<00:01:38.250> game<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.549> well<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.110> think

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
improvements at our game as well I think

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.080 
improvements at our game as well I think
we<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.380> learn<00:01:40.500> from<00:01:40.560> each<00:01:40.740> other<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.909> think

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
we can learn from each other and I think

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
we can learn from each other and I think
that<00:01:42.540> McGee<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.200> only<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.590> improving

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that McGee is only going to improving

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.789 
that McGee is only going to improving
and<00:01:44.490> proven<00:01:44.729> improve<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.930> incredible<00:01:46.470> rate<00:01:46.680> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and proven improve and incredible rate I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.889 
and proven improve and incredible rate I
don't<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.280> he's<00:01:47.880> anywhere<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.659> art

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
don't think he's anywhere and your art

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.800 
don't think he's anywhere and your art
is<00:01:49.049> peaking<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.070> minute<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.430> i<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.360> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
is peaking the minute and i think that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.149 
is peaking the minute and i think that
when<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> be

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
when we get to that it's going to be

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.149 
when we get to that it's going to be
beautiful<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:55.799> now<00:01:55.920> getting

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
beautiful and that's right now getting

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.550 
beautiful and that's right now getting
you<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.490> speak<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.439> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
you to speak and see what we can do so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.899 
you to speak and see what we can do so
your<00:01:58.710> damage<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.549> team<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> think

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
your damage we can do this team I think

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.100 
your damage we can do this team I think
we've<00:02:00.210> got<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.509> good<00:02:00.719> team<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:01.049> now

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
we've got a really good team right now

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.209 
we've got a really good team right now
and<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:03.149> potential<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.930> massive<00:02:04.500> we're<00:02:05.009> doing

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
and the potential is massive we're doing

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.119 
and the potential is massive we're doing
good<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:05.790> now<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.920> more

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
good right now and I think that the more

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.279 
good right now and I think that the more
that<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.459> understand<00:02:09.060> certain<00:02:09.509> situations<00:02:10.170> as

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
that we understand certain situations as

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.699 
that we understand certain situations as
a<00:02:10.349> team<00:02:10.530> because<00:02:10.670> from<00:02:11.670> Timlin<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.450> then<00:02:13.379> fuse

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
a team because from Timlin and then fuse

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.479 
a team because from Timlin and then fuse
and<00:02:13.980> millennium<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.720> was<00:02:15.950> probably<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.190> mean

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
and millennium I was probably that mean

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.190 
and millennium I was probably that mean
like<00:02:17.760> leader<00:02:18.030> guy<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.450> I've<00:02:18.510> still<00:02:18.810> got<00:02:19.050> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
worst in good forward I think that

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.449 
worst in good forward I think that
obviously<00:03:03.890> like<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.920> said<00:03:05.099> we<00:03:05.159> have<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> lot<00:03:05.430> to

go<00:04:57.190> well<00:04:57.400> look<00:04:58.330> at<00:04:58.449> ER<00:04:58.690> epsilon<00:04:59.409> and<00:05:00.270> phase

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
go well look at ER epsilon and phase

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.080 
go well look at ER epsilon and phase
France<00:05:01.570> or<00:05:01.810> grip<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.400> both<00:05:03.400> groups<00:05:03.669> are<00:05:03.789> a<00:05:03.820> hard

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
France or grip so both groups are a hard

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.140 
France or grip so both groups are a hard
I'd<00:05:04.330> say<00:05:04.510> ours<00:05:04.840> is<00:05:04.990> probably<00:05:05.400> well<00:05:06.400> it's

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
I'd say ours is probably well it's

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.300 
I'd say ours is probably well it's
probably<00:05:07.389> the<00:05:07.510> easier<00:05:07.780> one<00:05:07.960> I'd<00:05:08.169> say<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.770> and

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
probably the easier one I'd say that and

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.710 
probably the easier one I'd say that and
they're<00:05:09.669> not<00:05:09.699> obviously<00:05:10.240> been<00:05:10.449> in<00:05:10.570> denial

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
they're not obviously been in denial

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.140 
they're not obviously been in denial

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
come off who gets on our gripper

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.040 
come off who gets on our gripper

haven't had the chance to bat wolf
against<00:05:28.240> each<00:05:28.419> other<00:05:28.599> so<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:29.320> really<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.620> hard

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
against each other so it really is hard

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.339
