00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.380 
it's a matte kind of finish on it it's a
little<00:00:52.770> different<00:00:52.980> than<00:00:53.219> my<00:00:53.370> normal<00:00:53.430> white<00:00:54.059> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
little different than my normal white I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.549 
little different than my normal white I
usually<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> white<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.289> because<00:00:55.469> I

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
usually get the white just because I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.450 
usually get the white just because I
think<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.800> looks<00:00:55.949> really<00:00:56.010> good<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
think it looks really good with the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.849 
think it looks really good with the
white<00:00:56.670> iphone<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.660> let's<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.320> crack<00:00:58.590> into

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
that I've been using up until I got this

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.750 
that I've been using up until I got this
