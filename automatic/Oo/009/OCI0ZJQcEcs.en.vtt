 - where do you live? - CastellÃ³n, Spain. 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.520
 The scenery is beautiful, the seasons are like spring, 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.600
 Sometimes the temperature in December is 20 degrees Celsius. 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.400
 - I want to move there to live! - great! 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.280

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.720

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.440
 Last year, I went to Indian Wells with Chiracus. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.280
 Also accompanied by Ferrer and Giraldo. 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.720
 How is the technology of Ferrer riding? 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.640
 general. 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.520
 I heard that you are a fan of David Ferrer? 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.320
 I really admire him. 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.640
 You may be able to beat him this year? 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.320
 I may be in a better condition this year. 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.880
 - so cool! - And more confident. Wait and see! 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.360
 David, your enemy is coming! 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.240
 We took a friend by the way, he is DJ, called Adrian. 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.200
 His mission is to record the original music of The Road to Roland Garros. 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.480
 Every player has to show a paragraph. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200
 Hello, my name is Adrian. 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.400
 I tried to make some unique sounds in this car. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.840
 Then he uses these small elements to form a piece of music. Really incredible! 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.280
 If I add special effects to this sound, 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.240
 - how about it? - Great! 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.120
 - Cool? - It's cool! 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 Ready?
