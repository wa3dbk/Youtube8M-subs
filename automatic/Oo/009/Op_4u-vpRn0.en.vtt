common goal to learn the music that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
common goal to learn the music that
involves<00:01:26.340> playing<00:01:26.580> sequential<00:01:27.270> patterns<00:01:27.630> and

during<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.539> rehearsal<00:01:39.689> process<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
during the rehearsal process the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.850 
during the rehearsal process the
approach<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.549> rehear<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.710> we're

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
approach is to rehear all that we're

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.249 
approach is to rehear all that we're
working<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.340> basically<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.570> dissect<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
working on basically we dissect the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.889 
working on basically we dissect the
music<00:01:46.590> into<00:01:46.829> segments<00:01:47.360> attention<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> focused

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
music into segments attention is focused

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.889 
music into segments attention is focused
into<00:01:49.200> rhythmic<00:01:49.649> intonation<00:01:50.689> balance<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
into rhythmic intonation balance and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.340 
into rhythmic intonation balance and
note<00:01:52.530> accuracy<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.340> all<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.789> performers<00:01:54.360> this

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
note accuracy of all the performers this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.319 
note accuracy of all the performers this
process<00:01:55.950> works<00:01:56.310> well<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.640> both<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> left

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
process works well for both the left

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.960 
process works well for both the left
