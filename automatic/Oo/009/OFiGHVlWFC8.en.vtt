primers<00:02:30.840> afternoon<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:33.060> would<00:02:33.480> say<00:02:33.720> that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
primers afternoon and I would say that

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.770 
primers afternoon and I would say that
that<00:02:34.020> sets<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.770> stage<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.100> perhaps<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:36.150> little

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
that sets the stage for perhaps a little

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.809 
that sets the stage for perhaps a little
more<00:02:36.900> contact<00:02:37.650> down<00:02:38.040> through<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.430> area<00:02:38.580> now

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.680 
again keep in mind there's a portion
down<00:02:41.040> there<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.400> could<00:02:41.610> be<00:02:41.730> used<00:02:42.000> as<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.420> pet

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
