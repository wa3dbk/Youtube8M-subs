see the letters very well but it's in
Russian<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:39.729> like<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:40.880> see<00:01:41.060> through<00:01:41.270> the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
Russian and like you see through the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.950 
Russian and like you see through the
viewfinder

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.090 

it's<00:01:47.960> pretty<00:01:48.140> much<00:01:48.290> just<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.650> piece<00:01:48.800> of<00:01:48.979> glass

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's pretty much just a piece of glass

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.749 
it's pretty much just a piece of glass
that<00:01:49.580> goes<00:01:49.729> up<00:01:49.970> through<00:01:50.210> here<00:01:51.759> it<00:01:52.759> can<00:01:52.970> switch

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
that goes up through here it can switch

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.810 
that goes up through here it can switch
where<00:01:55.759> is<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:58.070> frame<00:01:58.369> rate<00:01:58.610> and

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
where is it this is the frame rate and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.060 
where is it this is the frame rate and
has<00:01:59.750> 8<00:02:00.259> 12<00:02:00.830> 24<00:02:01.820> 48<00:02:01.930> 32<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.110> 16<00:02:03.530> frames<00:02:03.800> per

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
has 8 12 24 48 32 and 16 frames per

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.419 
has 8 12 24 48 32 and 16 frames per
second<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:07.899> think<00:02:08.899> this<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.320> controls<00:02:10.160> for<00:02:10.369> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
second I think this is controls for the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.000 
second I think this is controls for the
light<00:02:10.610> meter<00:02:10.880> or<00:02:11.420> something<00:02:11.810> but<00:02:12.650> like<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:12.950> said

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
light meter or something but like I said

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.420 
I have no clue the logo is right there

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
camera it says somewhere right here 2 by

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.120 
camera it says somewhere right here 2 by
8<00:02:32.239> millimeters<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.110> it's<00:02:33.320> 8<00:02:33.530> millimeter<00:02:33.890> film

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
8 millimeters so it's 8 millimeter film
