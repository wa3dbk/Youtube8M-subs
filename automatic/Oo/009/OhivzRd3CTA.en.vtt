00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
see here with this bright pink I didn't
find<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.490> Mac<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.090> showed<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> match<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.899> one

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
find a Mac I showed it to match this one

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.859 
find a Mac I showed it to match this one
but<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> did<00:02:04.860> find<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.729> closest<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.450> from

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
but I did find the closest one from

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.729 
but I did find the closest one from
urban<00:02:07.200> decay<00:02:07.229> which<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.420> Woodstock<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.530> so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
urban decay which is Woodstock and so

hot pink so let's go and compare it with
Woodstock<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.900> Woodstock<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:18.040> slightly<00:02:19.030> more

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
Woodstock and Woodstock is slightly more

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.530 
Woodstock and Woodstock is slightly more

touch<00:04:11.320> more<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.830> blue<00:04:12.070> shift<00:04:12.490> and<00:04:12.850> it's<00:04:13.330> a

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
touch more of the blue shift and it's a

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.630 
touch more of the blue shift and it's a
hint<00:04:13.810> lighter<00:04:14.110> but<00:04:14.740> these<00:04:14.920> are<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.160> two<00:04:15.340> that

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
hint lighter but these are the two that

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.159 
hint lighter but these are the two that
I<00:04:15.700> found<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.209> be<00:04:16.330> the<00:04:16.510> closest<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.320> each<00:04:17.350> other

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
I found to be the closest to each other

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.510 
I found to be the closest to each other
if<00:04:20.169> you're<00:04:20.350> looking<00:04:20.620> for<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.830> pretty<00:04:21.190> kind<00:04:21.430> of

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
eggplant purple color this is mix

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.570 
eggplant purple color this is mix
eggplant

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
eggplant

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.149 
eggplant
and<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:25.240> did<00:04:25.479> not<00:04:25.629> find<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.259> Mac<00:04:26.440> dupe<00:04:26.680> for<00:04:26.919> it<00:04:27.009> but

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
and I did not find a Mac dupe for it but

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.800 
and I did not find a Mac dupe for it but
I<00:04:27.190> did<00:04:27.400> find<00:04:27.669> an<00:04:27.759> urban<00:04:28.060> decay<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.629> was<00:04:28.780> a

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
I did find an urban decay that was a

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.719 
I did find an urban decay that was a
dupe<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.949> only<00:04:30.069> difference<00:04:30.250> between

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
dupe and the only difference between

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.809 
dupe and the only difference between
these<00:04:30.909> two<00:04:31.270> are<00:04:31.780> basically<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:33.039> finish<00:04:33.520> and

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
these two are basically the finish and

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.779 
these two are basically the finish and
so<00:04:34.599> they<00:04:35.139> are<00:04:35.349> very<00:04:35.830> similar<00:04:36.099> in<00:04:36.250> color<00:04:36.520> so<00:04:36.729> I

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
so they are very similar in color so I

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.460 
so they are very similar in color so I
would<00:04:36.909> call<00:04:37.060> them<00:04:37.180> dupes<00:04:37.419> in<00:04:37.599> that<00:04:37.750> way<00:04:37.900> but

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
would call them dupes in that way but

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.559 
would call them dupes in that way but
with<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.860> finish<00:04:39.220> of<00:04:39.430> urban<00:04:39.789> decay<00:04:39.909> you<00:04:40.389> know

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
with the finish of urban decay you know

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.570 
with the finish of urban decay you know
they<00:04:40.690> have<00:04:40.840> very<00:04:41.169> metallic<00:04:41.560> eyeshadows<00:04:42.280> so

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
they have very metallic eyeshadows so

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.909 
they have very metallic eyeshadows so
while<00:04:42.879> the<00:04:43.000> color<00:04:43.210> may<00:04:43.419> be<00:04:43.479> right<00:04:43.840> on<00:04:43.919> the

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
while the color may be right on the

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.589 
while the color may be right on the
finish<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.639> eyeshadow<00:04:46.000> may<00:04:46.270> make<00:04:46.509> it

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
finish of the eyeshadow may make it

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.439 
finish of the eyeshadow may make it
appear<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.870> little<00:04:47.020> bit<00:04:47.169> different<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:49.330> can

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
appear a little bit different so you can

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.320 
appear a little bit different so you can
see<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:49.720> color<00:04:49.960> super<00:04:50.710> similar<00:04:51.009> there<00:04:51.370> and

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
see the color super similar there and

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.210 
see the color super similar there and
you<00:04:52.539> can<00:04:52.659> see<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.379> Urban<00:04:53.770> Decay<00:04:53.860> just

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
you can see that the Urban Decay just

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.909 
you can see that the Urban Decay just
puts<00:04:54.430> off<00:04:54.580> more<00:04:54.879> of<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.300> kind<00:04:55.569> of<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:56.530> know<00:04:56.620> I

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
puts off more of a kind of you know I

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.619 
puts off more of a kind of you know I
don't<00:04:57.400> know<00:04:57.460> metallic<00:04:57.969> sort<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.330> flash

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
metallic sort of finish to it but both

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.619

is<00:05:04.930> mix<00:05:05.379> frosted<00:05:06.069> lilac<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:06.759> this<00:05:07.389> looks<00:05:07.719> like

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
is mix frosted lilac and this looks like

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.020 
is mix frosted lilac and this looks like
it<00:05:08.680> would<00:05:08.770> be<00:05:08.889> a<00:05:08.919> really<00:05:09.159> pretty<00:05:09.400> lavender<00:05:09.789> but

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
it would be a really pretty lavender but

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.180 
it would be a really pretty lavender but
actually<00:05:10.479> it's<00:05:10.990> more<00:05:11.259> of<00:05:11.349> a<00:05:11.469> white<00:05:11.740> kind<00:05:12.069> of

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
actually it's more of a white kind of

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.180 
actually it's more of a white kind of
frost<00:05:12.550> with<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.090> hint<00:05:13.509> of<00:05:13.719> lavender<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:14.650> so

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
frost with a hint of lavender to it so

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.680 
frost with a hint of lavender to it so

if you're after more of a true lavender
that<00:05:17.110> gives<00:05:17.319> off<00:05:17.530> more<00:05:17.860> of<00:05:17.889> that<00:05:18.190> kind<00:05:18.430> of<00:05:18.460> you

want to keep looking this might not be
for<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.169> because<00:05:23.770> it<00:05:23.979> does<00:05:24.099> give<00:05:24.310> off<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.639> lot

of<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:25.210> white<00:05:25.419> cast<00:05:26.009> but<00:05:27.009> the<00:05:27.099> closest<00:05:27.639> item

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.309

I<00:05:27.969> could<00:05:28.030> find<00:05:28.300> in<00:05:28.419> my<00:05:28.449> collections<00:05:28.900> dupe<00:05:29.139> this

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
I could find in my collections dupe this

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.800 
I could find in my collections dupe this
was<00:05:29.650> urban<00:05:30.099> decay<00:05:30.430> asphyxia<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.330> it's<00:05:31.569> still

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
was urban decay asphyxia and it's still

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.499 
was urban decay asphyxia and it's still
not<00:05:31.990> a<00:05:32.050> dupe<00:05:32.289> so<00:05:32.979> this<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:34.270> know<00:05:34.389> while

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
not a dupe so this you know while

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:35.969 
not a dupe so this you know while
they're<00:05:34.690> similar<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.500> they're<00:05:35.740> both<00:05:35.919> very

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
they're similar and they're both very

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.450 
they're similar and they're both very
light<00:05:37.319> asphyxia<00:05:38.319> still<00:05:38.680> gives<00:05:38.949> better<00:05:39.130> color

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
light asphyxia still gives better color

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.399 
light asphyxia still gives better color
payoff<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:40.389> get<00:05:40.599> a<00:05:40.630> little<00:05:40.960> more<00:05:41.199> of<00:05:41.380> that

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
payoff and you get a little more of that

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.529 
payoff and you get a little more of that
lavender<00:05:41.860> tone<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.430> it<00:05:42.580> so<00:05:43.210> we'll<00:05:43.330> just

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
lavender tone to it so we'll just

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.830 
lavender tone to it so we'll just
compare<00:05:43.930> both<00:05:44.319> of<00:05:44.349> them<00:05:44.620> side-by-side<00:05:45.099> there

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
compare both of them side-by-side there

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.059 
compare both of them side-by-side there
so<00:05:46.840> you<00:05:46.930> can<00:05:47.050> see<00:05:47.229> this<00:05:47.409> one<00:05:47.620> is<00:05:47.770> definitely

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
so you can see this one is definitely

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.189 
so you can see this one is definitely
more<00:05:48.419> lavender<00:05:49.419> even<00:05:49.630> though<00:05:50.020> they're<00:05:50.169> both

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
more lavender even though they're both

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.070 
more lavender even though they're both
you<00:05:50.710> know<00:05:50.830> quite<00:05:51.279> fair<00:05:51.550> I<00:05:51.900> hope<00:05:52.900> you<00:05:52.990> guys

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
you know quite fair I hope you guys
