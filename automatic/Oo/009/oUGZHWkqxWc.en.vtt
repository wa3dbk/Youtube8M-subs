00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
lipstick I think it's really really

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
lipstick I think it's really really
pretty<00:00:53.740> honestly<00:00:54.630> and<00:00:55.630> I've<00:00:55.780> worn<00:00:56.050> it<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.260> lot

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
pretty honestly and I've worn it a lot

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.310 
pretty honestly and I've worn it a lot
even<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.240> summer<00:00:58.480> which<00:00:58.840> I<00:00:58.960> guess<00:00:59.140> was

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
even in the summer which I guess was

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.020 
even in the summer which I guess was
kind<00:00:59.590> of<00:00:59.680> weird<00:00:59.920> now<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.460> look<00:01:00.610> back<00:01:00.670> on<00:01:01.000> it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
kind of weird now that I look back on it

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.840 
kind of weird now that I look back on it
but<00:01:01.710> yeah<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.980> think<00:01:03.100> it's<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.430> really<00:01:03.700> nice

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
but yeah I think it's a really nice

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.430 
but yeah I think it's a really nice
color<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:04.480> kind<00:01:04.809> of<00:01:04.839> feel<00:01:05.020> like<00:01:05.050> this<00:01:05.230> has<00:01:05.410> a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
color I kind of feel like this has a

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.280 
color I kind of feel like this has a
cool<00:01:05.740> undertone<00:01:06.690> because<00:01:07.690> it<00:01:07.840> makes<00:01:08.020> my<00:01:08.229> teeth

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
cool undertone because it makes my teeth

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.690 
cool undertone because it makes my teeth
look<00:01:08.650> white<00:01:09.630> my<00:01:10.630> teeth<00:01:10.840> are<00:01:11.020> white<00:01:11.320> but<00:01:11.710> pretty

so<00:02:07.659> when<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.840> have<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.140> camera<00:02:08.319> zoomed<00:02:08.770> out<00:02:08.950> it

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
so when I have the camera zoomed out it

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.820 
so when I have the camera zoomed out it
seems<00:02:09.819> that<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.599> lipstick<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.200> really<00:02:11.620> really

seems that the lipstick is really really

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.040 
seems that the lipstick is really really
like<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.310> bright<00:02:12.700> red<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:13.540> not<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.020> that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
like a bright red and it's not like that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.670 
like a bright red and it's not like that
so<00:02:14.770> I'm<00:02:14.860> gonna<00:02:14.980> zoom<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.349> more

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
so I'm gonna zoom in and this is more

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.380
