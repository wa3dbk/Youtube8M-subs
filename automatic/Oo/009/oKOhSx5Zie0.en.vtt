gross the advantage of using a close-up

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.760 
gross the advantage of using a close-up

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
filter of an extension tube is you get

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.499 
filter of an extension tube is you get
your<00:01:25.890> full<00:01:26.130> auto<00:01:26.310> focus<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.790> aperture

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
your full auto focus and aperture

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.319 
your full auto focus and aperture
settings<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:28.680> shooting<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.400> 200<00:01:29.759> ASA's<00:01:30.090> give

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
settings I'm shooting at 200 ASA's give

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.330 
settings I'm shooting at 200 ASA's give
me<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> reading<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.840> F<00:01:30.990> 32<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.890> I'm<00:01:32.009> using<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
me a reading of F 32 so I'm using the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
me a reading of F 32 so I'm using the
smallest<00:01:32.610> aperture<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.479> give<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> greatest

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
smallest aperture to give the greatest

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.690 
smallest aperture to give the greatest
depth<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.380> field<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.799> exposure<00:01:35.490> time

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
depth of field the exposure time

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.819 
depth of field the exposure time
therefore<00:01:36.180> becomes<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:36.990> slower<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.470> it's

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
therefore becomes a lot slower and it's

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.620 
therefore becomes a lot slower and it's
given<00:01:38.070> me<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.310> sixth<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.700> second<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.030 
given me one sixth of a second for that
reason<00:01:39.930> I'm<00:01:40.020> shooting<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.590> protection

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
reason I'm shooting with the protection

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.710 
reason I'm shooting with the protection
remote<00:01:41.280> control<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:41.880> wired<00:01:42.060> remote<00:01:42.270> control

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.399 

in<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.580> first<00:01:49.790> exposure<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.270> use<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.570> 18<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.020> 55

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
in the first exposure I use the 18 to 55

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.850 
in the first exposure I use the 18 to 55
set<00:01:51.770> at<00:01:51.920> 55<00:01:52.490> for<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.790> longest<00:01:53.060> focal<00:01:53.540> length

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
set at 55 for the longest focal length

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.950 
set at 55 for the longest focal length

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
using a maximum aperture of 32 I've also

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.020 
using a maximum aperture of 32 I've also
put<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.409> plus<00:01:57.740> 10<00:01:58.009> plus<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.280> filter<00:01:58.700> on<00:01:58.820> I've

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
put the plus 10 plus a filter on I've

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.850 
put the plus 10 plus a filter on I've
now<00:01:59.570> moved<00:01:59.720> over<00:01:59.869> to<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.170> hundred<00:02:00.409> more<00:02:00.530> macro

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
now moved over to the hundred more macro

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.039 
now moved over to the hundred more macro

difference in exposure and of course

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.850 
difference in exposure and of course
having<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.869> longer<00:02:06.140> focal<00:02:06.289> length<00:02:06.530> I've<00:02:06.649> got<00:02:06.770> to

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
having a longer focal length I've got to

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.490 
having a longer focal length I've got to
move<00:02:06.979> quite<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.369> bit<00:02:07.549> further<00:02:07.700> away<00:02:08.500> I'm

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
move quite a bit further away I'm

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.840 
move quite a bit further away I'm
looking<00:02:09.800> inside<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.220> cube<00:02:10.399> I've<00:02:10.610> got<00:02:10.759> an

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
looking inside the cube I've got an

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.090 
looking inside the cube I've got an
incredibly<00:02:11.360> soft<00:02:11.660> light<00:02:11.870> I've<00:02:12.620> created<00:02:12.830> that

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
incredibly soft light I've created that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.130 
incredibly soft light I've created that
by<00:02:13.310> adding<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.090> links<00:02:14.480> or<00:02:14.630> lights<00:02:14.840> on<00:02:14.989> either

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
by adding the links or lights on either

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.809 
by adding the links or lights on either
side<00:02:15.440> using<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.950> silver<00:02:16.160> umbrella<00:02:16.519> so<00:02:16.730> I'm

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
side using the silver umbrella so I'm

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.640 
side using the silver umbrella so I'm
diffusing<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.420> light<00:02:17.480> before<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.349> hits<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
diffusing the light before it hits the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.380 
diffusing the light before it hits the
tent<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.099> of<00:02:19.190> course<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.519> outer<00:02:19.819> surface<00:02:20.300> of

tent and of course the outer surface of

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.440 
tent and of course the outer surface of
the<00:02:20.510> cube<00:02:20.720> diffuses<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.590> light<00:02:21.680> even<00:02:21.920> further

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the cube diffuses the light even further
