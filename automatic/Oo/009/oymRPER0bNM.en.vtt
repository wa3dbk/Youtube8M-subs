tool your more intermediate advanced
type<00:00:50.250> tool<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> tech<00:00:52.469> machines<00:00:52.770> from

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
type tool so the tech machines from

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.250 
type tool so the tech machines from
vertical<00:00:53.219> ice<00:00:53.489> reason<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.840> vertical<00:00:55.110> ice

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
vertical ice reason is for vertical ice

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
vertical ice reason is for vertical ice
is<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> very<00:00:55.860> down<00:00:56.070> turn<00:00:56.370> at<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> pick<00:00:56.789> angle

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
is a very down turn at the pick angle

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.670 
is a very down turn at the pick angle
but<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> also<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> lot<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.050> head<00:00:58.289> clearance

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
but it also has a lot of head clearance

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.099 
but it also has a lot of head clearance
it<00:00:59.460> still<00:00:59.640> uses<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.969> three<00:01:00.239> millimeter<00:01:00.480> pick<00:01:00.960> so

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
it still uses a three millimeter pick so

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.139 
it still uses a three millimeter pick so
this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.379> more<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> an<00:01:01.890> advanced<00:01:02.309> intermediate

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
this is more of an advanced intermediate

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.060 
this is more of an advanced intermediate
to<00:01:03.600> advanced<00:01:03.930> when<00:01:04.199> you're<00:01:04.320> climbing<00:01:04.500> water

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
to advanced when you're climbing water

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
ice four plus water ice five then you'll

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.580 
ice four plus water ice five then you'll
be<00:01:08.040> using<00:01:08.189> something<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.880> tech<00:01:09.060> machine

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590

that<00:01:43.500> goes<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.009> four<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> half

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that goes to about four and a half

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
that goes to about four and a half
millimeters<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.390> well<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> be

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
millimeters as well this is going to be

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
millimeters as well this is going to be
more<00:01:47.159> your<00:01:47.369> mid<00:01:47.610> tier<00:01:47.909> tool<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.750> reason

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
more your mid tier tool and the reason

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.069 
more your mid tier tool and the reason
being<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.890> from<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:51.720> difference

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
being as you can see from the difference

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.690 
being as you can see from the difference
in<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> pick<00:01:52.500> angle

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
in the pick angle

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.930 
in the pick angle
the<00:01:54.030> picking<00:01:54.420> goal<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:56.070> tech<00:01:56.370> machine<00:01:56.700> is

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
the picking goal on the tech machine is

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.540 
the picking goal on the tech machine is
much<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.420> downturn<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.800> can<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.310> as

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
much more downturn you can see that as

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.070 
much more downturn you can see that as
compared<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.150> something<00:02:00.570> that's<00:02:00.750> gonna<00:02:00.930> be

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
compared to something that's gonna be

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.710 
compared to something that's gonna be
more<00:02:01.350> moderate<00:02:01.920> ice<00:02:02.159> more<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.300> water<00:02:03.540> ice

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
more moderate ice more like water ice

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.950 
more moderate ice more like water ice
three<00:02:03.990> water<00:02:04.409> ice<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.890> something<00:02:05.550> like<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
three water ice for something like that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.910 
three water ice for something like that
it's<00:02:06.960> compared<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> something<00:02:07.560> that's<00:02:07.800> gonna

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it's compared to something that's gonna

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.370 
it's compared to something that's gonna
be<00:02:08.069> water<00:02:08.280> ice<00:02:08.369> four<00:02:08.759> plus<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.990> more<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.259> your

to<00:02:13.980> water<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.250> scree<00:02:14.520> you're<00:02:14.670> gonna<00:02:14.760> want

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
to water a scree you're gonna want

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.370 
to water a scree you're gonna want
something<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.420> doesn't<00:02:15.600> quite<00:02:15.900> have<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
something that doesn't quite have the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.620 
something that doesn't quite have the
pic<00:02:16.620> angle<00:02:16.980> yeah<00:02:17.610> what<00:02:17.820> happens<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.300> on<00:02:18.450> it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
pic angle yeah what happens is on it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.990 
pic angle yeah what happens is on it
when<00:02:18.840> you're<00:02:18.930> swinging<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.380> nice<00:02:19.560> tool<00:02:20.000> you're

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
when you're swinging a nice tool you're

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.580 
when you're swinging a nice tool you're
swinging<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.540> tool<00:02:21.840> if<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.170> too<00:02:22.470> much

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
swinging the tool if you have too much

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.770 
swinging the tool if you have too much
of<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.830> pic<00:02:23.040> angle<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.670> angle<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.630> ice

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
of a pic angle or the angle of the ice

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.729 
of a pic angle or the angle of the ice
is<00:02:25.110> lower

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
is lower

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.500 
is lower
you're<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.610> you're<00:02:26.790> gonna<00:02:26.910> bounce<00:02:27.180> out

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you're just you're gonna bounce out

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
you're just you're gonna bounce out
you're<00:02:27.989> gonna<00:02:28.080> have<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.440> pull<00:02:28.709> down<00:02:28.890> when<00:02:29.190> you

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
you're gonna have to pull down when you

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.860 
you're gonna have to pull down when you
swing<00:02:29.520> your<00:02:29.610> tool<00:02:29.850> that's<00:02:30.270> why<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.540> made<00:02:30.660> for

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
swing your tool that's why it's made for

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.050 
swing your tool that's why it's made for
vertical<00:02:31.290> pull<00:02:31.530> Chi<00:02:31.769> is<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:32.910> when<00:02:33.000> you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
vertical pull Chi is and then when you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060 
vertical pull Chi is and then when you
have<00:02:33.180> something<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.570> this<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.380> has<00:02:34.440> that's

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
have something like this that has that's

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.060 
have something like this that has that's
less<00:02:35.489> vertical<00:02:36.590> you're<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.680> gonna<00:02:37.830> have<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
less vertical you're not gonna have the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.140 
less vertical you're not gonna have the
same<00:02:38.220> issues<00:02:38.519> when<00:02:38.670> you're<00:02:38.790> swinging<00:02:38.940> into

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
same issues when you're swinging into

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.699 
same issues when you're swinging into
low<00:02:39.300> range<00:02:39.330> light<00:02:39.780> because<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.380> not<00:02:40.530> as

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
low range light because it's not as

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.710 
low range light because it's not as
downturn<00:02:41.190> when<00:02:41.820> Gravelle<00:02:42.120> first<00:02:42.360> came<00:02:42.510> about

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
downturn when Gravelle first came about

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.500 
downturn when Gravelle first came about
they<00:02:42.959> invented<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.070> first<00:02:44.280> vertical<00:02:44.880> real

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
they invented the first vertical real

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.290 
they invented the first vertical real
eye<00:02:45.840> facts<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.800> market<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.970> called<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
eye facts on the market it's called the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.030 
eye facts on the market it's called the
machine<00:02:48.600> they<00:02:48.959> completely<00:02:49.470> changed<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.890> way

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
machine they completely changed the way

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.340 
machine they completely changed the way
that<00:02:50.310> vertical<00:02:50.670> ice<00:02:50.820> works<00:02:51.209> they<00:02:52.170> were<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
that vertical ice works they were the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.140 
that vertical ice works they were the
first<00:02:52.530> ones<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.800> actually<00:02:52.890> came<00:02:53.250> up<00:02:53.280> with<00:02:53.459> a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
first ones that actually came up with a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.850 
first ones that actually came up with a
way<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.600> reach<00:02:54.840> up<00:02:55.019> grip<00:02:55.290> up<00:02:55.380> find<00:02:55.560> your<00:02:55.590> tool

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
way to reach up grip up find your tool

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.039 
way to reach up grip up find your tool
so<00:02:56.430> they<00:02:56.550> just<00:02:56.790> expanded<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.690> with<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
so they just expanded on that with the

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.380 
so they just expanded on that with the
new<00:02:58.200> machine<00:02:58.650> line

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.450
