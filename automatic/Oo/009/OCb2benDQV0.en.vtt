00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.960 
blew up right over here and it came
through<00:01:57.270> either<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.710> USB<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.430> ethernet

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
through either the USB or the ethernet

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.670 
through either the USB or the ethernet
probably<00:02:00.600> Ethernet<00:02:01.080> because<00:02:01.440> it's<00:02:01.560> no

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
probably Ethernet because it's no

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.020 
probably Ethernet because it's no
tourists<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.190> either<00:02:02.310> coming<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.850> through

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
tourists for either coming in through

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.540 
tourists for either coming in through
the<00:02:03.060> cable<00:02:03.330> line<00:02:03.630> or<00:02:03.840> grounding<00:02:04.410> out<00:02:04.620> through

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
the cable line or grounding out through

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.000 
the cable line or grounding out through
the<00:02:05.640> cable<00:02:05.820> modem<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.930> that's<00:02:07.230> probably<00:02:07.620> what

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
the cable modem so that's probably what

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.590 
the cable modem so that's probably what
happened<00:02:08.130> there<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.730> then<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.390> looks<00:02:09.480> like

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
happened there and then it looks like

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.150 
happened there and then it looks like
you<00:02:09.780> grounded<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.260> to<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> computer<00:02:10.920> case

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
you grounded out to the computer case

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.880 
you grounded out to the computer case
somehow<00:02:11.940> through<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.630> audio<00:02:13.050> connection

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
somehow through the audio connection

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.380 
somehow through the audio connection
right<00:02:14.100> there<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.640> there<00:02:15.030> happens<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.300> be

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
right there because there happens to be

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.470 
right there because there happens to be
a<00:02:15.480> burn<00:02:15.720> spot<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.410> case<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> same<00:02:17.130> spot

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
a burn spot on the case in the same spot

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.370 
a burn spot on the case in the same spot
so<00:02:18.480> that's<00:02:18.660> what<00:02:18.780> we're<00:02:18.900> looking<00:02:19.110> at<00:02:19.200> down

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
so that's what we're looking at down

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.580 
so that's what we're looking at down
