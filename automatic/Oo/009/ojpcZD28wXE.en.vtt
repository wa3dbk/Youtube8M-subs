for<00:02:32.269> OTG<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:33.310> straight<00:02:34.310> away<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:35.110> am<00:02:36.110> putting<00:02:36.709> in

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
for OTG a straight away I am putting in

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.729 
for OTG a straight away I am putting in
this<00:02:37.190> OTG<00:02:37.730> cable<00:02:40.090> popped<00:02:41.090> in<00:02:41.299> and<00:02:41.510> let's<00:02:42.500> see

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
this OTG cable popped in and let's see

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.520 
this OTG cable popped in and let's see
whether<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.190> detects<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.360> saying<00:02:44.989> that

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
whether it detects it is saying that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.140 
whether it detects it is saying that
very<00:02:45.739> chain<00:02:46.130> won't<00:02:46.370> change<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.819> default

very chain won't change the default

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.910 
very chain won't change the default
write<00:02:47.299> this<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.810> means<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.260> has<00:02:48.440> detected

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
write this so that means it has detected

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.240 
write this so that means it has detected
the<00:02:48.950> OTG<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.610> as<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.269> can<00:02:50.390> see<00:02:50.829> next-gen<00:02:51.829> USB

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
the OTG and as you can see next-gen USB

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.280 
the OTG and as you can see next-gen USB
storage<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.880> showing<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:54.170> is

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
storage it is showing and it is

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.410
