00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 so now I presented you a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.400
 little trick for mounting that plunges 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.860
 so in fact usually have same clip 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.780
 one is with the body bed or with 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.969
 a whole sheath miners like like 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.940
 this one and after you put it in 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.820
 your line body on the jerseys 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.070
 swivel get into the long clip here 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.460
 and then after that you have the editing 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.170
 who is here we winter after the end of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.670
 your installation did what I wanted 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 to show you it's a small system 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.020
 fast for to just change 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.730
 bottom of line 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.440
 quickly without being forced to each 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.260
 time to cut again to redo a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 year for people for example who 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.560
 do their reassembly in this style 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.450
 so that is the editing more 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.410
 the swivel so that stays on the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.960
 problem is that when you have to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.730
 change assembly whenever it is necessary 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.379
 cut a knot here loses close 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.080
 d'oran bret me what I show you 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.110
 and it's with a staple which 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.410
 madoff system which we begin to yield 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:10.140
 some staples up that I take from this 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:12.540
 size here so the technique is 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.430
 you take your london clip - 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.130
 personally I take techniques 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 fishing because they are quite flexible 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.970
 if you take for example fox you 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.080
 crush them when I crush him for you 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.300
 show he'll break 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.310
 I have already tested so you take it yourself 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.410
 crush it completely have up 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.860
 until the portion of the clip whose long 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.580
 until then we totally crashed here 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.520
 so that will make you an oval shape 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.259
 here and instead of doing the DVD of 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.410
 make a knot on the walls on the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.709
 marion rowling does 1-1 directly on 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.929
 the graph here and carla graff will come 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:51.780
 go back so that's going to make this system there 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.240
 so to take it out but it's also hard 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.200
 that if you had your your would like 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.300
 inside here for auto ferrain 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.440
 at very good and if I really you 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.929
 want to change the bottom of the line 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.940
 you just have to shoot and if you have 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.940
 learned your leader that you 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.209
 just put on your on your 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.209
 staple 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.489
 your leader and your bellini 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.849
 is up to go to go 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.909
 to fish 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:25.560
 that's it, we're done 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.129
 have your leader who and who is 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.969
 ready to who is caught fishing in a 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.969
 other correctly 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.680
 here it is directly and it makes you like 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.640
 it's a fast system to change 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.460
 spare and mounting very quickly 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.050
 this is for the little tip for the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.180
 graph and the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.180
 editing with we would like
