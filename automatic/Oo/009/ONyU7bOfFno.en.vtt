 small bowl of cider 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.140

 of a pastry chef but the origin of the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.680
 recipe remains a mystery of traces 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.380
 written we do not have one knows it's 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.390

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.610
 drunkard and scordia who was holding shop 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.780
 place of the cross at douarnenez cent 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.940
