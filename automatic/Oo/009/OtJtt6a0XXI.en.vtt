questions about the lamp camper wiring
system<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.809> today<00:00:16.170> we'd<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.770> talk<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
system and today we'd like to talk to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.830 
system and today we'd like to talk to
you<00:00:17.160> specifically<00:00:17.699> about<00:00:17.850> why<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.630> use<00:00:18.810> a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
you specifically about why we use a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.679 
you specifically about why we use a
special<00:00:19.170> plug<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:20.369> mate<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.939> camper<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.510> your

special plug to mate your camper to your
truck<00:00:22.100> most<00:00:23.100> automobiles<00:00:23.699> today<00:00:23.910> come<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
truck most automobiles today come with a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.490 
truck most automobiles today come with a
bargeman<00:00:25.050> plug<00:00:25.500> which<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> 7-way<00:00:26.760> plug<00:00:27.500> one

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
bargeman plug which is a 7-way plug one

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.980 
bargeman plug which is a 7-way plug one
thing<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.099> plug<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.869> only

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
thing about this plug is that it only

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590 
thing about this plug is that it only
comes<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.500> 10<00:00:31.740> gauge<00:00:32.009> wire<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
comes with a 10 gauge wire on on the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.680 
comes with a 10 gauge wire on on the
system<00:00:33.989> itself<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.149> system

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
system itself and with that system

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
system itself and with that system
basically<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> 10<00:00:37.590> gauge<00:00:37.829> wire<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.430> it's

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
basically in the 10 gauge wire as it's

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.540 
basically in the 10 gauge wire as it's
clearly<00:00:39.300> stated<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.440> their<00:00:40.620> wiring<00:00:41.100> harness

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
clearly stated in their wiring harness

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.660 
clearly stated in their wiring harness
is<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:42.989> carry<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.010> load<00:00:44.280> of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
is that it will carry the the load of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.970 
is that it will carry the the load of
the<00:00:45.270> amperage<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.079> voltage<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the amperage and the voltage from the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.970 
the amperage and the voltage from the
truck<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.840> basically<00:00:48.840> charge<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.500> batteries

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
truck to basically charge your batteries

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.260 
truck to basically charge your batteries
and<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.170> 12-volt<00:00:53.270> refrigerator

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and have a 12-volt refrigerator

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
and have a 12-volt refrigerator
basically<00:00:54.870> function<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.710> therefore<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.340> we

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
basically function so therefore what we

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.590 
basically function so therefore what we
do<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> custom<00:00:58.289> molded<00:00:59.390> plug<00:01:00.390> that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
do is we have a custom molded plug that

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.080 
do is we have a custom molded plug that
is<00:01:00.719> made<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> win<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.070> custom<00:01:02.520> mold<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> plug

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
is made and win this custom mold to plug

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.980 
is made and win this custom mold to plug
it<00:01:03.480> allows<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.170> an<00:01:04.409> 8<00:01:04.979> gauge<00:01:05.280> wire<00:01:05.670> most<00:01:06.510> RVs

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
it allows for an 8 gauge wire most RVs

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.929 
it allows for an 8 gauge wire most RVs
are<00:01:07.260> wired<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.710> eight<00:01:08.040> gauge<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
are wired with eight gauge but if you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.120 
are wired with eight gauge but if you
put<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> 10<00:01:09.450> gauge<00:01:09.689> wire<00:01:10.020> coming<00:01:10.830> from<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
put a 10 gauge wire coming from the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.219 
put a 10 gauge wire coming from the
truck<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.820> alternator<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.780> charge<00:01:13.049> your

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
truck or the alternator to charge your

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.649 
truck or the alternator to charge your
system<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:14.070> run<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.460> 12-volt<00:01:14.880> refrigerator

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
system or run your 12-volt refrigerator

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.170 
system or run your 12-volt refrigerator
it's<00:01:16.200> insufficient<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> carry<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> load<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
it's insufficient to carry the load and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's insufficient to carry the load and
still<00:01:18.659> run<00:01:19.350> everything<00:01:19.799> properly<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
still run everything properly so

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.359 
still run everything properly so
therefore<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> custom<00:01:22.680> molded<00:01:23.070> plug

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
therefore we have a custom molded plug

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
therefore we have a custom molded plug
that<00:01:23.790> obviously<00:01:24.360> costs<00:01:24.720> more<00:01:24.869> money<00:01:25.140> than<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that obviously costs more money than the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.039 
that obviously costs more money than the
standard<00:01:26.100> bargeman<00:01:26.610> plug<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.420> allow<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.900> all

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
standard bargeman plug to allow for all

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.859 
standard bargeman plug to allow for all
your<00:01:28.460> appliances<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.729> charge<00:01:30.270> system<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
your appliances and charge system to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.420 
your appliances and charge system to
actually<00:01:31.229> function<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.909> also<00:01:33.090> allows<00:01:33.540> for

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
actually function so it also allows for

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.850 
actually function so it also allows for
you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.579> safety<00:01:36.210> along<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> way<00:01:37.439> does<00:01:37.680> your

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
you know safety along the way does your

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
you know safety along the way does your
wires<00:01:38.040> won't<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.520> heating<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
wires won't be heating up because if you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.340 
wires won't be heating up because if you
put<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> 10<00:01:40.350> gauge<00:01:40.619> rock<00:01:40.890> wire<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.729> between

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
put the 10 gauge rock wire in between

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.539 
put the 10 gauge rock wire in between
what's<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.560> happen<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.220> add<00:01:44.310> wire

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
what's going to happen there is add wire

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
what's going to happen there is add wire
can<00:01:44.820> potentially<00:01:45.420> heat<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.079> could

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
can potentially heat up and you could

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.100 
can potentially heat up and you could
potentially<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.040> safety<00:01:47.850> item<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.509> so

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
potentially have a safety item there so

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.770 
potentially have a safety item there so
this<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.560> why<00:01:49.890> Lance<00:01:50.610> ensures<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.270> safety
