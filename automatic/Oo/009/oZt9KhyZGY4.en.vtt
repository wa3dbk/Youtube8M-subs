00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
hydraulic hoses to the tractor to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:43.030 
hydraulic hoses to the tractor to
install<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.450> loader

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.850 

you'll<00:00:43.460> put<00:00:43.640> your<00:00:43.760> parking<00:00:44.150> brake<00:00:44.330> on<00:00:44.770> put<00:00:45.770> the

you'll put your parking brake on put the
tractor<00:00:46.250> in<00:00:46.370> neutral

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
tractor in neutral

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.979 
tractor in neutral
you'll<00:00:48.749> kill<00:00:48.929> the<00:00:49.079> tractor<00:00:50.659> will<00:00:51.659> relieve<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you'll kill the tractor will relieve the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.689 
you'll kill the tractor will relieve the
hydraulic<00:00:52.440> pressure<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.100> connect<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
hydraulic pressure so we can connect the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
hydraulic pressure so we can connect the
hoses<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.690> finish<00:00:54.960> installing<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.530> loader<00:00:55.739> we

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
hoses to finish installing the loader we

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.919 
hoses to finish installing the loader we
will<00:00:56.129> connect<00:00:56.550> our<00:00:56.820> hydraulic<00:00:57.359> hoses<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
will connect our hydraulic hoses to the

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.840 
will connect our hydraulic hoses to the
connections<00:00:58.379> by<00:00:58.799> the<00:00:58.859> color-coded<00:00:59.549> miss<00:00:59.699> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
connections by the color-coded miss of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:25.039 
connections by the color-coded miss of
the<00:00:59.909> hoses<00:01:23.119> now<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.179> will<00:01:24.420> start<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> tractor

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the hoses now we will start the tractor

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.380 
the hoses now we will start the tractor
and<00:01:25.649> use<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> hydraulics<00:01:26.459> to<00:01:26.670> lower<00:01:27.179> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and use the hydraulics to lower the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:42.580 
and use the hydraulics to lower the
loader<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:28.229> our<00:01:28.289> loader<00:01:28.500> frames

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.530 

now<00:01:42.829> that's<00:01:43.040> securely<00:01:43.460> on<00:01:43.729> our<00:01:43.970> loader<00:01:44.149> frames

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
now that's securely on our loader frames

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.170 
now that's securely on our loader frames
we<00:01:45.380> will<00:01:45.530> pull<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.770> locking<00:01:46.220> mechanism<00:01:46.820> back

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
we will pull the locking mechanism back

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.810 
we will pull the locking mechanism back
down

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.630 

and<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:54.970> is<00:01:55.060> how<00:01:55.210> we<00:01:55.270> install<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:57.010> H<00:01:57.100> 120

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
and that is how we install the H 120

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.560 
and that is how we install the H 120
loader<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.120> twin<00:01:58.420> 25<00:01:58.870> our<00:01:59.110> tractor
