00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
re this was a prototype when we first

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.400 
re this was a prototype when we first
started<00:00:56.630> this<00:00:56.690> team<00:00:56.840> they<00:00:57.020> were<00:00:57.080> gonna<00:00:57.200> help

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
started this team they were gonna help

started this team they were gonna help
us<00:00:57.530> out<00:00:57.650> and<00:00:59.050> so<00:01:00.050> they<00:01:00.170> give<00:01:00.320> us<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.530> prototype

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
us out and so they give us the prototype

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.730 
us out and so they give us the prototype
and<00:01:01.250> we<00:01:01.340> we<00:01:01.730> did<00:01:01.940> dyno<00:01:02.420> testing<00:01:02.990> with<00:01:03.140> the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
and we we did dyno testing with the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.880 
and we we did dyno testing with the
velocity<00:01:04.309> stacks<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.439> we<00:01:06.439> found<00:01:06.619> out<00:01:06.860> that

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
velocity stacks and we found out that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.679 
velocity stacks and we found out that
you<00:01:07.220> know<00:01:07.340> all<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.759> riders<00:01:07.939> like<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.390> longer

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
you know all the riders like the longer

you<00:01:31.870> know<00:01:31.990> he's<00:01:32.860> went<00:01:33.460> pretty<00:01:33.700> stiff<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.210> we

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
you know he's went pretty stiff and we

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.820 
you know he's went pretty stiff and we
come<00:01:34.540> into<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.900> first<00:01:35.110> round<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.560> figured

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
come into the first round and figured

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.190 
come into the first round and figured
out<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.010> we<00:01:36.580> were<00:01:36.700> way<00:01:36.880> too<00:01:36.910> stiff<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.690> we

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
out that we were way too stiff and we

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.830 
out that we were way too stiff and we
had<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.470> backtrack<00:01:38.710> on<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.400> so<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:40.480> they<00:01:40.630> all

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
had to backtrack on it so and they all

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.200 
had to backtrack on it so and they all
really<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.920> know<00:01:42.040> really<00:01:42.430> love<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.790> aleene's

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
feel first time we went and tested with

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.090 
feel first time we went and tested with
less<00:01:45.490> he<00:01:45.790> was<00:01:45.910> like<00:01:46.500> he<00:01:47.500> felt<00:01:47.740> real<00:01:47.890> good<00:01:48.040> about

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
less he was like he felt real good about

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.760 
less he was like he felt real good about
it<00:01:48.430> because<00:01:48.610> they<00:01:49.000> said<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:49.360> were<00:01:49.770> starting

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
it because they said we were starting

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.910 
it because they said we were starting
off<00:01:50.890> where<00:01:51.160> he<00:01:51.190> ended<00:01:51.430> up<00:01:51.550> out<00:01:51.790> last<00:01:51.970> year<00:01:52.300> so

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
off where he ended up out last year so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.340 
off where he ended up out last year so
no<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:54.400> think<00:01:55.240> it's<00:01:55.600> really<00:01:55.750> good<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.020> really

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
no I think it's really good I really

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.760 
no I think it's really good I really
liked<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.740> it's<00:01:57.460> got<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.850> water<00:01:58.380> loads<00:01:59.380> on<00:01:59.680> the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
liked it it's got the water loads on the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.410 
liked it it's got the water loads on the
bottom<00:02:00.100> which<00:02:00.400> they<00:02:00.610> really<00:02:01.000> like<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.210> a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
bottom which they really like that a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.790 
bottom which they really like that a
whole<00:02:01.570> lot<00:02:01.720> better<00:02:01.870> every<00:02:02.200> stock<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:02.590> gives<00:02:02.740> a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
whole lot better every stock it gives a

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.640 
whole lot better every stock it gives a
better<00:02:02.950> feel<00:02:03.370> for<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.670> front<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:05.050> shock<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.620> a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
better feel for the front the shock is a

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.450 
better feel for the front the shock is a
the<00:02:06.640> tthe<00:02:07.210> shock<00:02:07.510> it's<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:09.040> know<00:02:09.160> it's<00:02:09.310> got

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
the tthe shock it's you know it's got

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.330 
the tthe shock it's you know it's got
the<00:02:09.490> high<00:02:09.730> speed<00:02:10.230> and<00:02:11.230> low<00:02:11.410> speed<00:02:11.440> compression

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
the high speed and low speed compression

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.710 
the high speed and low speed compression
and<00:02:12.460> then<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.700> rebound<00:02:13.030> damping<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.570> then

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and then the rebound damping and then

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.000 
and then the rebound damping and then
you<00:02:14.020> know<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.290> year<00:02:14.500> they've<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.830> changed
