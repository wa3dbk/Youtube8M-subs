00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.430 
little thing on the field to make it to
make<00:04:09.150> sure<00:04:09.180> we<00:04:09.479> came<00:04:09.659> away<00:04:09.810> with<00:04:09.989> three<00:04:10.169> points

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
make sure we came away with three points

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.789 
make sure we came away with three points
was<00:04:11.099> our<00:04:11.190> mindset<00:04:11.669> then<00:04:12.269> I<00:04:13.760> said<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:15.810> know

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
was our mindset then I said to you know

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.930 
was our mindset then I said to you know
our<00:04:16.979> midfield<00:04:17.430> tonight<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:19.609> we<00:04:20.609> needed<00:04:20.820> to

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
our midfield tonight that we needed to

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.960 
our midfield tonight that we needed to
impose<00:04:21.510> our<00:04:21.900> game<00:04:22.260> on<00:04:22.470> them<00:04:22.680> we<00:04:23.039> needed<00:04:23.370> two<00:04:23.610> in

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
impose our game on them we needed two in

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.409 
impose our game on them we needed two in
particular<00:04:24.949> make<00:04:25.949> it<00:04:26.130> very<00:04:26.310> hard<00:04:26.669> for<00:04:26.820> for

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
particular make it very hard for for

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.620 
particular make it very hard for for
pavel<00:04:27.840> Pardo<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.440> think<00:04:28.740> he's<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.340> key<00:04:30.060> player<00:04:30.090> on

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
pavel Pardo I think he's a key player on

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.180 
pavel Pardo I think he's a key player on
their<00:04:30.810> team<00:04:31.760> a<00:04:32.760> guy<00:04:33.720> in<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.020> midfield<00:04:34.229> who<00:04:34.800> who

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
their team a guy in the midfield who who

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.129 
their team a guy in the midfield who who
gets<00:04:35.430> other<00:04:35.639> people<00:04:36.030> involved<00:04:36.360> an

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
gets other people involved an

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.129 
gets other people involved an
experienced<00:04:37.830> player<00:04:38.039> and<00:04:38.510> our<00:04:39.510> idea<00:04:39.870> was<00:04:39.930> that

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
experienced player and our idea was that

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.850 
experienced player and our idea was that
we<00:04:40.320> really<00:04:40.800> needed<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.159> as<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:42.599> team<00:04:42.990> understand

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
we really needed to as a team understand

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.890 
we really needed to as a team understand
that<00:04:43.979> if<00:04:44.190> he's<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:44.639> important<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.210> them<00:04:45.360> we

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
that if he's so important to them we

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.310 
that if he's so important to them we
needed<00:04:46.260> to<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:47.430> push<00:04:48.000> hard<00:04:48.270> be<00:04:48.659> aggressive<00:04:48.900> and

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
needed to to push hard be aggressive and

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.670 
needed to to push hard be aggressive and
make<00:04:49.530> it<00:04:49.710> hard<00:04:49.949> for<00:04:50.009> him<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:50.669> that<00:04:50.820> we<00:04:51.150> would

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
make it hard for him so that we would

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.409 
make it hard for him so that we would
have<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:52.889> edge<00:04:53.099> I<00:04:53.370> mean<00:04:53.729> as<00:04:53.849> i<00:04:53.970> just<00:04:54.030> said<00:04:54.270> to

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
have that edge I mean as i just said to

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.439 
have that edge I mean as i just said to
jeff<00:04:54.780> i<00:04:54.960> think<00:04:55.229> that<00:04:55.470> that<00:04:55.759> that<00:04:56.759> was<00:04:57.000> our

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
jeff i think that that that was our

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.570 
jeff i think that that that was our
midfield<00:04:58.080> play<00:04:58.349> tonight<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.919> work<00:04:59.130> as<00:04:59.370> the

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
midfield play tonight the work as the

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.370 
midfield play tonight the work as the
group

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
group

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.880 
group
was<00:05:01.370> was<00:05:01.850> really<00:05:02.270> important<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:03.800> know

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
was was really important and you know

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.150 
was was really important and you know
that<00:05:04.040> sets<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.640> tone<00:05:04.850> in<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.270> game<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:06.160> you

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
that sets the tone in the game and you

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.620 
that sets the tone in the game and you
know<00:05:07.280> tonight<00:05:07.550> is<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:07.880> night<00:05:08.210> where<00:05:10.540> you<00:05:11.540> know

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
know tonight is a night where you know

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.540 
know tonight is a night where you know
as<00:05:11.810> coaches<00:05:12.320> afterwards<00:05:12.890> maybe<00:05:13.130> we'll<00:05:13.400> go

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
as coaches afterwards maybe we'll go

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.120 
as coaches afterwards maybe we'll go
around<00:05:13.670> and<00:05:14.260> with<00:05:15.260> each<00:05:15.410> guy<00:05:15.620> and<00:05:15.650> talk<00:05:15.980> about

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
around and with each guy and talk about

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.010 
around and with each guy and talk about
how<00:05:16.370> they<00:05:16.550> played<00:05:16.910> I<00:05:17.180> don't<00:05:17.570> think<00:05:17.630> it<00:05:17.870> was

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
how they played I don't think it was

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.500 
how they played I don't think it was
necessarily<00:05:18.650> a<00:05:18.890> night<00:05:19.220> where<00:05:19.460> we<00:05:20.270> got<00:05:20.480> our

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
necessarily a night where we got our

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.020 
necessarily a night where we got our
best<00:05:20.990> performances<00:05:21.830> from<00:05:22.040> each<00:05:22.250> guy<00:05:22.490> all

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
best performances from each guy all

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.060 
best performances from each guy all
right<00:05:23.210> but<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:23.660> think<00:05:23.780> collectively<00:05:24.320> there<00:05:24.860> was

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
right but I think collectively there was

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.640 
right but I think collectively there was
a<00:05:25.100> an<00:05:25.690> understanding<00:05:26.690> of<00:05:26.780> what<00:05:26.840> kind<00:05:27.260> of<00:05:27.410> game

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
a an understanding of what kind of game

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.130 
a an understanding of what kind of game
which<00:05:28.220> had<00:05:28.400> something<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.270> do<00:05:29.450> with<00:05:29.630> Mexico

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
which had something to do with Mexico

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.750 
which had something to do with Mexico
and<00:05:30.380> something<00:05:30.740> to<00:05:30.830> do<00:05:30.980> with<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.190> conditions

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
and something to do with the conditions

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.930 
and something to do with the conditions
okay<00:05:32.540> you<00:05:33.170> know<00:05:33.290> and<00:05:33.470> it's<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.980> when<00:05:34.670> I<00:05:34.700> say

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
okay you know and it's the when I say

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.090 
okay you know and it's the when I say
conditions<00:05:35.480> it's<00:05:35.810> only<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.230> wind<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.890> rest

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
conditions it's only the wind the rest

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.740 
conditions it's only the wind the rest
of<00:05:37.280> it<00:05:37.370> tonight<00:05:37.520> was<00:05:37.790> great<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.210> field<00:05:38.450> was<00:05:38.600> in

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
of it tonight was great the field was in

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.830 
of it tonight was great the field was in
excellent<00:05:39.170> shape<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:40.280> know<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.840> temperature

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
excellent shape you know the temperature

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.040 
excellent shape you know the temperature
for<00:05:42.260> players<00:05:42.500> is<00:05:42.830> great<00:05:43.100> but<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.730> wind<00:05:43.940> is

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
for players is great but the wind is

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.780 
for players is great but the wind is
something<00:05:45.050> that<00:05:45.320> you<00:05:46.220> know<00:05:46.310> you<00:05:46.370> don't<00:05:46.640> really

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
something that you know you don't really

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.600 
something that you know you don't really
know<00:05:47.330> how<00:05:47.450> to<00:05:47.510> prepare<00:05:47.960> for<00:05:47.990> it<00:05:48.350> so<00:05:48.980> you<00:05:49.520> know

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
know how to prepare for it so you know

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.850 
know how to prepare for it so you know
again<00:05:49.880> I<00:05:49.940> I<00:05:50.230> think<00:05:51.230> that<00:05:51.380> its<00:05:51.530> a<00:05:51.650> night<00:05:51.830> where

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
again I I think that its a night where

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.240 
again I I think that its a night where
we<00:05:52.130> didn't<00:05:52.460> have<00:05:52.960> men<00:05:53.960> for<00:05:54.260> men<00:05:54.440> all<00:05:54.680> our<00:05:55.010> best

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
we didn't have men for men all our best

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.300 
we didn't have men for men all our best
performances<00:05:55.970> but<00:05:56.180> I<00:05:56.240> thought<00:05:56.570> as<00:05:56.720> a<00:05:57.560> team<00:05:57.950> our

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
performances but I thought as a team our

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.550 
performances but I thought as a team our
collective<00:05:59.180> sense<00:05:59.510> as<00:05:59.720> to<00:05:59.750> how<00:06:00.020> to<00:06:00.080> deal<00:06:00.380> with

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
collective sense as to how to deal with

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.530 
collective sense as to how to deal with
things<00:06:00.740> how<00:06:01.160> to<00:06:01.220> move<00:06:01.520> how<00:06:01.940> to<00:06:02.000> put<00:06:02.270> pressure

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
things how to move how to put pressure

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.450 
things how to move how to put pressure
on<00:06:02.750> them<00:06:02.960> was<00:06:03.500> good<00:06:03.770> and<00:06:03.950> that's<00:06:04.130> what<00:06:04.370> you

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
on them was good and that's what you

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.490 
on them was good and that's what you
want<00:06:04.640> to<00:06:04.700> see<00:06:04.940> and<00:06:05.120> you<00:06:05.180> in<00:06:05.570> a<00:06:05.960> team<00:06:06.520> we<00:06:08.500> we

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
want to see and you in a team we we

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.800 
want to see and you in a team we we
played<00:06:09.770> one<00:06:10.010> game<00:06:10.250> in<00:06:10.490> the<00:06:10.580> group<00:06:10.810> we're

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810
