based<00:01:43.509> off<00:01:43.659> of<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.840> figures<00:01:44.079> from<00:01:44.170> this

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
based off of the figures from this

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.289 
based off of the figures from this
series<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:44.889> that's<00:01:45.039> pretty<00:01:45.189> cool<00:01:45.429> now<00:01:46.029> looking

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
series so that's pretty cool now looking

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.480 
series so that's pretty cool now looking
at<00:01:46.389> mr.<00:01:46.630> freeze<00:01:46.869> here<00:01:47.349> so<00:01:47.709> you<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:47.979> see<00:01:48.189> where

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
at mr. freeze here so you can see where

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.519 
at mr. freeze here so you can see where
a<00:01:48.789> piece<00:01:49.389> of<00:01:49.539> it<00:01:49.630> broke<00:01:49.840> off<00:01:50.020> piece<00:01:50.289> of<00:01:50.409> that

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:50.529 
a piece of it broke off piece of that

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:52.199 
a piece of it broke off piece of that
this<00:01:50.829> part<00:01:51.130> right<00:01:51.249> here<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.609> band<00:01:51.849> a<00:01:52.090> little

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
this part right here the band a little

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.529 
this part right here the band a little
like<00:01:53.200> almost<00:01:53.740> like<00:01:54.090> triangle<00:01:55.090> looking<00:01:55.329> thing

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
like almost like triangle looking thing

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.269 
like almost like triangle looking thing
kind<00:01:55.899> of<00:01:55.990> broke<00:01:56.139> off<00:01:56.319> these<00:01:56.590> two<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:56.799> thought<00:01:57.159> it

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:57.279 
kind of broke off these two I thought it

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:58.679 
kind of broke off these two I thought it
like<00:01:57.369> pegs<00:01:57.669> off<00:01:57.909> but<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.209> doesn't<00:01:58.509> actually

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
like pegs off but it doesn't actually

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.620 
like pegs off but it doesn't actually
ripped<00:01:59.139> off<00:01:59.349> but<00:02:00.009> I'm<00:02:00.279> gonna<00:02:00.520> glue<00:02:00.789> that<00:02:01.299> back

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
ripped off but I'm gonna glue that back

ripped off but I'm gonna glue that back
in<00:02:01.869> no<00:02:02.139> problem<00:02:02.770> it'll<00:02:03.399> probably<00:02:03.639> stay<00:02:03.969> if

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
in no problem it'll probably stay if

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.969 
in no problem it'll probably stay if
I'll<00:02:04.179> eat<00:02:04.389> and<00:02:04.509> I<00:02:04.539> won't<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.380> fall<00:02:05.590> right<00:02:05.770> off

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979
