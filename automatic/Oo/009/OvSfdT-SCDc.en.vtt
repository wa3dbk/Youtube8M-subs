like ice I still support team focus and
everything<00:03:33.319> but<00:03:33.889> that's<00:03:34.719> that's<00:03:35.719> just<00:03:35.989> a

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
everything but that's that's just a

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.179 
everything but that's that's just a
little<00:03:36.230> bit<00:03:36.349> uncalled<00:03:36.739> for<00:03:36.889> in<00:03:37.730> my<00:03:37.939> opinion<00:03:38.389> so

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
little bit uncalled for in my opinion so

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.259 
little bit uncalled for in my opinion so
basically<00:03:40.189> a<00:03:40.219> badger<00:03:40.459> went<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:40.849> started<00:03:41.150> his

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
basically a badger went and started his

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.080 
basically a badger went and started his
own<00:03:41.389> team<00:03:41.719> and<00:03:41.989> half<00:03:42.889> of<00:03:43.189> team<00:03:43.459> focus<00:03:43.879> if<00:03:43.999> you

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
own team and half of team focus if you

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.759 
own team and half of team focus if you
go<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.329> look<00:03:44.389> at<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.629> roster<00:03:44.780> now<00:03:45.169> it's<00:03:45.499> I

of a wake up call it community a little
bit<00:04:08.469> of<00:04:09.469> everything<00:04:09.859> on<00:04:10.669> YouTube<00:04:10.909> now<00:04:11.209> is

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
bit of everything on YouTube now is

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.059 
bit of everything on YouTube now is
basically<00:04:11.870> about<00:04:12.109> money<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.859> I<00:04:12.919> don't

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
basically about money and I and I don't

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.550 
basically about money and I and I don't
blame<00:04:13.219> people<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.699> know<00:04:13.790> money<00:04:14.090> is<00:04:14.469> you<00:04:15.469> know

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
blame people you know money is you know

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.140 
blame people you know money is you know
it's<00:04:15.799> a<00:04:15.859> nice<00:04:16.009> incentive<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.639> continue<00:04:16.849> making

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
it's a nice incentive to continue making

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.960 
it's a nice incentive to continue making
videos<00:04:17.570> on<00:04:17.720> YouTube<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.489> gaining<00:04:19.489> views<00:04:19.729> and

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
videos on YouTube and gaining views and

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.600 
videos on YouTube and gaining views and
everything<00:04:20.919> but<00:04:21.919> I<00:04:22.220> think<00:04:23.889> that<00:04:24.889> now<00:04:25.130> is<00:04:25.400> the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
everything but I think that now is the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.510 
everything but I think that now is the
time<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:26.380> make<00:04:27.380> a<00:04:27.409> difference<00:04:27.919> make<00:04:28.250> make<00:04:28.490> a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
time to make a difference make make a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.420 
time to make a difference make make a
