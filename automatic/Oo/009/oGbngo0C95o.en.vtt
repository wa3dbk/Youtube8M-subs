00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.280
 I'm as important and interesting to you 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.310
 chat with fans in this one 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.310
 format 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.649
 I certainly do not have a better live format 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.619
 unfortunately for the lack of others 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.899
 options, I think this one 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.120
 pretty good because it's interesting 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.540
 discover 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.100
 fan thoughts their questions i think im 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.020
 it is interesting to know firsthand what 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.420
 going on with their favorite team their 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.450
 by the players and so on so on here 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.130
 so I think it's good 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.439
 the initiative must be developed and maintained 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.439
 how do you imagine the live format 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.729
 even the same communication in the club museum here 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.950
 something is something in such a plan what 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.500
 the question today is especially interested 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.259
 for love I liked the question about 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.140
 the most beautiful goals of my career if 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.489
 the honor that there were only two here but not 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.530
 I will be modest both turned out 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:04.670
 beautiful well, as it does not know the question 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.340
 why there did not crumble 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.799
 what is the difference between interviews 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.670
 composed of questions from the fans here 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.510
 the interview you give 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.510
 professional journalist 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.350
 I do not know for sure the answer is hidden by yours 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.470
 question that is, they have professionals 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.750
 and the question is accordingly some there with 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.070
 professional subtlety with some 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.070
 here are the nuances 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.260
 well interesting there maybe there more 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.730
 parts like professionals by the most like 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.120
 and people who are for example far from 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:44.840
 football fans understand them easier 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.430
 understand their questions 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.239
 often not even related to a complete example 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.290
 photo of the general plan usual interesting i 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.810
 I think what's the difference 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.829
 if you have accounts in social networks if yes 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.860
 how active are you yes I am in 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.860
 contact 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.350
 rather, I registered there I do not know 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.750
 how many years ago 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.380
 exclusiveness to look there 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.200
 is free 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.820
 pirated movies and so on so on and on 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.680
 and download music like that so I am there 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.569
 often participated there communication whether there still 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.129
 I donâ€™t know there 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.989
 life of social networks rather no ie in this 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.030
 the plan is a man of such old school 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.370
 refers to them on the principle of not quite 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.549
 I understand why all is well no no no no not 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.180
 categorically absolutely well just like 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.609
 those people with whom I communicate and communicate there 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.349
 many other applications there I don't know 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.540
 right there in the cyber father this is considered 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:48.090
 as a social network or not, we will assume that 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.090
 yes then active social network chic
