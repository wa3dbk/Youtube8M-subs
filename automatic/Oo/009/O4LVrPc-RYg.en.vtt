00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.300 

so<00:00:01.260> here<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.560> have<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.709> cr-v<00:00:02.340> LX<00:00:02.790> model<00:00:03.480> on<00:00:03.570> 07

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.310 
so here we have a cr-v LX model on 07

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.410 
so here we have a cr-v LX model on 07
which<00:00:05.310> I'm<00:00:05.490> sure<00:00:05.640> will<00:00:05.759> probably<00:00:06.060> be<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.180> same

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
which I'm sure will probably be the same

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.190 
which I'm sure will probably be the same
for<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.720> 08<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.400> it<00:00:08.400> has<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:09.269> same<00:00:09.719> type<00:00:09.990> hand

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
for the 08 and it has the same type hand

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:37.310 
for the 08 and it has the same type hand
is<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.590> accord<00:00:35.450> we<00:00:36.450> determined<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.110> have

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
is the accord we determined that we have

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
is the accord we determined that we have
the<00:00:37.500> plug<00:00:37.940> but<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.000> believe<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:39.780> not

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the plug but I believe if I'm not

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
the plug but I believe if I'm not
mistaken<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> pins<00:00:40.890> were<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.190> wrong

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
mistaken that the pins were in the wrong

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.840 
mistaken that the pins were in the wrong
locations<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.840> remember<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.640> will<00:00:44.640> find

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
locations do you remember I will find

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.639 
locations do you remember I will find
out<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.450> moment<00:00:45.750> okay<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
out here in just a moment okay so if you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.459 
out here in just a moment okay so if you
wanted<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> take<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.250> apart<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.239> move<00:00:48.960> this

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
wanted to take it apart and move this

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
wanted to take it apart and move this
pin<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.070> pin<00:00:50.309> down<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.059> pin<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
pin and this pin down to this pin and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.630 
pin and this pin down to this pin and
this<00:00:51.750> pin<00:00:51.989> which<00:00:52.739> would<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:52.949> moving<00:00:53.250> each<00:00:53.370> wire

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this pin which would be moving each wire

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.069 
this pin which would be moving each wire
down<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.800> theoretically<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.430> could

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
down one theoretically you could

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.479 
down one theoretically you could
potentially<00:00:58.079> plug<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.500> straight<00:00:58.980> into<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
potentially plug it straight into the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.549 
potentially plug it straight into the
non<00:01:00.390> battery-powered<00:01:00.870> unit<00:01:01.789> but<00:01:03.110> we<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.320> for

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
non battery-powered unit but we know for

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.289 
non battery-powered unit but we know for
a<00:01:04.619> fact<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.250> battery<00:01:05.519> power<00:01:05.729> unit<00:01:06.060> works

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
a fact that the battery power unit works

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.240 
a fact that the battery power unit works
so<00:01:06.540> we're<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> go<00:01:07.140> ahead<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.590> go

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
so we're just going to go ahead and go

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.240 
so we're just going to go ahead and go
that<00:01:08.520> install<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.750> well<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> starts<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that install that way well it starts to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:38.180 
that install that way well it starts to
rain

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.109 

so<00:01:39.190> now<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:39.369> got<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.520> crv<00:01:39.909> with<00:01:40.090> a

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
so now you got a crv with a

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.760 
so now you got a crv with a
battery-powered<00:01:40.539> home<00:01:40.960> link<00:01:41.289> you<00:01:41.619> have

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
battery-powered home link you have

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.789 
battery-powered home link you have
powered<00:01:42.280> map<00:01:42.880> lights<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:44.500> keep<00:01:44.649> your

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
powered map lights and you keep your

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.429 
powered map lights and you keep your
conversation<00:01:45.399> mirror<00:01:45.610> yep<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:47.110> only<00:01:47.289> thing

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
conversation mirror yep the only thing

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.800 
conversation mirror yep the only thing
you<00:01:47.560> lose<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:48.100> your<00:01:48.430> ambient<00:01:49.090> light<00:01:49.270> from<00:01:49.600> the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
you lose is your ambient light from the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.389 
you lose is your ambient light from the
original<00:01:50.170> unity<00:01:50.470> took<00:01:50.649> out<00:01:50.799> correct<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.280> now

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
original unity took out correct so now

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.820 
original unity took out correct so now
we're<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:55.350> pilot<00:01:56.350> LX<00:01:57.190> pi<00:01:57.520> Lydia<00:01:58.560> 2007<00:01:59.560> which

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
we're in a pilot LX pi Lydia 2007 which

different or Bharata seas and c rvs

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.410 
different or Bharata seas and c rvs
because<00:02:35.109> we've<00:02:35.290> already<00:02:35.970> been<00:02:36.970> there<00:02:37.180> done

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
because we've already been there done

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:52.920 
because we've already been there done
that

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.080 

there<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.050> just<00:02:54.260> one<00:02:54.320> plug<00:02:54.830> one<00:02:55.460> simple<00:02:55.850> plug

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
there is just one plug one simple plug

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.310 
there is just one plug one simple plug
that<00:02:56.840> plugs<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.450> when<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.480> say<00:02:59.720> simple<00:03:00.200> I

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
that plugs in and when I say simple I

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:12.850 
that plugs in and when I say simple I
mean<00:03:00.640> simple<00:03:08.320> interesting<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:12.230> umpires<00:03:12.590> up

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
mean simple interesting this umpires up

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.010 
mean simple interesting this umpires up
it<00:03:12.980> won't<00:03:13.130> shut<00:03:13.340> off<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.790> yeah<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.570> lights<00:03:14.780> just

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
it won't shut off I yeah the lights just

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.320 
it won't shut off I yeah the lights just
come<00:03:15.260> on<00:03:15.380> immediately<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:18.880> whatever<00:03:19.880> reason

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
come on immediately and whatever reason

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.949 
come on immediately and whatever reason
you<00:03:20.570> get<00:03:21.170> power<00:03:21.380> here<00:03:25.209> I'll<00:03:26.540> into<00:03:26.810> that

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
you get power here I'll into that

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.090 
you get power here I'll into that
one<00:03:27.110> give<00:03:27.890> constant<00:03:28.520> power<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.709> we<00:03:30.740> figured

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
one give constant power so we figured

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.290 
one give constant power so we figured
something<00:03:31.310> out<00:03:31.520> and<00:03:31.580> we're<00:03:31.880> not<00:03:31.970> sure<00:03:32.209> exactly

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
something out and we're not sure exactly
