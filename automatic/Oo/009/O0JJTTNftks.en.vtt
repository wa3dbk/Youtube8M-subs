groceries greens everything is going up
and<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.719> mean<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.020> really<00:00:40.230> difficult<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.340> put

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and I mean it's really difficult to put

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.840 
and I mean it's really difficult to put
food<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.030> table

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
food on the table

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.900 
food on the table
so<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.629> surely<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.170> comes<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.710> handy

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
so really and surely this comes in handy

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.270 
so really and surely this comes in handy
it<00:00:47.910> really<00:00:48.210> comes<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.629> handy<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.469> it

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it really comes in handy because it

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.819 
it really comes in handy because it
means<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.030> some<00:00:51.360> people<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.870> won't<00:00:52.500> have

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
means that some people that won't have

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:03.280 
means that some people that won't have
anything<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.370> eat<00:00:53.579> we'll<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> nice<00:00:55.110> meal

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.340 

hunger<00:01:04.820> strikes<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> core<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
hunger strikes at the core of of a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 
hunger strikes at the core of of a
person's<00:01:07.799> dignity

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
person's dignity

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.660 
person's dignity
