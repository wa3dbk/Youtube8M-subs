 to interpret this doll by 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.420
 porcelain among others in some photos 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.950
 then you saw me with loviso kill me 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.320
 because I thought I'd make it more similar 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.650
 to the porcelain spreading a cream 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.810

 simple blue eyeshadow 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.820

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.110
 gel eyeliner of the ss then in which I have 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.760

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.300
 made in the big mirror but I have 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.990
 draw on these clays and then for a while 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.000
 faded 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.000
