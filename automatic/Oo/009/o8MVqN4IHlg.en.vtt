00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.690 
seconds ago but back to this picture I
initially<00:01:52.649> said<00:01:52.950> Santa<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.310> making<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.610> snow

initially said Santa was making it snow

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.010 
initially said Santa was making it snow
but<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.939> decided<00:01:54.270> he<00:01:54.390> wouldn't<00:01:54.600> make<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.780> snow

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
but I decided he wouldn't make it snow

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.209 
but I decided he wouldn't make it snow
he<00:01:55.380> would<00:01:55.500> make<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> reindeer<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
he would make it reindeer and the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.859 
he would make it reindeer and the
strippers<00:01:56.579> name<00:01:56.729> could<00:01:56.880> possibly<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.450> vixen

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
strippers name could possibly be vixen

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.420 
strippers name could possibly be vixen
but<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.380> more<00:01:58.469> than<00:01:58.619> likely<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.979> car<00:01:59.219> name

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
but it's more than likely a car name

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.670 
but it's more than likely a car name
like<00:01:59.610> Mercedes<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:01.020> right<00:02:01.170> guys<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.560> it
