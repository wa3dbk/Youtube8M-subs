00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.820
 little known so already before starting 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.920

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 the link of his chain in the description 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.140
 that offered me to do a little 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.539
 parceum and that I accepted so 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.000
 very well laugh so today it's going 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.540
 happen on success so success 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 monster success at the panda labs so 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.350
 you can do it many times no 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.600
 not during the six names he asks 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.760
 so here you are the moon turtles you 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.129
 create a character or so yours 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.629
 you level it up 30 really with 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.270
 the successes that now has its level 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.649
 35 it lasts not even 10 minutes you 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.960
 will you buy him a ticket from 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.460
 moon paulillas you go to the gun that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.039
 take the same step five minutes story 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
 of market then you're just going 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.030
 kill blue turtles yellow turtle 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.090
 red and green with a challenge and you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.280
 win 10 10 carapace from stems two 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.510
 circuses colors I guess if you 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.619
 play for a long time dofus you 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.420
 know anyway that the carapaces 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.810
 are one of the essential resources 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.330
 for kraft and carac oif that will be so 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.650
 we can see a 2 million more average 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.420
 so it's still not bad 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.710
 so that you can buy in age of 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.060
 life straw cocos and skins 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.009
 wolves tower that's really what has 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.950
 never in hdv you will never see a hdv 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.470
 shells by 100 so we go when 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.689
 even see if we have or not so ever 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.430
 so I think you understood the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.290
 principle you create a character you 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.049
 level up to 36 jets if you have a 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.909
 sacred like me you are simply 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.549
 makes you win or anything a 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.540
 personal beast or more to chelles pardon you 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.360
 just do some fighting and 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.280
 the 30 levels bring you to otomai tp 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.659
 whatever you want you do that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.159
 give you their resources to your 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.479
 child your main character you 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.240
 to recreate another sitting immediately 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.250
 that you have 150 that means fifteen 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.680
 characters so in my opinion two days 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.090
 half a day yet not even a 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.439
 half day I speak bat 12 hours I 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.210
 speak at half an hour or a day 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.560
 for vincendo maybe fusted five 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.700
 hours so maybe in two hours and 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.420
 half I think there is already by means of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.369
 do something 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.810
 so here it is a little trick 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.019
 known therefore still see the prices of 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.269
 shells story 2 so we did before 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.910
 of resources 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.019
 I'm sorry for for already that I do 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.200
 believe if I see that I was able to exit 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.760
 videos I have no excuse I had just 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.709
 I just did not have the morale of hell so 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.310
 I want to do it so I'll tell you 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.500
 so do 300 ayala anyway by sense 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.450
 so 350 minkama the essence is when 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.980
 even quite expensive 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.430
 242 will always be what ah no I'm 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.620
 also say 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.230
 so you see that green and red there 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.700
 is not yellow against 240000 cana 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.410
 and blue to three kinds of price range 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.299
 to him from you that you can outright 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.640
 bought both will still be 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.870
 profitable in the end so the chips not 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.250
 and that I would like as booty to see the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.040
 price but I think we can buy 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.569
 living room yeah yeah x 27 mm at it's info 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.910
 200 I think so I think it's 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.590
 enough yeah it takes two directions 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.900
 so that's enough enough so that 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.370
 bid at 50 thousand khaimah if we look 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.129
 for a fear so that will make me 50 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.319
 minkama that you'll get it for free 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:16.519
 and then we look at the pots of wolverines 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.340
 edge for all of us 445 edges like 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.730
 that's how much does it take 10.25 that you 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.709
 will 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.780
 in own and 100,000 kama more or less 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.400
 so it will do you no more 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.690
 we had discovered 50 that's a hundred 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.730
 fifty thousand khaimah for kraft is 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.060
 a because what is it will not be all of 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.819
 next it will be a happiness a good 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.010
 good web one to two hours I think 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.959
 for you kraft and 7 carat headdress so 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.819
 is really not bad at all if you 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.920
 are in the shrink I think in an hour 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.330
 an hour and a half is possible if 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.250
 you are not got optimized at all 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.480
 I think it will take at least two 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.360
 hours something like that 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.269
 So you go about those you have success so 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.140
 you will see that now I have my 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.900
 sacrifice king sakhri is mounted 117 so 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.440
 I have a stupid panels to a crazy I think 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.940
 time i'm going to check out panoplie yeah 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.190
 I am old and complete so he gave 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.480
 a pe is not bad and resists them so 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.739
 here only to the critics 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.590
 I have ares but soon I count 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.229
 change not worry p feel like 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.329
 tawake i have a million kama i have 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.280
 a few trophies that I bought gilles 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.600
 in love with turquoise and because I have you 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.030
 said I wanted to do a team so 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.190
 I have the main character 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.630
 more or less so I quote again I 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.190
 believe that I made a last of five 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.050
 characters it looks good to me 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.180
 looks okay all that so a little bit to 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.950
 to invite 40 prospects because I will do 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.110
 the dungeons kwakwa daigo responds to do 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.340
 to make me kamas so there 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.639
 I have a wild rice strap 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.200
 because she is the trunk is here 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.200
 I had a tray of water up to level 50 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.510
 and so you see for me it's okay 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.460
 it rolls so I already have the fact that 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.830
 I created with a pretty epic name you 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.050
 see it in the next video 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.580
 with I hesitate again I think I 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.440
 will do a tram end we will see again 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.020
 that's why the rest so see again 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.789
 that I'm still crowd is so 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.330
 it xp well anyway you like them 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.490
 tessa xp streams still not bad so I 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.960
 think I have nothing to say so as 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.789
 I said if you like the tips you 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.919
 can leave a like subscribe to the 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.180
 chain because they usually I do not know if 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.860
 you already know or if the first 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.000
 time you come on my channel all 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.449

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.039
 dedication to go to subscribers what so 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.740
 I click on the subscribers and I will do 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.080
 a dedication a live 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.000
 except that we were there a week ago 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.180
 exactly end six days exactly on 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.440
 was 30 subscribers there we had I thought 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.979
 we were at 40 but in fact we are at 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.780
 39 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.220
 so there will be no editing in this 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.050
 video but do not hesitate to subscribe 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.000

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.580
 if we are maybe 50 I do not know 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.990

 together we had a very good laugh 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.349
 so I would put his chain in the 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.910
 description as I already said it was 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.360
