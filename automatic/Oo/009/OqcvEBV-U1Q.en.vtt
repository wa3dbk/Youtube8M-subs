00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
are 55 55 gram weighted keys so it

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.180 
are 55 55 gram weighted keys so it
should<00:01:34.050> be<00:01:34.080> very<00:01:34.170> nice<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> went<00:01:35.160> to

should be very nice and when I went to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.149 
should be very nice and when I went to
key<00:01:35.399> con<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.320> tried<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.350> all<00:01:37.679> the<00:01:37.770> different

tried out all Hoffs collection

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.749 
tried out all Hoffs collection
essentially<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.429> one<00:01:47.580> that<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
essentially and this is the one that I

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.669 
essentially and this is the one that I
liked<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> best<00:01:48.270> although<00:01:48.810> he<00:01:49.080> had<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> 10th

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
liked the best although he had the 10th

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.460 
liked the best although he had the 10th
anniversary<00:01:50.369> edition<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:51.929> is<00:01:52.080> has

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
anniversary edition but this one is has

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.790 
anniversary edition but this one is has
the<00:01:52.590> same<00:01:52.830> weighted<00:01:53.460> keys<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.850> everything<00:01:53.940> so

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
the same weighted keys and everything so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.040 
the same weighted keys and everything so
I'm<00:01:55.800> very<00:01:55.979> excited<00:01:56.340> about<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:57.690> it's<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> 10

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
I'm very excited about it so it's a 10

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.210 
I'm very excited about it so it's a 10
