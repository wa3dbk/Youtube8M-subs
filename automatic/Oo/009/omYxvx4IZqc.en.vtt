00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
there and he tells you know the machines

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.490 
there and he tells you know the machines
that<00:00:48.840> he<00:00:49.020> wants<00:00:49.320> peace<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.320> they

send<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.890> into<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> matrix<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.030> he<00:00:54.809> has<00:00:54.930> his

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
send them into the matrix and he has his

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.580 
send them into the matrix and he has his
little<00:00:55.350> battle<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.660> Agent<00:00:57.660> Smith<00:00:58.430> and<00:01:00.590> then

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
little battle with Agent Smith and then

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.529 
little battle with Agent Smith and then
it<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.129> know<00:01:02.250> basically<00:01:02.789> comes<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> main

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it you know basically comes to the main

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.039 
it you know basically comes to the main
conclusion<00:01:05.270> where<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:06.750> show<00:01:06.900> the

conclusion where you know they show the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.920 
conclusion where you know they show the
scene<00:01:08.000> with<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.439> with<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> prophet

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
that is not how the matrix should I

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.529 
that is not how the matrix should I
ended<00:01:31.979> ok<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.610> want<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.909> how<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> matrix

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
ended ok you want to know how the matrix

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.649 
ended ok you want to know how the matrix
should<00:01:33.719> have<00:01:33.869> ended<00:01:34.079> I'll<00:01:34.679> tell<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.520> ok<00:01:36.390> first

should have ended I'll tell you ok first
off<00:01:37.159> when<00:01:38.159> neo<00:01:38.399> gets<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> machine<00:01:39.299> world

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
off when neo gets to the machine world

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.080 
off when neo gets to the machine world
he<00:01:41.130> shouldn't<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.429> been<00:01:41.549> fucking<00:01:42.000> around

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
he shouldn't have been fucking around

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.889 
he shouldn't have been fucking around
with<00:01:42.710> Agent<00:01:43.710> Smith<00:01:43.950> ok<00:01:44.460> he<00:01:45.420> should<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.689> just

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
with Agent Smith ok he should have just

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.990 
with Agent Smith ok he should have just
fucking<00:01:46.350> blew<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.069> the<00:01:47.219> fucking<00:01:47.610> machines

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
fucking blew up all the fucking machines

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.090 
fucking blew up all the fucking machines
with<00:01:48.299> his<00:01:48.420> mind<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:49.079> he<00:01:49.200> did<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> Sentinels

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
with his mind like he did the Sentinels

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.169 
with his mind like he did the Sentinels
and<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.420> would<00:01:51.569> have<00:01:51.659> destroyed<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.319> matrix

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
and it would have destroyed the matrix

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.600 
and it would have destroyed the matrix
thus<00:01:54.179> destroying<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.560> guy<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.039> they<00:01:56.159> put<00:01:56.399> in

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
thus destroying the guy that they put in

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.059 
thus destroying the guy that they put in
you<00:01:57.209> know<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.599> the<00:01:58.140> matrix<00:01:58.530> ticking<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.039> know

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
you know in the matrix ticking you know

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.460 
you know in the matrix ticking you know
create<00:01:59.579> two<00:01:59.909> could<00:02:00.149> control<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.840> matrix<00:02:01.289> or

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
create two could control the matrix or

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.289 
create two could control the matrix or
whatever<00:02:01.709> the<00:02:01.799> little<00:02:02.039> god<00:02:02.310> parity<00:02:03.030> type

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
whatever the little god parity type

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.169 
whatever the little god parity type
figure<00:02:03.929> and<00:02:04.319> it<00:02:05.099> would<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.340> destroyed<00:02:05.459> Agent

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
figure and it would have destroyed Agent

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.419 
figure and it would have destroyed Agent
Smith<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:07.470> would<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.770> destroyed<00:02:07.829> all<00:02:08.369> that

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
Smith it would have destroyed all that

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.460 
Smith it would have destroyed all that
bullshit<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:09.690> would<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.959> set<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> real

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
bullshit and I would have set the real

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.100 
bullshit and I would have set the real
people<00:02:10.769> free<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:12.540> know<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.750> could<00:02:13.079> have

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
people free you know you could have

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.210 
people free you know you could have
fucking<00:02:13.410> Reaper<00:02:14.010> restarted<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> real<00:02:15.180> world

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
fucking Reaper restarted the real world

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.390 
fucking Reaper restarted the real world
without<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.579> machines<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.310> I'm

should have blew up the fucking machines
and<00:02:36.239> just<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.530> thus<00:02:37.769> destroyed<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.430> matrix

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
and just and thus destroyed the matrix

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.660 
and just and thus destroyed the matrix
but<00:02:39.420> by<00:02:39.959> saying<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.590> he<00:02:40.769> wants<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.069> piece<00:02:41.310> to

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
but by saying that he wants a piece to

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.599 
but by saying that he wants a piece to
the<00:02:41.790> fucking<00:02:42.180> machines<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:44.190> fact<00:02:44.489> that

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
the fucking machines and the fact that

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.660 
the fucking machines and the fact that
the<00:02:45.500> prophet<00:02:46.500> or<00:02:46.590> whatever<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.160> know<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.549> old

black lady was actually a program

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.830 
black lady was actually a program
that<00:02:52.310> means<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.640> matrix<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.270> still<00:02:53.570> in

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
that means a matrix is still in

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.830 
that means a matrix is still in
existence<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.770> all<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.700> people<00:02:55.850> in<00:02:56.180> Zion<00:02:56.630> a
