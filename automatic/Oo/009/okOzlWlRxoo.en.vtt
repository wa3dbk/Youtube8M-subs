00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.520
 and it's you and what are you looking for 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.920
 there are times that one is not prepared to 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.920
 certain questions 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.920
 you're here is a good start 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.370
 I'm looking for a born 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.830
 What are you looking for 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.550
 the reason for our existence because 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.680
 We are alive 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.200
 if you really want to answer your 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.810
 questions 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.810
 We will have to make a trip 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.039
 It's very simple 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.039
 but all this in words can not be 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.170
 You will see that it is not only your imagination but 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.580
 that there are other beings external to you that 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.580
 they can guide you too 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.460
 relax, this is great 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.950
 I 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.640
 in this pile of stones that those 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.070
 who brought the stone also to 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.860
 adapt of cells are a few 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.880
 who really have lived from the rest and 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.880
 they are asleep 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.340
 and when you take for the first time since 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.340
 there is the plant inside you 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.670
 I feel much more identified with 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.219
 live the divided in the mountains that in 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.229
 the cities all enclosed in temples 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.670
 praying a god that did not even know his face 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.670
 nor your intentions with me 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.600
 before knowing about humanity you 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.600
 you have to be human
