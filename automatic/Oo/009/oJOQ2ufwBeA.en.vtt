00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.470 

that<00:00:18.110> valve<00:00:18.470> was<00:00:18.970> no<00:00:19.970> if<00:00:20.029> you<00:00:20.090> could<00:00:20.210> see<00:00:20.359> that

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
that valve was no if you could see that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.570 
that valve was no if you could see that
well<00:00:20.690> they<00:00:20.869> came<00:00:20.990> right<00:00:21.190> see<00:00:22.190> how<00:00:22.279> it's<00:00:22.430> kind

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
well they came right see how it's kind

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.830 
well they came right see how it's kind
of<00:00:22.640> in<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:22.850> middle<00:00:23.060> it<00:00:23.180> was<00:00:23.300> forced<00:00:23.630> down<00:00:23.720> to

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
of in the middle it was forced down to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.310 
of in the middle it was forced down to
the<00:00:23.990> bottom<00:00:24.320> I<00:00:24.439> opened<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.800> that<00:00:24.949> manually

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
the bottom I opened to that manually

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.390 
the bottom I opened to that manually
couldn't<00:00:27.320> hurt<00:00:27.410> her<00:00:27.470> burping<00:00:27.890> sound<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:28.340> I'm

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
couldn't hurt her burping sound so I'm

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.000 
couldn't hurt her burping sound so I'm
hoping<00:00:28.730> that's<00:00:28.910> going<00:00:29.090> to<00:00:29.529> offer<00:00:30.529> some<00:00:30.980> kind

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
hoping that's going to offer some kind

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.340 
hoping that's going to offer some kind
of<00:00:31.250> resolution<00:00:31.580> I<00:00:32.149> went<00:00:32.539> ahead<00:00:32.629> and<00:00:32.780> rerouted

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
of resolution I went ahead and rerouted

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.169 
of resolution I went ahead and rerouted
those<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:33.829> proper<00:00:34.159> way<00:00:34.339> so<00:00:34.370> that<00:00:34.789> it<00:00:34.940> should

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:35.179 
those the proper way so that it should

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:39.939 
those the proper way so that it should
force<00:00:36.050> itself<00:00:36.440> open<00:00:36.909> but<00:00:37.909> uh<00:00:38.649> should<00:00:39.649> open<00:00:39.920> a

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
force itself open but uh should open a

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.289 
force itself open but uh should open a
little<00:00:40.159> bit<00:00:40.249> more<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:40.879> go<00:00:41.649> but<00:00:43.179> this<00:00:44.179> is

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.299 
little bit more you go but this is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:45.579 
little bit more you go but this is
another<00:00:44.539> thing<00:00:44.749> I<00:00:44.870> noticed<00:00:44.899> cuz<00:00:45.289> I'm<00:00:45.409> just

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
another thing I noticed cuz I'm just

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.500 
another thing I noticed cuz I'm just
familiar<00:00:45.949> with<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.249> GT<00:00:46.670> e--'s<00:00:46.850> is<00:00:47.059> my<00:00:47.239> first

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
familiar with the GT e--'s is my first

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.199 
familiar with the GT e--'s is my first
GE<00:00:47.829> sound<00:00:48.829> look<00:00:48.949> normal<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:49.850> doesn't<00:00:50.120> look

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:50.209 
GE sound look normal it doesn't look

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:51.699 
GE sound look normal it doesn't look
like<00:00:50.239> some<00:00:50.510> kind<00:00:50.839> of<00:00:51.170> should<00:00:51.319> be<00:00:51.440> coming

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:51.709 
like some kind of should be coming

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
off of there anyway so I'm gonna go

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.889 
off of there anyway so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.399> start<00:00:55.579> this<00:00:55.699> bitch<00:00:55.909> up<00:00:56.209> see<00:00:56.749> what

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
ahead and start this bitch up see what

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:57.599 
ahead and start this bitch up see what
she<00:00:57.019> does

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
she does

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.979 
she does
nice<00:00:58.609> view<00:00:58.909> of<00:00:59.029> the<00:00:59.119> car<00:00:59.359> right<00:00:59.539> there<00:00:59.569> a

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
nice view of the car right there a

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.349 
nice view of the car right there a
little<00:01:00.859> roughed<00:01:01.190> inside<00:01:01.699> but<00:01:01.969> I<00:01:02.059> finally

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
little roughed inside but I finally

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.819 
little roughed inside but I finally
solving<00:01:03.079> that<00:01:03.820> first<00:01:04.820> step<00:01:05.380> is<00:01:06.380> getting<00:01:06.710> a

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
solving that first step is getting a

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.330 
solving that first step is getting a
running<00:01:07.070> good<00:01:08.710> alright<00:01:09.710> let's<00:01:09.979> see<00:01:10.100> what<00:01:10.219> she

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
running good alright let's see what she

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
running good alright let's see what she
does<00:01:14.979> yeah

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.550 

now<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.820> temperature<00:01:22.300> was<00:01:22.570> going<00:01:23.050> all<00:01:23.350> the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
now the temperature was going all the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.700 
now the temperature was going all the
way<00:01:23.710> up<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.280> double<00:01:24.760> red<00:01:24.940> lines<00:01:25.710> after

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
way up to the double red lines after

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.160 
way up to the double red lines after
about<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.880> know<00:01:27.970> two<00:01:28.030> minutes<00:01:28.540> of<00:01:28.660> driving<00:01:28.900> it

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
about you know two minutes of driving it

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.500 
about you know two minutes of driving it
after<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.040> heated<00:01:30.250> up<00:01:30.490> all<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.760> air<00:01:30.970> heated<00:01:31.390> up

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
after it heated up all the air heated up

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.720 
after it heated up all the air heated up
got<00:01:31.720> in<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.870> middle<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:33.070> just<00:01:33.100> let<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.520> sit

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
got in the middle you just let it sit

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.570 
got in the middle you just let it sit
there<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:35.080> will<00:01:35.320> climb<00:01:35.650> up<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.190> red<00:01:36.340> light

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
there it will climb up to the red light

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.620 
there it will climb up to the red light
so<00:01:38.370> like<00:01:39.370> I<00:01:39.520> said<00:01:39.700> hopefully<00:01:39.910> this<00:01:40.330> is<00:01:40.450> done

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
so like I said hopefully this is done

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.480 
so like I said hopefully this is done
