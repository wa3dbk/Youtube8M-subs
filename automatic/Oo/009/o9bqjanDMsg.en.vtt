00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.040
We're having children like never before -

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:13.733
- then we get divorced -

00:00:13.988 --> 00:00:15.099
- then we hook up with someone new -

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:16.466
- then we have even more children

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.655
or perhaps your soon-to-be already has kids of their own.

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:23.087
And suddenly you end up with the issue of transportation.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.030
Or at least, a transport task.

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:28.413
Because how do you cart around all of those children?

00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:31.390
Yes that is mighty difficult, and usually it would 
 cost you a lot of money -

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:35.450
- but I'm standing next to a very nice solution, from Hyundai -

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:37.940
- the H1, normally known as a Van -

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.020
- but now with impressive seating for 8 adults in the back.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.626
It's fitted with a 2.5 litre, commonrail diesel engine -

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:50.086
- good for 170 bhp and nearly 295 ft/lbs of torque.

00:00:51.193 --> 00:00:54.584
And all that for a price of just under £20.000.

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:57.054
It is certainly worth a second look.

00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:10.923
The Hyundai H1 Travel is fitted with a 5-speed, manual 
 transmission, which has a nice feel to it.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.159
And the feel of the steering is surprisingly direct.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:23.563
The suspension is alright, nothing to brag about, but it gets the job done.

00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:26.891
And that is also the case with other cabin noises,

00:01:27.152 --> 00:01:29.770
so all-in-all the driving experience is OK.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.504
You're seated high of the ground, with a nice view of things ahead.

00:01:32.807 --> 00:01:35.239
I know from past experiences that many appreciate just that.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:44.920
Of course you need to be aware that this is a big car, but 
 vision is excellent all around, so you won't get in any trouble.

00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:47.690
Safety-wise, the H1 also does just fine.

00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:52.640
ABS, ESC, EBD, airbags, everything is present.

00:01:52.637 --> 00:02:01.780
The only thing missing is curtain airbags in the rear, but that 
 is all you must do without in the Hyundai H1 Travel.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.770
But the main thing with the H1 is of course it's size.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.520
A total of 5,13 meters in length!

00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:15.270
And it is 1,92 meters tall -

00:02:15.386 --> 00:02:16.240
- and just as wide.

00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:19.890
So there is plenty of room inside.

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:24.400
And even though we have a cabin of such magnitude 
 that holds a lot of... children, for instance -

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:27.230
- it also has a very large cargo space -

00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:30.500
- which holds more than 800 liters.

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:34.390
So where you normally find cars of this 
 size, or maybe a bit smaller -

00:02:34.635 --> 00:02:40.290
- having space for 6 or 7 persons and 
 not much left over for luggage -

00:02:40.407 --> 00:02:41.910
- it's not the case with this one.

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:45.320
But you have to be aware that with a length of 5.13m -

00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:48.570
- we're dealing with quite a long car.

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:51.000
And you really get a sense of that when driving around town.

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.460
But other than that, it's a very user friendly car.

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:57.490
It's also a big car when it comes to weight -

00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:59.620
- because it weighs in at a hefty 2.3 tons.

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:04.870
That is as much as a ... Land Rover, actually, so quite a heffalump.

00:03:05.186 --> 00:03:09.630
Fortunately it has those 170 horses to push it from 0-60 in 14.5 seconds,

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:13.570
nothing to brag about, but alright, and a top speed of 111 mph.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.680
And that was all of the children, I think...

00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:20.180
But how does it handle the open road? 

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:29.960
Regarding fuel consumption, it's evident that with a front like 
 that, and a 2.3 ton curb weight -

00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:32.570
- we won't be seeing Lupo numbers.

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.810
Hyundai promises just under 33mpg (imp.), and for once it actually does that!

00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:40.470
At a nice and easy, steady pace, which the car encourages you to keep -

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:43.460
- it returns an average of 32-33 mpg (imp.)

00:03:44.092 --> 00:03:49.500
And if you really keep your foot out 
 of it, 38-39 mpg (imp.) isn't impossible.

00:03:49.818 --> 00:03:54.330
But the cars dimensions set a natural boundary for fuel efficiency.

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.440
So incredible numbers are out of reach, but with 
 a large fuel tank of 16.5 gal. -

00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:04.830
- you can get some serious range without having to re-fuel all the time.

00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:12.270
When doing about 50 mph, the noise and comfort levels are wonderful -

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.140
- just right.

00:04:14.928 --> 00:04:21.850
On rougher surfaces you feel that it doesn't have silky-smooth, all-consuming suspension -

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:29.010
- but then again, it only costs £20.000 -

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:31.600
- and offers up loads of space amongst many other things.

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:33.680
You can't get everything...

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.650
And now to the question of: "Would I buy this car?" -

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:38.910
- well, absolutely, if I had the need for it.

00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:43.450
Whoops, now I'm caught, because I'm the father of four -

00:04:43.902 --> 00:04:50.260
- and the eldest has a girlfriend, and the others 
 want to bring home friends all the time...

00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:54.200
Well, then you actually do need one of these cars.
