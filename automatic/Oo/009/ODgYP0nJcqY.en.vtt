 of what are called here the carters the

 corniche become a land of 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.420
 predilection for students in 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.110
 heat wave 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.229
 after coming here with the breeze with this 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.470
 heat here it's much quieter 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.899
 here I feel here to work here 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.189
 in the breeze besides there at the window 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.020
 of mosquitoes 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.750
 the phenomenon is called guru in the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.270
 jargon Wolof term students 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.490
 means to absorb however it presents 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.200
 risk to health 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.300
 revises to pass the exam the time 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.950
 of truth so rang the students have 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.170
 started the tests whose 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.150
 different faculties between optimism and 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.250
 fear the climate is sluggish following 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.840
 cyclical strikes the cs reporter signed 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.550
 a burst after a year a vestaire 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.890
 disturbed by a long strike 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.750
 higher education teachers 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.250
 it's time for university exams 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.500
 sheikh anta diop of dakar 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.610
 here at the Faculty of Legal Sciences 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.100
 and politics 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.440
 students have written on topics 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.720
 choice of political power and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.920
 religious power in senegal on 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.360
 asked the question of knowing that 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.880
 it is a compatibility or 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.260
 complementarity in their actions 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.530
 this is the subject of anthropology and 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.660
 political sociology 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.830
 good more or less affordable we can 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.080
 to say because first of all it's in the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.060
 quality but also we can have the 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.520
 So worry relief through respite 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.970
 politics in senegal english one can 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.069
 have even found at the amphitheater of 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.870
 afasec the faculty of science 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.850
 economic and management 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.410
 the circumstance by the students of the 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.600
 Sciences and technologies Faculty 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.850
 here the tests are judged rather 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.380
 difficult 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.450
 it was so said simon frankly 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.250
 speak almost seen the population of the 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.400
 russia were so much that in tibet that 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.680
 the nine-month program and skiing we have 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.070
 reduced to three months after which 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.410
 apparently competing with the tests 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.390
 we saw it at the bottom and it was not 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.100
 at all against the eagles at this 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.739
 added uncertainty is the plethora of 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.060
 the number of rooms 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.209
 which does not make it easy for 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.030
 supervisors that it might take and 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.880
 so consider another type of 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.319
 breakdown of students a finding the 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.880
 management is easier 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.370
 you were able to report everything to 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.920
 the time of the little mess between 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.000
 quotation marks that reigns so because with 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.950
 the number quite important 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.380
 it's difficult to control so 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.360
 actually all the steps so that 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.340
 takes a little time and the students 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.440
 so impatient that it makes a certain 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.780
 disorder 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.130
 since the mid -90s the ucad 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.030
 seeks to reconnect with his past 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.060
 prestigious 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.370
 initiating reforms in the meantime 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.350
 students continue to study and 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.410
 to do the exams under conditions 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.410
 difficult at this time every
