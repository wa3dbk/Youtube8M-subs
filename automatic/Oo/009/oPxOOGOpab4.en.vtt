00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:07.150
 there permaculture day staff 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.190
 I'm here today to give the first 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.829
 Our guide's tips have a culture 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.440
 very happy to have started this guide 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:16.660
 this project now and has enough 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.850
 people following snow already have more than 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.710
 200 people on our list 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.120
 many comments about our 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.680
 first and book 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.750
 so we have to take it here 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.490
 at home producing more or less two 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.860
 months and it was a very easy way 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.000
 because we just played the 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.980
 seeds here 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.079
 the technique we used to ride 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.600
 this bed was a technique also 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.370
 very simple without beating hoe 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.710
 nothing is a simple thing that makes 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.749
 their trash and compost and puts 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.120
 here i explain how making an ebook 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.649
 do it yourself so now I go 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.719
 teach a tip that was fundamental 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.089
 for us to produce so many tomatoes 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.510
 has been harvesting at sea for more 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.159
 months, we are all self-sufficient in the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.289
 our tomato production here at home 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.129
 like tomato with everything a tomato delight 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.729
 organic 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.560
 when you have the main branch 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.660
 tomato tomatoes will have a twig 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.340
 main power and turn it off will go 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:15.550
 leave the tomato leaves from the leaves they 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.190
 need to be strong and sometimes the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.890
 tomato launches another leaf launches two 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.020
 this in no way weakens the fruits 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.060
 from here you have another example 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.400
 also that she stay with them here 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.260
 threw this leaf and now the tomato 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.300
 is wanting to throw another leaf goes 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.000
 weaken or take away that gaucho bread 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.640
 is sucking the power of the plant itself 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.390
 thing here the main place is coming 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.870
 on here 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.240
 he released this he threw this sheet and 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.160
 now another line of life by taking the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.840
 force of the plant is a leaf that is 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.990
 having with the fruit with a little 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.760
 flowers but she is not she we already 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.900
 has taken is producing us well 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.270
 will also take it and here also to another 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.940
 gaucho bread in the way that very little 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.300
 also on this sheet is strong 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.960
 Are you pretty and the gaucho bread? 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.340
 support here we have another away 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.260
 main sheet and here the main sheet 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.370
 another sheet wanting to leave here 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.640
 people are going to take 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.840
 and here you see the fruits only know one 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.020
 technique to pollinate to help and 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:33.100
 help a lot of seed is enough 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.100
 fruit just hit and sway
