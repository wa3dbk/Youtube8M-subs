00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.790
 today we will see what is 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.040
 oil pressure indicator 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.669
 which why does he need it shows 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.820
 if the presence of oil in the highway which 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:21.240
 can crankshaft mean oil like to it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.130
 comes it comes from the pump by 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.270
 oil channel oil filter 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.790
 filter by vertical channel on this 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:35.010
 the indicator lifts him 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:40.589
 a stream of oil and on here on 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.280
 this channel here it is under the filter we have to 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:50.309
 Sorry unprecedented will be here by 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.679
 this channel well runs into the engine block 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.479
 arises and there is watering already articulated 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:58.409
 the shaft is completly separate and therefore 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.940
 smeared here means the channel here 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.239
 threesome 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.560
 here you can see here there is a hole there 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.090
 casing can camshaft on this side 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.630
 stub nowhere it goes mean 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.119
 wrongly people accepts this indicator 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.119
 over pressure relief valve 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.039
 they say that it serves to 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.380
 oil hold she did not knock you 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.939
 vertical channel means nothing 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 like he does not perform any 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.960
 functions is just an indicator of it but 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.170
 valve valve oh mono can not be 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.170
 means how to remove it is taken the key to 22 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.719
 breaks out 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.009
 we have such a detail the eyelet is compacted 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.399
 here kentron live ring 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:01.579
 the case how it works stands in the case 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:05.750
 here's the oil pump through the filter 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.599
 vertical channel passes to the sensor 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.910
 indicator on the oil turns on 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.930
 crankshaft and here it comes at a time 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.099
 and the flow of oil that goes to the crankshaft 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.269
 oil flow is the whole thing 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:25.040
 this mushroom rises and we see 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:28.400
 what we have is a minimum 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.069
 pressure means pressure here in 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.560
 limits but 405 this top falls on 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:38.450
 connection is not here it is wrong to think that 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.910
 here 4 or 6 atmospheres as usual 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.090
 diesel through no pressure 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.610
 pressure is minimal because there in 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.920
 the casing is solid let's say the hole 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.959
 which pressure cannot hold 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.209
 will do it will be visible on this 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:59.930
 the hole here means it is not a valve it 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:05.150
 just an indicator means there is a hole 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:11.120
 This one is about a dot about which 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:14.209
 oil comes from this channel and here 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.549
 accordingly , there is also a hole 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.730
 on which oil flows in among 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.170
 this sensor and serves to 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.209
 smear this stock 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.530
 which runs in the body because if 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.290
 you can not smear can stick 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.329
 can buy somewhere there and since 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.180
 us the pressure here is minimal it can 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.569
 just dripka not to raise 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.810
 when the fungus did not rise then 9 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.609
 it is impossible to work as a block because 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.079
 it means you take off the calender 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.930
 look for the cause of either pieces here when 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.959
 wedge or the pump does not pump well or 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.849
 somewhere not the density of the filter and oil 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.359
 kills to the side for the channel huddled there 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.670
 fence in general need to look for the cause 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:02.000
 if we this some does not rise 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.120
 I can not work again I repeat it is not 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.150
 valve is just an indicator which 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:14.569
 rated for minimum pressure yet he 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:22.120
 actually consists consists here such 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:22.120
 Detalyushka pulled super and 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:37.930
 pulled pieces from the hull here are no 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.190
 there are no rubber seals 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.010
 compacted 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:51.729
 nothing he does not compacted that is only 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:54.620
 due to the gap here on the pieces and the case 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.419
 if there will be some kind of development there 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.050
 there is a chance that the bridge will penetrate 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:04.180
 between the wall between the body will be 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.180
 you are pouring out from under your cap 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.830
 here is on the stock pro. 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.280
 serves to oil which 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.120
 passes 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.150
 Yureku grow small I 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.460
 showed this here 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.030
 trail vidyushku falls in this pocket 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.360
 window does not smear this pieces to valve 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:30.350
 I did not stick here, in principle, and all 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.290
 design of the most primitive station 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:40.800
 mean here 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:43.140
 stock has such a small gap here 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.820
 so much runs respectively 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.890
 that's why he valve be and not 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.570
 may delay nothing here 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.790
 Moscow, he can not hold any 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:06:01.320
 what seals on the rod it does not 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:06:05.820
 This part exists and serves. 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.540
 only once more so for 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.430
 indications 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.820
 oil for what we saw that flow 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:18.870
 oil rose from the filter raised 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:25.910
 the indicator did not go to the crankshaft principle 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.910
 and all all devices all
