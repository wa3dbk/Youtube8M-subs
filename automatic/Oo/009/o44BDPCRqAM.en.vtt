for people probably that's Gringo's to

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.260 
for people probably that's Gringo's to
dance<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.560> so<00:00:51.130> when<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.370> music<00:00:51.460> slowed<00:00:51.970> down

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
dance to so when the music slowed down

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.910

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.910 
they put in a shuffle 2 3 cha-cha-cha 2
3<00:00:56.950> and<00:00:57.820> they<00:00:57.940> say<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.720> touch<00:00:59.020> a<00:00:59.050> word<00:00:59.440> came

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
3 and they say the touch a word came

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
3 and they say the touch a word came
from<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.390> shuffle<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.960> feet<00:01:02.760> bum

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
cha-cha-cha 2 3 so that's how we got

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.649

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
first which is very similar to the salsa

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.310 
first which is very similar to the salsa
and<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:13.510> slowed<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:13.930> down<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.170> we<00:01:14.229> got

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
and then slowed it down and we got

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.820 
and then slowed it down and we got
