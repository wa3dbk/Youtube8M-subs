00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
and then create virtual copy we can see

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.130 
and then create virtual copy we can see
now<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.890> my<00:00:32.160> film<00:00:32.430> strip<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.940> actually<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.719> two

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.380 
now in my film strip I actually have two
different<00:00:34.170> thumbnails<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.520> still<00:00:36.059> only<00:00:36.300> have

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
different thumbnails I still only have

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.200 
different thumbnails I still only have
one<00:00:36.649> original<00:00:37.649> image<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> hard<00:00:38.430> drive<00:00:38.700> but

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
one original image on the hard drive but

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.639 
one original image on the hard drive but
Lightroom<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.750> showing<00:00:40.110> me<00:00:40.260> two<00:00:40.530> different

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
Lightroom is showing me two different

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
Lightroom is showing me two different
thumbnails<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.700> change<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
thumbnails so that I can change the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
thumbnails so that I can change the
processing<00:00:43.020> between<00:00:43.680> each<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.980> these

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
processing between each of these

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.880 
processing between each of these
thumbnails<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> second<00:00:46.559> thumbnails

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
thumbnails so with the second thumbnails

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
thumbnails so with the second thumbnails
selected<00:00:47.340> I'll<00:00:47.489> tap<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.940> V<00:00:48.210> key<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.750> that

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
selected I'll tap the V key and that

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
selected I'll tap the V key and that
will<00:00:49.170> give<00:00:49.440> me<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.739> black<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> white

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
will give me this black and white

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.420 
will give me this black and white
version<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.379> now<00:00:52.379> I'm<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.160> one

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
version and now I'm going to do this one

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.340 
version and now I'm going to do this one
more<00:00:53.640> time<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:54.480> photo<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
more time I'm going to use photo and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.200 
more time I'm going to use photo and
then<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.039> say<00:00:56.219> create<00:00:56.489> virtual

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
then I'm going to say create virtual

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.840 
then I'm going to say create virtual
copy<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.890> case<00:00:59.160> I'm<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> tap

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
copy and in this case I'm going to tap

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
copy and in this case I'm going to tap
the<00:00:59.879> V<00:01:00.180> key<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> bring<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> back<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.289> color<00:01:01.530> but

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the V key to bring it back to color but

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.910 
the V key to bring it back to color but
then<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.640> under<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> saturation<00:01:03.719> area<00:01:04.439> here

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
then go under the saturation area here

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.940 
then go under the saturation area here
in<00:01:05.040> HSL<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.840> decrease<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.680> saturation

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
in HSL and just decrease the saturation

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.750 
in HSL and just decrease the saturation
of<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.869> my<00:01:10.110> color<00:01:10.590> ranges<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.369> something

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
of all of my color ranges to something

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.420 
of all of my color ranges to something
like<00:01:11.909> maybe<00:01:12.270> negative<00:01:12.659> 75<00:01:13.590> I'll<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.130> copy

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
like maybe negative 75 I'll just copy

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.149 
like maybe negative 75 I'll just copy
that<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:15.420> tab<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.290> paste<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.799> in

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that and then tab and then paste that in

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.170 
that and then tab and then paste that in
all<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.540> different<00:01:18.960> sliders<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
all of the different sliders here so

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
all of the different sliders here so
basically<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.830> three

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
basically what I have now are three

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.520 
basically what I have now are three
different<00:01:23.640> versions<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.659> original<00:01:25.170> image

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
different versions of the original image

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
different versions of the original image
and<00:01:25.710> I'll<00:01:26.220> make<00:01:26.430> my<00:01:26.580> film<00:01:26.850> strip<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.210> bit

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and I'll make my film strip a little bit

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.270 
and I'll make my film strip a little bit
larger<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> can

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
larger so we can see that and you can

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.130 
larger so we can see that and you can
see<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.700> three<00:01:30.119> versions<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

thing<00:01:38.640> about<00:01:38.700> virtual<00:01:39.210> copies<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:39.960> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
thing about virtual copies is if I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749 
thing about virtual copies is if I
return<00:01:40.409> back<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> grid<00:01:41.310> view<00:01:41.340> by<00:01:41.700> tapping

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759

these three images they would be

these three images they would be
exported<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:50.880> three<00:01:51.240> separate<00:01:52.020> files<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
exported as three separate files or if I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.889 
exported as three separate files or if I
went<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> print<00:01:53.970> module<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.420> could<00:01:54.600> print

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
went to the print module I could print

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.319 
went to the print module I could print
all<00:01:55.110> three<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.590> these<00:01:55.740> images<00:01:56.100> right<00:01:56.700> next<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
all three of these images right next to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.389 
all three of these images right next to
each<00:01:57.450> other<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.200> even<00:01:58.590> though<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> only<00:01:58.920> have

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
each other so even though I only have

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.420 
each other so even though I only have
one<00:01:59.790> original<00:02:00.540> file<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> hard<00:02:01.680> drive<00:02:02.040> I've

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
one original file on the hard drive I've

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.179 
one original file on the hard drive I've
now<00:02:02.969> got<00:02:03.240> three<00:02:03.659> different<00:02:03.960> versions<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
now got three different versions of it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.010 
now got three different versions of it
that<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.520> process<00:02:05.759> an<00:02:06.090> output<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.600> any<00:02:06.750> time

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
that I can process an output at any time

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.350 
that I can process an output at any time
so<00:02:07.770> there<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.729> easy<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so there you have it it's that easy to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.240 
so there you have it it's that easy to
create<00:02:09.569> multiple<00:02:10.440> versions<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:11.099> your<00:02:11.220> files

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
create multiple versions of your files

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.820 
create multiple versions of your files
