00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.180
 you search and how to enter accounts 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.360

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.070
 pirate one point 7.2 ok you will find 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.360
 You'll already be able to play in these 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.559
 servers here to see if they 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.980
 really work with minecraft 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.090
 pirate but not for me official all 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.720
 here are the are more than are more than ten 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.240
 It's eight servers for you to use. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.720
 here are eight servers that are 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.270
 online 24 hours online ok here he said 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 that has these clubs but I do not know 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.320
 It's okay if I have to go in here every 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.780
 It's okay to show you that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.049
 really get the servers in the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.270
 Now you servers are going 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.619
 need to record is this server 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.439
 that you can see that he is well 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.659
 but there are a lot of people who watch the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.060
 Minecraft ended up spoiling everything, right? 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.960
 I do not know if you have barrels stick to other types 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.490
 from plugin 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.170
 so I would not recommend entering the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.990
 first server that I'm going to put in the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.299
 list I recommend entering the ones below 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.729
 mainly from here that is one of the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.430
 better if I'm not mistaken as server and 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.770
 no one is logged in and the fan is fine 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
 little you can see I'm going away from me a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.020
 little of the total and there is nobody and we 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.780
 we are in a new biome in maine 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.270
 And you have some things there. 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.700

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.530

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.879
 see if it really falls on time like this 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.770
 he falls on time 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.200

 It 's human here . 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.160
 it was a village where somebody walked 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.560
 entering here I wanted to say that the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.010

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.570

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.560
 Minecraft but you guys are going to play here 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.830
