 the space infinite and wide 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.290
 infinitely great 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.929
 space simulation we look back 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.789
 At almost 40 years of space for the pc and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.880
 come to be for video game consoles in 1974 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.949
 still play out space in what for 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.900
 space simulation booth was by 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.810
 Kinbauri at the University of Iowa 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 programmed up to 32 players could 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.759
 the space oli at the plato network 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.160
 play system that is space m that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.340
 first 3d multiplayer online game of the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.540
 software history the actual 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.129
 Starting shot for the genre of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.469
 Space simulation like we do today 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.570
 However, getting to know and adore marks 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.090
 Elite from the year 1984 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.980
 the classic of david brave bandage 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.710
 economic aspects with action elements 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.920
 and offered a for those circumstances 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.809
 pioneering vector graphics galaxy 1993 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.640
 appeared with franchise elite 2 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.230
 successor of mainly in graphic 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.480
 clearly increased 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.150
 However, numerous bugs made for 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.490
 displeasure among the series fans on roger 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.710
 first encounter the third part of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.310
 row could not be a success and the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.930
 Quality of elite 1 link 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 the most iconic space to date 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.909
 series he celebrated the stage in the year 1990 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.860
 with commander from today's stars 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.570
 whose maker chris roberts told 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.990
 his story about the fight of the people 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.090
 against the cats rellin breed coffee 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.600
 a cinematic way to do it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.590
 otherwise only from the cinema knew from the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.000
 third part became the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.350
 However, intergalactic battles always 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.390
 more pushed into the background 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.880
 one was amazed between the inlays 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.890
 mass interactive movie sequences in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.580
 famous actors like Mark 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.080
 hamill acts 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.850
 so it fits perfectly into the picture 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.470
 that series creator roberts the end of 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.479
 90s a corresponding wing 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.220
 Commander movie was brought to the start 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.750
 However, this was even for 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 hard-nosed fans of the series barely too 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.970
 endured so flat were the dialogues to 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.960
 mediocre the digital effects by far 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.180
 better cut the wing commander 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.100
 private off here for this 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.570
 combined brilliant story staging 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.790
 the main series with significantly more 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.110
 playful freedom to act and 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.730
 explore the space remembered 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.440
 actually a classic elite 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.750
 but of course with clear 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.580
 of more modern technology and that exactly 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.739
 wharf was in the star wars rebel assault 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.720
 because the magnificently staged cd-rom 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.910
 action to the world famous star saga 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.739
 Moisten the player on candle straight 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.750
 paths from one level to the next 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.130
 due to the spectacular technicians 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.480
 Nevertheless, it should be among the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.480
 main genre representatives 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.379
 in the same year appeared with axway one 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.540
 further furnishing of george lucas 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.430
 film trilogy developed by the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.379
 simulation experts totally the gamescom 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.760
 in the morning holland picks up the stars 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.909
 shootout as exciting as 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.920
 demanding dogfight in the age of 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.650
 direct successor tie fighter for 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.670
 this principle continues successfully 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.069
 However, as a player changed times 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.959
 pages and moved now for daytrader and 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.959
 its dark empire in the line 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.139
 In 1997, playstation players also traveled to 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.599
 virtual space colony wars vom 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.519
 the developer studios use it 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.440
 the 3d chips of the sony console around 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.049
 to stage impressive battles 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.340
 The highlight of the series was part 3 with the 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.349
 subtitles advisable 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.629
 However , the game remained the deserved 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.370
 success denied so no today 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.859
 Further episodes of colony wars 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.359
 have appeared 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.760
 as happened to the company colleagues the 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.750
 Police are strict, however 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.879
 No real wash 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.859
 space simulation there once a 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.599
 futuristic helicopter only 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.540
 through the atmosphere of jupiter's moon 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.069
 piloted a completely different approach 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.139
 pursued the star trek star flees 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.370
 academy as the name already makes clear 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.980
 you had to play in the game 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.489
 World famous scifi series as a recruit in 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.159
 various simulator mission one prove 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.840
 The 2002 Star Trek game 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.879
 bridge commander was continued 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.829
 now acted as a young captain 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.699
 the most clever on the bridge 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.560
 commands to his spaceship to spread 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.000
 conflict free space from the year 1998 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.340
 on the other hand was a litter of the famous 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.079
 essent series in contrast to the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.000
 original episodes you do not fly, however 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.380
 through cramped tunnels but through the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.390
 open space 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.770
 1999 is a German 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.320
 developer studio in the fight for the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.020
 best space simulation an egosoft 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.210
 delivered the start with ex bnd frontier 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.490
 a series starting today for her 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.610
 complexity but also famous 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.470
 notorious is far more straightforward and 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.150
 beginner-friendly camstar lancer 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.760
 hence the game of the wing commander 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.070
 makers put on 24 years of story 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.420
 missions singularity up to 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.010
 a certain degree decided the 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.830
 performance of the player on the progress 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.990
 the later missions are revolutionary 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.090
 failed tragically so can the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.460
 best to describe a fantastic jumpgate 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.550
 from 2001, space is fascinating 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.930
 online game numerous hobbypiloten 2008 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.970
 should then the follower jumpgate 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.540
 evolution , he brought it 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.310
 but only to various beta phases 2012 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.830
 the campaign servers became final 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.870
 off 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.550
 ok plays under water and thus has the 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.590
 title space simulation actually 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.300
 not quite deserved but aqualux that 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.220
 Submarine game with the grandiose graphic 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.560
 controls and plays just like wing 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.970
 commander and co just that just fish 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.280
 instead of stars in the game world 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.420
 buzz around 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.340
 In 2003, it was again the wing commander 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.230
 inventor and chris roberts the with 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.100
 Freelancer is a popular space in the world 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.690
 brought out 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.220
 However , the mouse keyboard came across 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.510
 Control not at all genre 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.730
 followers on charity 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.910
 nevertheless the title belongs to today 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.550
 the best of his master mason griffin 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.410
 who only went well the bounty hunter 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.090
 to release in 2003 under 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.130
 however, the gameplay is the 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.050
 scifi shootout memorable the 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.000
 Bounty hunting butt flowing transitions 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.320
 between space-fought and 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.270
 ego shooter deposits 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.970
 There would have been so much more to it 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.590
 can 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.810
 one to this day immensely successful 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.540
 Weltraum hit began its triumph in 2003 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.460
 ran online from Emsland studio ccp 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.350
 offers its online player in addition to one 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.300
 gigantic world of games especially one 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.180
 one vote because in the virtual 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.890
 There is no democracy in galaxy 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.020
 Other online titles have the paying ones 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.140
 abo customers have as much say as 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.280
 here at the e3 2013, there it is 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.530
 famously a new star wars 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.150
 Battlefront announced and that was 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.500
 also time for the last part of the series 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.510
 appeared eight years ago 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.070
 star wars battlefront 2 was above all 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.600
 through his gigantic online battles 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.520
 whether space or not 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.640
 planet surface many players in 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.140
 remained a good memory 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.360
 much smaller is the fanbase of 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.220
 darkstar one the ambitious space 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.630
 Game from german studio ascaron came 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.000
 two players like critics neat 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.620
 good but ultimately not enough 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.550
 with classics like the commander and too 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.920
 to be able to measure 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.260
 even more dramatic is the fate of 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.330
 black prophecy the online simulation 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.950
 was a felt eternity of the 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.020
 Development finally appeared as 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.330
 free to play title and has just been 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.370
 18 months after your start already 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.229
 rehired 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.910
 the latest and therefore last 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:12.760
 representative in our special strike suit 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.440
 zero financed the pack starter 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.260
 outer space Geballer seen from a year 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.790
 Okay everything is going well there 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.770
 the upcoming star citizen a whole 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.120
 other calibers will be if it times 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.120
 finally finished
