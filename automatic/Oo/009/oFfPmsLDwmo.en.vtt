00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.030 
guys that I went and cut this hole
inside<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.489> section<00:03:18.880> right<00:03:19.840> here<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.010> I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
inside of a section right here so that I

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.850 
inside of a section right here so that I
can<00:03:21.160> go<00:03:21.400> faster<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:22.599> as<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.079> do<00:03:23.140> each<00:03:23.380> section

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
I'm going to cut each section so where I

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.819 
I'm going to cut each section so where I
believe<00:03:26.920> my<00:03:27.160> hair<00:03:27.489> stops<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.630> then<00:03:29.440> take

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
believe my hair stops that and then take

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.350 
believe my hair stops that and then take
it<00:03:29.950> out<00:03:30.040> but<00:03:30.310> actually<00:03:30.640> I'm<00:03:30.760> cutting<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.299> a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
it out but actually I'm cutting it a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.580 
it out but actually I'm cutting it a
little<00:03:31.420> bit<00:03:31.660> longer<00:03:31.900> than<00:03:32.200> when<00:03:32.319> my<00:03:32.410> head

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
little bit longer than when my head

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.089 
little bit longer than when my head
