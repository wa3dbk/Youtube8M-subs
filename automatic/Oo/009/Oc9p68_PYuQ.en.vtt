00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.210 
can't hit no and it will try to adjust
the<00:02:40.430> resolution<00:02:40.580> once<00:02:41.239> again<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.950> it's<00:02:43.100> just

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the resolution once again so it's just

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.040 
the resolution once again so it's just
going<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.459> load<00:02:43.670> up<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.120> there<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.600> go<00:02:44.780> you

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
going to load up and there you go you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.080 
going to load up and there you go you
have<00:02:45.080> your<00:02:45.500> ps3<00:02:45.860> connected<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.790> your<00:02:46.910> computer

monitor

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.850 

so<00:02:51.220> right<00:02:51.519> now<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.790> have<00:02:52.030> video<00:02:52.659> but<00:02:53.049> no<00:02:53.260> audio

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
so right now you have video but no audio

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.149 
so right now you have video but no audio
so<00:02:54.700> there's<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.180> video<00:02:55.390> but<00:02:56.140> as<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.739> can<00:02:56.890> see

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
there's no audio unless your monitor

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.500 
there's no audio unless your monitor
does<00:02:59.440> already<00:02:59.890> have<00:03:00.220> audio<00:03:00.700> speakers

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
does already have audio speakers

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.080 
does already have audio speakers
connected<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.349> the<00:03:03.220> mine<00:03:03.430> doesn't<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.060> I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
connected to it the mine doesn't so I

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.420 
connected to it the mine doesn't so I
have<00:03:04.420> no<00:03:04.569> audio<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.220> simultaneously<00:03:06.220> we're

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
have no audio so simultaneously we're

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.240 
have no audio so simultaneously we're
going<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.730> use<00:03:06.849> two<00:03:07.180> parts<00:03:07.599> HDMI<00:03:08.409> for<00:03:08.920> video

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
going to use two parts HDMI for video
