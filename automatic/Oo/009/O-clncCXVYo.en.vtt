work very well for me so I think you can
only<00:01:38.530> go<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:38.890> far<00:01:39.310> but<00:01:39.850> you're<00:01:40.030> not<00:01:40.149> going<00:01:40.390> to

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
only go so far but you're not going to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.270 
only go so far but you're not going to
get<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.869> same<00:01:41.049> kind<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.320> results<00:01:41.680> from<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.950> huge

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
get the same kind of results from a huge

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.609 
get the same kind of results from a huge
expensive<00:01:43.240> treatment<00:01:43.630> with<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.049> toothpaste

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
expensive treatment with a toothpaste

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.620 
expensive treatment with a toothpaste
but<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.189> do<00:01:45.310> have<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.880> say<00:01:46.030> though<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.420> does

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
but I do have to say though it does

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.280 
but I do have to say though it does
remove<00:01:47.759> relatively<00:01:48.759> new<00:01:49.030> stains<00:01:49.450> very<00:01:50.020> very

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
remove relatively new stains very very

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.889 
remove relatively new stains very very
well<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.969> think<00:01:51.969> there<00:01:52.149> was<00:01:52.299> a<00:01:52.360> study<00:01:52.780> done

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
well I think there was a study done

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.109

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.330 
the eye I was very intrigued to try it
because<00:03:35.959> I've<00:03:36.200> never<00:03:36.350> tried<00:03:36.709> I'm<00:03:36.950> not<00:03:37.100> sure<00:03:37.220> if

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
because I've never tried I'm not sure if

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.160 
because I've never tried I'm not sure if
there<00:03:37.459> are<00:03:37.610> any<00:03:37.880> other<00:03:38.090> blacks<00:03:38.360> with<00:03:38.540> me<00:03:38.690> to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
there are any other blacks with me to

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.320 
there are any other blacks with me to
piss<00:03:39.380> on<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.709> Marrakesh<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.190> if<00:03:41.090> there<00:03:41.299> I

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
piss on the Marrakesh and if there I

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.390 
piss on the Marrakesh and if there I
haven't<00:03:41.750> heard<00:03:41.870> about<00:03:41.959> them<00:03:42.200> Bush<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:42.890> was

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
haven't heard about them Bush I was

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.259 
haven't heard about them Bush I was
intrigued<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.760> try<00:03:44.090> it

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
intrigued to try it

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.229 
intrigued to try it
and<00:03:44.500> Boccia<00:03:45.500> when<00:03:45.739> you<00:03:45.830> spit<00:03:46.070> out<00:03:46.100> it's<00:03:46.519> not

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
and Boccia when you spit out it's not

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.360 
and Boccia when you spit out it's not
very<00:03:47.480> pleasing<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.049> eye<00:03:48.080> not<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.680> white

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
very pleasing to the eye not that white

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.310 
very pleasing to the eye not that white
or<00:03:49.610> blue<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:50.090> but<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.450> think<00:03:50.630> white<00:03:50.989> or<00:03:51.170> blue

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
or blue is but I think white or blue

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.530 
or blue is but I think white or blue
more<00:03:51.709> resonates<00:03:52.130> with<00:03:52.489> being<00:03:52.730> clean<00:03:52.970> whereas

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
more resonates with being clean whereas

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.520 
more resonates with being clean whereas
black<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.989> just<00:03:54.260> but<00:03:54.980> it's<00:03:55.670> just<00:03:55.760> like<00:03:56.530> dirty

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
black is just but it's just like dirty

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.170 
black is just but it's just like dirty
look<00:03:57.890> like<00:03:58.040> dark<00:03:58.250> my<00:03:58.489> mouth<00:03:58.730> but<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.000> guess

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
look like dark my mouth but I guess

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.860 
look like dark my mouth but I guess
that's<00:03:59.360> a<00:03:59.420> good<00:03:59.540> thing

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
that's a good thing

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.840 
that's a good thing
I<00:03:59.900> don't<00:04:00.170> know<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:01.070> it's<00:04:01.220> not<00:04:01.370> pleasing<00:04:01.610> to

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
I don't know and so it's not pleasing to

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.250 
I don't know and so it's not pleasing to
the<00:04:01.940> eye<00:04:01.970> obviously<00:04:02.510> but<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.870> does<00:04:03.049> work

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
the eye obviously but it does work

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.250 
the eye obviously but it does work
relatively<00:04:03.769> well<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.209> priced<00:04:05.600> at<00:04:05.959> I

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
relatively well and this is priced at I

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.490 
relatively well and this is priced at I
think<00:04:06.440> it's<00:04:06.530> $4.99<00:04:07.420> again<00:04:08.420> depending<00:04:09.350> where

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
think it's $4.99 again depending where

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.880 
think it's $4.99 again depending where
you<00:04:09.590> buy<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.769> it's<00:04:10.010> in<00:04:10.100> around<00:04:10.340> 500<00:04:10.820> mark<00:04:11.120> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
you buy it it's in around 500 mark and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.340 
you buy it it's in around 500 mark and
it's<00:04:12.890> not<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.700> best<00:04:14.120> whitening<00:04:14.690> toothpaste

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
it's not the best whitening toothpaste

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.110 
it's not the best whitening toothpaste
I've<00:04:15.590> used<00:04:15.920> I'm<00:04:16.250> not<00:04:16.400> going<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.640> mention<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.000> in

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
I've used I'm not going to mention it in

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.240 
I've used I'm not going to mention it in
this<00:04:17.299> video<00:04:17.479> because<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.290> don't<00:04:18.919> think<00:04:19.130> that's

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
this video because I don't think that's

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.250 
this video because I don't think that's
very<00:04:19.310> fair<00:04:19.700> if<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:19.940> want<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:20.180> know<00:04:20.299> I'll<00:04:20.479> talk

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.320 
now I didn't bother really doing for and
afters<00:04:50.930> because<00:04:51.440> my<00:04:51.740> teeth<00:04:51.980> aren't<00:04:52.330> too

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
yellow at the moment and it may have

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.210 
yellow at the moment and it may have
lifted<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.990> shade<00:04:57.320> or<00:04:57.500> two<00:04:57.530> but<00:04:57.919> as<00:04:58.010> I<00:04:58.100> mentioned

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220
