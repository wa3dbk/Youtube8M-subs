are all sorts of different styles in
them<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.080> device<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:46.170> pedals<00:00:46.500> got<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
them in the device the pedals got the

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.510 
them in the device the pedals got the
ability<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.580> record<00:00:47.880> your<00:00:48.090> guitar<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.520> loop

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it so you can create multiple layers so

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.299 
it so you can create multiple layers so
you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.440> keep<00:00:52.530> looping<00:00:52.770> yourself<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you can just keep looping yourself and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.240 
you can just keep looping yourself and
adding<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:53.640> layer<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.100> also

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250

jamming ability and you've got the
ability<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.770> add<00:02:15.950> layers<00:02:16.430> as<00:02:16.760> I've<00:02:17.030> seen

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
ability to add layers as I've seen

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.780 
ability to add layers as I've seen
people<00:02:17.510> actually<00:02:17.660> do<00:02:18.650> full<00:02:18.920> songs<00:02:19.220> using<00:02:19.610> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
people actually do full songs using a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.089 
people actually do full songs using a
looper<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:21.200> could<00:02:21.349> get<00:02:21.530> very<00:02:21.560> creative

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
looper so you could get very creative

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.979 
looper so you could get very creative
with<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.880> hope<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.569> enjoyed<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:23.959> one
