00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
West Coast offense for several reasons I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.970 
West Coast offense for several reasons I
want<00:00:29.360> to<00:00:29.450> be<00:00:29.570> balanced<00:00:30.140> on<00:00:30.230> first<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:30.770> ten

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
want to be balanced on first and ten

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.890 
want to be balanced on first and ten
which<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:31.550> most<00:00:31.790> important<00:00:32.360> down<00:00:32.599> in

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
which is the most important down in

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.350 
which is the most important down in
football<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:33.740> also<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.340> down<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:34.640> happens

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
football it's also the down that happens

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.210 
football it's also the down that happens
the<00:00:35.510> most<00:00:35.720> it's<00:00:35.990> also<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.410> down<00:00:36.590> where<00:00:37.100> the

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
the most it's also the down where the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.340 
the most it's also the down where the
defense<00:00:37.700> has<00:00:37.970> to<00:00:38.210> balance<00:00:38.540> up<00:00:38.930> they<00:00:39.079> have<00:00:39.200> to

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
defense has to balance up they have to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.110 
defense has to balance up they have to
defend<00:00:39.470> both<00:00:39.890> to<00:00:40.340> run<00:00:40.520> in<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:40.700> past<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.090> I

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
defend both to run in the past and I

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360 
defend both to run in the past and I
think<00:00:41.329> you<00:00:41.450> can<00:00:41.600> attack<00:00:41.900> that<00:00:41.930> defense<00:00:42.740> better

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
think you can attack that defense better

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.580 
think you can attack that defense better
from<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.790> west<00:00:44.030> coast<00:00:44.180> I<00:00:44.600> want<00:00:45.079> to<00:00:45.170> be<00:00:45.290> able<00:00:45.440> to

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
from the west coast I want to be able to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.560 
from the west coast I want to be able to
be<00:00:45.980> good<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.340> short<00:00:46.640> yardage<00:00:46.790> goal-line

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
be good and short yardage goal-line

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.930 
be good and short yardage goal-line
certain<00:00:48.350> running<00:00:48.950> situations<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:49.910> think

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
certain running situations and I think

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.540 
certain running situations and I think
the<00:00:50.300> West<00:00:50.540> Coast<00:00:50.780> offense<00:00:51.160> gives<00:00:52.160> you<00:00:52.340> that

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
the West Coast offense gives you that

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.040 
the West Coast offense gives you that
and<00:00:52.790> I<00:00:53.000> want<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:53.270> be<00:00:53.360> able<00:00:53.450> to<00:00:53.600> recruit<00:00:53.960> the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
and I want to be able to recruit the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.260 
and I want to be able to recruit the
best<00:00:54.590> quarterbacks<00:00:55.250> in<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.460> country<00:00:55.550> Mason<00:00:56.239> I

of<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.219> plays<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.729> really<00:01:38.060> want<00:01:38.270> to

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
of the plays that I really want to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.779 
of the plays that I really want to
feature<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:39.049> all<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.740> wishbone<00:01:40.219> principles

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
feature is all the wishbone principles

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.519 
feature is all the wishbone principles
and<00:01:40.969> that's<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.329> old<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.779> I<00:01:42.079> think<00:01:42.350> when<00:01:42.469> you

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:42.529 
and that's the old and I think when you

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:44.199 
and that's the old and I think when you
can<00:01:42.649> spread<00:01:42.950> them<00:01:43.099> out<00:01:43.249> you<00:01:43.759> utilize<00:01:44.179> a

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
can spread them out you utilize a

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.559 
can spread them out you utilize a
running<00:01:44.630> quarterback<00:01:44.810> with<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.799> wishbone

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
running quarterback with the wishbone

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.300 
running quarterback with the wishbone
option<00:01:47.569> principles<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.229> also<00:01:48.799> that<00:01:49.039> quick

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
option principles and also that quick

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.550 
option principles and also that quick
passing<00:01:49.819> attack<00:01:50.119> I<00:01:50.450> think<00:01:50.749> it's<00:01:51.049> awful<00:01:51.409> hard

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
passing attack I think it's awful hard

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.739 
passing attack I think it's awful hard
to<00:01:51.619> defend<00:01:52.149> it<00:01:53.149> has<00:01:53.299> something<00:01:53.599> to<00:01:53.630> do<00:01:53.719> with

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
to defend it has something to do with

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:55.300 
to defend it has something to do with
what<00:01:53.959> programmer<00:01:54.529> would<00:01:54.829> for<00:01:55.039> me<00:01:55.159> what

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
what programmer would for me what

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.559 
what programmer would for me what
program<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.729> take<00:01:55.939> me<00:01:56.060> over<00:01:56.149> I<00:01:56.270> think<00:01:56.329> the

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
program is take me over I think the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.899 
program is take me over I think the
spread<00:01:56.929> is<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.049> great<00:01:57.380> talent<00:01:57.919> neutralizer<00:01:58.549> and

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
spread is a great talent neutralizer and

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.760 
spread is a great talent neutralizer and
if<00:01:59.029> I<00:01:59.119> didn't<00:01:59.359> think<00:01:59.479> I<00:01:59.659> could<00:01:59.689> recruit<00:02:00.259> the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
if I didn't think I could recruit the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.859 
if I didn't think I could recruit the
best<00:02:01.130> players<00:02:01.459> in<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.700> country<00:02:01.789> I<00:02:02.329> think<00:02:02.539> I

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
best players in the country I think I

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.859 
best players in the country I think I
would<00:02:03.049> maybe<00:02:03.770> do<00:02:04.069> an<00:02:04.310> option<00:02:04.999> or<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.209> spread

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
would maybe do an option or the spread

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:06.999 
would maybe do an option or the spread
and<00:02:06.139> yet<00:02:06.409> you've<00:02:06.529> got<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.740> national

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
and yet you've got a national

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.710 
and yet you've got a national
championship<00:02:07.669> team<00:02:07.939> in<00:02:08.060> Florida<00:02:08.479> that

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
championship team in Florida that

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.509 
championship team in Florida that
certainly<00:02:08.989> doesn't<00:02:09.200> neutralize<00:02:09.739> talent<00:02:10.429> or

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
certainly doesn't neutralize talent or

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.039 
certainly doesn't neutralize talent or
need<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.789> neutralize<00:02:11.299> talent<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:11.900> they're<00:02:12.019> a

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
need to neutralize talent and they're a

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.920 
need to neutralize talent and they're a
spread<00:02:12.799> team<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.220> mean<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:14.150> can<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.569> can<00:02:14.720> do<00:02:14.840> it

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
spread team I mean you can you can do it

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.449 
spread team I mean you can you can do it
in<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.079> lot<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.319> different<00:02:15.620> ways<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:15.799> find<00:02:16.370> it

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
in a lot of different ways I find it

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.619 
in a lot of different ways I find it
interesting<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.939> year<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.209> mean<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.569> think

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
interesting that year I mean I think

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.660 
interesting that year I mean I think
Glenn<00:02:17.989> Mason<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.409> think<00:02:18.590> power<00:02:18.799> run<00:02:19.220> game<00:02:19.250> and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
Glenn Mason I think power run game and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.740 
Glenn Mason I think power run game and
you're<00:02:19.760> telling<00:02:19.970> me<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.209> want<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.450> spread

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
you're telling me you want to spread

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.860 
you're telling me you want to spread
down<00:02:20.989> hey<00:02:21.439> it's<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.860> new<00:02:21.890> Glen<00:02:22.310> Mason<00:02:22.870> I'm

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
down hey it's the new Glen Mason I'm

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.039 
down hey it's the new Glen Mason I'm
trying<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.260> get<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.379> job<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:25.370> do<00:02:25.939> I<00:02:26.120> do<00:02:26.329> think<00:02:26.569> that

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
trying to get a job I do I do think that

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.530 
trying to get a job I do I do think that
we'll<00:02:27.200> watch<00:02:27.439> the<00:02:27.620> Florida<00:02:28.220> offense<00:02:28.670> evolve<00:02:29.269> I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
we'll watch the Florida offense evolve I

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.720 
we'll watch the Florida offense evolve I
think<00:02:29.840> that's<00:02:30.019> more<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.890> product<00:02:31.219> where

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
think that's more of a product where

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.270 
think that's more of a product where
Urban<00:02:32.180> Meyer<00:02:32.390> had<00:02:32.989> coach<00:02:33.290> before<00:02:33.500> boiling<00:02:34.189> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
Urban Meyer had coach before boiling the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.520 
Urban Meyer had coach before boiling the
Green<00:02:34.489> Valley<00:02:34.670> because<00:02:35.390> national<00:02:36.140> champion

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
Green Valley because national champion

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.289 
Green Valley because national champion
no<00:02:36.680> because<00:02:37.010> once<00:02:37.189> they<00:02:37.340> lose<00:02:37.549> Tim<00:02:37.879> Tebow<00:02:38.269> I

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
no because once they lose Tim Tebow I

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.000 
no because once they lose Tim Tebow I
don't<00:02:38.540> think<00:02:38.689> the<00:02:38.840> next<00:02:39.170> quarterback<00:02:39.680> will<00:02:39.890> be

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
don't think the next quarterback will be

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.949 
don't think the next quarterback will be
that<00:02:40.310> type<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.969> I<00:02:41.030> think<00:02:41.269> you'll<00:02:41.450> see<00:02:41.780> a

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
that type and I think you'll see a

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.500 
that type and I think you'll see a
change<00:02:42.469> you<00:02:42.680> will<00:02:42.769> not<00:02:42.920> see<00:02:43.340> an<00:02:43.549> offense<00:02:44.239> based

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
change you will not see an offense based

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.119 
change you will not see an offense based
on<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> running<00:02:45.110> quarterback<00:02:45.319> at<00:02:45.620> Florida<00:02:46.010> when

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
on a running quarterback at Florida when

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.380 
on a running quarterback at Florida when
Tim<00:02:46.310> Tebow<00:02:46.640> leaves<00:02:46.879> do<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.060> agree<00:02:47.180> with<00:02:47.360> that

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
Tim Tebow leaves do you agree with that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.089 
Tim Tebow leaves do you agree with that
that's<00:02:47.689> my<00:02:47.840> prediction<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.439> don't<00:02:48.620> agree<00:02:48.829> I

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
that's my prediction I don't agree I

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.330 
that's my prediction I don't agree I
think<00:02:49.879> that's<00:02:50.060> our<00:02:50.329> Meyers<00:02:51.079> offense<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.890> he's

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
think that's our Meyers offense and he's

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.039 
think that's our Meyers offense and he's
got<00:02:52.549> enough<00:02:52.819> attraction<00:02:53.450> he'll<00:02:53.599> get<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.840> guy

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
got enough attraction he'll get a guy

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.300 
got enough attraction he'll get a guy
that's<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.349> running<00:02:54.590> quarterback<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.189> you'll

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
that's a running quarterback and you'll

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.949 
that's a running quarterback and you'll
see<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.579> spread<00:02:55.849> I<00:02:56.090> don't<00:02:56.329> think<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:56.659> it'll<00:02:56.870> be

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
see the spread I don't think so it'll be

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:57.580 
see the spread I don't think so it'll be
interesting<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.349> see

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
interesting to see

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.289 
interesting to see
I<00:02:57.739> think<00:02:58.099> he'll<00:02:58.250> evolve<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.909> we'll<00:02:59.090> revisit

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
I think he'll evolve and we'll revisit

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.229 
I think he'll evolve and we'll revisit
this<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.680> loved<00:03:01.310> revisiting<00:03:01.849> when<00:03:01.939> I'm<00:03:02.060> right

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
this I loved revisiting when I'm right

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.709 
this I loved revisiting when I'm right
here<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.450> mean<00:03:02.689> we<00:03:02.810> we<00:03:03.200> really<00:03:03.469> should
