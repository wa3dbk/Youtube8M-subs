00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
much as we could and luckily the cows

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.240

set<00:00:29.869> up<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.199> let<00:00:30.320> him<00:00:30.439> kind<00:00:30.619> of<00:00:30.769> show<00:00:30.949> what<00:00:31.099> he

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
set up and let him kind of show what he

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.610 
set up and let him kind of show what he
can<00:00:31.369> do<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.419> it<00:00:32.599> worked<00:00:32.989> out<00:00:33.110> well<00:00:33.170> but

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
can do and so it worked out well but

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.020 
can do and so it worked out well but
made<00:00:33.920> more<00:00:34.190> than<00:00:34.309> anything<00:00:34.550> we<00:00:34.790> were<00:00:34.879> just

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
made more than anything we were just

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.020 
made more than anything we were just
trying<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.449> get<00:00:36.410> through<00:00:36.650> and<00:00:36.830> it<00:00:37.730> worked<00:00:37.910> out

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
trying to get through and it worked out

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.390 
trying to get through and it worked out
better<00:00:38.269> than<00:00:38.449> expected<00:00:38.980> what<00:00:39.980> is<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.190> source

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
better than expected what is the source

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.049 
better than expected what is the source
of<00:00:40.519> strong<00:00:40.760> point<00:00:41.000> um<00:00:42.100> he's<00:00:43.100> very<00:00:43.309> diverse<00:00:43.699> I

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
of strong point um he's very diverse I

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.660 
of strong point um he's very diverse I
think<00:00:44.510> would<00:00:44.690> be<00:00:44.870> his<00:00:45.739> strongest<00:00:46.070> point<00:00:46.489> is

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
think would be his strongest point is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.399 
think would be his strongest point is
that<00:00:46.850> pretty<00:00:47.180> much<00:00:47.330> every<00:00:47.600> situation<00:00:48.170> you<00:00:48.199> can

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
that pretty much every situation you can

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.520 
that pretty much every situation you can
put<00:00:48.589> them<00:00:48.710> in<00:00:48.979> he<00:00:49.549> can<00:00:49.729> handle<00:00:49.879> he<00:00:50.269> can<00:00:50.449> go<00:00:51.199> fast

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
put them in he can handle he can go fast

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.039 
put them in he can handle he can go fast
wall<00:00:51.799> to<00:00:51.949> wall<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.460> stop<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:53.180> he<00:00:53.449> can<00:00:53.629> do<00:00:53.809> all

far<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.800> that<00:01:46.920> goes<00:01:46.979> i<00:01:47.250> think<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.580> does<00:01:47.940> make<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
far as that goes i think it does make it

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.420 
far as that goes i think it does make it
nice<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.930> not<00:01:49.080> as<00:01:49.440> physically<00:01:50.190> hard

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
nice because it's not as physically hard

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.900 
nice because it's not as physically hard
on<00:01:50.610> him<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:50.910> it<00:01:51.060> could<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.490> now<00:01:53.490> those<00:01:53.700> nine

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
on him as it could be so now those nine

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.490 
on him as it could be so now those nine
