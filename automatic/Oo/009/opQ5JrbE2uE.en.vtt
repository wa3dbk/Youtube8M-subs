circuits and one thing I want to dispel

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.250 
circuits and one thing I want to dispel
right<00:00:44.820> away<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.329> metabolic<00:00:45.600> circuits

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
right away is these metabolic circuits

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.130 
right away is these metabolic circuits
are<00:00:46.410> amazing<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.579> burning<00:00:48.180> fat<00:00:48.210> while

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
are amazing for burning fat while

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.650 
are amazing for burning fat while
building<00:00:49.620> lean<00:00:50.070> muscle<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.910> depending<00:00:51.570> on

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
building lean muscle and depending on

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.639 
building lean muscle and depending on
some<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> exercises<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.469> do

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
some of the exercises that you do

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.459 
some of the exercises that you do
increase<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.399> strength<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.879> well<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.469> couple

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
increase your strength as well a couple

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.080 
increase your strength as well a couple
of<00:00:55.530> reasons<00:00:55.710> why<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.039> metabolic<00:00:56.520> circuit<00:00:57.000> in

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
of reasons why this metabolic circuit in

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.459 
of reasons why this metabolic circuit in
particular<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.840> great<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
particular is great for that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.270 
particular is great for that
number<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.420> it<00:01:00.420> builds<00:01:00.930> muscle<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.590> muscle

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
number one it builds muscle and muscle

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
number one it builds muscle and muscle
is<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> most<00:01:02.879> metabolic<00:01:03.300> tissue<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.409> body

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
is the most metabolic tissue in the body

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.649 
is the most metabolic tissue in the body
the<00:01:04.890> more<00:01:05.040> muscle<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.150> higher<00:01:06.630> your

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the more muscle you have the higher your

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.270 
the more muscle you have the higher your
metabolism<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:08.130> it's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
metabolism is going to be when it's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.609 
metabolism is going to be when it's
resting<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.880> rmr<00:01:09.540> resting<00:01:10.020> metabolic<00:01:10.170> rate

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
resting your rmr resting metabolic rate

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
resting your rmr resting metabolic rate
you<00:01:11.159> always<00:01:11.460> want<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.790> rate<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.450> behind<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you always want that rate to behind the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.130 
you always want that rate to behind the
more<00:01:13.530> muscle<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.970> higher<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
more muscle you have the higher that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.690 
more muscle you have the higher that
rate<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.430> fat<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
rate is going to be so the more fat you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.160 
rate is going to be so the more fat you
learning<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> more<00:01:18.509> calories<00:01:18.930> you'll<00:01:19.049> be

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
learning the more calories you'll be

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.440 
learning the more calories you'll be
burning<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.280> rest<00:01:20.549> okay<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
burning when you're at rest okay so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.270 
burning when you're at rest okay so
because<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.080> use<00:01:22.200> compound<00:01:22.710> movements

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
because we use compound movements

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.310 
because we use compound movements
movements<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.970> use<00:01:24.119> multiple<00:01:24.360> muscles<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
movements that use multiple muscles and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.410 
movements that use multiple muscles and
multiple<00:01:25.680> joints<00:01:26.009> you're<00:01:26.340> building<00:01:27.060> muscle<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
multiple joints you're building muscle a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.880 
multiple joints you're building muscle a
lot<00:01:27.570> quicker<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.110> increasing<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.740> strength

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
lot quicker and increasing your strength

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.640 
lot quicker and increasing your strength
so<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.939> key<00:01:30.240> another<00:01:30.960> thing<00:01:31.229> about<00:01:31.350> this

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so that's key another thing about this

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.679 
so that's key another thing about this
workout<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.220> key<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> human<00:01:33.360> growth

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
workout that's key is human growth

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.380 
workout that's key is human growth
hormone<00:01:34.350> yes<00:01:34.710> using<00:01:35.670> these<00:01:35.759> metabolic

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hormone yes using these metabolic

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.569 
hormone yes using these metabolic
training<00:01:36.720> circuits<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.500> happens<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.159> you're

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
training circuits what happens is you're

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.880 
training circuits what happens is you're
doing<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.360> lot<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.689> work<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.200> small<00:01:40.500> period<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
doing a lot of work in a small period of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.219 
doing a lot of work in a small period of
time<00:01:40.950> we're<00:01:41.700> producing<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.479> lot<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.630> power<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
time we're producing a lot of power in a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.990 
time we're producing a lot of power in a
small<00:01:43.350> period<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.799> time<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.790> does

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
small period of time and what that does

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.810 
small period of time and what that does
is<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.560> produces<00:01:46.560> HGH<00:01:47.280> or<00:01:47.490> human<00:01:47.790> growth

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
is that produces HGH or human growth

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
is that produces HGH or human growth
hormone<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> body<00:01:48.899> which<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.530> amazing

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
hormone for the body which is amazing

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
hormone for the body which is amazing
because<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.790> HGH<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.200> more

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
because the more HGH you have the more

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
because the more HGH you have the more
fat<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.770> burn<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.610> course<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.390> more

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
fat you burn and of course the more

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.090 
fat you burn and of course the more
muscle<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> build<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> more
