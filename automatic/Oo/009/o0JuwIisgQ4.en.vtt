00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
look at his muscles I either think that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.590 
look at his muscles I either think that
he's<00:00:53.160> gotten<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.520> extreme<00:00:54.000> amount<00:00:54.239> more<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.990 
he's gotten an extreme amount more of
defense<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.199> he's<00:00:55.320> become<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.739> bulky<00:00:56.190> maybe

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
defense so he's become more bulky maybe

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.250 
defense so he's become more bulky maybe
he'll<00:00:57.180> move<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.600> tier<00:00:57.809> or<00:00:57.840> something<00:00:58.199> like

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
he'll move up a tier or something like

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.799 
he'll move up a tier or something like
that<00:00:58.320> or<00:00:58.680> his<00:00:59.399> defense<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.210> has<00:01:00.449> switched

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that or his defense that has switched

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.510 
that or his defense that has switched
over<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.140> his<00:01:01.320> attacks<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> I'm<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.280> sure

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
over to his attacks that I'm not sure

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.450 
over to his attacks that I'm not sure

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the bottom there that looks like I guess

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310

how<00:01:23.220> they're<00:01:23.400> gonna<00:01:23.460> represent<00:01:23.720> other<00:01:24.720> grunts

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
how they're gonna represent other grunts

how they're gonna represent other grunts
admins<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.850> those

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
admins and all that as you can see those

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.030 
admins and all that as you can see those
are<00:01:27.450> she<00:01:27.780> looks<00:01:27.990> completely<00:01:28.439> different<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
are she looks completely different and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.870 
are she looks completely different and
so<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:30.470> Maxie<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.189> don't<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.759> they're

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
so this Maxie so I don't know if they're

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.429 
so this Maxie so I don't know if they're
gonna<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.150> new<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.450> something<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
gonna be new or something like that I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.499 
gonna be new or something like that I
really<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.549> no<00:01:35.700> clue<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.360> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
really have no clue and then also you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.679 
really have no clue and then also you
can<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.290> acro<00:01:38.130> bike<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.000> Mach<00:01:39.360> bike

so<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> guess<00:01:40.470> those<00:01:40.650> are<00:01:40.680> coming<00:01:40.950> back<00:01:41.189> because

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so I guess those are coming back because

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.969 
so I guess those are coming back because
we<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.270> two<00:01:42.780> bucks<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.200> screen<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.619> can

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
we see two bucks on the screen you can

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
we see two bucks on the screen you can
see<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.250> some<00:01:44.640> new<00:01:44.850> gameplay<00:01:45.270> elements<00:01:45.689> are

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
see that some new gameplay elements are

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.670 
see that some new gameplay elements are
also<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.290> screen<00:01:46.560> right<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:47.299> you<00:01:48.299> could<00:01:48.420> see

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
also on screen right now you could see

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.050 
also on screen right now you could see
Steven<00:01:49.680> talking<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> main<00:01:50.490> character<00:01:50.970> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
Steven talking to the main character you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.889 
Steven talking to the main character you
could<00:01:51.180> also<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.560> starter<00:01:53.509> choosing<00:01:54.509> area

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
could also see the starter choosing area

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.350 
could also see the starter choosing area
so<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.649> totally<00:01:56.369> remade<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> lot<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.180> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
so they totally remade a lot of it and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.870 
so they totally remade a lot of it and
it<00:01:57.420> looks<00:01:57.630> amazing<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.619> looks<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.040> good<00:01:59.070> it

it looks amazing it looks so good it
looks<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.270> good<00:02:00.299> actually<00:02:00.689> cannot<00:02:01.140> wait<00:02:01.560> for

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
looks so good actually cannot wait for

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.160 
looks so good actually cannot wait for
this<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> next<00:02:02.850> picture<00:02:03.060> over<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.630> is

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
this so the next picture over here is

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.469 
this so the next picture over here is
quite<00:02:04.500> intriguing<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.310> me<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:06.000> looks<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
quite intriguing to me this looks like a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.389 
quite intriguing to me this looks like a
mega<00:02:06.719> evolution<00:02:07.500> type<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.799> thing<00:02:07.979> I'm<00:02:08.190> not

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
mega evolution type of thing I'm not

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.240 
mega evolution type of thing I'm not
sure<00:02:08.789> at<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.270> moment<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.929> it

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
sure at the moment but it

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.070 
sure at the moment but it
looks<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.490> Kyogre<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.150> groudon<00:02:11.630> can<00:02:11.870> mega

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
looks like Kyogre and groudon can mega

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.970 
looks like Kyogre and groudon can mega
evolve<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.710> it<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:12.920> confirmed<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
evolve and it is confirmed that the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.530 
evolve and it is confirmed that the
Kyogre<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.100> ground<00:02:16.280> on<00:02:16.400> unscrew<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.330> box

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
Kyogre and ground on unscrew on the box

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.910 
Kyogre and ground on unscrew on the box
arts<00:02:17.900> are<00:02:18.020> actually<00:02:18.350> different<00:02:18.530> from<00:02:18.800> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
arts are actually different from the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.860 
arts are actually different from the
actual<00:02:19.070> Kyogre<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.700> draw<00:02:19.880> down<00:02:20.090> as<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.780> can

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
actual Kyogre and draw down as you can

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.560 
actual Kyogre and draw down as you can
see<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.010> guess<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:22.910> looks<00:02:23.210> it<00:02:23.390> just

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
see and I I guess it just looks it just

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.020 
see and I I guess it just looks it just
looks<00:02:23.750> absolutely<00:02:24.170> amazing<00:02:24.770> on<00:02:25.280> top<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.760> that

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030

looks absolutely amazing on top of that
on<00:02:26.240> top<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:26.660> bat<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.620> mega<00:02:27.860> pictures

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
on top of that bat to the mega pictures

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.910 
on top of that bat to the mega pictures
you<00:02:29.300> can<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.930> Megas<00:02:30.290> actually<00:02:30.800> do

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920
