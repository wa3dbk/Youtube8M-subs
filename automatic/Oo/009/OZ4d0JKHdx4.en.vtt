00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
part of the power flex range then what

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.380 
part of the power flex range then what
is<00:01:16.770> our<00:01:16.890> fiberglass<00:01:17.400> poles<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.150> very

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
is our fiberglass poles which are very

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.300 
is our fiberglass poles which are very

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
strong but also very flexible so it's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.620 
strong but also very flexible so it's
very<00:01:20.490> easy<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.670> set<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.299> bend<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
very easy to set it up and bend the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.850 
very easy to set it up and bend the
poles<00:01:21.840> into<00:01:22.049> position<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.590> need<00:01:22.740> them

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
poles into position that you need them

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.370 
poles into position that you need them
in<00:01:23.009> what<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.670> setup<00:01:23.939> they're<00:01:24.479> very<00:01:24.750> strong<00:01:25.110> so

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
in what is setup they're very strong so

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.570 
in what is setup they're very strong so
obviously<00:01:25.590> adverse<00:01:25.890> weather<00:01:26.070> conditions<00:01:26.490> are
