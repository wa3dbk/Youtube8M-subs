 as you see, it does not take long for 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.740
 cooking is preferable to remove the 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.080
 skin that is quite hard and itchy 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.200

 we mix well and before serving it is 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.960
 that we're going to Libya but then we're going 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.850
 to prepare our vinaigrette that we are going to 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.170

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.170
 One lemon's juice

 we add salt even if you remember 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.600
 We already lost the salad in 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.120
 salt we put a little pepper 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.430
 black freshly ground and I'm going to put my 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.890
 oil to emulsify little by little 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.690
 extra virgin olive oil I'm going 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.700
 putting little by little it has already thickening 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.250
 is vinaigrette because it is evolving 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.590
 my oil before serving the seasoning 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.070
 is salads because they were fresh rich 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.720
 especially to accompany both meats 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.850

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.330
 centimeter as you see is to say peeled that 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.220
 it's easier to cook we put our 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.990

 we move them well we put a twig 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.990
 of cinnamon and in turn a teaspoon of 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.480

 a species called old spice that 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.200
 they sell it also in the markets that is 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.390
 a combination of spices that gives a 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.660
 rich taste to all the sweets we 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.550
