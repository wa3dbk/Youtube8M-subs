and this solar system belongs to them
because<00:03:17.959> they<00:03:18.080> were<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.260> first<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.620> chart<00:03:18.890> it

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
because they were the first to chart it

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.260 
because they were the first to chart it
they<00:03:20.690> also<00:03:20.870> believe<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.880> because<00:03:22.880> they<00:03:23.180> were

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
they also believe that because they were

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.170 
they also believe that because they were
the<00:03:23.360> first<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.750> chart<00:03:24.080> our<00:03:24.950> planet<00:03:25.550> that<00:03:26.060> they

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
the first to chart our planet that they

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.760 
the first to chart our planet that they
owned<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.510> planet<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:26.989> everything<00:03:27.380> else<00:03:27.530> on

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
owned the planet that everything else on

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.640 
owned the planet that everything else on
it<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:30.290> right<00:03:30.530> now<00:03:30.709> is<00:03:30.890> us<00:03:32.320> underneath<00:03:33.320> them

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
it but right now is us underneath them

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.289 
it but right now is us underneath them
is<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.489> Orion's<00:03:36.700> they<00:03:37.700> did<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.030> dirty<00:03:38.180> work

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
is the Orion's they did the dirty work

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.170 
is the Orion's they did the dirty work
for<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.720> Drax<00:03:38.989> there<00:03:39.830> is<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.220> hierarchy<00:03:40.519> just

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
for the Drax there is a hierarchy just

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.570 
for the Drax there is a hierarchy just
like<00:03:41.810> in<00:03:42.019> any<00:03:42.290> government<00:03:42.650> there's<00:03:43.489> a

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
like in any government there's a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.240 
like in any government there's a
hierarchy<00:03:44.170> even<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.260> dark<00:03:45.530> forces<00:03:45.920> are

hierarchy even the dark forces are

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.729 
hierarchy even the dark forces are
organized<00:03:46.820> in<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.269> hierarchy<00:03:47.840> in<00:03:48.620> a

organized in a hierarchy in a
hierarchical<00:03:49.190> government<00:03:49.989> underneath<00:03:50.989> that

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
hierarchical government underneath that

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.870 
hierarchical government underneath that
one<00:03:51.410> many<00:03:51.650> different<00:03:52.070> groups<00:03:52.220> but<00:03:52.549> we'll<00:03:52.700> deal

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
one many different groups but we'll deal

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.970
