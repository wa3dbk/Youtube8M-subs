00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
choices the 2t 30s I think are very

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530

planning<00:01:21.799> should<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.950> interesting<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.549> mean

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
planning should be interesting I mean

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.520 
planning should be interesting I mean
you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.090> pretty<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:24.360> assume<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> 50

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you can pretty much assume that the 50

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.100 
you can pretty much assume that the 50
dash<00:01:25.680> 2<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> 54<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:27.030> gonna<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.659> lighting

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110

anything that's coming up the East they

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
anything that's coming up the East they
might<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.689> able<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> adjust<00:01:31.350> something<00:01:31.590> after

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.940 
holding but hard to tell what they're
planning<00:02:13.590> now

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
planning now

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.160 
planning now
pretty<00:02:14.250> spread<00:02:14.489> out<00:02:14.840> yeah<00:02:15.840> I'm<00:02:15.959> very

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
pretty spread out yeah I'm very

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.570 
pretty spread out yeah I'm very
surprised<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.800> there's<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.129> many<00:02:17.220> tanks

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
surprised that there's so many tanks

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.640 
surprised that there's so many tanks
across<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.209> entire<00:02:18.480> map<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:19.050> kind<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.560> would

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
across the entire map I kind of would

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.800 
across the entire map I kind of would
have<00:02:19.739> figured<00:02:19.890> most<00:02:20.459> tanks<00:02:20.790> would<00:02:20.970> be<00:02:21.150> focused

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
have figured most tanks would be focused

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.650 
have figured most tanks would be focused
in<00:02:21.959> certain<00:02:22.260> areas<00:02:22.349> here<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:24.390> know<00:02:24.480> see

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
in certain areas here you know see

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.900 
in certain areas here you know see
either<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> West<00:02:25.200> Side<00:02:25.260> or<00:02:25.530> any<00:02:25.800> side<00:02:26.010> push<00:02:28.910> tips

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
either a West Side or any side push tips

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.850 
either a West Side or any side push tips
ago<00:02:30.090> with<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.480> few<00:02:30.660> tanks<00:02:30.989> in<00:02:31.230> general<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:31.769> a

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
ago with so few tanks in general it's a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.040 
ago with so few tanks in general it's a
good<00:02:32.010> idea<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.310> focus<00:02:32.700> your<00:02:32.819> tanks<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:36.050> there

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
good idea to focus your tanks but there

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.990 
good idea to focus your tanks but there
are<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> lot<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.560> sight<00:02:37.890> angles<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.489> abuse<00:02:38.849> on

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
are a lot of sight angles to abuse on

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.240 
are a lot of sight angles to abuse on
this<00:02:39.120> map<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.930> perhaps<00:02:40.440> they're<00:02:40.769> positioned

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
this map so perhaps they're positioned

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:49.070 
this map so perhaps they're positioned
creatively<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:41.880> purpose

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.580 

I<00:02:50.360> always<00:02:51.360> seem<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.690> doing<00:02:51.810> pretty<00:02:51.930> good

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
I always seem to be doing pretty good

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.870 
I always seem to be doing pretty good
holding<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> city<00:02:53.280> there<00:02:53.490> although<00:02:53.670> that

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
holding the city there although that

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.020 
holding the city there although that
mosinee<00:02:54.330> 100<00:02:54.720> getting<00:02:54.900> some<00:02:55.050> good<00:02:55.200> hits<00:02:55.380> I

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
mosinee 100 getting some good hits I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.370 
mosinee 100 getting some good hits I
wonder<00:02:57.030> where<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.180> tonight's<00:02:57.660> use<00:02:57.870> position

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
wonder where that tonight's use position

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.290 
wonder where that tonight's use position
not<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.830> was<00:02:59.070> kind<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.580> thinking<00:02:59.670> around<00:03:00.090> like

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
not I was kind of thinking around like

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.540 
not I was kind of thinking around like
the<00:03:00.420> 89<00:03:00.810> with<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.950> angles<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.370> he<00:03:02.460> was

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
the 89 with the angles that he was

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.450 
the 89 with the angles that he was
firing<00:03:02.790> out<00:03:03.000> there<00:03:03.590> I'm<00:03:04.590> pretty<00:03:04.860> sure<00:03:05.040> he<00:03:05.280> is

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
firing out there I'm pretty sure he is

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.370 
firing out there I'm pretty sure he is
tucked<00:03:05.910> up<00:03:06.060> there<00:03:06.210> in<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.390> zero<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.960> saw<00:03:07.200> him<00:03:07.350> a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
tucked up there in a zero I saw him a

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.700 
tucked up there in a zero I saw him a
second<00:03:07.620> ago<00:03:07.680> hit<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.310> e100<00:03:09.300> all<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.440> way<00:03:10.530> over

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
second ago hit the e100 all the way over

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.340 
second ago hit the e100 all the way over
there<00:03:10.740> at<00:03:10.950> f3<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.690> other<00:03:12.900> even<00:03:13.170> under

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
there at f3 that the other even under

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.460 
there at f3 that the other even under
just<00:03:13.530> killed<00:03:14.300> you<00:03:15.300> know<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.420> saw<00:03:15.600> about<00:03:15.810> 800-900

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
just killed you know I saw about 800-900

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.990 
just killed you know I saw about 800-900
damage<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.040> good<00:03:17.250> odds<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.790> was<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
damage so good odds that that was the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:30.690 
damage so good odds that that was the
t90<00:03:18.330> to

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.960 

a<00:03:30.849> lot<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.810> good<00:03:31.840> brawling<00:03:32.830> here<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.430> right

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
a lot of good brawling here but right

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.270 
a lot of good brawling here but right
now<00:03:34.270> it's<00:03:34.510> not<00:03:34.599> looking<00:03:34.720> too<00:03:35.019> good<00:03:35.110> for<00:03:35.290> Team

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
now it's not looking too good for Team

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.930 
now it's not looking too good for Team

he's<00:04:21.130> actually<00:04:21.280> an<00:04:21.519> a4<00:04:21.910> I<00:04:23.370> wonder<00:04:24.370> if<00:04:24.460> that's

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
he's actually an a4 I wonder if that's

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.219 
he's actually an a4 I wonder if that's
an<00:04:24.700> adjustment<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.270> recently<00:04:25.600> happened<00:04:25.660> or

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
an adjustment that recently happened or

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.740 
an adjustment that recently happened or
uh<00:04:26.260> maybe<00:04:26.770> he<00:04:27.700> was<00:04:27.820> trying<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.120> swing<00:04:28.330> West<00:04:28.570> to

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
uh maybe he was trying to swing West to

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.909 
uh maybe he was trying to swing West to
dig<00:04:28.930> out<00:04:29.050> those<00:04:29.440> tanks<00:04:29.740> behind<00:04:29.860> there<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.250> g8

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
dig out those tanks behind there a g8

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.020 
dig out those tanks behind there a g8
either<00:04:32.919> way<00:04:33.010> he<00:04:33.160> was<00:04:33.250> making<00:04:33.490> some<00:04:33.550> good<00:04:33.790> shots

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
either way he was making some good shots

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.320 
either way he was making some good shots

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.700 

lot<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.120> people<00:04:43.300> scoff<00:04:43.539> at<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:43.720> t<00:04:43.960> 1-10<00:04:44.320> but

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
lot of people scoff at that t 1-10 but

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.629 
lot of people scoff at that t 1-10 but
it<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.850> great<00:04:46.330> tank<00:04:46.979> faster<00:04:47.979> fire<00:04:48.190> rate<00:04:48.490> and

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
it is a great tank faster fire rate and

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.730 
it is a great tank faster fire rate and
if<00:04:48.700> you're<00:04:48.850> using<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.180> e100<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.780> mean<00:04:50.289> you<00:04:50.500> got

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
if you're using the e100 I mean you got

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.969 
if you're using the e100 I mean you got
15<00:04:51.190> or<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:51.520> seconds<00:04:51.880> between<00:04:52.060> shots<00:04:52.479> so<00:04:52.979> you

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
15 or so seconds between shots so you

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.379 
15 or so seconds between shots so you
cannot<00:04:54.370> afford<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.760> miss<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.060> all<00:04:55.180> or<00:04:55.360> that

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
cannot afford to miss it all or that

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.790 
cannot afford to miss it all or that
t110<00:04:55.990> will<00:04:56.289> kill<00:04:56.680> you<00:04:56.860> guaranteed<00:04:57.550> yep<00:04:58.800> or

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
t110 will kill you guaranteed yep or

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.500 
t110 will kill you guaranteed yep or
