00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
it is ultimately portable so if you ever

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.580 
it is ultimately portable so if you ever

indeed they share a lot of similarities
so<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.350> hot<00:03:44.530> tub<00:03:44.770> shell<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.430> swimmers<00:03:45.730> fire

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
so the hot tub shell the swimmers fire

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.610 
so the hot tub shell the swimmers fire
shell<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.360> ultimately<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.870> rather<00:03:47.020> large<00:03:47.350> hot
