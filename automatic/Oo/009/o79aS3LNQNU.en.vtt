00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.640
 the purpose of his new tax so of 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.900
 simplify the depth for the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.860
 consumer sees something on 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.210
 was going towards a fall something 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.680
 more serious yeah yeah actually because 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.659
 if you want to actually team up a wine 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.280
 white and between acidity legras media 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.789
 do something you after that be 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.210
 you take 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.949
 what is your budget about 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.870
 Languedoc castle relief on peak 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.949
 saint loup including a white wolf peak 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.840
 but there is no alternative to are 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.489
 broken by color at first 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 so the reds on one side the whites of 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.360
 the other his keys rosé and by character 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 no the red you have the light the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.560
 fries and spices and powerful ones at 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.729
 within these characters as if 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.039
 take the spices and the wines are 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.440
 sorted by price to know that I write it 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.050
 my life nor the prices go about 2.4 to 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.000
 about thirty euros the goal 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.070
 really being going to work on 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.500
 the selection a selection that is going to be 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.509
 reduced compared to a wine shop 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.270
 traditional we will really go 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.350
 look for small nuggets of 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.610
 winemakers and to simplify the choice 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.500
 to consumers 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.270
 the one to whom my life or the majority of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.210
 wines come from independent winemaker 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.409
 of wine from owners 90% of the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.460
 selection with which we work 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.810
 are bio organic wines dynamie and nature 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.189
 we have developed small 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.130
 explanatory sheets for each of our 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.630
 cuvées because a vintage is first 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.189
 the work of a winemaker behind so 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.259
 a word about the history of the winemaker 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.469
 finally a word about the tank itself 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.740
 which describes the nose and mouth and for 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.700
 finish wine pairings 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.649
 but we are here above all for 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.239
 answer all questions from 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.679
 customers we are addressing so that 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.840
 for a fish I think it can 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.700
 to be not bad c and then you 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.230
 listen I trust you and 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.819
 nice so I do inhabitants of the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.450
 neighborhood game to the page that knows 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.790
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.030
 in vain and since I come here I have 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.230
 got used every weekend when 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.569
 I invite friends or when I 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.720
 moves I 'm welcome to come 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.069
 ask aarau and françois-xavier to 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.269
 advise me to advise me on 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.080
 20 that could correspond to what we could 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.599
 see what we are going to eat 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.630
 especially since they have an approach 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.560
 which is rather rather very playful of the 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.360
 wine we can see it from elsewhere 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.500
 in the different in the different 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.580
 themes that are addressed because when 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.860
 we arrive and we do not know 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.000
 absolutely nothing ben we tend to 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.319
 ask questions is what I'm going 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.519
 rather prefer something light 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.120
 something a little more full-bodied 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.680
 so here I find that this trade 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.620
 for both connoisseurs 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.870
 who will find 24ths also at 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.329

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.160

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.239

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.049
 different whose prices vary from 26 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.340
