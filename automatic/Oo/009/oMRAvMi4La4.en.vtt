control the direction of the mirror goes

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.389 
control the direction of the mirror goes
in<00:00:38.199> now<00:00:38.410> you'll<00:00:38.530> need<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:38.770> ignition<00:00:39.129> switched

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
in now you'll need the ignition switched

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.900 
in now you'll need the ignition switched
on<00:00:39.579> to<00:00:39.610> use<00:00:39.850> this<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:41.410> you<00:00:41.470> can<00:00:41.649> see<00:00:41.910> I'll

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
on to use this but you can see I'll

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.080 
on to use this but you can see I'll
learn<00:00:43.180> I'm<00:00:43.360> moving<00:00:43.660> it<00:00:43.720> around<00:00:43.810> there<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
learn I'm moving it around there and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.380 
learn I'm moving it around there and
down<00:00:46.600> right<00:00:47.140> back<00:00:48.130> to<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.340> left<00:00:48.520> what<00:00:49.090> I<00:00:49.120> tend

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
down right back to the left what I tend

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.670 
down right back to the left what I tend
to<00:00:49.420> get<00:00:49.540> people<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:49.960> do<00:00:50.079> is<00:00:50.200> just<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.500> be<00:00:50.620> able

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
to get people to do is just to be able

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.470 
to get people to do is just to be able
to<00:00:50.829> see<00:00:51.010> a<00:00:51.040> little<00:00:51.250> bit<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.640> car<00:00:51.880> on<00:00:52.420> the

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
to see a little bit of the car on the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.950 
to see a little bit of the car on the
inside<00:00:52.719> of<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.079> mirror<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:55.510> you<00:00:55.750> used

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
inside of the mirror and then you used

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.690 
inside of the mirror and then you used
to<00:00:56.079> have<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.290> little<00:00:56.350> bit<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:56.950> door<00:00:57.280> handle

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
to have that little bit of door handle

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.459 
to have that little bit of door handle
in<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:57.880> bottom<00:00:58.270> corner<00:00:58.780> just<00:00:59.050> there<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.379> think

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
in the bottom corner just there I think

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.610 
in the bottom corner just there I think
that's<00:00:59.739> about<00:00:59.860> right<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.930> then<00:01:02.260> we<00:01:02.350> come<00:01:02.440> over

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
that's about right so then we come over

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.899 
that's about right so then we come over
to<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.800> other<00:01:02.950> side<00:01:03.129> and<00:01:05.039> same<00:01:06.039> thing<00:01:06.070> that's

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
to the other side and same thing that's

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.060 
to the other side and same thing that's
just<00:01:07.240> simply<00:01:07.479> from<00:01:07.750> rotating<00:01:08.530> that<00:01:08.710> let's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
just simply from rotating that let's

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.440 
just simply from rotating that let's
switch<00:01:09.219> back<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.610> left<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.030> get<00:01:10.180> control

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
switch back to the left you get control

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.050 
switch back to the left you get control
of<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.750> left<00:01:10.930> mirror<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.580> then<00:01:12.670> move<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.000> up

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
of the left mirror and then move it up

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.399 
of the left mirror and then move it up
and<00:01:13.240> down<00:01:13.299> left<00:01:13.510> and<00:01:13.659> right<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:13.900> just<00:01:14.290> the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
and down left and right and just the

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.100

viewing<00:01:34.119> straight<00:01:34.450> out<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.780> back<00:01:35.189> now<00:01:36.189> it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
viewing straight out the back now it

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.410 
viewing straight out the back now it
should<00:01:36.430> be<00:01:36.520> pretty<00:01:36.670> obvious<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.420> very

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
should be pretty obvious so very

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.160 
should be pretty obvious so very
flexible<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:46.780> we<00:01:46.900> go

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
flexible there we go

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.810 
flexible there we go
underneath<00:01:47.439> there's<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.799> little<00:01:48.040> switch<00:01:48.280> that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
underneath there's a little switch that

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.880

you<00:01:48.909> can<00:01:49.090> rotate<00:01:49.509> left<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.140> right<00:01:50.350> at

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
you can rotate left and right at

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.170 
you can rotate left and right at
nighttime<00:01:51.130> that's<00:01:51.490> like<00:01:51.700> putting<00:01:51.970> sunglasses

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
nighttime that's like putting sunglasses

view quite a bit okay

00:01:59.079 --> 00:01:59.830 
view quite a bit okay
that's<00:01:59.320> the
