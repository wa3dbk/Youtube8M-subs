00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello so in this tutorial I'm going 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.019
 show you how to use a keyboard 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.460
 like these a qwerty keyboard with a 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.019
 application will be able to use this 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.269
 keyboard there in French ie with 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.110
 the accents and or so it's very 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.539
 simple in the background what to do 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.220
 it's going to be fun and then 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.910
 go download the app that 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.910

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.640
 is no longer question that costs 2 out 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.529
 42.6 I'm not deceiving about 50 dollars 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.699
 so it's important to take the 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.310

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.480
