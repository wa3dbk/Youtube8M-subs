00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.820
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.220
 online bonsai school video today 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.450
 I want to tell you something that always happens 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.939
 and I think I 've never commented on 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.520
 first rains we usually do not 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.100
 as with backers gonzalista mountaineers 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.630
 If we are we are very happy when 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.410
 comes the first warm especially the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.260
 that we are from rainfed areas here I 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.960
 in winter and little we have 300 days of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.570
 sun a year then we need that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.430
 rain and especially the ones that we like 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 the tropical circuses for example 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.120
 like this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.160
 what happens the first rain always 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 they drag everything that is suspended in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.909
 the allergic air we do not notice much 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.159
 because it seems that you breathe better and that 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.509
 everything is cleaner those times that 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.420
 first rain that swims in cars 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.009
 totally muddy attitude that 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.049
 rain guards good because that's what 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.220
 what happened yesterday yesterday I was watching was 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.409
 yesterday on August 30 and here is not normal 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.270
 it rained it rained and evidently came down 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.090
 all the pollution all the dirt all 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.159
 the dust that was in the air and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.450
 that puts the leaves of the plants 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.179
 fatal fatal not bad for your health but 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.289
 that dirt makes for example the plates 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.750
 solar I have plates there or the 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.310
 answer and the solar panels now with 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.229
 the society the fall are totally 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.299
 obviously the cells are not covered 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.280
 they capture the amount of sun they should 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.799
 because he 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.600
 the dirt that sand that forms 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.010
 above it prevents the rays from inciting 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 about those cells because here it happens 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.570
 exactly the same we this is not 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.759
 bad for the health of the tree because no 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.060
 is a polluting agent in most 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.070
 of the cases other times yes but we 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.840
 cover the sheet our word does not leave us 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.420
 that the tree breathes well the tree 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.009
 breathe for its leaves the tree makes the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.110
 photosynthesis receives the sun by the leaves 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.520
 and if you have them totally dirty and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.180
 covered as the tree will not work 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.920
 just like we have to clean 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.719
 the easiest way to clean the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.370
 dirt this is just sand look at this 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.010
 it's just sand is just mud does not have 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.810
 more important and I say it 's nothing 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.030
 it is not a chemical or anything that goes to 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.030
 kill the plant but it's a nursery 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.950
 You see have the sheet so we do the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.500
 photosynthesis the ideal is that our 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.780
 look like that simply with a 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.819
 little bit of water you see how it is 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.650
 this well this is important is super 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.840
 important in this way the sheet 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.459
 will breathe well in this case is going to 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.980
 moisturize well will do photosynthesis 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.590
 well and it will work perfectly that 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.090
 is what this has to happen like what 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.470
 so obviously I now 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.880
 himself lift just passed his finger like this 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.880
 with a little water to the wet fingers 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.390
 and we can water it we can give it a 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.069
 good foliar watering, especially for 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.080
 his folios with that about things 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.450
 we can do a good irrigation or a 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.780
 good foliar irrigation to remove all 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.910
 this dirt and clean 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.069
 the sheet but it is important that our 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.220
 water does not have lime because if it has which 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.600
 let's stain the leaf practically goes 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.800
 to be worse the remedy the disease that 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.319
 so it suits us to leave the dirty ones 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.910
 that with lime because lime clogs the 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.330
 pores this simply a dirt that 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.330
 falls over 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.909
 it is important that it be a water with 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.859
 weak mineralization or with little lime or 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.390
 with little dissolved salts if it can be 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.209
 water the mods and much better water 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.010
 distilled or bottled water or something else 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.180
 what I did when I was a kid that 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.819
 my mother said it when I had my 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.420
 the first ficus was that I was picking a cotton 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.849
 cited oil cooking oil with oil 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.000
 olive oil sunflower oil and with 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.069
 that cleaned the leaves of my ficus for 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.049
 to breathe well and to use the 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.700
 photosynthesis and well and be perfect 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.829
 I'm going to do right now to make a 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.379
 foliar irrigation to all and in that way I 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.349
 I will remove most of the problem 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.579
 Whoever wants to can do it like that whoever 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.709
 a little more sybarite have more time 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.650
 free or have trees as inches 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.560
 you can or the sheets one by one and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.959
 cleaning the go by removing all the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.729
 dirt to leave the tree impeccable for 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.949
 keep breathing well and doing well 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.949
 photosynthesis a little boy 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.270
 I always say do not do the folk river 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.630
 and plunder in thanks missing but in this 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.910
 case is not necessary is imperative 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.460
 it is already here has achieved much 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.350
 reed everyone and tomorrow I will teach you 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.390
 how to make an irrigation system 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.100
 irrigation boat and hose that is a lot 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.950
 faster than the shower the 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.830
 traditional extra string gift to me 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.090
 it makes me lose a lot of time 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.650
 then I will show you how to assemble a 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.680
 super easy irrigation balance system 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.870
 I always give truth in taichung by 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.100
 we had it from the airplane faucets do 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.510
 and faucets hooked the hose 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.340
 contrast of irrigated water all but 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.390
 here you can not water even with the water of 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.560
 networks because there is not even with the water of 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.560
 well because it's really bad 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.850
 ah 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.520
 then tomorrow I will teach how to do 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.320
 irrigation system watering plant 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.320
 to make sure there are many people who 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.060
 it saves a lot of time and even if 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.160
 we have you can also drag and now 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.289
 is if you liked this video I say 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.240
 I never recommend doing river for 10 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.530
 foliares not beings people do not 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.120
 I recommend never doing foliar risks 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.889
 except in these cases that it is necessary 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.479
 that you liked the video you can 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.860
 Subscribe to be here a little 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:51.410
 subscribe you can follow the networks

 ah 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.320
 ah 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.820
 when they see the workers a hug 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.820
 and even others and mobiles
