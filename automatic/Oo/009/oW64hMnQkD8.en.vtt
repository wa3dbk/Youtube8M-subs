into<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> holes<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> vent<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.509> pop

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
into one of the holes in the vent to pop

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.109 
into one of the holes in the vent to pop
out<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.140> vent<00:01:49.350> because<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.399> first<00:01:50.729> time<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
out the vent because the first time it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149 
out the vent because the first time it
will<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.570> stuck<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.619> you're<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
will be stuck then you're just going to

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.100 
will be stuck then you're just going to
want<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> roll<00:01:53.610> out<00:01:53.640> deep<00:01:54.030> plastic<00:01:54.479> tabs<00:01:54.720> under

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
want to roll out deep plastic tabs under

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.350 
want to roll out deep plastic tabs under
each<00:01:55.350> memory<00:01:55.710> module<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.250> simply<00:01:57.030> pull<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
each memory module and simply pull to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.139 
each memory module and simply pull to
pop<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> modules<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.189> here<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.880> two

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
pop out the modules so here are the two

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.359 
pop out the modules so here are the two
gigabyte<00:02:00.659> modules<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.439> have<00:02:01.500> been

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
gigabyte modules that have been

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.639 
gigabyte modules that have been
installed<00:02:03.180> into<00:02:03.479> my<00:02:03.600> iMac<00:02:04.020> stock<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:04.619> I

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
installed into my iMac stock when I

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.920 
installed into my iMac stock when I
picked<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.159> last<00:02:05.549> summer<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> do

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
picked it up last summer I'm going to do

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.389 
picked it up last summer I'm going to do
the<00:02:07.049> same<00:02:07.259> thing<00:02:07.469> with<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.770> second<00:02:08.190> memory

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the same thing with the second memory

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
the same thing with the second memory
module<00:02:08.789> simply<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.720> out<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> tablet<00:02:10.410> pull

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
module simply take out the tablet pull

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.490 
module simply take out the tablet pull
and<00:02:10.890> get<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.340> module<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.379> then

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and get the module out and then

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.600 
and get the module out and then
what<00:02:13.920> you're<00:02:14.070> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.490> do

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
what you're going to want to do

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.790 
what you're going to want to do
afterwards<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.420> take<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.110> new<00:02:16.290> memory<00:02:16.590> so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
afterwards is take the new memory so

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.710 
afterwards is take the new memory so
here's<00:02:17.010> my<00:02:17.160> crucial<00:02:17.430> four<00:02:17.850> gigabyte<00:02:18.270> module

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
here's my crucial four gigabyte module

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.980 
here's my crucial four gigabyte module
and<00:02:19.100> simply<00:02:20.100> place<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.910> into<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.750> memory

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
and simply place it into the memory

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.290 
and simply place it into the memory
module<00:02:22.500> slot<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.460> we're<00:02:23.580> going<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.760> put<00:02:23.970> either

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
module slot so we're going to put either

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.660 
module slot so we're going to put either
one<00:02:24.780> into<00:02:25.170> either<00:02:25.290> slot<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.220> here<00:02:26.430> we're<00:02:26.580> going

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
one into either slot so here we're going

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.820 
one into either slot so here we're going
to<00:02:26.760> put<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.060> into<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> left<00:02:27.960> slot<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.590> want<00:02:28.770> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
to put it into the left slot you want to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.110 
to put it into the left slot you want to
make<00:02:28.950> sure<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.280> going<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.610> right<00:02:29.730> way<00:02:29.970> and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
make sure it's going the right way and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640 
make sure it's going the right way and
that's<00:02:30.209> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.570> with<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.870> M<00:02:31.080> facing

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
that's going to be with the M facing

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.790 
that's going to be with the M facing
inwards<00:02:32.400> towards<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.690> max<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.709> going

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
inwards towards the I max so it's going

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.290 
inwards towards the I max so it's going
to<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:34.950> upside<00:02:35.340> down<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.180> going

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
to be upside down to you and it's going

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.530 
to be upside down to you and it's going
to<00:02:36.360> be<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.630> top<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.790> module<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.970> then

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
to be on top of the module and then

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.580 
to be on top of the module and then
you're<00:02:39.660> going<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.810> take<00:02:39.930> your<00:02:40.110> second<00:02:40.440> module

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
you're going to take your second module

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.340 
you're going to take your second module
place<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.760> into<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.240> second<00:02:42.780> part<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.260> if

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
you're on a Mac 27-inch you can just

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.990 
you're on a Mac 27-inch you can just
place<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.480> into<00:02:45.600> any<00:02:46.050> empty<00:02:46.680> port<00:02:47.010> simply<00:02:47.760> pop

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.390 
place it into any empty port simply pop
it<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.450> will<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:49.470> will<00:02:49.680> feel<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.130> pop

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
it in you will you will feel it pop

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.400 
it in you will you will feel it pop
right<00:02:50.790> into<00:02:51.000> place<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.570> then<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.170> won't<00:02:52.320> be

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
right into place and then you won't be

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.630 
right into place and then you won't be
able<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.650> pull<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.980> out<00:02:53.040> with<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.310> fingers

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
is below but after what I realized is

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.039 
is below but after what I realized is
that<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.549> want<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.150> make<00:03:24.269> sure<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.840> took

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
that you want to make sure that you took

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.900 
that you want to make sure that you took
out<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.620> right<00:03:25.769> modules<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.489> put<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
out the right modules and you put in the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.330 
out the right modules and you put in the
new<00:03:27.060> ones<00:03:27.239> because<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.200> would<00:03:28.440> really<00:03:28.709> be<00:03:29.010> sad

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
new ones because it would really be sad

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.550 
new ones because it would really be sad
if<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:29.850> accidentally<00:03:30.450> only<00:03:30.690> switched<00:03:30.989> one<00:03:31.320> or

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
if you accidentally only switched one or

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.740 
if you accidentally only switched one or
you<00:03:32.010> didn't<00:03:32.250> even<00:03:32.459> switch<00:03:32.820> any<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.209> them<00:03:33.450> like

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
you didn't even switch any of them like

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.289 
you didn't even switch any of them like
you<00:03:33.780> took<00:03:34.080> out<00:03:34.320> your<00:03:34.650> old<00:03:34.950> modules<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.790> you

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
you took out your old modules and you

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.140 
you took out your old modules and you
put<00:03:36.570> in<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.080> same<00:03:37.530> ones<00:03:37.799> without<00:03:38.340> noticing<00:03:38.970> so

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
put in the same ones without noticing so

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.090 
put in the same ones without noticing so
just<00:03:39.390> check<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:39.930> you'll<00:03:40.170> save<00:03:40.530> yourself<00:03:40.650> some

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
just check so you'll save yourself some

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.190 
just check so you'll save yourself some
time<00:03:41.250> it's<00:03:41.760> only<00:03:41.880> five<00:03:42.150> seconds<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.750> check<00:03:42.989> and

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
time it's only five seconds to check and

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.630 
time it's only five seconds to check and
it<00:03:43.290> really<00:03:43.500> will<00:03:43.769> save<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.100> bunch<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.400> time

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
it really will save you a bunch of time

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.090 
it really will save you a bunch of time
so<00:03:45.480> now<00:03:45.630> we<00:03:46.140> are<00:03:46.290> just<00:03:46.320> going<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.650> boot<00:03:46.920> up<00:03:47.040> the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
so now we are just going to boot up the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.330 
so now we are just going to boot up the
iMac<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.989> did<00:03:49.170> notice<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.590> first<00:03:49.920> boot<00:03:50.160> it

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
iMac and I did notice on first boot it

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.550 
iMac and I did notice on first boot it
does<00:03:50.579> take<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.060> little<00:03:51.390> bit<00:03:51.510> longer<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.260> boot<00:03:52.410> up

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
does take a little bit longer to boot up

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.640 
does take a little bit longer to boot up
the<00:03:52.590> iMac<00:03:53.010> because<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:54.380> noticing<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.560> you

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
the iMac because it is noticing that you

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.220 
the iMac because it is noticing that you
have<00:03:55.860> installed<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.579> new<00:03:57.299> RAM<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.049> just

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
have installed the new RAM and it just

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.720 
have installed the new RAM and it just
has<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.530> get<00:03:58.680> used<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.310> make<00:03:59.459> sure<00:03:59.640> you

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
has to get used to it and make sure you

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.610 
has to get used to it and make sure you
have<00:03:59.850> installed<00:03:59.970> correctly<00:04:00.480> because<00:04:01.200> if<00:04:01.500> you

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
have installed correctly because if you

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.090 
have installed correctly because if you
didn't<00:04:01.890> put<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.160> RAM<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.959> proper<00:04:03.959> way<00:04:04.200> or<00:04:04.470> if

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
didn't put in RAM the proper way or if

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.220 
didn't put in RAM the proper way or if
they<00:04:05.430> are<00:04:05.579> not<00:04:05.790> connecting<00:04:06.540> inside<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.110> the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
they are not connecting inside of the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.140 
they are not connecting inside of the
iMac<00:04:07.709> then<00:04:08.190> what<00:04:08.400> will<00:04:08.549> happen<00:04:08.579> is<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
iMac then what will happen is the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.000 
iMac then what will happen is the
computer<00:04:09.540> will<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.840> no<00:04:10.019> RAM<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.860> won't

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
computer will have no RAM and it won't

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.069 
computer will have no RAM and it won't
be<00:04:11.130> able<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.430> connect<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.030> if<00:04:12.420> that<00:04:12.630> happens

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
be able to connect and if that happens

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.900 
be able to connect and if that happens
you<00:04:13.200> will<00:04:13.320> get<00:04:13.680> an<00:04:13.769> error<00:04:13.980> on<00:04:14.160> your<00:04:14.190> screen<00:04:14.579> but

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
you will get an error on your screen but

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.520 
you will get an error on your screen but
if<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.120> follow<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.480> directions<00:04:15.930> earlier

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
if you follow the directions earlier

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.349 
if you follow the directions earlier
that<00:04:16.799> will<00:04:16.979> not<00:04:17.160> happen<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.729> you<00:04:17.880> guys<00:04:18.060> should

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
that will not happen and you guys should

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.500 
that will not happen and you guys should
be<00:04:18.510> fine<00:04:18.979> so<00:04:19.979> as<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.579> can<00:04:20.669> see<00:04:20.910> you<00:04:21.150> will<00:04:21.329> get

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
be fine so as you can see you will get

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.839 
be fine so as you can see you will get
the<00:04:21.690> Apple<00:04:22.109> logo<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.650> after<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.520> should

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
the Apple logo and after that should

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.839 
the Apple logo and after that should
take<00:04:24.000> about<00:04:24.150> one<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:25.169> two<00:04:25.200> minutes<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:26.160> notice

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
take about one to two minutes to notice

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.260 
take about one to two minutes to notice
the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.369 
the
new<00:04:27.389> memory<00:04:27.780> modules<00:04:29.479> so<00:04:30.479> once<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.930> computer

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
new memory modules so once the computer

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.379 
new memory modules so once the computer
boots<00:04:31.560> up<00:04:31.860> one<00:04:32.190> thing<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.729> I<00:04:32.879> noticed

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
boots up one thing that I noticed

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.260 
boots up one thing that I noticed
personally<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.560> my<00:04:34.740> desktop<00:04:35.310> icons<00:04:35.909> with

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
personally is that my desktop icons with

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.110 
personally is that my desktop icons with
my<00:04:36.569> folders<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.199> my<00:04:37.500> files<00:04:37.949> loaded<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.879> lot

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
my folders and my files loaded a lot

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.540 
my folders and my files loaded a lot
quicker<00:04:39.389> than<00:04:39.509> usual<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.199> if<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:41.099> happens

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
quicker than usual and if that happens

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.610 
quicker than usual and if that happens
you<00:04:41.669> will<00:04:41.789> already<00:04:42.240> know<00:04:42.479> that<00:04:42.629> you<00:04:42.960> have<00:04:43.229> the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
you will already know that you have the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.369 
you will already know that you have the
new<00:04:43.800> modules<00:04:44.310> in<00:04:44.460> but<00:04:45.180> if<00:04:45.389> you<00:04:45.870> just<00:04:46.110> want<00:04:46.319> to

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
new modules in but if you just want to

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.749 
new modules in but if you just want to
make<00:04:46.470> sure<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.710> go<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:47.009> Apple<00:04:47.250> menu<00:04:47.490> and

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
make sure to go to the Apple menu and

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.790 
make sure to go to the Apple menu and
hit<00:04:47.940> about<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.449> Mac<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.720> then<00:04:49.289> you<00:04:49.409> will<00:04:49.530> see

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
hit about this Mac and then you will see

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.820 
hit about this Mac and then you will see
so<00:04:50.099> now<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.460> does<00:04:50.639> say<00:04:50.849> 8<00:04:51.270> gigabytes<00:04:51.810> of<00:04:51.960> 10<00:04:52.199> 67

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
so now it does say 8 gigabytes of 10 67

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.510 
so now it does say 8 gigabytes of 10 67
megahertz<00:04:53.310> ddr3<00:04:54.060> RAM<00:04:54.690> from<00:04:55.080> crucial<00:04:55.710> calm<00:04:56.190> and

megahertz ddr3 RAM from crucial calm and

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.180 
megahertz ddr3 RAM from crucial calm and
now<00:04:57.389> what<00:04:57.599> I'm<00:04:57.690> going<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.900> do<00:04:58.020> is<00:04:58.259> run<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.800> geek

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
now what I'm going to do is run the geek

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.700 
now what I'm going to do is run the geek
bench<00:04:59.580> benchmark<00:05:00.569> test<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:01.289> see<00:05:01.440> if<00:05:01.470> the

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.439 
bench benchmark test to see if the
computer<00:05:02.099> is<00:05:02.130> running<00:05:02.669> any<00:05:02.789> faster<00:05:03.270> than

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
computer is running any faster than

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.020 
computer is running any faster than
before<00:05:03.599> so<00:05:04.530> I<00:05:04.560> do<00:05:04.650> have<00:05:04.949> both<00:05:05.250> my<00:05:05.430> scores<00:05:05.789> up

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
before so I do have both my scores up

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.370 
before so I do have both my scores up
and<00:05:06.240> if<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.419> want<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:06.690> check<00:05:06.810> out<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.080> score

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
and if you want to check out the score

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.649 
and if you want to check out the score
before<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.130> after<00:05:08.430> you<00:05:08.580> can<00:05:08.699> hit<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.210> link<00:05:09.539> in

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
before and after you can hit the link in

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.020 
before and after you can hit the link in
the<00:05:09.750> description<00:05:10.229> below<00:05:10.380> but<00:05:10.650> my<00:05:11.310> old<00:05:11.639> score

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
the description below but my old score

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.920 
the description below but my old score
was<00:05:12.330> about<00:05:13.159> 35<00:05:14.159> or<00:05:14.360> 3600<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:15.449> can't<00:05:15.659> exactly

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
was about 35 or 3600 I can't exactly

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.960 
was about 35 or 3600 I can't exactly
remember<00:05:16.139> but<00:05:17.009> the<00:05:17.130> computer<00:05:17.550> definitely

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
remember but the computer definitely

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.659 
remember but the computer definitely
sped<00:05:18.210> up<00:05:18.360> in<00:05:18.539> memory<00:05:18.840> performance<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.680> in<00:05:20.340> RAM

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
sped up in memory performance and in RAM

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.820 
sped up in memory performance and in RAM
from<00:05:21.270> compressing<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.110> decompressing<00:05:22.560> is

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
from compressing and decompressing is

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.909 
from compressing and decompressing is
about<00:05:23.310> 1<00:05:23.729> gigabyte<00:05:24.449> faster<00:05:25.080> now<00:05:25.229> than<00:05:25.530> usual

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
about 1 gigabyte faster now than usual

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.649 
about 1 gigabyte faster now than usual
so<00:05:26.310> you<00:05:26.370> might<00:05:26.520> be<00:05:26.639> thinking<00:05:26.969> I<00:05:27.120> doubled<00:05:27.539> my

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
so you might be thinking I doubled my

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.360 
so you might be thinking I doubled my
memory<00:05:27.990> so<00:05:28.289> shouldn't<00:05:28.560> it<00:05:28.650> be<00:05:28.710> going<00:05:28.979> twice<00:05:29.159> as

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
memory so shouldn't it be going twice as

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.159 
memory so shouldn't it be going twice as
fast<00:05:29.400> but<00:05:30.090> when<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:30.360> think<00:05:30.569> about<00:05:30.629> it<00:05:30.900> one

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
fast but when you think about it one

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.100 
fast but when you think about it one
gigabyte<00:05:31.590> more<00:05:31.919> a<00:05:31.949> second<00:05:32.460> is<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.610> huge<00:05:33.360> deal<00:05:33.599> so

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
gigabyte more a second is a huge deal so

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.270 
gigabyte more a second is a huge deal so
if<00:05:34.169> you<00:05:34.259> guys<00:05:34.349> want<00:05:34.590> to<00:05:34.680> see<00:05:34.800> that<00:05:34.919> in<00:05:35.069> full

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280
