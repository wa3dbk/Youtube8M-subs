00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
a fantastic deal now i'm not you know i

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.789 
a fantastic deal now i'm not you know i
wasn't<00:01:09.450> too<00:01:09.659> fussed<00:01:09.960> about<00:01:10.140> not<00:01:10.439> having<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
wasn't too fussed about not having the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.310 
wasn't too fussed about not having the
i3<00:01:11.310> mainly<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.630> AI<00:01:12.659> files<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
i3 mainly because the AI files in the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.859 
i3 mainly because the AI files in the
items<00:01:13.770> they've<00:01:13.950> already<00:01:14.100> got<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:15.689> have

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
items they've already got are they have

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.170 
items they've already got are they have
two<00:01:16.259> virtual<00:01:16.740> cores<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.400> then<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> actual

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
two virtual cores and then to actual

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.660 
two virtual cores and then to actual
cause<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.560> officially<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
cause so really it's not officially a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.990 
cause so really it's not officially a
quad-core<00:01:21.390> processor<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.939> know

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
quad-core processor so I think you know

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.719 
quad-core processor so I think you know
in<00:01:27.270> favor<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.750> battery<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.770> graphic<00:01:29.369> sake

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
in favor of battery and graphic sake

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.219 
in favor of battery and graphic sake
said<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.360> much<00:01:30.600> better<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
said I think it's much better just to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.749 
said I think it's much better just to
keep<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> core<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.920> Julian<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.549> white<00:01:32.640> as

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
keep the core to Julian and white as

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.719 
keep the core to Julian and white as
well<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:34.500> another<00:01:34.619> reason<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.369> don't

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
well and that's another reason I don't

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.850 
well and that's another reason I don't
think<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.079> an<00:01:37.229> i3<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
think there is going to be an i3 and the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.760 
think there is going to be an i3 and the
13-inch<00:01:38.280> anytime<00:01:38.880> soon<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.590> think<00:01:40.590> what's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
13-inch anytime soon I think what's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.140 
13-inch anytime soon I think what's
going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.009> happen<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.430> he's<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.000> rid

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
going to happen is he's going to get rid

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
going to happen is he's going to get rid
of<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.360> white<00:01:42.570> unibody<00:01:43.350> macbook<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> he's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
of the white unibody macbook and he's

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.160 
of the white unibody macbook and he's
gonna<00:01:44.970> probably<00:01:45.210> bring<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> price<00:01:45.720> down<00:01:45.780> in

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
gonna probably bring the price down in

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.340 
gonna probably bring the price down in
the<00:01:46.259> 13<00:01:46.680> inch<00:01:46.710> pro<00:01:47.960> two<00:01:48.960> maybe<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.259> know

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the 13 inch pro two maybe you know

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.230 
the 13 inch pro two maybe you know
hundred<00:01:49.680> pounds<00:01:49.979> less<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:50.939> make<00:01:51.090> it

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
hundred pounds less you know make it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.969 
hundred pounds less you know make it
about<00:01:51.360> 900<00:01:52.110> pounds<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
about 900 pounds you know so the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.490 
about 900 pounds you know so the
cheapest<00:01:53.369> no<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.390> I've<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.930> 900

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
cheapest no but that I've then is 900

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.950 
cheapest no but that I've then is 900
pounds<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.119> think<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.240> probably<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.930> know

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
pounds I think that's probably you know

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.780 
pounds I think that's probably you know
that<00:01:58.829> would<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> best<00:01:59.159> thing<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.520> could

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that would be the best thing you could

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.240 
that would be the best thing you could
do<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.079> also<00:02:01.259> takes<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.740> manufacturing

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
do it then also takes a manufacturing

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.590 
do it then also takes a manufacturing
process<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> equation<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.509> know

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
process out of the equation you know

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.539 
process out of the equation you know
they<00:02:03.689> haven't<00:02:03.899> got<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> make<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.619> polycarbonate

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
they haven't got to make a polycarbonate

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.550 
they haven't got to make a polycarbonate
shell<00:02:05.909> unibody<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.689> know<00:02:06.810> they've<00:02:07.350> just

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
shell unibody you know they've just

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.430 
shell unibody you know they've just
gotta<00:02:07.770> focus<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:10.110> aluminium

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
gotta focus on the the aluminium

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.300 
gotta focus on the the aluminium
enclosure<00:02:11.810> much<00:02:12.810> better

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
enclosure much better

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.030 
enclosure much better
for<00:02:13.550> him<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:15.050> possibly<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.770> know<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
for him I'm possibly you know the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.160 
for him I'm possibly you know the
consumer<00:02:16.550> as<00:02:16.640> well<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:17.060> know<00:02:17.180> it's<00:02:17.390> gonna<00:02:17.959> get

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
consumer as well you know it's gonna get

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.949 
consumer as well you know it's gonna get
a<00:02:18.230> better<00:02:19.099> notebook<00:02:19.819> you<00:02:20.239> know<00:02:20.360> 4050<00:02:20.720> pounds

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
a better notebook you know 4050 pounds

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.390 
a better notebook you know 4050 pounds
more<00:02:21.290> than<00:02:21.319> they<00:02:21.560> would<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:21.739> paid<00:02:22.040> for<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
more than they would have paid for the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.290 
more than they would have paid for the
plastic<00:02:22.760> one<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.980> think<00:02:25.520> hopefully<00:02:25.790> there

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
plastic one I think hopefully there

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.550 
plastic one I think hopefully there
should<00:02:26.480> be<00:02:26.569> something<00:02:26.780> done<00:02:27.020> with<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.230> macbook

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
should be something done with a macbook

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.949 
should be something done with a macbook
air<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:28.760> would<00:02:28.849> be<00:02:28.940> quite<00:02:29.239> good<00:02:29.599> if<00:02:29.840> they

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
air that would be quite good if they

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.350 
air that would be quite good if they
could<00:02:29.989> you<00:02:30.380> know<00:02:30.500> possibly<00:02:31.220> know<00:02:31.730> just<00:02:31.940> up<00:02:32.120> up
