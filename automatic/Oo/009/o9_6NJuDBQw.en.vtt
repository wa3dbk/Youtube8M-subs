00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.760
 hello my name is mess nogales and I'm going to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.889
 explain what is the word parkinson 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.740
 white is a syndrome of 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.410
 congenital presentation in which it appears 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.170
 an accessory path that drives impulses 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.710
 from the atrium to the ventricles without 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.960
 pass through the atrioventricular node 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.039
 but first let's see what a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.039
 normal driving 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.410
 the impulse begins in the sinus node 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.760
 this is in the right atrium 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:46.000
 from here it passes to the atrioventricular node 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.520
 through the beam of hits reaches the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.910
 ventricles by the right branch and the 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.910
 left branch 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:01.010
 this would give us the next electro a 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:04.010
 wave p an interval pq q rs and the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.239
 let's see what happens in 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.239
 a world parkinson while 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.240
 the normal driving route continues 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.450
 being and working the problem is that 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.390
 appears an accessory path that communicates 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.030
 the atrium and the ventricles is that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.840
 we see is the most frequent form of all 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.390
 the driving is orthodromic this wants 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.580
 say that the impulse goes down the road 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.650
 normal and up through the way 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.320
 accessory entering again in the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.950
 circuit this would be the electro 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:46.270
 characteristic appears in the p wave the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.810
 complex qr s wave t and most 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.869
 important everything appears a wave that 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.210
 we call delta wave this is what we 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.880
 is indicating is that the ventricles are 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.700
 they are in need of a little before 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.259
 the normal input in addition to this we see 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.100
 that the pr has been cut in this case the 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:12.810
 jÃºver and that will always be close already 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.810
 that passes through the atrioventricular node 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.750
 we must bear in mind that the world 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.720
 parkinson white is not the same as a 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.390
 precipitation the wolf parkinson wise it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.470
 produces when there is one more precipitation 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 an arrhythmia 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.420
 we can find a second case in the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.420
 that driving is anti dromi here 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.540
 This form is less common than 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.599
 previous 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.129
 and it is characterized because the body in the 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.129
 electro is wide 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.420
 let's treat these patients going to 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.879
 depend if you just have pre-excitation or 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.720
 if you have a presentation plus a 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.720
 atrial fibrillation 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.160
 in the case that it is a fibrillation 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.350
 earphone pre excited treatment what 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.960
 let's do it by cardio version 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.570
 electric in case there is a bad 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.180
 tolerance on the part of the patient or with 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.220
 antiarrhythmics of group 1 c to which 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.730
 belongs flecainida and the area itself 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.129
 or with procaine gives me 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.140
 we must remember never to put them in the brakes 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.900
 of the node in case it is a 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.940
 ugly pre excited as it would favor 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.650
 driving through the road 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.930
 accessory 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.299
 in this case it could produce a 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.530
 ventricular fibrillation by not retaining 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.350
 none of the impulses 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.420
 include drugs such as digoxin the 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.730
 betablockers or the penny call 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.940
 that all of them are held back from the 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.430
 node some authors also include the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.290
 fear of drugs 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.480
 in case all you have is 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.920
 a pre citation the treatment goes to 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.920
 depend on whether the patient is 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.080
 asymptomatic or asymptomatic in case of 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.600
 the patient is symptomatic the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.410
 technique of choice is the ablation of 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.410
 accessory pathway 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.300
 in case the patient is 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.220
 asymptomatic the only thing we should 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.220
 do is observe the patient 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.370
 in case the patient is 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.370
 sun and shut up
