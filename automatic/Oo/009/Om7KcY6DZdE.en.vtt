concrete you look up on top you'll see

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.560 
concrete you look up on top you'll see
where<00:00:20.400> they<00:00:20.490> actually<00:00:20.670> chipped<00:00:21.180> into<00:00:21.359> the

concrete existing concrete wall to the
rebar<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:26.880> could<00:00:27.060> join<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.599> all

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
rebar so they could join this all

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.810 
rebar so they could join this all
together

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
together

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.550

the concrete support pillar and over
there<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.829> rebar<00:00:53.870> it's<00:00:54.870> inside<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
there you see the rebar it's inside of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.500 
there you see the rebar it's inside of
that<00:00:56.750> support<00:00:57.750> structure<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:02.129> deck<00:01:02.520> one
