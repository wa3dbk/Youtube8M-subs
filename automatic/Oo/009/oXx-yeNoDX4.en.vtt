00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 let's see right away we all love 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.289
 both past games about the dark knight 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 The first part came out 4 years ago and it was 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.980
 not just the best superhero game 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.990
 but its almost the best game at all in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
 That year, the second part added to everything 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
 other full open world and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.859
 the scale of everything that was happening in general was 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 cool too but then developer studio 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.759
 Rokstedi decided to move away from eared 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.160
 flyer and switch your attention to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.020
 some other project hells batman in 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
 hands of the montreal branch warner 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.370
 brothers gay who decided to tell 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.070
 us a story about becoming a defender 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.739
 Gotham about those times when he did 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.960
 not the first steps but not yet known 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.520
 folk avenger however I allow 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.800
 do not tell yourself about the main 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 the game mechanics of batman since in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.699
 general, it is not very different from the arch 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.280
 asaylum and arkham city 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.649
 so if you have no idea what 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.439
 such games about batman then look 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.720
 review of past parts there about it already 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.549
 said i will pay attention only to those 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.040
 things that the developers have decided 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.799
 add to the game but will say whether it was worth it 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.320
 do but first the plot I said this 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.299
 prequel on Christmas Eve in the year of Omsk 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.640
 jail happens another collapse and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.619
 batman decides to settle all the unrest there 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.689
 but during this it turns out that some 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.820
 the villain black mask appointed for his 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.250
 head a huge reward at 50 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.380
 Millions of dollars and already 8 gone 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 scoundrels of murderers began our search 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.320
 the hero 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.450
 Here is such an outlook, but everything is not so 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.759
 just a player will be waiting for a few 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.560
 plot twists and let the obvious 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.210
 since we already know what was 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.860
 further batman will have for the first time 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.490
 meet some of their sworn 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.020
 of enemies 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.579
 and also makes friends with the commissioner 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.590
 gordon since at the time of launch 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.869
 police stories are not yet used 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.079
 services of a dark knight and even vice versa 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.450
 the whole plot turned out not normal 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.490
 a revelation but they brought you except 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.049
 ending in which he exploited 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.780
 the fact that no one ever batman 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.610
 kills it turned out some kind of stupid 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.129
 In general, fight constantly with the same ones 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.319
 same villains who wander from the game into the game under 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.950
 annoying it's time for Batman to understand what 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.020
 it doesn't work and nobody in prison 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.420
 and Perry is brought up yes and generally see 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.190
 The arkham is the one that still passes through 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.670
 which is easier to escape than from a child 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.890
 the garden 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.480
 but the plot is not the only thing 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.220
 new to arkham origins 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.470
 on human bat armor 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.810
 new gadgets arrived which are funny 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.760
 remained and the old who in theory batman 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.620
 first find only subsequent games 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.540
 but we will not find fault with the most useful 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.700
 the whole new arsenal of this lecturer 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.010
 gloves that the generator can 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.019
 charge and enemies in the muzzles give a 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.510
 here is a shock detonator useless bit 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.630
 more than fully he literally a couple 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.580
 seconds enter enemies delusion and everything in 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.150
 the rest of his application is absolutely not 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.340
 required 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.810
 You are in general new gadgets strong 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.420
 originality does not shine 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.760
 exactly like riddler riddles more precisely 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.980
 Enigma remember as when solving some 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.950
 puzzles in arkham city could head 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.560
 break so here it is not there well then 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.269
 there is a collection of colleagues the balls of remained but 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.489
 here is the difficulty in getting them no 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.799
 no everything is simple and trite no 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.750
 complex machinations I have not met at all in 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.880
 side mission plan the developers went 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.920
 towards the side of their assassin's credo 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.720
 let's nafigachim towers that need 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.790
 sync sense hack a 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.410
 otherwise you will not be able to use phase 3 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.780
 which was introduced here 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.579
 and who the hell needs because 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.859
 year has almost doubled 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.049
 compared to the last game, that's just 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.420
 he is all faded and uninteresting 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.079
 so moving around it turns 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.030
 into a routine 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.100
 and besides , the enemies on the streets are just 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.709
 They fill up and everyone wants to beat you and with 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.260
 fighting here is not all clear on the one hand 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.359
 mechanics left exactly the same blows 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.639
 counterstrike using gadgets and and 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.739
 a combo of two buttons but on the dynamics they 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.660
 changed relative to arch avenger 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.329
 now almost after every strike 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.730
 it is necessary to make a contour kick because 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.560
 the enemies overwhelm you as if flies without giving 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.389
 quietly crush stunned opponents and 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.880
 okay to go from all sorts of attacks 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.950
 centuries and thugs and fight beautiful almost 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.810
 do not force because it was added 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.209
 rating system of your fights 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.540
 If earlier experience was given for the maximum 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.400
 a long combo now this is not enough 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.060
 never failing to scatter everyone 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.389
 foe 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.939
 but you get 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.280
 Estimated not that of course 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.729
 nice of the positive innovations you can 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.379
 Mark 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.360
 fairly complementing your mode 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.580
 investigations where now batman is not 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.770
 only looking for clues but also restores 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.960
 all the events at the crime scene and 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.849
 this data is trying to find new clues 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.189
 and now you still have the opportunity to visit 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.930
 batman sky cave and personally talk to 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.680
 Albert who like Lenin such 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.650
 young 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.349
 But in general, something like everything oh yes almost 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.870
 forgot about such a new chip as their bugs 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.310
 it became some indecent amount 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.889
 all have probably heard about 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.439
 idle tower which can be passed 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.900
 only unions even more tank do not even know 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.000
 did nior repair since in x box of 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.129
 The sky version is fine with her, but to me 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.180
 managed to conclude another tower and this already 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.979
 no gate 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.930
 in general, people write about everywhere 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.550
 all kinds of shoals out at max 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.680
 Solodilova battle with the killer around 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.219
 it literally broke the first ten 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.219
 minutes of play 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.570
 a separate line should be told about 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.430
 multiplayer which was not there before and 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.050
 it would be better to stay like that 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.540
 multiplayer game with us 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.100
 only one invisible mode is available 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.050
 the essence is that the predator 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.570
 on a relatively small card 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.910
 throws 8 players who are divided into 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.460
 three teams three people go to gang 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.380
 joker and three go vandu bane they 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.630
 fighting each other in a battlefield analogue 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.190
 pskov concave several points that 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.440
 need to capture and certain 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.600
 the number of ticket revival which 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.030
 it is necessary for enemies to demolish to zero then 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.280
 you win it looks like normal 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.590
 such a third-person action game with all sorts 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.660
 perks and short-term x-ray 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.639
 sight and ability to play with 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.370
 special circumstances for the bane itself 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.320
 or joker is here such an analog tank and 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.120
 draining water up to a point on the map 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.370
 appears. for which you need to run 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.110
 up if you had time to turn and 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.540
 now you can almost with one blow 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.160
 demolish all enemies and everything would be fine but I 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.919
 didn't tell about those two players 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.830
 who hit the third team they 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.470
 play for Batman and that Kiev shorts 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.010
 their task is to fill the scale of fears so that 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.720
 scare 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.150
 both gang of villains and force them 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.520
 escape from the battlefield it fills as 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.870
 easy to guess for the murder or rather 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.919
 the case of Batman for serious bodily 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.110
 damage 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.750
 for this purpose all the same gadgets are used 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.210
 that there is a single and betarangi their hands and 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.430
 detective vision that's only if u 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.410
 other players will shoot you 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.300
 then the scale of fear will decrease 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.520
 so you have to try yourself not 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.289
 fall under enemy fire because 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.840
 fragile batman stand probably 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:58.200
 just half of the clip and the whole is played 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.880
 even fun but not for long here everything is like 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.160
 multiplayer in the second dead space and 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.570
 first kind of funny to tear people 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.340
 hands playing necromorphs 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.530
 but the next day you are unlikely 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.880
 come back online and even for such 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.820
 side cartoon 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.020
 developers are not too lazy to lead 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.340
 microtransactions to buy yourself 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.530
 all sorts of updates 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.660
 add here the already mentioned bugs 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.910
 like departures but disconnect in long 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.789
 searching for players and occasionally dropping 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.900
 levels and understand what is better in principle 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:25.820
 would arkham origins 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.830
 did without 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.140
 in this and let him speak a lot 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.630
 all bad about the new batman 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.060
 but it is worth noting that even in this one 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.450
 spoiled secondary and bugged am 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.640
 the form 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:40.280
 the original concept looks all 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.090
 Equally better than many games, so all the same 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.250
 laudable 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.460
 if you are not interested in recently released 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.710
 catch up with her cat to hold 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.670
 several days a year and not not the most 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.670
 bad waste of time
