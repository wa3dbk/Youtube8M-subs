fabric<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.670> here<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:09.060> connects<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.509> velcro

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
fabric in here that connects with velcro

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.540 
fabric in here that connects with velcro
to<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.470> back<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.039> could<00:02:11.130> have<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> black

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.930 
to the back so you could have a black
sweep<00:02:11.880> also<00:02:12.890> alrighty<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.400> let's<00:02:14.580> put<00:02:14.790> this

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
down now the one thing that I looked at
with<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.740> glass<00:02:20.040> frames<00:02:20.430> anyway<00:02:20.880> was

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
with what the glass frames anyway was

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.300 
with what the glass frames anyway was
the<00:02:21.570> fact<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.770> know<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.950> really<00:02:23.190> need

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the fact that you know you really need

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.060 
the fact that you know you really need
light<00:02:23.670> coming<00:02:24.120> all<00:02:24.330> around<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.320> order<00:02:25.920> to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
light coming all around it in order to

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.310 
light coming all around it in order to
basically<00:02:26.910> get<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> reflections<00:02:27.989> because<00:02:28.290> a

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
basically get the reflections because a

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.620 
basically get the reflections because a
lot<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.530> hers<00:02:28.739> has<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> lot<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.459> color<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.030> it

and<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.100> it's<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.280> little<00:04:10.460> bit

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
and and it's a little bit

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.340 
and and it's a little bit
counterintuitive<00:04:11.390> because<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:12.110> would<00:04:12.230> think

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
counterintuitive because you would think

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.620 
counterintuitive because you would think
that<00:04:12.580> with<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.640> light<00:04:13.880> like<00:04:14.090> this<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:14.540> would

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
that with a light like this it would

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.270 
that with a light like this it would
reflect<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.230> lenses<00:04:15.710> and<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:15.950> would<00:04:16.100> wash

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
reflect in the lenses and it would wash

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.130 
reflect in the lenses and it would wash
them<00:04:16.459> right<00:04:16.610> out<00:04:16.640> but<00:04:17.330> it<00:04:17.450> actually<00:04:17.810> doesn't

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
them right out but it actually doesn't

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.229 
them right out but it actually doesn't
it's<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.680> nice<00:04:18.920> even<00:04:19.430> light<00:04:19.610> there's<00:04:20.090> no

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
it's a nice even light there's no

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.150 
it's a nice even light there's no
reflection<00:04:20.480> in<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.959> lens<00:04:21.110> I'm<00:04:21.800> going<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.070> do<00:04:22.130> a

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
reflection in the lens I'm going to do a

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:32.340 
reflection in the lens I'm going to do a
couple<00:04:22.490> shots<00:04:22.730> here<00:04:23.000> show<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.540> what<00:04:23.690> we<00:04:23.810> have

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.810 

all<00:04:33.350> right<00:04:33.530> cool<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.310> always<00:04:34.430> shoot<00:04:34.670> on

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
all right cool and I always shoot on

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.600 
all right cool and I always shoot on
manual<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:36.290> that<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.530> can<00:04:36.770> adjust<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.250> because

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
manual so that I can adjust it because

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.450 
manual so that I can adjust it because
with<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:38.150> light<00:04:38.450> table<00:04:38.840> like<00:04:38.990> this<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:40.340> would

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
with a light table like this you would

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.370 
with a light table like this you would
not<00:04:40.700> be<00:04:41.030> able<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.480> get<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.960> correct<00:04:42.200> exposure

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
not be able to get the correct exposure

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.220 
not be able to get the correct exposure
because<00:04:43.160> it's<00:04:43.340> going<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.550> read<00:04:43.760> off<00:04:44.030> of<00:04:44.360> you

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
because it's going to read off of you

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.320 
because it's going to read off of you
know<00:04:45.350> your<00:04:45.860> light<00:04:46.190> your<00:04:46.430> your<00:04:46.640> your<00:04:47.120> light

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
know your light your your your light

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.330 
know your light your your your light
table<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:47.960> it's<00:04:48.200> going<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.440> under<00:04:48.920> expose

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
table and it's going to under expose

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.030 
table and it's going to under expose
your<00:04:49.610> actual<00:04:49.880> product<00:04:50.350> okay<00:04:51.350> so<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:51.830> want<00:04:51.980> to

make<00:04:52.130> sure<00:04:52.160> that<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.550> shoot<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:52.940> on<00:04:53.030> manual

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
make sure that you shoot it on manual

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.010 
make sure that you shoot it on manual
all<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.930> time<00:04:55.360> okay<00:04:56.360> let<00:04:56.570> me<00:04:56.630> get<00:04:56.750> a<00:04:56.780> couple

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
all the time okay let me get a couple

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.390 
all the time okay let me get a couple
more<00:04:57.260> shots<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.770> we're<00:04:57.890> getting<00:04:58.100> some<00:04:58.220> really

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
more shots and we're getting some really

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.930 
more shots and we're getting some really
good<00:04:58.520> color<00:04:58.910> now<00:04:59.120> if<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.360> do<00:04:59.510> get<00:04:59.690> any<00:04:59.990> type<00:05:00.320> of

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
good color now if you do get any type of

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.740 
good color now if you do get any type of
reflection<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.060> can<00:05:02.120> always<00:05:02.390> pop<00:05:02.540> on<00:05:02.720> a

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
reflection you can always pop on a

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.020 
reflection you can always pop on a
polarizer<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.590> that<00:05:04.280> would<00:05:04.460> generally<00:05:04.760> take

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
polarizer and that would generally take

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.900 
polarizer and that would generally take
care<00:05:05.240> of<00:05:05.330> any<00:05:05.650> you<00:05:06.650> know<00:05:06.800> incidental<00:05:07.700> type

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
care of any you know incidental type

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.520 
care of any you know incidental type
reflections<00:05:08.510> that<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:08.750> might<00:05:08.930> get<00:05:09.140> but<00:05:09.320> it's

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
reflections that you might get but it's

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.740 
reflections that you might get but it's
very<00:05:09.830> even<00:05:10.370> you're<00:05:10.880> getting<00:05:11.090> nice<00:05:11.240> color<00:05:11.540> all

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
very even you're getting nice color all

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.410 
very even you're getting nice color all
around<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:13.550> only<00:05:13.700> other<00:05:13.910> thing<00:05:14.210> that

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
around it and the only other thing that

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.270 
around it and the only other thing that
I<00:05:14.780> would<00:05:14.960> show<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.200> is<00:05:15.470> this<00:05:15.680> is<00:05:15.740> very<00:05:16.070> unique

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
I would show you is this is very unique

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.430 
I would show you is this is very unique
for<00:05:16.700> this<00:05:17.480> particular<00:05:17.750> product<00:05:18.110> there<00:05:18.350> are

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
for this particular product there are

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.510 
for this particular product there are
some<00:05:18.530> other<00:05:18.650> products<00:05:19.040> that<00:05:19.160> would<00:05:19.220> look<00:05:19.370> good

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
some other products that would look good

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.590 
some other products that would look good
on<00:05:19.580> this<00:05:19.910> okay

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
on this okay

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.720 
on this okay
but<00:05:21.260> I<00:05:21.440> did<00:05:21.710> it<00:05:21.830> specifically<00:05:22.370> for<00:05:22.640> the

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
but I did it specifically for the

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.160 
but I did it specifically for the
glasses<00:05:22.970> but<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.450> other<00:05:23.570> thing<00:05:23.810> that<00:05:23.840> you<00:05:24.020> can

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
glasses but the other thing that you can

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.540 
glasses but the other thing that you can
do<00:05:24.350> and<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.590> nice<00:05:24.740> thing<00:05:24.920> about<00:05:24.980> the<00:05:25.220> digit

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
do and the nice thing about the digit

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.750 
do and the nice thing about the digit
--nt<00:05:25.730> is<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.690> fact<00:05:26.960> that<00:05:27.080> you<00:05:27.680> have<00:05:27.950> the<00:05:28.220> you

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
--nt is the fact that you have the you

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.750 
--nt is the fact that you have the you
know<00:05:28.790> all<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.330> sides<00:05:30.100> are<00:05:31.100> basically<00:05:31.670> a

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
know all the sides are basically a

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.210 
know all the sides are basically a
diffuse<00:05:32.150> material<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:33.200> you<00:05:33.290> can<00:05:33.560> shoot<00:05:33.950> light

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
diffuse material so you can shoot light

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.040 
diffuse material so you can shoot light
through<00:05:34.550> these<00:05:34.730> too<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:35.090> let's<00:05:35.570> say<00:05:35.660> I<00:05:35.690> put<00:05:35.900> my

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
through these too so let's say I put my

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.130 
through these too so let's say I put my
camera<00:05:36.290> up<00:05:36.560> here<00:05:37.120> okay<00:05:38.120> I'm<00:05:38.630> getting<00:05:38.870> nice

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
camera up here okay I'm getting nice

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.660 
camera up here okay I'm getting nice
light<00:05:39.380> coming<00:05:39.650> up<00:05:39.740> along<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.130> sides<00:05:40.400> and

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
light coming up along the sides and

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.570 
light coming up along the sides and
front<00:05:41.120> on<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.420> bottom<00:05:41.780> obviously<00:05:42.340> but<00:05:43.340> I<00:05:43.370> need

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
front on the bottom obviously but I need

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.730 
front on the bottom obviously but I need
some<00:05:43.730> more<00:05:43.760> light<00:05:44.090> on<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.420> top<00:05:44.690> okay

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
some more light on the top okay

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.070 
some more light on the top okay
so<00:05:46.100> what<00:05:46.580> I'm<00:05:46.700> going<00:05:46.910> to<00:05:47.000> do<00:05:47.210> is<00:05:47.450> basically<00:05:47.630> you

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
so what I'm going to do is basically you

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.560 
so what I'm going to do is basically you
can<00:05:48.230> always<00:05:48.350> add<00:05:48.680> light<00:05:49.100> to<00:05:49.130> it<00:05:49.430> obviously<00:05:49.570> and

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
can always add light to it obviously and

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.840 
can always add light to it obviously and
I'm<00:05:50.810> going<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.020> grab<00:05:51.610> one<00:05:52.610> of<00:05:52.640> the<00:05:53.140> FJ<00:05:54.140> Westcott

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
I'm going to grab one of the FJ Westcott

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.890 
I'm going to grab one of the FJ Westcott
spider-like<00:05:55.850> td6

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
spider-like td6
