this video this is just going to be a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.160 
this video this is just going to be a
really<00:00:21.689> quick<00:00:22.320> tutorial<00:00:23.660> taking<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> idea

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
really quick tutorial taking the idea

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.220 
really quick tutorial taking the idea
before<00:00:25.640> about<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> modes<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:28.019> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
before about one of the modes in this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.890 
before about one of the modes in this
case<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.980> Dorian<00:00:29.640> since<00:00:29.849> us<00:00:29.970> proposed<00:00:30.240> using

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
case a Dorian since us proposed using

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.370 
case a Dorian since us proposed using
before<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:32.329> taking<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> baseline<00:00:33.870> that's

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
before and taking a baseline that's

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.370 
before and taking a baseline that's
written<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> pen<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> time<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:36.380> minor

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
written in a pen a time a minor

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.970 
written in a pen a time a minor
pentatonic<00:00:37.649> which<00:00:38.460> minor<00:00:39.270> pentatonic<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:42.260> d<00:00:43.260> e

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.189 

and<00:00:47.090> using<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.739> Dorian<00:00:49.739> mode<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:51.199> create

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and using the Dorian mode to create

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.010 
and using the Dorian mode to create
small<00:00:52.559> melodic<00:00:53.340> fragments<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.180> 34<00:00:54.840> note

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
small melodic fragments just 34 note

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.590 
small melodic fragments just 34 note
runs<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.399> spice<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:56.879> now<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.480> way

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
runs to kind of spice it up now the way

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.910 
runs to kind of spice it up now the way
I'm<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> demonstrate<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
I'm going to demonstrate this is

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860 
I'm going to demonstrate this is
obviously<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.059> play<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.510> man

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
obviously not the way you play the man

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.389 
obviously not the way you play the man
if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> were<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.350> throw<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.739> anywhere<00:01:02.100> near

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
if you were to throw in anywhere near

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.630 
if you were to throw in anywhere near
this<00:01:02.550> much<00:01:02.789> adornment<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:05.070> probably<00:01:05.430> cost

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
this much adornment you probably cost

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.469 
this much adornment you probably cost
yourself<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.000> gig<00:01:06.799> but<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.240> an

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
yourself a gig but this is just an

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.700 
yourself a gig but this is just an
example<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:10.280> how<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> add<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> lines

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
example of how to add to the lines

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.480 
example of how to add to the lines
occasionally<00:01:13.710> throwing<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.130> some<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.400> these

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
occasionally throwing in some of these

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
occasionally throwing in some of these
ideas<00:01:15.049> this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.530> improvised

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
ideas this is all going to be improvised

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.149 
ideas this is all going to be improvised
so<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:18.090> baseline<00:01:18.479> by<00:01:18.689> itself<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:20.040> just

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
so the baseline by itself and I'm just

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.350 
so the baseline by itself and I'm just
going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.369> play<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> first<00:01:20.820> section<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
going to play the first section of the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:32.710 
going to play the first section of the
chorus<00:01:21.659> part<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:26.900> basically

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.210 

along<00:01:33.720> those<00:01:33.930> lines<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.380> kind<00:01:34.649> of<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.799> minor

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
along those lines is kind of a minor

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.630 
along those lines is kind of a minor
pentatonic<00:01:35.520> field<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.710> Dorian<00:01:38.189> mode<00:01:38.340> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
pentatonic field and the Dorian mode is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.750 
pentatonic field and the Dorian mode is
e<00:01:39.229> F<00:01:40.229> sharp<00:01:40.259> G<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.340> B<00:01:42.240> C<00:01:43.229> sharp<00:01:43.259> D

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.430 

so<00:01:48.760> some<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.840> ways<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.110> could<00:01:50.260> use<00:01:50.410> just

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
so some of the ways you could use just

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.400 
so some of the ways you could use just
simple<00:01:50.980> 3<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.430> 4<00:01:51.670> know<00:01:51.820> Milotic<00:01:52.600> fragments<00:01:53.290> to

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
simple 3 and 4 know Milotic fragments to

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.960 
simple 3 and 4 know Milotic fragments to
color<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.830> line<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.400> have<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> little<00:01:54.790> bit<00:01:54.940> of

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
color the line to have a little bit of

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.700 
color the line to have a little bit of
detail<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.480> add<00:01:55.570> some<00:01:55.780> contrast<00:01:56.140> of<00:01:56.350> interest

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
detail to add some contrast of interest

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:47.110 
detail to add some contrast of interest
might<00:01:57.190> be<00:01:57.810> some<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:58.930> these<00:01:59.050> kinds<00:01:59.440> of<00:01:59.500> things

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:03:23.640 

and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.190 

things<00:03:24.489> along<00:03:24.700> those<00:03:24.939> lines<00:03:25.239> so<00:03:25.930> again<00:03:26.170> just

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
things along those lines so again just

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.750 
things along those lines so again just
simple<00:03:26.620> phrases<00:03:26.860> you<00:03:27.129> can<00:03:27.189> break<00:03:27.549> it<00:03:27.579> up

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
simple phrases you can break it up

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.339 
simple phrases you can break it up
rhythmically<00:03:28.209> you<00:03:28.540> can<00:03:28.689> break<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:28.959> up<00:03:29.200> in

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
rhythmically you can break it up in

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.309 
rhythmically you can break it up in
terms<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.860> melody<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:31.599> good<00:03:32.049> point<00:03:32.260> of

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
terms of melody a good point of

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.720 
terms of melody a good point of
reference<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.739> always<00:03:32.980> going<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.220> be<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.340> lot<00:03:33.670> of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
reference is always going to be a lot of

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.830 
reference is always going to be a lot of
aligning<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.360> song<00:03:34.629> itself<00:03:35.610> but<00:03:36.689> you<00:03:37.689> can

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
aligning the song itself but you can

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.440 
aligning the song itself but you can
look<00:03:37.989> at<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.140> chord<00:03:38.379> structure<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.010> song

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
look at the chord structure of the song

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.240 
look at the chord structure of the song
and<00:03:40.450> again<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.439> can<00:03:41.470> join<00:03:41.739> things<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.159> are

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
and again you can join things that are

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.160 
and again you can join things that are
kind<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.549> random<00:03:43.000> as<00:03:43.120> long<00:03:43.299> as<00:03:43.450> they<00:03:43.599> sort<00:03:44.079> of

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
kind of random as long as they sort of

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.319 
kind of random as long as they sort of
relate<00:03:44.530> back<00:03:44.859> at<00:03:45.159> some<00:03:45.430> point<00:03:45.459> or<00:03:45.939> if<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.209> can

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
relate back at some point or if you can

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.649 
relate back at some point or if you can
find<00:03:46.480> waited<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:48.459> resolve<00:03:48.879> them<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.420> an

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
find waited to to resolve them in an

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.039 
find waited to to resolve them in an
interesting<00:03:49.930> way<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:51.069> again<00:03:51.579> this<00:03:52.569> was<00:03:52.780> Stuart

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
interesting way so again this was Stuart

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.440 
interesting way so again this was Stuart
