00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.239
 Vasilyeva and pledged to take the company whom 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.560
 bidding today we will touch a little 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.619
 Kurchenko theme and this one and style 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.359
 control aut it all fits n 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.329
 on a par with other styles have long been 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.829
 not used like for example 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.089
 mentoring however their sometimes 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.839
 entangle percent if we say 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.329
 mentoring then it is rather a process 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.380
 direction in which 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.350
 Mom the head passes a certain 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.230
 experience and gives clear instructions because 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.460
 this experience can be used 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.400
 employee 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.800
 coaching scheme worst on 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.360
 developing and allows from soon 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.420
 decided to mark the horizons and find 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.910
 new opportunities 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.220
 link your resources and in sports like that grow 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.940
 Employees no wonder interest scheme 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.090
 developmental coaching we are more 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.860
 rather than transmitting control 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.050
 and the task is a bunch and a supervisor who 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.080
 inferior and in the role of getting it 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.509
 for your employee 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.409
 do not give an answer I rather ask 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.729
 questions and ask questions creating it 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.829
 space for people to be in 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.670
 network answers are independent and 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.929
 studied in this way all my tasks and 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.000
 problems and solve yourself 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 n asking questions would seem simple 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.350
 instructions without asking questions cottage 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.240
 Own do well, it probably will 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.180
 hard enough if ooo didn't eat like that 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.020
 do not involve these questions kokoity scheme 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.200
 do not disturb 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.910
 tie clearly understand the stage by 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.310
 who need to go through and withdraw an employee she 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.240
 certain result 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.000
 and if you count several different schemes 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.020
 one of the most common and 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.770
 eao unknown sale schemes carrying 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.609
 photo shoots this group diagram 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.299
 and I am a Russian analogue of this growth system 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.630
 as a matter of fact 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.670
 ground such an option is good 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.079
 symbolizes the philosophy of this 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.729
 approach name developing growing 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.700
 employees 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.600
 I will work such an account in the system 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.369
 otherwise what to do on your own 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.909
 by stages the first stage of the project is jsc goal or 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.370
 stop rather yes Russian version 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.630
 important is an apa employee help go from 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.260
 arena formats here in this 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.370
 the prize of the situation in which no way 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.360
 can find a way out 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.180
 and articulate specific goals and what 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.170
 here actually you want to achieve such 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.589
 get result 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.209
 and it allows arabian people to 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.949
 gate stop interest 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:26.799
 agree inside the situation and outline 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.009
 some goal no goal according to the result 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.959
 the result which will be there 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.569
 well brave agree on 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.170
 half an hour is about what result we 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.629
 want to get heap result 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.090
 session date iskakova what what purpose are we 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.829
 want to achieve what will be the result 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.079
 our conversation 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.889
 and how do you understand that you got this 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.099
 result and exactly the same way 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.900
 we donâ€™t help with the same questions 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.749
 ask the person we ask 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.799
 which one of these face-to-face meetings 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.309
 what resources do you need and how are you 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.069
 understand that prostitution 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.039
 and what can you do and so on 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.039
 formulated the goal and now actually 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.899
 by saying 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.519
 it is important to examine the current situation 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.239
 buddy yes survey current 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.199
 situations 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.689
 we are more percent of Stalin man 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.299
 sentence with questions about what 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.919
 This is a situation beyond what it is. 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:13.879
 composed 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.599
 percent of everything else what ways are you already 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.260
 used to do something like that 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.799
 then what resources did you have if you 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.730
 use and maybe you speech 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.119
 might need 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:25.959
 and tell the person a few to go out with 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.669
 problem look at her lokshin 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.889
 see what it consists of yet can 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.349
 she is no 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.049
 and as soon as we examined this 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.249
 situations she could need 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:36.969
 and he 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.849
 make a list of opportunities 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.699
 Here's the task it would be a stage of very assessments 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.389
 important because a person is 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.860
 problem most often 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.379
 Pro will be one of two solutions 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.840
 and then everything did not work out for him and on this 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.959
 he is laughing 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.209
 the task of this phase will allow him to go beyond 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.119
 framework and let him find a new risuhin about 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:58.720
 opportunities and can such 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.970
 m generation of ideas occurs evaluation 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.339
 personally 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.589
 and for this there are such magical questions 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:07.699
 when we man how to be going frame 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.059
 and letting him not think there alone as 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:12.099
 time and social position 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.110
 etc 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.040
 now if it was a superman how would you 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.590
 decided to create here it was impossible not 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.310
 limited amount of time 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.850
 and at least not a limited resource 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.890
 so that this business as you could 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.870
 solve all these issues is important and 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.200
 talk about how he himself offers one 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.850
 two possible solutions 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.360
 but there is still how could you still expand 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.300
 opportunities yes better there at least 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.770
 ten options 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.870
 to choose from 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.850
 so we its author said everything 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.639
 Manabi's possibilities did not see different 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.880
 options further uh it is important for the employee to give 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.990
 which one to choose which one seems closer and 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.289
 more interesting 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.879
 later off off tastes even better 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.479
 to tell 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.719
 it is important to take concrete steps and what 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.520
 you will do to his year 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.069
 in such a way to achieve this 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.889
 what steps will be the result 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.339
 what resources do you need 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:04.249
 you will need newspapers 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.819
 and here is the most important one 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.389
 need to do 20 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.509
 write became a concrete step first 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.650
 which person will commit to resolve 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.919
 this issue 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.930
 it is important that he recorded recorded 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.930
 specific date right down to the point in 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.349
 diary and it is important to give him this help and 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.270
 supporting the first step 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.480
 so we set goals we explore why what 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.160
 why did we fail 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.040
 we expand opportunities 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.310
 surveyed and we decide what exactly 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.330
 we start doing 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.229
 and here probably in brief here on this subject we are all 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.740
 there are many more of these different 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.879
 interesting questions and subtleties we are always on 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.939
 Communication because apparently everyone as our guests 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:46.639
 to discuss some interesting ones 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:46.860
 questions
