00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
dropping them from there but you can see

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.270 
dropping them from there but you can see
how<00:02:28.900> slow<00:02:29.079> I'm<00:02:29.319> dropping<00:02:29.709> them<00:02:29.799> right<00:02:29.920> now<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
how slow I'm dropping them right now so

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.759 
how slow I'm dropping them right now so
you'll<00:02:31.180> want<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.450> go<00:02:31.660> down<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:32.069> or<00:02:33.069> hit<00:02:33.610> l2<00:02:34.090> or

you'll want to go down to or hit l2 or
left<00:02:35.769> bumper<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.160> think<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:36.549> Xbox<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.239> does

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
left bumper I think on Xbox this does

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.839 
left bumper I think on Xbox this does
work<00:02:37.599> on<00:02:37.750> Xbox<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:39.340> those<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.579> you<00:02:39.700> who<00:02:39.790> are

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
wondering but hit l2 or left bumper and

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.059 
wondering but hit l2 or left bumper and
go<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.290> modification<00:02:45.209> from<00:02:46.209> here<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.840> can<00:02:47.069> it

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
go to modification from here you can it

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.589 
go to modification from here you can it
just<00:02:48.250> shows<00:02:48.489> all<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.879> miscellaneous<00:02:49.420> stuff

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
just shows all the miscellaneous stuff

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.410 
just shows all the miscellaneous stuff
and<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:51.220> can<00:02:51.400> actually<00:02:51.549> drop<00:02:51.819> things<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.239> lot

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
and you can actually drop things a lot

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.940 
and you can actually drop things a lot
faster<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:53.200> I'm<00:02:53.260> going<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.440> drop<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.709> until<00:02:53.829> I

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
faster so I'm going to drop it until I

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.140 
faster so I'm going to drop it until I
have<00:02:54.069> about<00:02:54.250> 30<00:02:54.849> down<00:02:55.090> or<00:02:55.900> 30<00:02:56.170> left<00:02:56.440> well<00:02:57.400> okay

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
have about 30 down or 30 left well okay

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.240 
have about 30 down or 30 left well okay
I<00:02:58.329> went<00:02:58.569> over<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> little<00:02:58.959> bit<00:02:59.079> but<00:02:59.799> then<00:03:00.160> you're

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
I went over a little bit but then you're

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.440 
I went over a little bit but then you're
gonna<00:03:00.340> want<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.549> back<00:03:00.639> out<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:01.030> can<00:03:01.180> see<00:03:01.329> all

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
gonna want to back out you can see all

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.610 
gonna want to back out you can see all
of<00:03:01.569> them<00:03:01.660> on<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.750> ground<00:03:01.989> right<00:03:02.139> there<00:03:02.319> and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
of them on the ground right there and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.930 
of them on the ground right there and
you<00:03:02.799> want<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.010> be<00:03:03.100> aiming<00:03:03.280> kind<00:03:03.609> of<00:03:03.670> toward<00:03:03.850> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
you want to be aiming kind of toward the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.870 
you want to be aiming kind of toward the
ground<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.209> was<00:03:04.269> looking<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.660> too<00:03:04.810> much<00:03:04.989> but<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
ground I was looking up too much but the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.670 
ground I was looking up too much but the
reason<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.299> because<00:03:07.959> if<00:03:08.260> you're<00:03:08.380> looking<00:03:08.470> up

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
reason is because if you're looking up

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.839 
reason is because if you're looking up
too<00:03:08.799> much<00:03:08.980> it'll<00:03:09.220> just<00:03:09.340> throw<00:03:09.549> them<00:03:09.730> and

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
too much it'll just throw them and

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.860 
too much it'll just throw them and
they'll<00:03:09.940> go<00:03:10.090> all<00:03:10.239> over<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.510> place<00:03:10.720> especially

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
they'll go all over the place especially

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.750 
they'll go all over the place especially
with<00:03:11.410> diamonds<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.920> can<00:03:12.069> lose<00:03:12.250> those<00:03:12.430> really

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
with diamonds you can lose those really

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.449 
with diamonds you can lose those really
easily<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.440> yeah<00:03:14.440> throw<00:03:14.680> them<00:03:14.769> down<00:03:14.889> and<00:03:15.130> then

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
easily so yeah throw them down and then

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.370 
easily so yeah throw them down and then
you're<00:03:15.579> gonna<00:03:15.670> want<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.299> die<00:03:16.720> somehow<00:03:17.109> you<00:03:17.170> can

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
you're gonna want to die somehow you can

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.870

get killed by one that's gonna kill me
fast<00:03:41.019> for<00:03:41.319> me<00:03:41.440> oh<00:03:41.620> my<00:03:41.889> I<00:03:42.519> don't<00:03:42.819> need<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:42.940> faster

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
fast for me oh my I don't need a faster

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.059 
fast for me oh my I don't need a faster
I'll<00:03:44.230> kill<00:03:44.639> okay<00:03:45.639> so<00:03:45.700> once<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.840> go<00:03:47.019> down<00:03:47.230> you

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
I'll kill okay so once you go down you

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.199 
I'll kill okay so once you go down you
want<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.280> pause<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.489> right<00:03:48.819> here

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
want to pause it right here

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.240 
want to pause it right here
once<00:03:49.750> that's<00:03:49.870> time<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.260> recover<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.829> second

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
once that's time to recover it second

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.420 
once that's time to recover it second
seven<00:03:51.669> seconds<00:03:52.150> make<00:03:53.079> sure<00:03:53.349> that<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:54.340> you

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
seven seconds make sure that it that you

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.479 
seven seconds make sure that it that you
pause<00:03:54.609> it<00:03:54.639> pretty<00:03:55.419> quick<00:03:55.660> okay<00:03:56.310> now<00:03:57.310> what<00:03:57.459> you

want<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.760> do<00:03:57.849> is<00:03:58.030> load<00:03:58.269> your<00:03:58.419> last<00:03:58.599> checkpoint

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
want to do is load your last checkpoint

once you have all your champagne bottles

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.170 
once you have all your champagne bottles
you<00:04:26.700> just<00:04:26.880> want<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.030> come<00:04:27.180> over<00:04:27.300> here<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:29.180> sell

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
you just want to come over here and sell

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.050 
you just want to come over here and sell
them<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.330> Svetlana<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.340> usually<00:04:32.669> turn<00:04:32.820> down

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
them to Svetlana and I usually turn down

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.440 
them to Svetlana and I usually turn down
the<00:04:33.360> characters<00:04:34.169> voice<00:04:34.500> volumes<00:04:35.300> are<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
the characters voice volumes are the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.060 
the characters voice volumes are the
voice<00:04:36.600> volume<00:04:36.840> when<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.169> sell<00:04:37.620> her<00:04:37.740> this<00:04:37.890> stuff

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
voice volume when I sell her this stuff

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.710 
voice volume when I sell her this stuff
because<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.490> gets<00:04:38.640> kind<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:39.000> annoying<00:04:39.120> hearing

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
because it gets kind of annoying hearing

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.159 
because it gets kind of annoying hearing
or<00:04:39.840> doing<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.230> many<00:04:40.380> times<00:04:41.600> but<00:04:42.600> yeah<00:04:42.750> just<00:04:42.930> go

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
or doing so many times but yeah just go

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.810 
or doing so many times but yeah just go
ahead<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.440> sell<00:04:43.590> her<00:04:43.680> as<00:04:43.919> many<00:04:44.100> as<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.430> want<00:04:44.460> I

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
ahead and sell her as many as you want I

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.730 
ahead and sell her as many as you want I
usually<00:04:45.180> keep<00:04:45.390> about<00:04:45.660> ten<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.110> mine<00:04:46.320> until

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
usually keep about ten of mine until

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.870 
usually keep about ten of mine until
where<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:46.950> just<00:04:47.130> in<00:04:47.280> case<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.550> want<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.730> come

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
where you just in case I want to come

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.730 
where you just in case I want to come
back<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.330> do<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.840> duplication<00:04:49.410> glitch<00:04:49.440> again

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
back and do the duplication glitch again

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.930 
back and do the duplication glitch again
and<00:04:50.750> that's<00:04:51.750> just<00:04:52.080> how<00:04:52.200> you<00:04:52.260> get<00:04:52.940> infinite

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
and that's just how you get infinite

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.060 
and that's just how you get infinite
amount<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.210> diamonds<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:54.750> once<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.740> sell<00:04:55.950> her

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
amount of diamonds and once you sell her

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.130 
amount of diamonds and once you sell her
if<00:04:56.220> you<00:04:56.340> not<00:04:56.880> make<00:04:57.090> sure<00:04:57.450> that<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.990> have<00:04:58.080> a

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
if you not make sure that you have a

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.670 
if you not make sure that you have a
checkpoint<00:04:58.650> with<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.669> bunch<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:03.680> champagne

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
checkpoint with a bunch of champagne

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.460 
checkpoint with a bunch of champagne
bottles<00:05:05.540> so<00:05:06.540> you<00:05:06.630> can<00:05:06.870> go<00:05:06.960> ahead<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:07.200> sell<00:05:07.380> her

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
bottles so you can go ahead and sell her

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.560 
bottles so you can go ahead and sell her
one<00:05:07.680> just<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:08.010> ensure<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:08.790> you'll<00:05:09.030> have<00:05:09.510> a

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
one just to ensure that you'll have a

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.170 
one just to ensure that you'll have a
lot<00:05:09.890> even<00:05:10.890> if<00:05:11.010> you<00:05:11.100> lose<00:05:11.370> them<00:05:11.580> so<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:11.940> can<00:05:12.090> go

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
lot even if you lose them so you can go

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.880 
lot even if you lose them so you can go
back<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.330> your<00:05:12.479> checkpoint<00:05:12.690> if<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.590> do<00:05:13.740> lose

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
back to your checkpoint if you do lose

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.820 
back to your checkpoint if you do lose
the<00:05:14.070> ones<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.400> drop<00:05:15.169> but<00:05:16.169> yeah<00:05:16.680> that's

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
the ones that you drop but yeah that's

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.980 
the ones that you drop but yeah that's
the<00:05:17.010> easiest<00:05:17.280> way<00:05:17.970> that<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.180> found<00:05:18.780> there

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
the easiest way that I found there

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.190 
the easiest way that I found there
there's<00:05:19.380> actually<00:05:19.800> one<00:05:19.919> easier<00:05:20.310> way<00:05:20.690> but<00:05:21.690> that

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
there's actually one easier way but that

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.930 
there's actually one easier way but that
requires<00:05:22.560> two<00:05:22.830> people<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.640> you<00:05:23.729> have<00:05:23.850> to

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
requires two people and you have to

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.040 
requires two people and you have to
trade<00:05:24.500> things<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:26.040> it's<00:05:26.810> actually<00:05:27.810> not<00:05:27.990> that

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
trade things and it's actually not that

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.630 
trade things and it's actually not that
complicated<00:05:28.500> but<00:05:28.800> you<00:05:28.950> do<00:05:29.190> have<00:05:29.280> to<00:05:29.400> have<00:05:29.430> two

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
complicated but you do have to have two

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.409 
complicated but you do have to have two
people<00:05:29.970> so<00:05:30.210> I'll<00:05:31.050> do<00:05:31.169> a<00:05:31.229> tutorial<00:05:31.440> on<00:05:31.830> that

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
people so I'll do a tutorial on that

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.190 
people so I'll do a tutorial on that
with<00:05:33.419> one<00:05:33.720> of<00:05:33.750> my<00:05:33.870> friends<00:05:34.020> out<00:05:34.320> but<00:05:35.930> yeah<00:05:36.930> and

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.670 
with one of my friends out but yeah and
this<00:05:37.979> glitch<00:05:38.400> actually<00:05:38.880> works<00:05:39.120> for<00:05:39.690> any<00:05:40.200> item

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
this glitch actually works for any item

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.860 
this glitch actually works for any item
at<00:05:40.770> all<00:05:40.860> like<00:05:41.820> here<00:05:42.419> I'll<00:05:42.539> show<00:05:42.690> you<00:05:42.720> real
