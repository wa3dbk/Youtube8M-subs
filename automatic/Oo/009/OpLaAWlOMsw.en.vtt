parking brake assembly thing works

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.770 
parking brake assembly thing works
before<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:09.000> battery<00:00:09.210> died<00:00:09.599> along<00:00:09.900> here

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780

basically you got these two cables that

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.000 
basically you got these two cables that
run<00:00:17.520> out<00:00:18.980> right<00:00:19.980> out<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:22.500> thing<00:00:22.800> right

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
run out right out to this thing right

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.370 
run out right out to this thing right
here<00:00:23.039> they<00:00:23.519> hook<00:00:23.699> into<00:00:24.090> these<00:00:24.269> ends<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:25.170> got<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
here they hook into these ends you got a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.460 
here they hook into these ends you got a
spring<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:27.090> thing<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.689> kit<00:00:28.289> right

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
spring on this thing on this kit right

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.230 
spring on this thing on this kit right
here<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.980> got<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.160> spring<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.789> runs<00:00:30.060> from

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
here you got a spring that runs from

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.560 
here you got a spring that runs from
there<00:00:30.619> over<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:32.870> that<00:00:33.870> bracket<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.649> there

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
there over to that bracket right there

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.569 
there over to that bracket right there
sometimes<00:00:36.570> after<00:00:36.840> time<00:00:37.230> time<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.160> age<00:00:38.250> these

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
sometimes after time time and age these

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.369 
sometimes after time time and age these
things<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.090> stuck<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:39.989> one's

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
things to get stuck like this one's

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.680 
things to get stuck like this one's
stuck<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.760> actually<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.540> in

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
out up underneath of there once you get

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.749 
out up underneath of there once you get
it<00:01:47.759> disassembly<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:51.860> on<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.130> model<00:01:53.369> truck

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it disassembly and on this model truck

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.880 
it disassembly and on this model truck
