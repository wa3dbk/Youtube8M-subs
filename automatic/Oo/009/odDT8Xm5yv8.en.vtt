00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
cover you can't believe this is actually

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060 
cover you can't believe this is actually
only<00:01:54.540> two<00:01:54.810> bucks<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.409> let's<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
only two bucks and let's see if it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.280 
only two bucks and let's see if it
actually<00:01:56.100> works<00:01:56.780> because<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.110> doesn't

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
actually works because if that doesn't

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.490 
actually works because if that doesn't
work<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.439> that's<00:01:59.340> bullcrap<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.469> go

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
work then that's bullcrap so here we go

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.139 
work then that's bullcrap so here we go
plug<00:02:02.100> handed<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.899> works<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:05.729> reason<00:02:06.060> why

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
plug handed and it works the reason why

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.180 
plug handed and it works the reason why
you<00:02:06.210> guys<00:02:06.360> didn't<00:02:06.659> hear<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.320> why<00:02:08.129> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you guys didn't hear it and why you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.219 
you guys didn't hear it and why you
didn't<00:02:08.550> hear<00:02:08.789> me<00:02:08.910> unlocking<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.569> because<00:02:09.840> my

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
didn't hear me unlocking is because my

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.860 
didn't hear me unlocking is because my

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
I don't know yep yep I was just a little

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.330 
I don't know yep yep I was just a little
tiny<00:03:05.010> light<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.609> like<00:03:06.299> once<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.629> unplugged<00:03:07.019> it

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
tiny light here like once I unplugged it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.000 
tiny light here like once I unplugged it
here<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.549> we<00:03:08.760> saw<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.150> little<00:03:09.390> tiny<00:03:09.569> um

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.339 

that<00:03:14.010> little<00:03:14.310> tiny<00:03:14.549> on<00:03:15.650> link<00:03:16.650> right<00:03:16.859> there<00:03:16.889> and

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
that little tiny on link right there and

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:24.440 
that little tiny on link right there and
if<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.739> powering<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:22.160> yep<00:03:23.160> it's<00:03:23.669> a<00:03:23.790> one-year

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
if it is powering so yep it's a one-year

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.420 
if it is powering so yep it's a one-year
actually<00:03:24.720> plot<00:03:24.930> when<00:03:25.109> you<00:03:25.200> plug<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.620> by

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
actually plot when you plug it in by

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.699 
actually plot when you plug it in by
itself<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:27.060> actually<00:03:27.269> lights<00:03:27.630> up<00:03:27.810> guys<00:03:28.560> can

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
itself it actually lights up guys can

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.229 
itself it actually lights up guys can
see<00:03:28.859> there<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.669> it<00:03:29.730> tells<00:03:29.879> you<00:03:29.970> how<00:03:30.090> many

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
see there so it tells you how many

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.059 
see there so it tells you how many
percent<00:03:30.419> slef<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.169> one<00:03:31.500> more<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.950> then

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
percent slef and one more and then

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.099 
percent slef and one more and then
probably<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.060> will<00:03:33.329> light<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.599> and<00:03:33.750> that

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
probably this will light up and that

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.800 
probably this will light up and that
saying<00:03:34.889> it's<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.099> full<00:03:35.280> charge<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.790> when<00:03:36.599> your

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
saying it's a full charge and when your

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.479 
saying it's a full charge and when your
truck<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.349> also<00:03:37.500> charge<00:03:37.859> them<00:03:38.190> all<00:03:38.370> at

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
truck you can also charge them all at

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.770 
truck you can also charge them all at
the<00:03:38.609> same<00:03:38.730> time<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:42.060> went<00:03:42.239> right
