00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:13.620
 find the recipes 750 grams with 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.330
 samsung there you go see a recipe 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.680
 an ass package in the casserole then 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.910
 that the cast iron casserole some 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.230
 advantage is that we will sell bread well 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.689
 crisp and at the same time as I look 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.820
 all by basing the recipe it's because 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.650
 nadia it now there for the bread you 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.609
 chose Russian white bread for example 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.590
 that simple 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.990
 so we're going to be nothing for the family 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.320
 yeah I put salt a big past 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.930
 the one on one side here is an inferred amphitheater 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 dif of fresh baker's yeast 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.989
 but you can of course 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.030
 yeast wise and you divide the weight by 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.680
 two and there as I will knead to the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.910
 hand I will use small water to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.980
 little like that I 'll see exactly the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.149
 dough not oppose are just because you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.250
 to agree the remainder road is all 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.149
 little bit of flour from your tips I 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.649
 add a little bit of water to 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.960
 go get the flour that in the bottom of 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.250
 container obviously a drummer 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.250
 hung it works very well too 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 the nadiÃ¨re train to knead the dough for 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.720
 give body posed plasticity 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.520
 that's what will allow the train to 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.119
 pushing okay is the end word of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.220
 but there it's good it's not ready 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.860
 we worked for 5 minutes at the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.560
 give body to body and we give it 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.460
 in the little bowl we will film 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.810
 we will put it in a corner of the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.580
 cooking we will wait for his double 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.200
 triple volume immediately at 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.880
 inch label you have you look at it 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.220
 kept going over all you go 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.330
 that it is nickel know alas you will be able 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.750
 to do is we are going to burst bubbles 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.979
 okay we will fold and release 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.390
 h awake it smells very very good it's 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.970
 without really the first one 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.210
 fermentation its forms of fresh bread there 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 she hunts leers and that's all 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.240
 does it's called a name for the throttle 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.619
 a degassing okay just a little 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 moment then after we will double the force 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.899
 one and in ghoul the bread casserole is 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.910
 very simple ball here doc 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.940
 what did others do then we 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.920
 will assume the cutting against and 210.6 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.620
 roman sato for that just like that 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.850
 hockey and after we need water a 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.380
 little bit of water do not do that he in 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.190
 does not occupy it perfectly 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.140
 need a little bit of moisture 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.790
 agree to form a little bit 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.400
 water at the mill face we follow the bottom 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:39.239
 okay ag wanted my paw 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.750
 yeah and I put it down gently 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.959
 Set the table 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.120
 Here there is a lot to put on 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.760
 contract goes like this and we will leave 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.410
 push we will let the dough redouble 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.670
 new goal 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.050
 and after we go the bush it takes a 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.330
 just a little bit of time in a corner of 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.580
 the kitchen the most yes corner for 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.710
 offer by the window next to a 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.030
 radiator next to the fireplace a 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.860
 beautiful all you will see the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.860
 cooking and go in this area 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.310
 this is the shoot keep it that's 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.510
 magnificent 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.700
 the man is very little flour 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.490
 it's for a visual effect there ok here 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.090
 and so it's secret what is acision 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.790
 go ahead show you how do you 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.890
 such decisions like that it's okay 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.120
 allow the leyre to escape 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.700
 during cooking and from friends of 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.640
 blow up here will have evolved covered 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.260
 if we put the lid do not have to the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.380
 thigh so then after heat your 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.750
 oven at 220 230 degrees - really make 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.110
 very hot and we will leather 30-40 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.930
 minutes 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.090
 will you go 25 to 30 minutes of 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.230
 cooking we did not have much gold if you 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.450
 find that it lacks colors 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.310
 do not hesitate to write me a moment without 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.080
 covered you have how beautiful it is 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.730
 will leave him a little cool 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.200
 in the casserole and kept in some 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.570
 really really crappy thing all 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.220
 it sounds hollow 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.959
 it sounds hollow his friends that he is 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.630
 perfect we will put it on a grid 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.340
 if it's okay for my return here and 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.660
 especially we will wait cool the 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.590
 more difficult in the escaping recipe 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.650
 they cool before tasting 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.060
 a tango jury rating beautiful form is 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.300
