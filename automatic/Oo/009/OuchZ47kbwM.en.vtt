while<00:05:24.229> I'm<00:05:24.410> not<00:05:24.440> a<00:05:24.620> huge<00:05:25.190> fan<00:05:25.310> of<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.729> song<00:05:26.090> I

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
while I'm not a huge fan of that song I

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.420 
while I'm not a huge fan of that song I
thought<00:05:26.810> that<00:05:26.990> pentatonics<00:05:27.620> obviously<00:05:28.160> did<00:05:28.400> a

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
thought that pentatonics obviously did a

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.430 
thought that pentatonics obviously did a
really<00:05:28.820> killer<00:05:29.090> job<00:05:29.449> on<00:05:29.690> it<00:05:29.810> I<00:05:29.900> can't<00:05:30.110> so<00:05:30.259> it's

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
really killer job on it I can't so it's

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.230 
really killer job on it I can't so it's
my<00:05:30.560> favorite<00:05:30.830> on<00:05:31.130> here<00:05:31.430> but<00:05:31.789> I<00:05:31.820> think<00:05:32.090> their

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
my favorite on here but I think their

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.480 
my favorite on here but I think their
female<00:05:32.599> vocalists<00:05:33.169> really<00:05:33.650> nailed<00:05:33.949> it<00:05:34.130> you

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
female vocalists really nailed it you

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.710
