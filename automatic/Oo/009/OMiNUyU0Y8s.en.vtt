00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
says groove play so you can load

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.340 
says groove play so you can load
individual<00:02:00.450> patterns<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.930> each<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.229> these

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
individual patterns on each one of these

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.499 
individual patterns on each one of these
keys<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.979> then<00:02:02.520> by<00:02:02.670> pressing<00:02:02.820> groove<00:02:03.270> play

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
keys and then by pressing groove play

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.270 
keys and then by pressing groove play
you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.990> call<00:02:04.229> recall<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.829> very<00:02:05.040> very

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you can call recall them very very

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.530 
you can call recall them very very
quickly<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.000> hold<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> key

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
quickly so if I hold the key

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.200 
quickly so if I hold the key

that's<00:02:09.210> a<00:02:09.300> whole<00:02:09.479> peat<00:02:09.780> pattern<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.410> one

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that's a whole peat pattern on this one

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.210 
that's a whole peat pattern on this one
and<00:02:11.460> that<00:02:11.700> pattern<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.270> one<00:02:13.070> now<00:02:14.070> of

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and that pattern on this one now of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.560 
and that pattern on this one now of
course<00:02:14.370> there's<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.820> lot<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.060> pads<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.420> it'd<00:02:15.540> be

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
course there's a lot of pads and it'd be

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.970 
course there's a lot of pads and it'd be
very<00:02:15.630> difficult<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.200> play<00:02:16.380> real-time<00:02:16.800> so

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
very difficult to play real-time so

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.310 
very difficult to play real-time so
they've<00:02:17.100> given<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.580> step<00:02:18.540> button<00:02:19.080> here

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
they've given you this step button here

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.440 
they've given you this step button here
which<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:20.130> basically<00:02:20.340> hold<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.090> hold<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
which you basically hold and hold the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.760 
which you basically hold and hold the
pad<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.900> keeps<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.620> if<00:02:22.709> I

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
pad and it keeps it for you so if I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.010 
pad and it keeps it for you so if I
wanted<00:02:23.040> dum<00:02:23.280> say<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.060> hi-hat<00:02:24.450> pattern<00:02:24.810> there

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
wanted dum say that hi-hat pattern there

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.960 
wanted dum say that hi-hat pattern there
I<00:02:25.170> would<00:02:25.560> actually<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:25.860> press<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.550> and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
I would actually just press this and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.780 
I would actually just press this and
higher<00:02:27.209> C<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.050> stays<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.500> now<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.430> go<00:02:29.550> along

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
higher C it stays on now I can go along

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:39.410 
higher C it stays on now I can go along
and<00:02:29.940> press<00:02:30.120> anything<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.540> want<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:39.270> if<00:02:39.300> I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
and press anything I want to so if I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.940 
and press anything I want to so if I
want<00:02:39.600> any<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.780> these<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.050> stay<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.440> again<00:02:40.800> do

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
want any of these to stay on again do

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.620 
want any of these to stay on again do
the<00:02:41.070> same<00:02:41.100> thing<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.880> work<00:02:42.150> out<00:02:42.300> something

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
the same thing and work out something

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.850 
the same thing and work out something
else<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.900> loop<00:02:46.050> will<00:02:46.080> loop<00:02:46.380> around<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
else so the loop will loop around the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.199 
else so the loop will loop around the
thing<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.250> will<00:02:47.340> actually<00:02:47.489> let<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.880> sequence

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
thing it will actually let you sequence

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.940 
thing it will actually let you sequence
the<00:02:48.300> whole<00:02:48.450> thing<00:02:48.690> like<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.350> very<00:02:49.380> cool

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the whole thing like that so very cool

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.040 
the whole thing like that so very cool
little<00:02:50.310> way<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.700> sequencing<00:02:51.600> your<00:02:51.690> patterns

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
little way of sequencing your patterns

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.960 
little way of sequencing your patterns
together<00:02:52.230> other<00:02:53.160> things<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.520> gives<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:53.940> a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
together other things it gives you is a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.210 
together other things it gives you is a
nice<00:02:54.150> effects<00:02:54.540> processor<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.260> compressor

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
nice effects processor and compressor

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.160 
nice effects processor and compressor
and<00:02:56.310> EQ<00:02:56.400> again<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.450> can<00:02:57.570> just<00:02:57.720> press<00:02:57.900> these

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
and EQ again you can just press these

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.570 
and EQ again you can just press these
you<00:02:58.350> see<00:02:58.530> what's<00:02:58.709> in<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.950> screen<00:02:59.190> here<00:02:59.370> says

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
you see what's in the screen here says

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.699 
you see what's in the screen here says
studio<00:03:00.000> compression<00:03:00.989> real<00:03:01.170> reverb<00:03:01.470> rather

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
studio compression real reverb rather

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.699 
studio compression real reverb rather
and<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.220> can<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.550> add<00:03:03.330> descend<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.200> increase

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
and I can just add descend and increase

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.690 
and I can just add descend and increase
that<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.190> we're<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.120> hear<00:03:06.360> more<00:03:07.700> here

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
that and we're going to hear more here

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.479 
that and we're going to hear more here
the<00:03:08.850> effect<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.750> reverb<00:03:10.590> type<00:03:10.950> sound<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:11.430> the

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the effect of a reverb type sound in the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.009 
the effect of a reverb type sound in the
backing<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:13.709> very<00:03:14.130> clever<00:03:14.489> box<00:03:14.820> as<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.720> say<00:03:15.870> it

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
backing so very clever box as I say it

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.750 
backing so very clever box as I say it
can<00:03:16.200> be<00:03:16.320> battery-powered<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:17.160> got<00:03:17.310> ins<00:03:17.580> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
can be battery-powered it's got ins and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.220 
can be battery-powered it's got ins and
outs<00:03:17.880> on<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.120> back<00:03:18.239> here<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.570> media<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.049> so

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
outs on the back here like media and so

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.900 
outs on the back here like media and so
on<00:03:19.350> along<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.650> back<00:03:19.830> which<00:03:20.519> means<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.790> can

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
on along the back which means you can

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.280 
on along the back which means you can
control<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.299> from<00:03:21.330> another<00:03:21.660> product<00:03:21.959> another
