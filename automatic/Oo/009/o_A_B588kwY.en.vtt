00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.160
 shout that mode that the pilot 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.769
 skids on corners leaving behind 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.769
 of the car escape recalls this movie 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.050
 already imagined doing it on two wheels 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.570
 the idea of ​​the rodrigo motorcycle that is 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:59.660
 Leandro's head two years ago but only 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:01:01.790
 now stepped off the paper and start 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.009
 mode is a huge challenge. 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.350
 because I keep thinking of theory 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.690
 the whole time I have to do more 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.759
 You never have anything like this in practice 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.470
 year off road a pretty earring on 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.200
 off-road side slip but it's on 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.460
 earth earth slides asphalt is going 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.780
 against everything I do in 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.500
 motovelocidade that fights not to 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.820
 slip 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.950
 Here I have to provoke motorcycle. 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.410
 slip so I'm not apprehensive 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.930
 I know what he's going to do. He'll learn. 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.720
 the new technique in this prototype 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.149
 first registered in Brazil created by 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.450
 he and the mechanic marcelo peixoto o 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.340
 heart is from yamaha r1 rocks this 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.560
 motorcycle and elongated by a distance 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.959
 between axes the greater the greater 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.479
 distance, she has a 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:47.149
 reaction that loses grip on the 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.830
 rear wheel but it's still far away 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.110
 of being in the final product 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.690
 she's elongated she touched the tire already with 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.920
 differential brake system calibration 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.649
 with hose 0 lice 1.5 tablets 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.030
 sports exhaust and just think that in the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.220
 second stage 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.599
 I'm going to change a lot a frankstein 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.729
 On wheels 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.170
 can our pilot tame 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.090
 this beast 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.560
 Look today the first time I'm 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.540
 with a lot of desire to ride a motorcycle and 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.250
 noticed the same time because I'm with 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.840
 I confess that I'm very afraid 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.210
 something that I do not know how to do I'll have to 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.210
 learn to walk and now it's already here 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.710
 two years thinking about how the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.710
 first time though 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.090
 I used the off road technique a lot 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.580
 for insecurity it is sometimes I 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.440
 I slipped too much and had to hit my foot 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.790
 on the floor to vote otherwise I would have fallen 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.560
 from the moment I pick up 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.489
 very technical and improve the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.080
 motorcycle 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.200
 the idea always with two feet in the 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.150
 I already did a lot more than 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.920
 imagined my fear was to say no 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.810
 can carry side can not 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.489
 by side sample and I think that in 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.489
 two tries and I won 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.040
 and we go to the track and addicts a thousand and then I 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.330
 I'll be fine, but improving the bike. 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.920
 improving the environment 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.310
 I think it will be much cooler than the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.310
 expected 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.240
 my biggest surprise was the wear and tear on the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.090
 I thought a tire would last the day. 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.430
 whole tire is delaying what 30 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.310
 minutes of training, not even that, and ends now 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.710
 were two full rear tires were 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.710
 tires and ended up completely 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.660
 I got on track for having more area 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.170
 exhaust is wider I could 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.630
 learn from the best and coffee and the 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.140
 drift is simple and relatively simple 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.820
 huh 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.040
 but you have to in the middle of the curve licata 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.140
 The front brake is the one that regulates the 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.090
 the rear will slip and the 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.010
 The speed I'm going to make the curve is 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.610
 the technique is very much on the front brake 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.610
 clutch 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.090
 destroyed tires and other exalto ine are 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.090
 fulfilled 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.020
 It's too good a taco just starting the 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.430
 The first day you have to improve the 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.130
 bike improve a lot in my condition 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.030
 physics my technique on the bike 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.160
 in the river 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.650
 to await the next issues of the 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.340
 involve much more difficulties 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.919
 you will see 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.009
 You're promised now, just wait for the 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.970
 next videos a motorcycle and pilot ready 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.009
 for the dnit 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.470
 subscribe to the channel and leandro and stay 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.470
 inside the news is the next
