00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.010
 in the following video we will illustrate the 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.980
 different modes of operation that 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.410
 erjon system can control and also 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.779
 how to activate each of them using 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.240
 the thermostat touch the way of 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.590
 operation establishes how it will work 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.600
 to the system 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.239
 it is set by the thermostat 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.690
 configured as a teacher and is common for 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.770
 all installation in the installation 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.230
 integrated with interface of 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.629
 communication and hard area so yes 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.480
 sets for both the system and the

 following stop operation modes 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.450
 all the installation will shut down e 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.640
 all engines will close at 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.640
 regardless of the settings it was a 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.500
 in the environment this mode is useful

 ventilation the air conditioner 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.310
 will only work by ventilating will be 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.770
 ventilate all the areas where the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.979
 set temperature is lower than 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.450
 ambient temperature useful way in 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.360
 little hot cold days this way 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.240
 functioning will only work with 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.030
 the air conditioner will be cold

 whose set temperature is lower 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.229
 of the room temperature 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.420
 dehumidification this way of 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.520
 operation is available in 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.039
 installations with air conditioners that

 they have this feature and they are 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.179
 integrated through the interface of 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.759
 herzon communication her 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.650
 operation is similar to the price mode 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.739
 with the particularity that reduces 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.810
 relative humidity in the environment and the way 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.060
 appropriate operation for non 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.730
 too cool the environment
