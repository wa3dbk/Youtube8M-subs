00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
space ship a space rocket ship and I

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.299 
space ship a space rocket ship and I
thought<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.440> would<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.769> good<00:00:13.860> spot<00:00:13.980> cuz

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
thought this would be a good spot cuz

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.070 
thought this would be a good spot cuz

oh my god anyways uh nor that racism
first<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.559> need<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> build<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.130> base<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.790> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
first you need to build a base like this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.660 
first you need to build a base like this
build<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.930> layer<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.430> preferably<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
build one layer up preferably with a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.979 
build one layer up preferably with a
different<00:00:39.090> color<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.480> make<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> look<00:00:39.809> better

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
different color and make it look better

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
different color and make it look better
build<00:00:40.559> more<00:00:40.800> onto<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.760> then

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
build more onto it as you can see then

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
build more onto it as you can see then
built<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.510> back<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.170> extend<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
built it back up like this extend the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.270 
built it back up like this extend the
back<00:00:44.370> make<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> doorway<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.280> looking

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
back make a doorway out of it looking

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.139 
back make a doorway out of it looking
pretty<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.730> far

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
pretty good so far

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.779 
pretty good so far
it's<00:00:48.989> great<00:00:49.289> symmetry<00:00:49.649> extend<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> front

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
it's great symmetry extend the front

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.069 
it's great symmetry extend the front
like<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:52.219> amazing

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
like so amazing

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
like so amazing
cover<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> top<00:00:55.260> again<00:00:55.649> break<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> hole<00:00:56.910> there

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
cover the top again break a hole there

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.610 
cover the top again break a hole there
I'm<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.690> importantly<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.199> need<00:00:58.320> wings

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
I'm so importantly you need wings

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
I'm so importantly you need wings
perfect<00:00:59.489> perfect<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.510> look<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
perfect perfect all look at that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.319 
perfect perfect all look at that
symmetry<00:01:01.230> gorgeous<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.760> must<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
symmetry gorgeous now we must do the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
symmetry gorgeous now we must do the
difficult<00:01:03.899> part<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.320> circuitry<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
difficult part the circuitry this is the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.890 
difficult part the circuitry this is the
most<00:01:05.610> important<00:01:05.970> part<00:01:06.210> because<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.570> rocket

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
most important part because it is rocket

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.649 
most important part because it is rocket
science<00:01:06.930> indeed<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.210> complete<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
science indeed so to complete the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.060 
science indeed so to complete the
circuitry<00:01:10.049> you're<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> need<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> put

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
circuitry you're going to need to put

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.240 
circuitry you're going to need to put
some<00:01:11.220> redstone<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:12.240> make<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.710> doohickeys

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
some redstone to make the the doohickeys

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.410 
some redstone to make the the doohickeys
dust<00:01:14.880> work<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:15.869> launch<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.470> net<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.729> code

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.960 

there's<00:01:21.420> repeaters<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.409> we're<00:01:23.070> done<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.670> space

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
there's repeaters go we're done in space

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.370 
there's repeaters go we're done in space
it's<00:01:24.270> pretty<00:01:24.509> depressing<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> gonna<00:01:25.170> put

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it's pretty depressing so you gonna put

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.530 
it's pretty depressing so you gonna put
some<00:01:25.409> nice<00:01:26.130> lighting<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.640> back<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
some nice lighting in the back in a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.050 
some nice lighting in the back in a
spaceship<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:27.960> some<00:01:28.380> some<00:01:28.770> grass<00:01:29.060> because

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
spaceship and some some grass because

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.520 
spaceship and some some grass because
there's<00:01:30.210> no<00:01:30.329> flowers<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.780> space<00:01:31.079> everyone

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
there's no flowers in space everyone

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.760 
there's no flowers in space everyone
knows<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.320> plan<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
knows that it's and if you do plan to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.649 
knows that it's and if you do plan to
eat<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.189> gotta<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.460> Everton<00:01:35.759> furnace<00:01:36.150> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
eat you gotta have Everton furnace so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.469 
eat you gotta have Everton furnace so
that's<00:01:36.869> important<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.829> some<00:01:38.479> case

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that's important to have and some case

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.580 
that's important to have and some case
you<00:01:39.659> wanna<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:39.960> top<00:01:40.079> your<00:01:40.259> spaceship

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you wanna get on top your spaceship

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
you wanna get on top your spaceship
here's<00:01:40.829> some<00:01:40.950> extra<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.280> don't<00:01:41.460> lateral

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
here's some extra I don't lateral

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.840 
here's some extra I don't lateral
hellooo<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:43.170> letters<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.189> pull<00:01:44.729> off

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
hellooo some letters or you can pull off

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.460 
hellooo some letters or you can pull off
the<00:01:44.970> wall<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.540> top<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:46.049> shape<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the wall and put on top of a shape to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.770 
the wall and put on top of a shape to
comp<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.770> top<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.070> deck<00:01:47.280> every<00:01:47.750> ship<00:01:48.750> needs

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
comp on top of the deck every ship needs

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.649 
comp on top of the deck every ship needs
a<00:01:49.380> front<00:01:49.979> piece<00:01:50.159> whatever<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.210> called<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.630> I

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
a front piece whatever it's called so I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.609 
a front piece whatever it's called so I
put<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.170> here

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
put this right here

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
put this right here
so<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.070> that'll<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.520> our<00:01:53.759> rudolph<00:01:54.149> it'll

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
so now that'll be like our rudolph it'll
