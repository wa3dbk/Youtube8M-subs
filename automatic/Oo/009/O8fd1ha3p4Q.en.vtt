00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.900
 servus we are fabi again and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.970
 daniel von text lte i know that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.189
 always a class says 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.720
 music makes you feel good 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.199
 as you can if you like the aces and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.849
 that is very important we are still 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.890
 Visiting samsung here in the context of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.369
 the ces in las vegas and what we do here 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:37.079
 The medium-sized tablet is that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:43.590
 galaxy note per 10 a galaxy per galaxy 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.149
 I can say that is dam 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.649
 but ever beautiful but we have the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.570
 here and it is very very chic it is 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.489
 really nice the display has us 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.079
 right at the beginning is blown away display 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.329
 awesome because it has a very neat 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.079
 Resolution 2560 x 1600 pixels at 10 12 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.879
 when i do my homework now 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.090
 I would have known how many pixels 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.220
 per inch that's yes I know what I mean 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 I think finding out tells something 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.830
 about the software so I can not 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 calculates very fast 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.189
 it runs android 4 4 2 on it newest 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.479
 android version states we have 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.790
 just noticed by already are the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.600
 The first devices we ever put up here 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.509
 the ces had 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.280
 it runs the samsung own surface 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.689
 In this case, what's up on it 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.130
 samsung here in the context of the iss first time 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.829
 has presented a bit 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.820
 flipboard character so you want to build 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.680
 So the own content on the front of 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.060
 put it on the tray and open up 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 a look the most important 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.880
 Information you have every day 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.350
 to capture 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.720
 The whole thing is relatively easy 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.479
 if you once with the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.310
 finger on it you can click here 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.450
 the whole just put together like 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.920
 one would like it so which partly 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.149
 politics is clicked on and then 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.759
 maybe still design or something and 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.860
 eat and immediately the areas of interest 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.070
 be joined together and then leave 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.990
 but these are also here 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.910
 Just adjust the size that is called 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.930
 can be the only place to 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.860
 example more important than politics in this 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.170
 nothing will happen yet 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.680
 Eaten today and you have to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.170
 say currently takes place outside 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.600
 without us exactly what we do 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.870
 sit here and chick ours 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.920
 account for pps so I have it here 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.020
 made a bit bigger so you see 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.950
 that can be wonderful together 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.739
 so what else can you say 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.140
 the surface is natural here 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.940
 the well-known things as well 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.830
 floating windows and so on here 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.989
 it can be small then I can make it big 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.810
 So you can of course move that 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.130
 You already know that and already 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.410
 of course, make a wish and big 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.720
 then you can do such things here as well 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.550
 do as I do multitasking 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.480
 so to speak and pushes another 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.209
 application pure 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.580
 This can then be, for example, too 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.800
 move the know all the fans 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.269
 from the North Rhine already this version 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.959
 was yes I think at the ihf first 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.150
 times presented 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.920
 and that's what samsung has got here in the skeleton 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.860
 sicap also installed 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.670
 that's how this window works 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.310
 just move 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.660
 great round story so I have now 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.110
 meanwhile my homework too 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.200
 made 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.570
 we have almost 300 pixels per inch 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 that's a bit below the wonder 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.440
 Honestly, if it's really good 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.820
 So sharp is easy 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.459
 below what apple under the 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.500
 names marie tina distributes, however 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.930
 is the difference so small that one 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.739
 he is not sure about the tablets 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.769
 even so not synonymous with the iphone 5 s 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.610
 report 326 I will but say it 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.380
 I believe in the tablets it is 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:00.459
 ipad mini resource is not it at all 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:03.610
 definitely support 264 at akh has 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.630
 he could not be better 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.100
 he could not be better 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.470
 daniel triggered alarm what stands beside 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.870
 A garbage bin loses the bet against 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.320
 me no it is not clear yet me 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.770
 believe it will continue 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.030
 that is exactly what we have from the 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.500
 hardware we have exactly 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.410
 the same equipment as the big one 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.850
 brother of the 12 2 inch version there is 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.810
 two versions do not know a brother 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.850
 is because that is another 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.400
 I had just shit with the flight the 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.310
 yes the story is the emergency 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.970
 Variant yes difference is not here 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.950
 piece is true yes but still 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.230
 it actually almost a brother or na 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.430
 yes, I would rather say sat 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:52.190
 nephew we agree on the core the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.620
 Equipment is like the nephew or how 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.450
 at the corsa from me also there are two 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.000
 executions the execution is with 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:03.350
 Without hesitating, let her go again 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.130
 samsung own ex us5 with 19 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:12.070
 but 1.9 ghz and the lti run 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.070
 snapdragon 800 from qualcomm with 2 3 ghz 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.900
 Rear 8 megapixel camera from the 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.740
 page 2 megapixel camera will be 3 gb ram 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.650
 A war must shake two with it 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.790
 you train differently than at 12 2 yes 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.630
 almost all that is almost so ok 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.900
 Nonetheless, it is a very 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.770
 proper equipment we have 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.700
 but again unrestricted 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.490
 unrestricted class finally, too 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.290
 often too high you are happy if I am 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.230
 then just not at all like 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.480
 a little bit i want to chris all the time 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.900
 what the back say we have here 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.940
 art plastic leather so plastic in 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.360
 leather look and what about the white one 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.790
 version of is I notice earlier the 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.370
 note 12 52 black this is 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.800
 the white version gives both models 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.130
 in both versions and on the 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.310
 This white model is dark 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.390
 Traces significantly more than on the 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.820
 black version 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.350
 that means knows one or the other 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.060
 Others better if you but 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.100
 wanted the device for a long time good 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.580
 I would grab the black one 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.840
 that's exactly what we have otherwise 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.340
 even if we go for it 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.110
 stereo speaker left right 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.100
 phone jack from a taster 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.650
 volume control infrared port and two 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:41.550
 for micro sd and there are 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:43.920
 Of course optional yes yes that 's me 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:50.610
 unfortunately not yet it is so easy there 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:54.260
 weighs 350 grams just so clearly 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:56.880
 less than all but two major notches 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.620
 8220 mAh battery 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.350
 that's not very true 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.030
 very good for the size, above all 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:08.550
 That should always be neat throughout the day 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:11.910
 relatively hard uses just because buy 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:16.500
 I look at if it would buy not the 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:20.070
 can afford great price, we know 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.840
 but not here but it comes 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.640
 also in the first quarter what yes it comes 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.570
 also in the first quarter that means we 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.710
 do not have to spend too much time on the 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:35.220
 Price wait and that was the galaxy tab 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:39.030
 per ten.de lexi per tab 10 1 name of 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.650
 with tab 10.1 is good appetite until then 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.820
 charts oasis there are eight and 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.500
 do not forget to subscribe 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.500
 thanks to the spectator
