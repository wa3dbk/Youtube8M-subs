00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
putting on my clothes this is already in
a<00:01:49.829> bundle<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.579> since<00:01:51.060> I'm<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.540> doing<00:01:51.750> an

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
a bundle and since I'm just doing an

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
a bundle and since I'm just doing an
ombre<00:01:52.259> I'm<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.159> leave<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
ombre I'm going to leave it with a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
ombre I'm going to leave it with a
rubber<00:01:53.909> band<00:01:54.000> around<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.720> end<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
rubber band around the end because I

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.100 
rubber band around the end because I
think<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.579> better<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.899> way

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
think it's going to be better that way

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.200 
think it's going to be better that way
because<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.770> keeps<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.040> hair<00:01:59.159> together<00:01:59.310> just

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
because it keeps the hair together just

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.969 
because it keeps the hair together just
make<00:02:00.390> sure<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.659> combed<00:02:00.930> out<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> real

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
make sure it's combed out with a real

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.010 
make sure it's combed out with a real
comb<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.430> your<00:02:02.610> hands<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.270> actually<00:02:03.930> I'm

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020

this<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.840> Peruvian<00:02:36.380> body<00:02:36.620> wave<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.700> does

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
this is Peruvian body wave so it does

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.030 
this is Peruvian body wave so it does
curled<00:02:38.480> up<00:02:38.690> but<00:02:39.440> I'm<00:02:39.560> going<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.709> try<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:39.890> get

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
curled up but I'm going to try and get

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.589 
curled up but I'm going to try and get
as<00:02:40.160> straight<00:02:40.520> as<00:02:40.610> possible<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:41.390> might

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
as straight as possible it might

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.210 
as straight as possible it might
actually<00:02:41.690> be<00:02:41.870> more<00:02:42.110> plausible<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.830> straighten

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
actually be more plausible to straighten

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.500 
actually be more plausible to straighten
it<00:02:43.280> with<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.459> actual<00:02:43.700> flat<00:02:43.970> iron<00:02:44.120> before

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
it with the actual flat iron before

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.540 
it with the actual flat iron before
doing<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.930> actually<00:02:45.800> says<00:02:46.010> Matt<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.430> use

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
doing this actually says Matt to use

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.620 
doing this actually says Matt to use
heat<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:46.940> glad<00:02:47.180> i<00:02:47.209> didn't<00:02:47.569> priest<00:02:47.840> renew<00:02:48.230> so

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
heat so glad i didn't priest renew so

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.360 
heat so glad i didn't priest renew so
now<00:02:50.630> go<00:02:50.810> ahead<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.110> mix<00:02:51.319> my<00:02:51.650> bleach<00:02:52.250> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
now go ahead and mix my bleach the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:01.260 
now go ahead and mix my bleach the
courts<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.760> directions

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:09.100 

you

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.570 

just<00:03:10.110> make<00:03:10.260> sure<00:03:10.290> all<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.680> product<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.190> mixed

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
just make sure all the product is mixed

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.080 
just make sure all the product is mixed
properly

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.699 

and<00:03:15.629> that's<00:03:15.780> about<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.080> consistency<00:03:16.379> you

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
and that's about the consistency you

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.869 
and that's about the consistency you
want<00:03:17.360> not<00:03:18.360> too<00:03:18.629> thin<00:03:18.989> not<00:03:19.019> too<00:03:19.319> thick<00:03:19.819> going<00:03:20.819> to

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
want not too thin not too thick going to

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.729 
want not too thin not too thick going to
start<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.300> shortest<00:03:21.660> hair<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.349> 14

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
start the shortest hair this is the 14

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.410 
start the shortest hair this is the 14
inches<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.640> I'm<00:03:23.730> going<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.910> place<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.090> against

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
inches so I'm going to place it against

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.210 
inches so I'm going to place it against
my<00:03:24.510> own<00:03:24.629> head<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.319> see<00:03:25.500> how<00:03:25.620> long<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.069> old

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
my own head just to see how long the old

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.729 
my own head just to see how long the old
armory<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.700> be<00:03:26.819> so<00:03:27.300> this<00:03:27.599> is<00:03:27.720> going<00:03:27.959> at<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.500> top

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
armory to be so this is going at the top

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.800 
armory to be so this is going at the top
of<00:03:28.769> my<00:03:29.040> head<00:03:29.069> more<00:03:29.519> than<00:03:29.550> likely<00:03:29.819> only<00:03:30.510> got<00:03:30.720> to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
of my head more than likely only got to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.530 
of my head more than likely only got to
do<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> small<00:03:31.319> tip<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:32.160> ombre<00:03:32.489> so<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:33.150> would<00:03:33.360> say

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
do a small tip of ombre so I would say

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.160 
do a small tip of ombre so I would say
about<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:34.140> much<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.660> what<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.840> want<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.049> do

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
about this much so what you want to do

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.580 
about this much so what you want to do
is<00:03:40.379> lay<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.739> flat<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:43.080> can<00:03:43.260> take<00:03:43.470> it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
is lay it flat like so you can take it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.589 
is lay it flat like so you can take it
elastic<00:03:44.129> and<00:03:44.310> secure<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.879> ends<00:03:45.060> that's<00:03:45.450> what

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
elastic and secure the ends that's what

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.390 
elastic and secure the ends that's what
I<00:03:45.660> think<00:03:45.870> I'll<00:03:45.959> do<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.950> hair<00:03:47.099> doesn't

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
I think I'll do just so the hair doesn't

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.920 
I think I'll do just so the hair doesn't
move<00:03:47.430> around<00:03:47.579> as<00:03:48.150> I'm<00:03:48.329> trying<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.540> bleach<00:03:48.750> it

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
move around as I'm trying to bleach it

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.160 
move around as I'm trying to bleach it
I'm<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.650> using<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.980> ponytail<00:03:50.400> holder<00:03:51.110> think<00:03:52.110> I

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
I'm just using a ponytail holder think I

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.900 
I'm just using a ponytail holder think I
need<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.380> little<00:03:52.410> more<00:03:52.769> developer<00:03:53.340> just<00:03:53.760> a

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
need a little more developer just a
