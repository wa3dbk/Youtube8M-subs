00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
devices are two pretty cool devices here

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.020 
devices are two pretty cool devices here
actually<00:00:12.300> they<00:00:13.280> are<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.340> little<00:00:14.519> bit<00:00:14.700> different

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
devices overall and so let's just let's

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.970 
devices overall and so let's just let's
just<00:00:24.449> check<00:00:24.750> them<00:00:24.930> all<00:00:25.050> specs<00:00:25.350> was<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.740> course
