even g1 is the only square and now
Knight<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:42.980> d4<00:02:43.430> not<00:02:44.180> only<00:02:44.600> threatening<00:02:45.049> the

Queen but threatening checkmate on f3
for<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.430> while<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.880> looked<00:02:50.299> like<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.720> white

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
for a while it looked like that white

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.990 
for a while it looked like that white
found<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> solution<00:02:52.010> because<00:02:52.370> now<00:02:52.549> Queen<00:02:52.850> is

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
found the solution because now Queen is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.890 
found the solution because now Queen is
defending<00:02:53.590> f3<00:02:54.590> pawn<00:02:54.850> but<00:02:55.850> then<00:02:56.030> black<00:02:56.660> played

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
defending f3 pawn but then black played

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.430 
defending f3 pawn but then black played
another<00:02:57.500> excellent<00:02:57.950> move<00:02:58.690> rook<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.930> even

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
another excellent move rook to even

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.030 
another excellent move rook to even
check<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:02.660> course<00:03:02.959> if<00:03:03.200> Queen<00:03:03.530> takes<00:03:03.799> the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
check and of course if Queen takes the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.800
