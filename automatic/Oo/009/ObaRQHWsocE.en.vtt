assuming that's what you mean um and I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.060 
assuming that's what you mean um and I
think<00:00:30.570> mascara<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.470> my<00:00:31.590> favorite<00:00:31.890> thing

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
think mascara is my favorite thing

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.299 
think mascara is my favorite thing
because<00:00:32.219> if<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.759> had<00:00:33.059> no<00:00:33.899> makeup<00:00:34.230> at<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
because if I had no makeup at all and I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.530 
because if I had no makeup at all and I
could<00:00:35.460> only<00:00:35.579> choose<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:36.059> thing<00:00:36.300> it'd

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
could only choose one thing it'd

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.660 
could only choose one thing it'd
definitely<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.930> mascara<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.559> mascara<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
definitely be mascara because mascara is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.920 
definitely be mascara because mascara is
like<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.090> thing<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> really<00:00:39.660> just

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
like the one thing that really just

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.010 
like the one thing that really just
makes<00:00:40.370> my<00:00:41.370> eyes<00:00:41.520> pop<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.840> don't
