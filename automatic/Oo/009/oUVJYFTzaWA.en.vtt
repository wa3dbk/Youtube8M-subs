as<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.180> got<00:00:57.360> some<00:01:00.260> protective

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
as you can see it's got some protective

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.630 
as you can see it's got some protective
like<00:01:01.850> Cape<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.739> screws<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.610> the

like Cape there and the screws on the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.270 
like Cape there and the screws on the
joins<00:01:06.030> protect<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:07.170> well<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.220> way<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
joins protect it as well and the way you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
joins protect it as well and the way you
call<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> pivot<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> mic<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.049> lot

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
call it the pivot for the mic is a lot

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.859 
call it the pivot for the mic is a lot
better<00:01:13.470> than<00:01:13.650> either<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.159> lot<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.869> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
better than either one it's a lot it's a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.469 
better than either one it's a lot it's a
lot<00:01:15.900> firmer<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:17.640> noise<00:01:17.880> cancelling<00:01:18.390> at

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
lot firmer and the noise cancelling at

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480 
lot firmer and the noise cancelling at
the<00:01:18.570> end<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.049> thicker<00:01:19.470> form<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.040> imagine<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the end is thicker form so imagine that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.749 
the end is thicker form so imagine that
help<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.820> well<00:01:21.860> as<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.340> unlike<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
help as well as you can see unlike the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910 
help as well as you can see unlike the
ex<00:01:23.880> Levin's<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.630> they're<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.229> white<00:01:25.439> they

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
ex Levin's or not they're not white they

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.149 
ex Levin's or not they're not white they
are<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.130> black<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:28.229> over<00:01:28.590> X<00:01:28.740> Elevens

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
are actually black the over X Elevens

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.859 
are actually black the over X Elevens
were<00:01:29.280> white<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.850> are<00:01:30.000> black<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.180> green<00:01:30.659> I

were white these are black and green I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.310 
were white these are black and green I
think<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> match<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> new<00:01:31.619> xbox<00:01:32.369> 360

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
think it's to match the new xbox 360

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.630 
think it's to match the new xbox 360
even<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> cyber<00:01:34.920> actually<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.340> covered<00:01:35.579> in

even the cyber actually is covered in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.760 
even the cyber actually is covered in
like<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> screen<00:01:36.240> protector<00:01:36.500> no<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.530> can't

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
like a screen protector no I can't

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.469 
like a screen protector no I can't
really<00:01:37.950> get<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> off<00:01:38.250> easily<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
really get it off easily but like you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.969 
really get it off easily but like you
get<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.689> screens<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.229> phones<00:01:40.530> when<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.799> buy

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
get on screens on phones when you buy

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.850 
get on screens on phones when you buy
them<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.400> gone<00:01:41.549> down<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> cover<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
them it's gone down just to cover that

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.990 
them it's gone down just to cover that
the<00:01:43.860> only<00:01:44.040> main<00:01:44.159> difference<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:44.820> it's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the only main difference is I think it's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.810 
the only main difference is I think it's
got<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> slightly<00:01:45.420> bigger<00:01:45.600> speak<00:01:45.930> than<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> x11

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
makes loans had to go back because they

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.020 
makes loans had to go back because they
were<00:01:50.880> broken<00:01:51.149> later<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:52.200> bought<00:01:52.590> these<00:01:52.850> we<00:01:53.850> got

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
were broken later we bought these we got

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.069 
were broken later we bought these we got
the<00:01:54.149> M<00:01:54.710> Turtle<00:01:55.710> Beach<00:01:55.799> logo<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> inside

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and that's the only difference is still

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.709 
and that's the only difference is still
you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.299> fully<00:02:00.540> adjustable<00:02:01.020> oh<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.390> inside

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
made of leather which ripped on mine

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.350 
made of leather which ripped on mine
because<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.429> opening<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.000> clause<00:02:09.209> and

because of opening a clause and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420 
because of opening a clause and
obviously<00:02:09.720> taking<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.379> knock<00:02:10.530> my<00:02:10.649> head<00:02:10.770> was

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
obviously taking one knock my head was

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.000 
obviously taking one knock my head was
this<00:02:11.520> one's<00:02:11.730> from<00:02:11.970> there<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.020> that'll<00:02:13.260> be<00:02:13.349> good

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
this one's from there so that'll be good

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.130 
this one's from there so that'll be good
and<00:02:14.159> it's<00:02:14.340> lever<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.760> top<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.720> they've<00:02:15.989> got

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and it's lever on the top so they've got

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.839 
and it's lever on the top so they've got
the<00:02:16.290> best<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.620> both<00:02:16.680> worlds<00:02:17.159> really<00:02:17.310> i'd<00:02:17.549> say

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
the best of both worlds really i'd say

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.710 
the best of both worlds really i'd say
so<00:02:18.840> that's<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.110> best<00:02:19.230> way<00:02:19.439> to<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.569> so<00:02:21.569> yeah

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
so that's the best way to do it so yeah

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.319 
so that's the best way to do it so yeah
all<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.950> all<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.069> says<00:02:23.400> good<00:02:23.610> headset<00:02:24.000> i'm<00:02:24.150> not

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
all and all it says good headset i'm not

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.259 
all and all it says good headset i'm not
tested<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> audio<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.409> so<00:02:25.590> far<00:02:25.860> but<00:02:26.269> that's

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
tested the audio on it so far but that's

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.420 
tested the audio on it so far but that's
a<00:02:27.629> human<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.560> good<00:02:28.680> as<00:02:28.799> leave<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.220> I

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
a human it's as good as leave one I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.069 
a human it's as good as leave one I
don't<00:02:29.819> think<00:02:29.849> it's<00:02:30.060> going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> be<00:02:30.329> worse<00:02:30.540> I'll

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
don't think it's going to be worse I'll

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.750 
don't think it's going to be worse I'll
let<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.409> know<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.620> another<00:02:31.829> video<00:02:31.980> parlor<00:02:32.519> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
let you know in another video parlor and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.339 
let you know in another video parlor and
you'll<00:02:32.879> be<00:02:32.970> able<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.150> tell<00:02:33.329> with<00:02:33.510> my<00:02:33.720> audio

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
you'll be able to tell with my audio

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.890 
you'll be able to tell with my audio
quality<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.950> my<00:02:35.010> videos<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.510> seems<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.870> a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
quality of my videos but it seems like a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.690 
quality of my videos but it seems like a
generally<00:02:37.379> headset<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.069> they<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.430> fixed

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
generally headset that they just fixed

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.819 
generally headset that they just fixed
generally<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.569> problems<00:02:39.989> everyone<00:02:40.379> had<00:02:40.560> and

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
generally the problems everyone had and

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.520 
generally the problems everyone had and
that's<00:02:41.310> new<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.849> difference<00:02:42.209> really<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.780> I

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
that's new in difference really and I

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.720 
that's new in difference really and I
think<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:43.829> got<00:02:43.950> slightly<00:02:44.250> bigger<00:02:44.430> speak

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
think it's got slightly bigger speak

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.699 
think it's got slightly bigger speak
apparently<00:02:45.269> because<00:02:45.659> it's<00:02:45.780> got<00:02:45.930> 250

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
apparently because it's got 250

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.869 
apparently because it's got 250
millimeter<00:02:47.040> speakers<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.579> opposed<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:47.909> 240<00:02:48.480> s

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
millimeter speakers as opposed to 240 s

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.089 
millimeter speakers as opposed to 240 s
om<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.359> volume<00:02:51.780> control<00:02:52.170> has<00:02:52.319> changed<00:02:52.799> you've

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
om the volume control has changed you've

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.960 
om the volume control has changed you've
got<00:02:53.310> your<00:02:53.579> chat<00:02:53.970> which<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.780> xbox<00:02:55.079> input

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
got your chat which is the xbox input

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
got your chat which is the xbox input
your<00:02:56.970> game<00:02:57.379> which<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.409> whatever<00:02:58.650> comes

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
your game which is whatever comes

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.740 
your game which is whatever comes
through<00:02:59.129> this<00:02:59.250> green<00:02:59.549> lead<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.269> I'll<00:03:00.389> explain

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
through this green lead so I'll explain

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.970 
through this green lead so I'll explain
probably<00:03:01.079> another<00:03:01.230> video<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:01.769> put

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
probably another video that you can put

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.440 
probably another video that you can put
this<00:03:02.069> into<00:03:02.250> your<00:03:02.340> computer<00:03:02.849> if<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.000> listen<00:03:03.420> to

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
this into your computer if you listen to

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.240 
this into your computer if you listen to
music<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.769> you've<00:03:05.040> got<00:03:05.190> bass<00:03:05.609> I<00:03:05.970> think<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.299> is

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
music and you've got bass I think it is

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.530 
music and you've got bass I think it is
yeah<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> bass<00:03:08.639> boost<00:03:10.040> turbo<00:03:11.040> base<00:03:11.280> no<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:12.269> um

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
yeah a bass boost turbo base no it's um

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.420 
yeah a bass boost turbo base no it's um
so<00:03:13.290> we<00:03:13.379> don't<00:03:13.440> want<00:03:13.620> much<00:03:13.739> base<00:03:13.950> with<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.280> want

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
so we don't want much base with you want

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.949 
so we don't want much base with you want
maximum<00:03:15.000> base<00:03:15.239> which<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.540> probably<00:03:15.810> what

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
maximum base which is probably what

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.050 
maximum base which is probably what
island<00:03:16.109> of<00:03:16.319> having<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.579> obviously<00:03:17.849> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
island of having it on and obviously the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.659 
island of having it on and obviously the
mutes<00:03:18.480> microphone<00:03:18.930> feature<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:20.370> can<00:03:20.549> plug

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
mutes microphone feature and we can plug

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.280 
mutes microphone feature and we can plug
in<00:03:20.819> your<00:03:20.910> xbox<00:03:21.919> controller<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:24.840> get<00:03:25.109> the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
in your xbox controller you get the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.369 
in your xbox controller you get the
usual<00:03:25.769> game<00:03:26.579> sound<00:03:27.000> leads<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.780> put<00:03:27.959> your<00:03:28.079> AV

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
usual game sound leads to put your AV

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.369 
usual game sound leads to put your AV
into<00:03:28.730> if<00:03:29.730> using<00:03:30.090> AV<00:03:30.359> i'm<00:03:30.540> not<00:03:30.690> using<00:03:30.870> i'm<00:03:31.049> not

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
into if using AV i'm not using i'm not

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.869 
into if using AV i'm not using i'm not
i'm<00:03:31.440> using<00:03:31.620> hdmi<00:03:32.129> and<00:03:32.160> might<00:03:32.430> buy<00:03:32.579> an<00:03:32.639> adapter

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
i'm using hdmi and might buy an adapter

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.569 
i'm using hdmi and might buy an adapter
so<00:03:33.239> i<00:03:33.299> can<00:03:33.480> plug<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.560> audio<00:03:34.980> leads<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.340> as<00:03:35.459> well

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
so i can plug the audio leads in as well
