I<00:00:07.790> think<00:00:08.790> our<00:00:08.910> band<00:00:09.150> members<00:00:09.540> were<00:00:09.719> scared<00:00:10.320> of

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559

being an event with a couple I think it

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.700 
being an event with a couple I think it
often<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> bad<00:00:14.460> idea<00:00:14.570> but<00:00:15.570> if<00:00:16.049> anything<00:00:16.470> it's

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
often is a bad idea but if anything it's

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.170 
often is a bad idea but if anything it's
like<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.160> best<00:00:17.310> part<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.910> our<00:00:18.060> relationship

the satisfaction of immediately tackling

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.740 
the satisfaction of immediately tackling
one<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> many<00:00:47.100> crazy<00:00:47.550> ideas<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.420> i<00:00:48.450> have
