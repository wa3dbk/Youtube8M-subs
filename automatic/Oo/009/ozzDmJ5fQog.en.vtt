00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.750
 hello to all and all these sites 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.220
 office 14 in the company of zeal weeks 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.940
 hello how are you doing well 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.590
 perfectly fine for me too 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.970
 today we find ourselves for 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.129
 announce a brand new 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.110
 adventure an adventure that maybe you 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.870
 know and who will look like that yes 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.510
 the magnificent on the man it is not 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.670
 badly I do not have this one so it's 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.129
 it just makes you laugh and it's 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.710
 simply a series created by a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.010
 word theo which is very nice you can 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.010
 to see him 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 which adds a lot of fashion especially this 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.330
 transformation maurs mode which is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.649
 pretty nice yes quite so yeah 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.729
 we formulate good family good and that's 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.390
 so well done that we can not 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.190
 pass the gates 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.240
 yeah yeah that's it that's pretty much not 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.310
 wrong so there is a lot a lot of 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.259
 modes am here I think it's the most 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.420
 Funny considering that we can transform ourselves into 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.009
 everything and anything but we will be able to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.929
 do lots of new stuff 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.069
 Well, here I am, I do not know too much 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.310
 still mostly me because I am 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.959
 arrived the most recently but we 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.399
 do not know too much we will make one to 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.619
 two videos a week on this server 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.679
 So called Magic kraft hard 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.410
 that you probably know that the 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.310
 live started with finally the live of 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.489
 Lacq 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.520
 yokes of auxi and dabo jokes and 

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:50.280
 others started last week 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.270
 So you probably know this 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280
 we were not because we are in 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 live simply 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.209
 and suddenly we start because we've been 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.480
 guest one is with blackhawks i am at 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.400
 wolf and wool 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.740
 SLUC did I forget the launcher 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.240
 always the name madeira sq 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.750
 yeah here I am sorry I have all 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.200
 forgiven 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.280
 it'll be we'll get used to it totally from 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.720
 it's been three times we start again 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.840
 this video so this time finally because 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.620
 that the forest yes exactly so here is there 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.060
 36 fashion 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.440
 the goal is going to be 2.2 turn around 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.600
 magic just because it's 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.800
 one as its name indicates it c magic and 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.810
 on kraft so it revolves around the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.000
 magic and will have to be done from kraft 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.500
 and new things accordingly 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.900
 and it's going to be pretty nice I 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.640
 think that's quite quite everything 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.200
 did something to add my 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.000

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.400
 well that yeah I like the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.190
 to deny because we go faster but 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.720
