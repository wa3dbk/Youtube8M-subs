get<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.190> grocery<00:00:59.489> store<00:00:59.760> anywhere<00:01:01.430> and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
get in the grocery store anywhere and

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.690 
get in the grocery store anywhere and
this<00:01:04.199> jar<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.559> getting<00:01:04.920> pretty<00:01:05.129> close<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> done

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
this jar is getting pretty close to done

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.410 
this jar is getting pretty close to done
but<00:01:06.020> you're<00:01:07.020> basically<00:01:07.560> looking<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.420> 50/50

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
but you're basically looking for a 50/50

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.149 
but you're basically looking for a 50/50
ratio<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.409> really<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.799> enough<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
ratio and I don't really have enough to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.760 
ratio and I don't really have enough to
make<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.520> ratio<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.420> I'm<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
make that ratio so I'm going to have to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.820 
make that ratio so I'm going to have to
make<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> pretty<00:01:17.220> small<00:01:17.490> culture<00:01:18.140> now<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
make a pretty small culture now if I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.490 
make a pretty small culture now if I
eyeball<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:21.479> tell<00:01:21.689> about<00:01:21.810> where<00:01:22.320> I'm

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
eyeball it I can tell about where I'm

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.929 
eyeball it I can tell about where I'm
going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> put<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> other<00:01:23.340> half<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
going to put in the other half of the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.550 
going to put in the other half of the
water<00:01:26.750> we're<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> add<00:01:28.170> water<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
water we're going to add water and you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.929 
water we're going to add water and you
don't<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> stir<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.400> shake<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.850> or

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
don't have to stir it or shake it or

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
don't have to stir it or shake it or
anything<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.540> pouring<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.259> gives<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
anything just pouring it in gives you a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.480 
anything just pouring it in gives you a
nice<00:01:35.520> mix<00:01:35.909> as<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.530> mixes<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.220> very

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
nice mix as you can see mixes up very

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.580 
nice mix as you can see mixes up very
nicely<00:01:39.200> I'm<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> add<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.939> piece<00:01:41.939> Apple

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
nicely I'm going to add a piece Apple

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.160 
nicely I'm going to add a piece Apple
that<00:01:43.590> gives<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.100> food<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.729> your<00:01:45.170> vinegar

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that gives you food for your vinegar

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.910 
that gives you food for your vinegar
wheels<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.880> then<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.240> pour<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.380> from

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
wheels and then just pour some in from

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.969 
wheels and then just pour some in from
an<00:01:50.040> existing<00:01:50.340> culture<00:01:51.020> if<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.350> bought<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.860> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
an existing culture if you bought it you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.370 
an existing culture if you bought it you
got<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.340> tiny<00:01:53.640> thing<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.869> poor<00:01:55.170> end

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
got a little tiny thing the poor end

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.310 
got a little tiny thing the poor end
doesn't<00:01:55.799> matter<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.280> will<00:01:56.430> work

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.370 

and<00:02:01.800> then<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.730> cultures<00:02:03.300> gotta<00:02:03.540> breathe<00:02:04.820> so

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
and then this cultures gotta breathe so

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
and then this cultures gotta breathe so
you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.530> use<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.680> coffee<00:02:08.009> filter<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:10.160> never<00:02:11.160> have

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
you can use a coffee filter I never have

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.100 
you can use a coffee filter I never have
time<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.670> go<00:02:11.880> looking<00:02:12.210> for<00:02:12.240> one<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:12.750> use<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
time to go looking for one I just use a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.980 
time to go looking for one I just use a
paper<00:02:13.350> towel<00:02:13.940> with<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> rubber<00:02:15.240> band<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.780> don't

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
paper towel with a rubber band you don't

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.470 
paper towel with a rubber band you don't

look bugs landing in there and that's it

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.320 
look bugs landing in there and that's it
your<00:02:21.480> vinegar<00:02:21.930> wheels<00:02:22.110> are<00:02:22.350> off<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.950> running

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
your vinegar wheels are off and running

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.940 
your vinegar wheels are off and running
now<00:02:24.330> they<00:02:24.750> will<00:02:25.020> literally<00:02:25.350> live<00:02:25.770> like<00:02:26.040> this

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
now they will literally live like this
