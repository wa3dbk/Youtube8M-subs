00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
boundary so on and so forth so it's not

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.120 
boundary so on and so forth so it's not
it's<00:01:23.630> not<00:01:23.750> like<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.289> know<00:01:24.380> he<00:01:24.560> hasn't<00:01:24.860> done<00:01:24.979> it

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
it's not like you know he hasn't done it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.160 
it's not like you know he hasn't done it
before<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:25.910> is<00:01:26.149> just<00:01:26.209> implementing<00:01:27.080> it

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
before it's just is just implementing it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.650 
before it's just is just implementing it
so<00:01:27.470> you're<00:01:27.649> just<00:01:27.860> trying<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.310> get<00:01:28.789> him<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.000> tap

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
so you're just trying to get him to tap

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.690 
so you're just trying to get him to tap
into<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.080> knowledge<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.590> he<00:01:30.830> had<00:01:30.860> no<00:01:31.399> course

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
into the knowledge that he had no course

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.850 
into the knowledge that he had no course
doesn't<00:01:32.000> have<00:01:32.209> the<00:01:32.330> experience<00:01:32.420> no<00:01:33.410> question

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
doesn't have the experience no question

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.499 
doesn't have the experience no question
I<00:01:34.039> mean<00:01:34.520> there<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.729> no<00:01:34.789> substitution<00:01:35.360> for

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
I mean there is no substitution for

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.029 
I mean there is no substitution for
experience<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.289> good<00:01:36.649> bad<00:01:36.830> or<00:01:36.860> indifferent

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
experience and good bad or indifferent

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.380 
experience and good bad or indifferent
and<00:01:37.660> he<00:01:38.660> has<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.800> he<00:01:39.830> just<00:01:40.160> just<00:01:40.670> let's<00:01:41.300> just

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
and he has it he just just let's just

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.820 
and he has it he just just let's just
