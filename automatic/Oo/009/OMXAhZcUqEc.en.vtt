00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.990
 Russia is not the first year 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.510
 held the so-called festival 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.090
 paint holi in Moscow so several times 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.250
 in a row over the summer during the climax 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.920
 holiday people throw out multicolored 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.289
 dry paint and have fun and yet very few people 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.480
 He knows what is connected with this holiday all the more 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.160
 that even on a popular wikipedia resource 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.490
 information about its history and origin 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.590
 extremely meager holi feast of colors 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.820
 India set the honor of burning alive 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.489
 demoness holika 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.350
 earlier hindus sprinkled themselves with ash from 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 ritual fire in which burned 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.690
 demoness then began to color the ashes 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.870
 but over time they began to use 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.320
 paint i can't relate to sympathy 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.600
 to such a disgrace of truth without image and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.289
 because the image of God is impressed and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.090
 on our face and in our rest 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.520
 human manifestations should not 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.260
 damage in such a chaotic way to 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.760
 what does a person want to join 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.979
 succumbed to such an invitation 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.590
 come off relax 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.920
 forget to lose the image of a man and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.390
 what will become easier for you and why 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.760
 throw yourself out of yourself 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.470
 yes no we know the more you dissolve 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.610
 passions the more degree you 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.610
 become dependent on them 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.350
 alchemist that kind of demonic games 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.210
 deeply hurts the soul more than that 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.300
 It is a grave sin and death 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.480
 because it is no secret from anyone that it 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.940
 there is some element 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.500
 Eastern demonic worship one way or 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.640
 otherwise participating in it and you if not 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.210
 still throw along with this paint 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.150
 sacrifice on a pagan altar over something 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.610
 refusing holy martyrs were ready 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.340
 undergo the most fierce death then 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.690
 anyway you are very close 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.920
 to the image of those people dimmed 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:12.340
 damaged spiritually who created 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.070
 this cult continued him now 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.040
 they tell you we are all made of 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.620
 traditions we are all in our development 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.370
 strive to stay in line with the sacred 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.700
 legends 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.310
 our spiritual mother church so what 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.610
 such a tradition 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.720
 we offer our children participating in 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.820
 this ugliness 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.540
 when we talk to you about the holiday 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.400
 holi so-called holiday abs japan 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.250
 each other paints need to understand 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.720
 two important things in my opinion 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.810
 I myself took part in such 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.380
 youth holidays in the territory 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.390
 India 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.489
 I will tell you a very important point 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.350
 firstly paint quality 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.720
 As a rule, even in India where this 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.880
 the holiday is celebrated much more widely 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.060
 than in Russia is so low 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.800
 that are always worth the first aid and 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.170
 there is an appeal of citizens about 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.330
 burning leather and paint all go on 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.270
 chemical based natural paint 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.430
 extremely little in Russia definitely 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.380
 paints will be chemically but this is not the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.720
 the problem point is that then 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.540
 we delve into the story of the appearance of this 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.790
 holiday there and immediately confronted with 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.370
 pure dime analogy is not correct 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.390
 say those who tell us about 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.600
 dispute between two gods 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.540
 here we had a koran after we had 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.269
 proper holika 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.090
 and there was a dispute between them herself 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.659
 lit itself in the process of this 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.230
 spore 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.329
 this is not gods even in terms of hinduism 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.299
 in terms of pure hinduism this is not 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:50.069
 the gods of the rich quranyi speaks directly 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:52.620
 what is it demons or anti gods that is 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.909
 pure demonology in addition 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.629
 It should be noted that this holiday 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.220
 held at full moon refer to 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.000
 to any knowledgeable person he will be told in 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.799
 full moon 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.209
 usually witch magic and other evil spirits 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.159
 conducts a huge number of ceremonies 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.480
 that is, the time is not easy and here 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.359
 imagine this holiday 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.700
 try to bring now drag 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.099
 literally Russia as something 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.759
 innocent something so funny what is 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:22.560
 pleasant with a certain drive 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:25.020
 diluting our culture without it 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.330
 suffering from the influence of western anti 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.630
 here's another culture so tough 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.300
 by demonic Hinduism we know that now 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.789
 the era of postmodernism which 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:44.389
 characterized by some kind of perfect 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:47.789
 arbitrariness is necessary forms and content 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:51.660
 favors place even more 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:54.430
 divorced from the tradition of the new era 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.960
 performance that is 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.870
 illusory representation of fantasy 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.800
 nothing but illusiveness is understandable 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.720
 The virtual world connection with this is very 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.250
 actively penetrates in all directions 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.479
 replaces the general life of a person and 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.380
 for example this particular holiday 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:20.800
 which calls to mix paints not 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.599
 working to create form 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.750
 because it requires effort because it 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.319
 requires craft because it requires purpose 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.830
 high and reasonable as a creator 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:33.159
 created the world 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.289
 Reasonably fine so and everyone 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:38.050
 fleeing 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:41.470
 too, it will take a lot of strength to 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.569
 so that this life cross life 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.819
 carry reasonably helpful 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.819
 for the good fruits of eternal salvation 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.360
 Obviously, this is a house that plunges. 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.840
 us 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:05.740
 colored dust of Hindu origin 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.990
 this chaos is a return to nothing in 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.350
 something quite already recognized to life eternal 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.870
 then we will not be able to return to something and 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.680
 eternity is only the most holy trinity and 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.820
 from would not like now in our 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.729
 meditation 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.610
 in these depths of hell you do not descend and 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:28.229
 bring down your attention but no doubt 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:32.530
 that every holiday of any nation 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:34.080
 which is characterized by names 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.740
 orgy 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.370
 bessini and dissimuity ruin us they 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.710
 create 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.050
 Today, few people are interested 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.970
 this is a festive background festival 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.280
 paint easily got on commercial 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.710
 rails and various non have hindu 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.110
 sect involved his promotion in Russia 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.180
 as a result we have a fun party in 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.139
 muddy mist and people dirtied 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.240
 colored mud 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.910
 as you can see, everything is not so rosy 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.139
 like those bright photoshop-processed 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.360
 online photos 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.010
 so if it makes sense to celebrate other people 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.720
 ritual holidays when you can 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.180
 revive and cultivate your 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.320
 traditions of Artyom Fedorov especially for 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.320
 TV channel Tsargrad
