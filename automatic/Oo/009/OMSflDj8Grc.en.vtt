00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.240

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.640
 always if we are in the last hour 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.060
 last hour of playstation network and 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.220
 I say last minute because there are few 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.590
 7 minutes 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:26.920
 acz play station or be the guys of the 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.210
 are and after almost 16 hours have 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.400
 clicked and said what 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.500
 next have given the solution the 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.370
 panacea have discovered the panacea 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 if you are still having problems 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.730
 with playstation network when starting the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.650
 session please restart the console and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.680
 try again 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.350
 'the in the meetings of the boys of 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.000
 playstation as I will today 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.809
 good you will be seeing some images 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.180
 because this is already the joy of the 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.730
 failures that people are having since 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.580
 8 in the morning until the time they are 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.410
 11 midnight at night and you'll be watching 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.360
 the statistics people can not 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.399
 connect however much you restart the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.520
 console the payoff turns it on again and 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.310
 this is already of laughter of shame 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.399
 from another official page it says it's 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.630
 everything online that is all right 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.670
 many of you in many parts of the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.850
 you tell me that you can connect 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.549
 others that you have to modify the x 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.909
 history of the emt with 1400 I do not know what 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.250
 things connection settings 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.049
 do not do that because the very sony said 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.909
 that is one of the born ones it does not do it 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.740
 and then it could be that you do not 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.079
 connect to you 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.590
 to yourself again if you do that little 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.899
 trick 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.500
 this is shameful this is the statement 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.329
 who said that nephew has said yes 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.280
 it does not work that you can start 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.009
 session that starts a console and pulls 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.460
 another time caracas and that tested 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.250
 try it by trying to see if he could see if 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.229
 We are here 16 hours trying 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.869
 connect the playstation and we have not 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.090
 off the console never quite 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.220
 embarrassing enough I think that it is 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.400
 leaving the salgado they have already gone 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.010
 quite a few days and this from the hands and 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.049
 they still do not give us an explanation 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.860
 consistent why it was chosen has fallen 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.480
 that is, they are not saying has fallen because 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.540
 good for this, tell me 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.579
 tell me what is happening then 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.690
 recognizes that there has been something 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:36.120
 or acknowledge that you have failed the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.819
 servers but has not recognized anything 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.030
 this is simply saying that there is a 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.530
 high volume of traffic 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.940
 they leave it there a high volume of traffic 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.709
 it may be because many have come 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.890
 consoles because they have had an attack on 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.040
 that for a million things and this already 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.780
 starts to piss off so thanks to 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.480
 all for being there leave your 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.390
 favorites share this information 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.550
 because the solution is that end and nothing else 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.959
 you know we will continue informing 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.959
 until the next ciao
