not only be an effective that will also
be<00:01:17.970> counterproductive

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
be counterproductive

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
be counterproductive
indeed<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.670> could<00:01:20.970> lead<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.180> more<00:01:21.509> violence

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
indeed they could lead to more violence

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
indeed they could lead to more violence
amongst<00:01:22.320> biker<00:01:22.530> groups<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.159> more<00:01:23.820> violence
