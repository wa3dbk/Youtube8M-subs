people<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.180> sounds<00:01:15.479> elementary

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
people so I know it sounds elementary

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.140 
people so I know it sounds elementary
but<00:01:16.140> stay<00:01:16.439> away<00:01:16.590> from<00:01:16.619> weight<00:01:16.920> gainer<00:01:17.159> next<00:01:18.030> up

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
but stay away from weight gainer next up

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.179 
but stay away from weight gainer next up
we<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.330> Casey<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.229> protein<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.920> not

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
we have Casey and protein this is not

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.090 
we have Casey and protein this is not
way<00:01:20.689> this<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.960> Casey<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> slow

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
way this is Casey and this is a slow

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.550 
way this is Casey and this is a slow
digesting<00:01:23.820> thicker<00:01:24.210> protein<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.020> mixes<00:01:25.409> up

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
digesting thicker protein it mixes up

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.460 
digesting thicker protein it mixes up
almost<00:01:25.860> pudding<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.330> let<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.570> sit<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
almost pudding like if you let it sit it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.160 
almost pudding like if you let it sit it
becomes<00:01:28.799> very<00:01:29.070> solid<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.240> benefit<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.960> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
becomes very solid the benefit is you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.710 
becomes very solid the benefit is you
can<00:01:31.320> take<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.619> before<00:01:31.829> bed<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:33.600> will

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
can take this before bed and it will

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.350 
can take this before bed and it will
stay<00:01:33.990> heavy<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:34.920> stomach<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.460> digest

I<00:04:23.349> do<00:04:23.890> recommend<00:04:24.490> this<00:04:24.669> one<00:04:24.849> this<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.180> probably

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
I do recommend this one this is probably

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.680 
I do recommend this one this is probably
it<00:04:25.870> guys<00:04:26.200> the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
it guys the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.270 
it guys the
is<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.230> one<00:04:27.680> that's<00:04:27.860> most<00:04:28.130> useful

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
is the the one that's most useful

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.820 
is the the one that's most useful
because<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:29.120> tastes<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:29.540> best<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:30.470> can<00:04:30.620> drink

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
because it tastes the best you can drink

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.680 
because it tastes the best you can drink
it<00:04:30.950> by<00:04:31.070> itself<00:04:31.430> it's<00:04:31.820> not<00:04:31.880> chock<00:04:32.360> full<00:04:32.390> of

carbs the fats reasonable have a look at

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.780 
carbs the fats reasonable have a look at
the<00:04:35.570> fat<00:04:35.810> content<00:04:36.050> there<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:36.830> only<00:04:37.250> two<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:37.760> a

that's<00:04:40.250> pretty<00:04:40.550> low<00:04:40.820> keep<00:04:41.660> in<00:04:41.840> mind<00:04:42.050> if<00:04:42.350> you're

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
that's pretty low keep in mind if you're

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.720 
that's pretty low keep in mind if you're
going<00:04:42.770> through<00:04:42.920> a<00:04:42.950> lot<00:04:43.100> of<00:04:43.250> protein<00:04:43.580> powder
