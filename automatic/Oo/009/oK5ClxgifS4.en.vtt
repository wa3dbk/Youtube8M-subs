00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
for figures and the good thing about

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.280 
for figures and the good thing about
that<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.270> that<00:02:58.390> they<00:02:58.630> slashed<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.080> price

about<00:02:59.590> five<00:02:59.890> dollars<00:03:00.070> about<00:03:00.370> six<00:03:00.670> dollars<00:03:00.880> a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
about five dollars about six dollars a

figure<00:03:01.360> with<00:03:02.080> with<00:03:02.440> some<00:03:02.590> tax<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:05.020> good

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
figure with with some tax so the good

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.300 
figure with with some tax so the good
thing<00:03:05.230> about<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.740> it's<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.160> lot

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
thing about it is that it's a lot

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.920 
thing about it is that it's a lot
cheaper<00:03:06.340> but<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.150> not<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:07.510> good<00:03:07.540> thing<00:03:07.840> about

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
cheaper but the not so good thing about

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.140 
cheaper but the not so good thing about
especially<00:03:08.380> for<00:03:08.530> us<00:03:08.620> collectors<00:03:09.130> who<00:03:09.820> love<00:03:10.000> to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
Wars characters is that they they're not

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.830

circulation<00:03:17.260> but<00:03:17.380> then<00:03:17.800> again<00:03:17.920> we<00:03:18.550> have<00:03:18.730> the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
circulation but then again we have the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.340 
circulation but then again we have the
black<00:03:19.120> series<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.660> three<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:19.959> three-quarter

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.690 
black shoes and the section black series
for<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.620> reason<00:03:23.769> for<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.100> being<00:03:24.430> is

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
for that so the reason for that being is

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.280 
for that so the reason for that being is
that<00:03:24.730> they're<00:03:25.060> cutting<00:03:25.420> budget<00:03:25.720> costs<00:03:26.080> it

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
that they're cutting budget costs it

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.380 
that they're cutting budget costs it
costs<00:03:26.980> them<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.459> will<00:03:27.580> cost<00:03:27.760> them<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:27.970> lot<00:03:28.000> less

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
costs them it will cost them a lot less

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.820 
costs them it will cost them a lot less
to<00:03:29.880> assemble<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> figure<00:03:31.300> with<00:03:32.140> less<00:03:32.440> parts

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
to assemble the figure with less parts

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.500 
to assemble the figure with less parts
with<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.160> with<00:03:33.370> less<00:03:33.519> articulation<00:03:34.150> has<00:03:34.300> less

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
with it with less articulation has less

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.720 
with it with less articulation has less
parts<00:03:34.840> obviously<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:35.980> it's<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.550> lot<00:03:36.670> cheaper

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
parts obviously so it's a lot cheaper

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.720 
parts obviously so it's a lot cheaper
for<00:03:37.239> them<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.570> another<00:03:38.170> thing<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.730> it's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
for them and another thing is that it's

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.490 
for them and another thing is that it's
a<00:03:39.880> it's<00:03:40.150> we<00:03:40.690> have<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.870> remember<00:03:41.050> that<00:03:41.170> hasbro

especially for kids the articulation

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.340 
especially for kids the articulation
won't<00:04:36.860> matter<00:04:37.160> as<00:04:37.430> much<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.970> guess<00:04:38.330> but<00:04:39.050> of

won't matter as much I guess but of

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.439 
won't matter as much I guess but of
course<00:04:39.590> some<00:04:40.070> extent<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.580> certainly<00:04:40.880> does<00:04:41.150> but

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
course some extent it certainly does but

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.840 
course some extent it certainly does but
then<00:04:41.570> another<00:04:42.020> extent<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.710> should<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.520> super

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
then another extent it should the super

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.310 
then another extent it should the super
circulation<00:04:44.360> that's<00:04:44.630> what<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:45.080> know<00:04:45.169> that's

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
circulation that's what you know that's

super educated that looks like a vintage
style<00:05:38.030> figure<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:38.930> mean<00:05:39.320> that<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.530> think<00:05:39.949> that's

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
style figure I mean that I think that's

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.710 
style figure I mean that I think that's
really<00:05:40.310> cool<00:05:40.520> but<00:05:40.729> that<00:05:41.240> just<00:05:41.270> me<00:05:41.510> personally

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
really cool but that just me personally

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.920 
really cool but that just me personally
that's<00:05:42.080> my<00:05:42.289> opinion<00:05:42.880> so<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:43.940> know<00:05:44.300> but<00:05:44.690> um

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
that's my opinion so you know but um

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.960 
that's my opinion so you know but um
yeah<00:05:45.680> it<00:05:45.800> just<00:05:45.830> made<00:05:46.130> sense<00:05:46.400> so<00:05:46.610> listen<00:05:46.880> to

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
yeah it just made sense so listen to

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.670 
yeah it just made sense so listen to
those<00:05:47.060> podcasts<00:05:47.419> into<00:05:47.900> those<00:05:48.020> episodes<00:05:48.320> and

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
those podcasts into those episodes and

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.110 
those podcasts into those episodes and
hopefully<00:05:49.280> it<00:05:49.400> does<00:05:49.550> make<00:05:49.729> sense<00:05:49.760> to<00:05:50.090> a

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
hopefully it does make sense to a

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.730 
hopefully it does make sense to a
certain<00:05:50.330> extent<00:05:50.570> but<00:05:50.840> don't<00:05:51.289> worry<00:05:51.440> we<00:05:51.680> still

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
certain extent but don't worry we still

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.129 
certain extent but don't worry we still
have<00:05:52.070> our<00:05:52.280> Black<00:05:52.820> Series<00:05:53.139> unfortunately

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
have our Black Series unfortunately

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.770

Clone<00:05:54.560> Wars<00:05:54.770> is<00:05:55.099> gone<00:05:55.400> it's<00:05:55.820> it's<00:05:56.120> done<00:05:56.509> for

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
Clone Wars is gone it's it's done for

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.330 
Clone Wars is gone it's it's done for
now<00:05:56.900> but<00:05:57.409> of<00:05:57.530> course<00:05:57.710> if<00:05:57.800> they<00:05:57.919> make<00:05:58.130> new

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
now but of course if they make new

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.399 
now but of course if they make new
characters<00:05:58.699> it'll<00:05:58.940> be<00:05:59.030> in<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.419> the<00:05:59.840> realistic

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
characters it'll be in the the realistic

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.110 
characters it'll be in the the realistic
style<00:06:00.620> not<00:06:00.949> no<00:06:01.130> longer<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.580> animated<00:06:01.940> stuff

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
style not no longer the animated stuff

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.360 
style not no longer the animated stuff
so<00:06:02.659> I<00:06:03.020> think<00:06:03.169> there's<00:06:03.680> like<00:06:03.889> a<00:06:04.039> brand<00:06:04.310> new

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.670 
so I think there's like a brand new
Captain<00:06:04.729> Rex<00:06:04.880> and<00:06:05.030> a<00:06:05.090> brand<00:06:05.330> new<00:06:05.389> are<00:06:05.599> to<00:06:05.810> maybe

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
Captain Rex and a brand new are to maybe

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.230 
Captain Rex and a brand new are to maybe
an<00:06:06.860> Anakin<00:06:07.190> Skywalker<00:06:07.639> but<00:06:07.759> then<00:06:07.880> that's<00:06:08.030> it

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240
