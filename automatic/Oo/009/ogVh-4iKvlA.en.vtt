00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
I think chain surfing died for two

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.940 
I think chain surfing died for two
reasons<00:02:35.680> number<00:02:36.180> one<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.989> rejection<00:02:38.650> from<00:02:38.680> an

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
reasons number one the rejection from an

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.600 
reasons number one the rejection from an
X<00:02:39.160> Games<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:40.230> definitely<00:02:41.230> number<00:02:41.500> two<00:02:41.860> would

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
X Games and definitely number two would

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.020 
X Games and definitely number two would
be<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:42.850> arrest<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.600> conviction<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:44.640> croc<00:02:45.640> and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
be the arrest and conviction of croc and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.870 
be the arrest and conviction of croc and
I<00:02:46.420> mean<00:02:46.959> after<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.739> sport<00:02:48.220> just<00:02:48.519> never

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
I mean after that the sport just never

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.150

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
realized I didn't appreciate it and I

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.530 
realized I didn't appreciate it and I
just<00:02:58.959> threw<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.380> all<00:02:59.500> away<00:02:59.530> for<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:01.150> low-income

really<00:03:33.790> young<00:03:33.970> kids<00:03:34.269> just<00:03:34.959> stepping<00:03:35.530> up<00:03:35.829> and

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
really young kids just stepping up and

really young kids just stepping up and
down<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.579> that<00:03:37.090> old<00:03:37.209> chain<00:03:37.510> we<00:03:37.660> used<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.870> ride

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
down that that old chain we used to ride

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.949 
down that that old chain we used to ride
every<00:03:38.350> day<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.970> kind<00:03:40.600> of<00:03:40.660> made<00:03:40.810> me<00:03:40.930> think

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
every day and it kind of made me think

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.559 
every day and it kind of made me think
that<00:03:41.290> maybe<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.160> dream<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:42.910> we<00:03:43.390> were

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
that maybe that dream that we were

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.840 
that maybe that dream that we were
building<00:03:44.069> has<00:03:45.069> not<00:03:45.340> yet<00:03:45.730> gone<00:03:46.450> away
