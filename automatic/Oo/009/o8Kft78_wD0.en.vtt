anyways now part 2 you gotta get out of
there<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:26.920> was<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.340> frustrated<00:02:28.000> with<00:02:28.120> this

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
there and I was so frustrated with this

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.730 
there and I was so frustrated with this
mission<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.780> done<00:02:28.930> with<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.410> putt<00:02:29.650> this

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
mission and done with it that putt this

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.090 
mission and done with it that putt this
point<00:02:30.040> I'm<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.460> up<00:02:30.850> over<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.360> wall<00:02:32.100> almost

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
point I'm like up over the wall almost

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.970 
point I'm like up over the wall almost
tripping<00:02:33.670> but<00:02:33.880> then<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.240> hit<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> B<00:02:34.600> button

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
tripping but then just hit the B button

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.300 
tripping but then just hit the B button
and<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.510> idea<00:02:37.930> was<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.170> slide<00:02:38.650> down<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.010> wall

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and the idea was to slide down a wall

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.770 
and the idea was to slide down a wall
and<00:02:39.660> not<00:02:40.660> take<00:02:40.930> all<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.200> much<00:02:41.440> damage<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:43.720> uh

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
and not take all that much damage but uh

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.250 
and not take all that much damage but uh
doesn't<00:02:44.740> really<00:02:44.860> work<00:02:45.100> out<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.340> well<00:02:46.260> because

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
doesn't really work out so well because

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.170 
doesn't really work out so well because
what<00:02:47.470> ends<00:02:47.830> up<00:02:47.890> happening<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.000> game

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
what ends up happening is that the game

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.970 
what ends up happening is that the game
ax<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.690> if<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.900> just<00:02:50.080> drop<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.350> far<00:02:50.710> straight

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
ax is if I just drop that far straight

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.740 
ax is if I just drop that far straight
down<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.670> kind<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.030> did<00:02:52.210> I<00:02:52.240> took<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.540> bunch<00:02:52.690> of

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.020 
down and I kind of did I took a bunch of
damage<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.680> see<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> little<00:02:54.190> red<00:02:54.460> are<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030
