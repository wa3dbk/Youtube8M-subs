is<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.599> stainless<00:00:13.080> steel<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.740> what<00:00:14.059> variation

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
is the stainless steel on what variation

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.680 
is the stainless steel on what variation
what<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.830> tell<00:00:17.100> from<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.580> dollars<00:00:18.570> you

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
what you can tell from the dollars you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.609 
what you can tell from the dollars you
can<00:00:18.810> see<00:00:19.020> simply<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.650> got<00:00:19.890> day<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.910> date

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
can see simply it's got day and date

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.300 
can see simply it's got day and date
with<00:00:22.619> three<00:00:22.920> hands<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.550> time<00:00:25.789> both<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
with three hands for time both all the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
with three hands for time both all the
believe<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.640> hour<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.750> minute<00:00:30.779> hand<00:00:31.289> are

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
believe the hour and the minute hand are

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.030 
believe the hour and the minute hand are
luminous<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:32.160> well<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.420> our<00:00:33.600> indexes<00:00:34.469> if

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
luminous as well as the our indexes if

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.130 
luminous as well as the our indexes if
not<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> entire<00:00:35.610> index<00:00:36.239> but<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.840> look<00:00:37.020> at

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
not the entire index but if you look at

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.049 
not the entire index but if you look at
the<00:00:37.380> extremities<00:00:38.160> you'll<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.850> there's

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the extremities you'll see that there's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.049 
the extremities you'll see that there's
luminous<00:00:39.480> material<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.140> too<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.489> 12

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
luminous material there too on the 12

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.110 
luminous material there too on the 12
and<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.300> six<00:00:42.480> also<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> Loomis<00:00:44.579> material

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and the six also have a Loomis material

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.700 
and the six also have a Loomis material
on<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.950> now<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.129> case<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.200> 50-meter<00:00:49.200> case

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
on it now this case is a 50-meter case

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.180 
on it now this case is a 50-meter case
it<00:00:50.670> does<00:00:51.000> house<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.260> Oregon's<00:00:52.770> forced

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it does house one of Oregon's forced
