00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
saying it's a hologram is like you drive

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.269 
saying it's a hologram is like you drive
it<00:00:31.679> around<00:00:31.769> :

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it around :

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.250

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you own the dark color but if you drive

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.130 
you own the dark color but if you drive
it<00:00:34.380> around<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.640> jump<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.780> into<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it around and you jump it out into the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.630 
it around and you jump it out into the
Sun<00:00:38.180> it's<00:00:39.290> it's<00:00:40.290> cool-looking<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.340> just
