I<00:00:03.380> want<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.470> go<00:00:04.620> over<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.629> how<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> change<00:00:07.020> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
I want to go over the how to change the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.950 
I want to go over the how to change the
crankshaft<00:00:07.500> sensor<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.760> generation<00:00:09.420> 1

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
crankshaft sensor on the generation 1

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.539 
crankshaft sensor on the generation 1
Sebring<00:00:10.620> Convertible<00:00:10.769> which<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.580> at<00:00:11.700> 96<00:00:12.389> to

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
Sebring Convertible which is at 96 to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.840 
Sebring Convertible which is at 96 to
2000<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:16.039> one<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> things<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.670> probably

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
2000 and one of the things you probably

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.109 
2000 and one of the things you probably
need<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:18.630> first<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.730> makes<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.970> lot

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
need to do first it makes it a lot

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.540 
need to do first it makes it a lot
simpler<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.660> remove<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.550> transmission

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
simpler to remove the transmission

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.400 
simpler to remove the transmission
control<00:00:23.699> module<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.449> that's<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
control module and that's what that is

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.490 
control module and that's what that is
right<00:00:25.740> here<00:00:26.099> looking<00:00:26.970> at<00:00:27.150> there's<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.019> 8

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
right here looking at there's a 8

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.259 
right here looking at there's a 8
millimeter<00:00:29.160> bolt<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> center<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
millimeter bolt in the center of the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.450 
millimeter bolt in the center of the
wiring<00:00:30.660> harness<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.439> remove<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.009> I'm

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
wiring harness you just remove that I'm

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.370 
wiring harness you just remove that I'm
using<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.820> socket<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.750> already<00:00:33.930> loose

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
using a socket here it's already loose

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.490 
using a socket here it's already loose
and<00:00:35.300> just<00:00:36.530> pull<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.950> wire<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.870> there's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and just pull out the wire and there's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.100 
and just pull out the wire and there's
two<00:00:40.649> bolts<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:42.059> there<00:00:42.110> under

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
two bolts one here and one there under

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.020 
two bolts one here and one there under
each<00:00:43.290> side<00:00:43.590> then<00:00:43.950> tick<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.370> comes<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.879> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
each side then tick that comes out you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
each side then tick that comes out you
can<00:00:45.059> see<00:00:45.300> here's<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> pins<00:00:46.399> where<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
can see here's all the pins where it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.190 
can see here's all the pins where it
goes<00:00:47.640> into<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> transmission<00:00:48.930> control

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
goes into the transmission control

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
goes into the transmission control
module<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:50.340> good<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.670> take<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.059> out

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
module it's good to take this out

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
module it's good to take this out
because<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:52.230> gets<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.710> away<00:00:52.860> you're<00:00:53.520> trying

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
because this gets it away you're trying

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.279 
because this gets it away you're trying
to<00:00:53.879> reach<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.300> four<00:00:54.510> places<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:56.930> did<00:00:57.930> remove

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to reach in four places and I did remove

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.900 
to reach in four places and I did remove
the<00:00:58.469> hose<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> don't<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.309> need<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.699> do

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the hose but you don't really need to do

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
the hose but you don't really need to do
that<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:03.059> makes<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.750> simpler

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that it makes it a little bit simpler

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
that it makes it a little bit simpler
it's<00:01:04.409> uh<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.220> know<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.369> depends<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
it's uh you know it depends on what the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's uh you know it depends on what the
person<00:01:06.390> wants<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:08.010> thing<00:01:08.250> that's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
person wants to do but one thing that's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
person wants to do but one thing that's
quite<00:01:09.000> often<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.750> changed<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
quite often has to be changed on the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.649 
quite often has to be changed on the
Chrysler<00:01:10.830> car<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> crank<00:01:12.299> shifts

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
Chrysler car is the crank shifts

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.200 
Chrysler car is the crank shifts
position<00:01:13.560> sensor<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.220> otherwise<00:01:14.880> known<00:01:15.150> as

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
position sensor or otherwise known as

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.100 
position sensor or otherwise known as
the<00:01:15.920> CPS<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.390> expected<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> lot

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the CPS and I think expected a lot

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
the CPS and I think expected a lot
easier<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.799> at<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.430> take<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.939> out

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
easier to get at it if you take this out

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.950 
easier to get at it if you take this out
and<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.970> that's<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.390> pins<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and you can see that's the pins on it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.870 
and you can see that's the pins on it
and<00:01:25.259> everything<00:01:25.700> alright

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and everything alright

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.609 
and everything alright
and<00:01:26.970> there's<00:01:27.240> two<00:01:27.420> bolts<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.960> each<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and there's two bolts so each one of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
and there's two bolts so each one of
those<00:01:28.710> are<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> eight<00:01:29.640> millimeter<00:01:30.240> bolts

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
those are all the eight millimeter bolts

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.109 
those are all the eight millimeter bolts
hey<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> socket<00:01:32.250> size<00:01:32.460> there's<00:01:32.939> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
hey that's the socket size there's that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
hey that's the socket size there's that
there's<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> bolt<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> actual<00:01:34.530> harness

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
there's the bolt on the actual harness

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.980 
there's the bolt on the actual harness
itself

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.210 

and<00:01:40.810> it's<00:01:41.810> simple<00:01:42.410> but<00:01:42.620> they<00:01:42.800> think<00:01:43.070> people

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
and it's simple but they think people

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.950 
and it's simple but they think people
have<00:01:43.580> been<00:01:43.790> very<00:01:44.030> scared<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.570> doing<00:01:44.870> these

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
have been very scared to doing these

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.870 
have been very scared to doing these
type<00:01:45.230> of<00:01:45.440> work<00:01:45.590> for<00:01:45.830> some<00:01:46.010> reason<00:01:46.400> so<00:01:46.580> I'm<00:01:46.670> just

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
type of work for some reason so I'm just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.270 
type of work for some reason so I'm just
going<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.090> put<00:01:47.300> out<00:01:47.510> exactly<00:01:47.990> what<00:01:48.260> it<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.560> now

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
going to put out exactly what it is now

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.220 
going to put out exactly what it is now
this<00:01:49.460> makes<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.880> easier<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.420> reach<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:50.960> get

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
this makes it easier to reach in to get

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.620 
this makes it easier to reach in to get
at<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.560> crankshaft<00:01:51.950> sensor<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.880> those<00:01:53.480> are

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
at the crankshaft sensor and those are

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.240 
at the crankshaft sensor and those are
the<00:01:53.720> two<00:01:53.870> bolts<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:54.380> are<00:01:54.440> holding<00:01:54.830> in<00:01:55.490> the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
the two bolts that are holding in the

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.680 
the two bolts that are holding in the
transmission<00:01:58.250> control<00:01:58.580> module<00:01:58.820> now<00:01:59.630> you

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
transmission control module now you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.480 
transmission control module now you
should<00:01:59.930> disconnect<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.620> battery<00:02:01.010> before<00:02:01.220> you

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
should disconnect the battery before you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.720 
should disconnect the battery before you
take<00:02:01.670> any<00:02:01.700> stuff<00:02:02.390> out<00:02:02.630> though<00:02:02.870> obviously<00:02:03.730> just

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
take any stuff out though obviously just

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.900 
take any stuff out though obviously just
going<00:02:05.000> over<00:02:05.240> this<00:02:06.430> augment<00:02:07.430> something<00:02:07.790> I<00:02:07.850> said

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
going over this augment something I said

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:15.540 
going over this augment something I said
earlier<00:02:08.510> and<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:12.230> get<00:02:12.380> on<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.770> next<00:02:12.800> one

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.680 

this<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.240> crankshaft

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
this is the this is the crankshaft

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.200 
this is the this is the crankshaft
sensor<00:02:21.140> itself<00:02:21.740> shining<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.520> light<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:23.380> it

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
sensor itself shining a light on it it

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.420 
sensor itself shining a light on it it
sits<00:02:26.290> underneath<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.530> distributor<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.190> I'm

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
sits underneath the distributor and I'm

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.650 
sits underneath the distributor and I'm
going<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.580> try<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.790> make<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.120> as<00:02:29.270> clear<00:02:29.420> as

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
going to try to make this as clear as

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.470 
going to try to make this as clear as
possible<00:02:30.230> because<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.560> know<00:02:30.680> people<00:02:31.180> were<00:02:32.180> into

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
possible because I know people were into

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.260 
possible because I know people were into
these<00:02:32.660> cars<00:02:33.020> they<00:02:33.410> were<00:02:33.470> going<00:02:33.890> where<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.910> how

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
these cars they were going where to how

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.820 
these cars they were going where to how
to<00:02:35.330> actually<00:02:35.540> change<00:02:35.990> this<00:02:36.200> thing<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.740> know

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
to actually change this thing you know

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.230 
to actually change this thing you know
it's<00:02:36.950> not<00:02:37.070> clear<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.350> hole<00:02:39.650> right<00:02:39.860> here

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
it's not clear this this hole right here

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.820 
it's not clear this this hole right here
showing<00:02:41.240> is<00:02:41.420> where<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.020> distributor<00:02:42.590> was<00:02:42.800> I

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
showing is where the distributor was I

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.500 
showing is where the distributor was I
took<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.280> distributor<00:02:43.850> out<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:47.150> right

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
took the distributor out and it's right

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.030 
took the distributor out and it's right
below<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.320> don't<00:02:48.470> need<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.709> take<00:02:48.890> the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
below you don't need to take the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.380 
below you don't need to take the
distributor<00:02:49.489> out<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.850> get<00:02:50.000> out<00:02:50.180> the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
distributor out to get out the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.180 
distributor out to get out the
crankshaft<00:02:50.959> sensor<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.739> shows<00:02:51.980> you

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
crankshaft sensor but it shows you

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.030 
crankshaft sensor but it shows you
exactly<00:02:52.660> where<00:02:53.660> it's<00:02:53.840> located<00:02:54.080> at<00:02:54.680> it's<00:02:54.860> right

uh pointing to and this sensor goes in

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.460 
uh pointing to and this sensor goes in
this<00:03:05.630> way<00:03:05.950> okay<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.670> goes<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:08.390> way<00:03:08.470> and

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
this way okay it goes in this way and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.940 
this way okay it goes in this way and
it's

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
it's

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.410 
it's

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
they use a paper gasket which is sheared

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.880 
they use a paper gasket which is sheared
off<00:03:16.629> as<00:03:16.989> soon<00:03:17.140> as<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.290> start<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.739> engine

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
off as soon as you start the engine

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.280 
off as soon as you start the engine
gives<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.610> correct<00:03:19.030> length<00:03:19.390> now<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.080> can

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
gives you the correct length now you can

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.600 
gives you the correct length now you can
use<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> piece<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:22.470> like<00:03:23.470> tape<00:03:24.010> or<00:03:24.370> something

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
use a piece of like tape or something

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.030 
use a piece of like tape or something
like<00:03:24.849> that<00:03:25.000> as<00:03:25.360> long<00:03:25.569> as<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:25.840> very<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.560> not

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
like that as long as it's very like not

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.460 
like that as long as it's very like not
very<00:03:27.489> sticky<00:03:27.849> tape<00:03:28.300> and<00:03:28.540> there's<00:03:29.230> also

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
very sticky tape and there's also

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.860 
very sticky tape and there's also
gaskets<00:03:30.220> they<00:03:30.370> sell<00:03:30.700> for<00:03:30.970> it's<00:03:31.120> like<00:03:31.180> spacer

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
gaskets they sell for it's like spacer

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.440 
gaskets they sell for it's like spacer
gaskets<00:03:32.470> but<00:03:32.769> when<00:03:33.700> you're<00:03:33.819> changing<00:03:34.120> this

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
gaskets but when you're changing this

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.300 
gaskets but when you're changing this
you<00:03:34.660> just<00:03:34.810> put<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.290> in<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.680> just<00:03:35.709> put<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.160> up

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
you just put it in you just put it up

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.059 
you just put it in you just put it up
against<00:03:36.819> the<00:03:36.940> flywheel<00:03:37.630> lightly<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:38.920> has

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
against the flywheel lightly and it has

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.509 
against the flywheel lightly and it has
a<00:03:39.480> space<00:03:40.480> or<00:03:40.750> gasket<00:03:41.319> on<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.799> it's<00:03:42.250> yours

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
a space or gasket on it and it's yours

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.309 
a space or gasket on it and it's yours
off<00:03:42.849> as<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.180> start<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.629> engine<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:44.049> gives<00:03:44.200> you

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
off as you start the engine it gives you

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.770 
off as you start the engine it gives you
the<00:03:44.440> proper<00:03:44.890> air<00:03:45.040> gap<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.090> senses<00:03:46.569> uh

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
the proper air gap so it senses uh

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.039 
the proper air gap so it senses uh
what's<00:03:47.080> going<00:03:47.410> on<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.940> could<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.510> know<00:03:49.540> do<00:03:49.840> its

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
what's going on it could you know do its

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.500 
what's going on it could you know do its
thing<00:03:50.140> but<00:03:53.040> it's<00:03:54.040> probably<00:03:54.400> best<00:03:54.940> when<00:03:55.420> you

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
thing but it's probably best when you

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.880 
thing but it's probably best when you
change<00:03:55.810> your<00:03:56.019> cell<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.440> don't<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.769> take

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
change your cell you don't have to take

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.350 
change your cell you don't have to take
the<00:03:57.040> distributor<00:03:57.549> out<00:03:57.579> or<00:03:57.910> anything<00:03:58.060> like

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
the distributor out or anything like

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.550 
the distributor out or anything like
that<00:03:58.390> but<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.700> go<00:04:00.700> ahead<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:02.910> remove<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
that but to go ahead and remove the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.380 
that but to go ahead and remove the
transmission<00:04:05.560> control<00:04:05.709> module<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:07.209> then

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
transmission control module and then

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.530 
transmission control module and then
this<00:04:07.720> way<00:04:08.019> you<00:04:08.079> can<00:04:08.290> get<00:04:08.470> at<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.680> EGR<00:04:09.489> tube

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
this way you can get at that EGR tube

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.050 
this way you can get at that EGR tube
the<00:04:10.540> silver<00:04:11.230> EGR<00:04:11.860> tube<00:04:11.890> you<00:04:12.310> give<00:04:12.489> this<00:04:12.730> four

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
the silver EGR tube you give this four

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.819 
the silver EGR tube you give this four
bolts<00:04:13.480> there's<00:04:13.630> two<00:04:13.810> bolts<00:04:14.200> on<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.470> intake

millimeters<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:23.020> take<00:04:23.260> take<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.830> tube<00:04:24.100> off

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
millimeters you take take that tube off

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.890 
millimeters you take take that tube off
and<00:04:24.700> you<00:04:24.760> have<00:04:24.880> plenty<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.300> room<00:04:25.389> you<00:04:25.660> could<00:04:25.780> be

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
and you have plenty of room you could be

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.590 
and you have plenty of room you could be
able<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.080> should<00:04:26.260> be<00:04:26.380> looking<00:04:26.860> at<00:04:27.010> this<00:04:27.600> CPS

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
able to should be looking at this CPS

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.930 
able to should be looking at this CPS
sensor<00:04:29.139> it's<00:04:29.950> not<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.100> big<00:04:30.370> deal<00:04:30.810> now<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
sensor it's not a big deal now the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.690 
sensor it's not a big deal now the
sensor<00:04:33.940> itself<00:04:34.770> recommended<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.830> get<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.220> OEM

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
sensor itself recommended to get the OEM

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.360 
sensor itself recommended to get the OEM
sensors<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.680> this<00:04:38.680> is<00:04:38.800> what<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.010> looks<00:04:39.250> like

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
sensors and this is what it looks like

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.060 
sensors and this is what it looks like
so<00:04:39.850> we're<00:04:40.240> looking<00:04:40.600> at<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.560> into

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
so we're looking at that this is into

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.850 
so we're looking at that this is into
the<00:04:42.160> transmission<00:04:42.700> this<00:04:43.539> is<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.930> gasket

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
the transmission this is the gasket

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.019 
the transmission this is the gasket
that's<00:04:45.010> on<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.430> end<00:04:45.580> of

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:46.029 
that's on the end of

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:48.269 
that's on the end of
there's<00:04:46.689> a<00:04:46.779> wiring<00:04:47.110> harness<00:04:47.259> which<00:04:47.919> connect

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:48.279 
there's a wiring harness which connect

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.239 
there's a wiring harness which connect
to<00:04:48.489> and<00:04:48.669> that's<00:04:48.789> ten<00:04:49.119> millimeter<00:04:49.659> bolt<00:04:49.959> and<00:04:50.319> if

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:51.249 
to and that's ten millimeter bolt and if

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.909 
to and that's ten millimeter bolt and if
you<00:04:51.369> get<00:04:51.489> a<00:04:51.519> replacement<00:04:51.999> distributor<00:04:52.929> um

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
you get a replacement distributor um

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.429 
you get a replacement distributor um
these<00:04:54.429> are<00:04:54.489> the<00:04:54.729> other<00:04:54.879> thing<00:04:55.149> that<00:04:55.439> most

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 
these are the other thing that most

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.079 
these are the other thing that most
people<00:04:56.589> that<00:04:57.129> you<00:04:57.429> know<00:04:57.519> a<00:04:57.549> lot<00:04:57.729> of<00:04:57.819> people

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:58.089 
people that you know a lot of people

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.059 
people that you know a lot of people
like<00:04:58.299> the<00:04:58.479> car<00:04:58.749> because<00:04:59.079> it's<00:04:59.259> convertible<00:04:59.979> I

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
like the car because it's convertible I

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.499 
like the car because it's convertible I
think<00:05:00.339> that's<00:05:00.519> what<00:05:00.759> they're<00:05:01.059> sticking

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
think that's what they're sticking

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.789 
think that's what they're sticking
around<00:05:01.629> for<00:05:03.659> Cardone<00:05:04.659> select<00:05:04.689> is<00:05:05.379> probably

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:05.799 
around for Cardone select is probably

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:09.209 
around for Cardone select is probably
the<00:05:05.979> best<00:05:06.249> one<00:05:07.089> to<00:05:07.119> get<00:05:07.509> that's<00:05:07.929> I<00:05:08.409> found<00:05:08.979> out

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
the best one to get that's I found out

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.729 
the best one to get that's I found out
that<00:05:09.459> many<00:05:09.729> times<00:05:10.059> aftermarket<00:05:10.959> parts<00:05:11.349> or<00:05:11.499> nut

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:11.739 
that many times aftermarket parts or nut

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:14.219 
that many times aftermarket parts or nut
or<00:05:12.159> not<00:05:12.639> do<00:05:12.969> not<00:05:12.999> work<00:05:13.389> very<00:05:13.689> well<00:05:13.779> with<00:05:14.110> the

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
or not do not work very well with the

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.799 
or not do not work very well with the
Chrysler<00:05:14.769> but<00:05:15.489> the<00:05:15.639> cardones<00:05:16.059> select<00:05:16.629> which

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:16.809 
Chrysler but the cardones select which

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:18.389 
Chrysler but the cardones select which
is<00:05:16.929> a<00:05:16.959> brand<00:05:17.409> new<00:05:17.589> distributor<00:05:18.219> that's

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:18.399 
is a brand new distributor that's

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.939 
is a brand new distributor that's
hundred<00:05:18.999> percent<00:05:19.360> tested<00:05:19.929> that<00:05:20.379> seems<00:05:20.799> to

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
hundred percent tested that seems to

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.049 
hundred percent tested that seems to
work<00:05:21.159> fine<00:05:21.459> and<00:05:21.869> take<00:05:22.869> it<00:05:23.019> out<00:05:23.199> basically<00:05:24.059> you

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:25.059 
work fine and take it out basically you

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:27.239 
work fine and take it out basically you
have<00:05:25.239> your<00:05:25.449> wiring<00:05:25.749> harness<00:05:26.349> on<00:05:26.559> the<00:05:26.649> top<00:05:26.889> just

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:27.249 
have your wiring harness on the top just

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:29.729 
have your wiring harness on the top just
to<00:05:27.659> there's<00:05:28.659> two<00:05:28.839> things<00:05:29.079> that<00:05:29.379> right<00:05:29.559> here

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:29.739 
to there's two things that right here

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:31.439 
to there's two things that right here
this<00:05:29.919> one<00:05:30.219> and<00:05:30.399> this<00:05:30.519> one<00:05:30.789> and<00:05:30.819> on<00:05:30.999> the<00:05:31.119> wiring

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
this one and this one and on the wiring

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.679 
this one and this one and on the wiring
harness<00:05:31.809> you<00:05:32.649> take<00:05:32.919> this<00:05:33.129> off<00:05:33.429> and<00:05:33.699> there's

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:34.689 
harness you take this off and there's

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.629 
harness you take this off and there's
two<00:05:34.899> bolts<00:05:35.169> both<00:05:35.709> of<00:05:35.889> them<00:05:36.039> are<00:05:36.249> twelve

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
two bolts both of them are twelve

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.659 
two bolts both of them are twelve
millimeter<00:05:36.939> and<00:05:37.529> there's<00:05:38.529> two<00:05:38.769> washers<00:05:39.279> that

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
millimeter and there's two washers that

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.729 
millimeter and there's two washers that
pull<00:05:40.239> straight<00:05:40.599> out<00:05:40.779> sometimes<00:05:41.259> it<00:05:41.439> doesn't

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:41.739 
pull straight out sometimes it doesn't

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:44.339 
pull straight out sometimes it doesn't
pull<00:05:41.889> out<00:05:42.039> that<00:05:42.219> easily<00:05:42.489> because<00:05:43.149> it<00:05:43.929> can<00:05:44.199> been

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
pull out that easily because it can been

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:45.839 
pull out that easily because it can been
sitting<00:05:44.649> in<00:05:44.709> the<00:05:44.829> car<00:05:45.039> for<00:05:45.309> such<00:05:45.519> a<00:05:45.549> long<00:05:45.819> time

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
sitting in the car for such a long time

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.819 
sitting in the car for such a long time
that<00:05:46.360> it<00:05:46.449> seems<00:05:46.689> like<00:05:46.869> it's<00:05:47.079> frozen<00:05:47.349> in<00:05:47.649> there

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:47.829 
that it seems like it's frozen in there

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:49.799 
that it seems like it's frozen in there
but<00:05:48.069> it<00:05:48.219> does<00:05:48.459> come<00:05:48.729> out<00:05:48.759> it's<00:05:49.059> on<00:05:49.239> two<00:05:49.419> bolts

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:49.809 
but it does come out it's on two bolts

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:53.639 
but it does come out it's on two bolts
holding<00:05:50.139> today<00:05:50.469> and<00:05:51.239> that's<00:05:52.239> it<00:05:52.629> but<00:05:53.289> I<00:05:53.349> think

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:53.649 
holding today and that's it but I think

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:55.829 
holding today and that's it but I think
the<00:05:53.769> most<00:05:53.949> common<00:05:54.219> thing<00:05:54.489> your<00:05:54.879> bedroll<00:05:55.329> going

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 
the most common thing your bedroll going

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.839 
the most common thing your bedroll going
these<00:05:55.929> cars<00:05:56.229> is<00:05:56.469> die<00:05:56.769> all<00:05:57.069> of<00:05:57.189> a<00:05:57.279> sudden<00:05:57.699> it's

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
these cars is die all of a sudden it's

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.969 
these cars is die all of a sudden it's
this<00:05:58.149> it's<00:05:58.569> electronic<00:05:59.409> it's<00:05:59.559> either<00:05:59.709> this

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
this it's electronic it's either this

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.040 
this it's electronic it's either this
thing<00:06:00.279> or<00:06:00.579> that<00:06:00.699> thing<00:06:00.759> the<00:06:01.239> crankshaft

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
thing or that thing the crankshaft

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.869 
thing or that thing the crankshaft
position<00:06:02.709> sensor<00:06:03.069> CPS<00:06:04.059> or<00:06:04.779> the<00:06:05.050> distributor

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879 
position sensor CPS or the distributor

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.989 
position sensor CPS or the distributor
so<00:06:07.289> not<00:06:08.289> that<00:06:08.559> difficult<00:06:09.009> to<00:06:09.399> change<00:06:09.639> but<00:06:09.969> I

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:09.999 
so not that difficult to change but I

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.119 
so not that difficult to change but I
think<00:06:10.059> it's<00:06:10.479> big<00:06:10.809> mystery<00:06:11.349> as<00:06:11.469> the<00:06:11.499> far<00:06:11.979> as

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
think it's big mystery as the far as

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.249 
think it's big mystery as the far as
whereas<00:06:12.399> exactly<00:06:13.149> as<00:06:13.269> it<00:06:13.419> located<00:06:13.899> and<00:06:14.139> it's

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
whereas exactly as it located and it's

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:17.159 
whereas exactly as it located and it's
located<00:06:14.739> as<00:06:15.039> I<00:06:15.879> showed

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
located as I showed

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.580 
located as I showed
so<00:06:17.860> it's<00:06:18.039> up<00:06:18.479> the<00:06:19.479> way<00:06:19.689> to<00:06:19.749> get<00:06:20.020> at<00:06:20.199> it<00:06:20.349> is<00:06:20.469> to

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
so it's up the way to get at it is to

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.469 
so it's up the way to get at it is to
take<00:06:20.770> out<00:06:21.039> that<00:06:21.280> transmission<00:06:21.939> control

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
take out that transmission control

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.540 
take out that transmission control
module<00:06:22.719> and<00:06:23.999> the<00:06:24.999> EGR<00:06:25.419> to<00:06:26.319> the<00:06:26.919> silver<00:06:27.340> tube

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
module and the EGR to the silver tube

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.629 
module and the EGR to the silver tube
that<00:06:27.939> gets<00:06:28.210> it<00:06:28.330> away<00:06:28.889> and<00:06:29.889> I<00:06:30.189> showed<00:06:30.430> how<00:06:30.580> you

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
that gets it away and I showed how you

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.879 
that gets it away and I showed how you
take<00:06:30.879> out<00:06:31.090> the<00:06:31.270> DT<00:06:31.659> of<00:06:31.749> the<00:06:32.169> transmission

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
take out the DT of the transmission

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.510 
take out the DT of the transmission
control<00:06:33.009> module<00:06:33.430> the<00:06:34.300> EGR<00:06:34.900> tube<00:06:34.930> is<00:06:35.499> uh<00:06:35.529> you'll

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
control module the EGR tube is uh you'll

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.100 
control module the EGR tube is uh you'll
be<00:06:36.550> able<00:06:36.729> to<00:06:36.939> get<00:06:37.090> out<00:06:37.210> the<00:06:37.360> two<00:06:37.509> bolts<00:06:37.779> that

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
be able to get out the two bolts that

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.189 
be able to get out the two bolts that
are<00:06:38.169> taxing<00:06:38.830> EGR<00:06:39.370> we<00:06:39.550> take<00:06:39.789> out<00:06:39.969> the

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
are taxing EGR we take out the

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.519 
are taxing EGR we take out the
transmission<00:06:41.199> control<00:06:41.590> module<00:06:41.979> and<00:06:43.529> then

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:44.529 
transmission control module and then

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.899 
transmission control module and then
you'll<00:06:44.680> have<00:06:44.770> enough<00:06:45.039> room<00:06:45.279> to<00:06:45.310> get<00:06:45.580> into

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
you'll have enough room to get into

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.140 
you'll have enough room to get into
installing<00:06:46.810> this<00:06:47.169> crankshaft<00:06:48.129> sensor<00:06:48.669> which

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
installing this crankshaft sensor which

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.649 
installing this crankshaft sensor which
is<00:06:49.300> a<00:06:49.330> 10<00:06:49.629> minute<00:06:49.990> 10<00:06:50.259> millimeter<00:06:50.800> bolt<00:06:51.129> I

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659 
is a 10 minute 10 millimeter bolt I

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:56.490 
is a 10 minute 10 millimeter bolt I
would<00:06:52.659> use<00:06:52.900> an<00:06:53.110> OEM<00:06:53.770> chrysler<00:06:54.610> pro<00:06:55.500> chrysler

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
would use an OEM chrysler pro chrysler

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.920 
would use an OEM chrysler pro chrysler
one<00:06:56.800> now<00:06:56.979> i<00:06:57.009> would<00:06:57.370> not<00:06:57.550> use<00:06:57.939> aftermarket<00:06:58.840> if

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
one now i would not use aftermarket if

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.550 
one now i would not use aftermarket if
you<00:06:59.050> want<00:06:59.259> the<00:06:59.379> best<00:06:59.620> results<00:06:59.770> on<00:07:00.310> this
