00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.720
 hi to all this more than a tutorial is a little tips and tricks on blender 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.540
 3d 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.400
 where we will see how to point an object to a camera in a dimension 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:13.829
 actually this is the video version of an ale text tutorial published 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.089
 several months ago on my site would generally like when the tutorials are like that 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.869
 small I do not even realize the livio version only so that I risk to pass 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.669
 unobserved like this, in fact, many dressed events have asked me various questions 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.089
 sometimes the same thing without knowing that the answer was already there 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.680
 sometimes it is necessary to point an object with the camera on 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.630
 movement for cellulite 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.190
 blender does not provide the nameplate cameras present in others 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.640
 programs such as 3d studio max 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.840
 however, the problem can be solved by using consent 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.030
 entirely constrained 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.180
 to be applied then to athens 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.660
 in the visible video scene presenting a bomb as long as it represents the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.690
 camera path 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.450
 let the cameras follow the path of the curve with the settings 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.170
 what photos for simplicity meanwhile the camera learns a hey curve 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.770
 choosing potter background from the best that will appear crossroad after pressing 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.020
 control p 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.170
 the bluray animation followed by fool succeeded france but we can bring 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.380
 such value for example 250 the duration of the animation of the photos of brenda 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.850
 selecting the curve and entering. 250 in the field photo animation france in 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.180
 card omgata within the properties wind 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.850
 now to get the camera. I do not for example throw the cube present in the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.010
 scene we must select it and insert a trekking constraint 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.370
 to do this we open the advice card of the properties windo 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.420
 let's begin. a new cost xd type 3 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.200
 at this point to get our purpose we have to set the fields of the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 constraint as follows in the object we write the name of the object from 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.840
 bet in our case where 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.480
 in to you we set - z 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.660
 inap set y 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.630
 clearly the target can also be animated, ie it can move or vote 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.360
 during the animation 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.810
 the camera will continue to move towards this object in any case 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 the interesting thing is that it is possible to point an object at the camera 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.150
 20 invisible so we can decide what to frame in the scene using 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.879
 nents 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.010
 that we can then soul retras doll in this way we will be able to move the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.169
 camera 3 in while directing it to certain points with ease 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.540
 well for this very short video tutorial and everything as always on

 tiziana 3d models 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:35.659
 textured car with glue for clarification and given in fine and available form of the 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:36.309
 place 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.989
 See you soon
