had a lot of attention to detail the
system<00:00:51.790> that<00:00:51.820> we<00:00:52.000> developed<00:00:52.750> taken<00:00:53.230> over<00:00:53.680> a

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
system that we developed taken over a

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.130 
system that we developed taken over a
year<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.580> get<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.790> play<00:00:54.970> back<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.600> standard

that<00:00:56.320> it's<00:00:56.470> out<00:00:56.650> there's<00:00:57.160> a<00:00:57.250> lot<00:00:57.400> of<00:00:57.580> design

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
that it's out there's a lot of design

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.920 
that it's out there's a lot of design
that<00:00:58.210> we're<00:00:58.330> going<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.480> use<00:00:58.660> two<00:00:58.900> different

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
that we're going to use two different

there's<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.590> San<00:01:07.890> design<00:01:08.190> you<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
there's a San design you just have to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.460 
there's a San design you just have to
grab<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> sound<00:01:09.600> he<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> more

of<00:01:26.730> things<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.300> create<00:01:27.660> a<00:01:27.750> really

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
of things like that to create a really

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.800 
of things like that to create a really
unusual<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.130> dynamic<00:01:30.120> experience<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.780> the

sound of the power play we'll have a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.830 
sound of the power play we'll have a

one<00:01:49.050> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.230> great<00:01:49.440> things<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.800> do<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> help<00:01:50.250> us

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
one of the great things we do to help us

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.580 
one of the great things we do to help us
develop<00:01:50.760> not<00:01:51.300> only<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.780> collisions<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.260> cars

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
develop not only the collisions for cars

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.920 
develop not only the collisions for cars
but<00:01:52.710> also<00:01:53.040> our<00:01:53.310> power<00:01:53.520> plays<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.690> to<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
but also our power plays with it to the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.050 
but also our power plays with it to the
junkyard<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.560> vault<00:01:55.979> three<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.580> four<00:01:56.760> cars

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.210 
junkyard the vault three or four cars
and<00:01:57.450> basically<00:01:58.260> set<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.860> work<00:01:58.979> like

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
and basically set to work like

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.120 
and basically set to work like
demolition<00:01:59.790> men<00:01:59.940> with<00:02:00.150> hammers<00:02:01.130> spanners<00:02:02.130> and

demolition men with hammers spanners and
anything<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.910> could<00:02:03.030> find<00:02:03.300> just<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
anything that we could find just to

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.610 
anything that we could find just to
record<00:02:04.050> smashing<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.920> stuff<00:02:05.190> up<00:02:06.560> there's<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
record smashing the stuff up there's a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.350 
record smashing the stuff up there's a
lot<00:02:07.800> more<00:02:08.010> that<00:02:08.580> comes<00:02:08.790> out<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.179> mix

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
lot more that comes out of the mix
