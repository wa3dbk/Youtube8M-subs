shadowing and lighting that we could

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
procedure

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.449 
procedure
but<00:02:14.599> just<00:02:14.810> like<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:14.989> regular<00:02:15.379> tattoo<00:02:16.010> there<00:02:16.280> is

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
but just like a regular tattoo there is

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.729 
but just like a regular tattoo there is
a<00:02:16.730> needle<00:02:17.120> involved<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.870> with<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.349> comes<00:02:18.560> a

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
a needle involved and with that comes a

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.740 
a needle involved and with that comes a
small<00:02:19.010> risk<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.430> infection<00:02:19.970> or<00:02:20.090> even<00:02:20.510> further

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
small risk of infection or even further

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.929 
small risk of infection or even further
scarring<00:02:21.439> and<00:02:21.590> some<00:02:22.129> people<00:02:22.400> may<00:02:22.579> be<00:02:22.640> allergic

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
scarring and some people may be allergic

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.179 
scarring and some people may be allergic
to<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.480> dye<00:02:23.629> itself<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:24.620> most<00:02:24.890> say<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
to the dye itself but most say the

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.369 
to the dye itself but most say the
procedure<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.819> not<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.360> painful<00:02:26.659> at<00:02:27.230> times

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
at worse it was like roughing up the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.390 
at worse it was like roughing up the
skin<00:02:32.659> it<00:02:32.930> took<00:02:33.109> about<00:02:33.260> six<00:02:33.709> weeks<00:02:33.890> for<00:02:34.069> Mickey
