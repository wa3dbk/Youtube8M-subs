roughly<00:01:10.130> on<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.850> market<00:01:11.210> besides<00:01:11.570> these<00:01:11.840> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
roughly on the market besides these and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.690 
roughly on the market besides these and
if<00:01:12.650> these<00:01:13.010> all<00:01:13.720> disappear<00:01:14.720> then<00:01:15.650> this<00:01:16.370> becomes

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
if these all disappear then this becomes

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.720 
if these all disappear then this becomes
the<00:01:17.060> high<00:01:17.150> price<00:01:17.480> and<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:19.130> gonna<00:01:19.310> be<00:01:19.490> really

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
the high price and it's gonna be really

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.230 
the high price and it's gonna be really
bad<00:01:20.380> because<00:01:21.380> if<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.310> card<00:01:22.550> crosses<00:01:23.060> this

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
bad because if the card crosses this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.120 
bad because if the card crosses this
line<00:01:23.300> it's<00:01:24.140> really<00:01:24.290> easy<00:01:24.560> all<00:01:24.680> someone<00:01:24.980> has<00:01:25.010> to

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
line it's really easy all someone has to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.610 
line it's really easy all someone has to
do<00:01:25.280> just<00:01:25.490> by<00:01:25.610> these<00:01:25.820> 18<00:01:26.240> copies<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:26.870> the<00:01:26.930> card

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
do just by these 18 copies and the card

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.810 
do just by these 18 copies and the card
becomes<00:01:27.860> one<00:01:28.010> hundred<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.310> thirty<00:01:28.460> dollars

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
becomes one hundred and thirty dollars

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.570 
becomes one hundred and thirty dollars
because<00:01:29.090> that's<00:01:29.360> just<00:01:29.540> how<00:01:29.690> UV<00:01:29.990> nomics<00:01:30.320> works

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
because that's just how UV nomics works
