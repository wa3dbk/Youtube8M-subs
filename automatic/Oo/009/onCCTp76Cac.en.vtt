00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
little device which I originally gave a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.029 
little device which I originally gave a
two<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> five<00:00:45.510> stars<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.559> revised

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
two out of five stars I have revised

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.299

that<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:48.090> actually<00:00:48.300> bump<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> 4<00:00:50.010> out

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that to actually bump this up to a 4 out

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279 
that to actually bump this up to a 4 out
of<00:00:50.340> 5<00:00:50.670> stars<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> reason<00:00:51.690> why<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> don't

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
of 5 stars and the reason why I don't

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.830 
of 5 stars and the reason why I don't
give<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.710> 45<00:00:53.039> out<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.579> 5<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.149> simply

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
give it a 45 out of 5 it's simply

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.830 
give it a 45 out of 5 it's simply
because<00:00:55.260> I'm<00:00:55.559> comparing<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.489> guy<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.480> other

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
because I'm comparing this guy to other

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.740

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
and let me show you this in action and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
and let me show you this in action and
now<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.900> will<00:01:22.140> notice<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.729> vent<00:01:24.119> right

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
now you will notice that this vent right

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.070 
now you will notice that this vent right
here<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.650> my<00:01:25.979> toyota<00:01:26.490> tundra<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.689> does

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
here it in my toyota tundra it does

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.410 
here it in my toyota tundra it does
wiggle<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.009> down<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.729> i<00:01:29.970> would<00:01:30.240> suggest

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
wiggle up and down so i would suggest

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.020 
wiggle up and down so i would suggest
mounting<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.560> somewhere<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> lower<00:01:32.670> level

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
mounting it somewhere on the lower level

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.260 
mounting it somewhere on the lower level
so<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.170> actually<00:01:34.409> extend<00:01:35.310> over<00:01:36.060> uh

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so that it can actually extend over uh

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.289 
so that it can actually extend over uh
the<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.259> solid<00:01:37.950> area<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.579> car<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.119> that

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the the solid area of your car so that

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.240 
the the solid area of your car so that
it<00:01:39.570> actually<00:01:39.840> well<00:01:40.500> let<00:01:40.710> me<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.040> show<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it actually well let me just show you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
it actually well let me just show you
okay<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.329> go<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.140> little

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
okay here we go so we have this little

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.700 
okay here we go so we have this little
guy<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.240> we're<00:01:45.240> gonna<00:01:45.299> clip<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.990> how<00:01:46.530> about

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
guy and we're gonna clip it on how about

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.440 
guy and we're gonna clip it on how about
right<00:01:47.960> there<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> fits<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.939> kind<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
right there and so it fits on kind of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.200 
right there and so it fits on kind of
snugly<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.189> once<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.340> put<00:01:53.610> something<00:01:53.880> on

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
snugly and once you put something on

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.499 
snugly and once you put something on
there<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.750> actually<00:01:55.140> stays<00:01:55.439> pretty<00:01:56.250> sturdy<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
there it actually stays pretty sturdy so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.289 
there it actually stays pretty sturdy so
let's<00:01:57.990> get<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.710> let's<00:01:59.070> say<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.490> example<00:01:59.549> this

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
let's get all let's say for example this

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.260 
let's get all let's say for example this
cassette<00:02:00.719> tape<00:02:01.020> which<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.820> approximately<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
cassette tape which is approximately the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.450 
cassette tape which is approximately the
same<00:02:03.600> size<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:04.259> an<00:02:04.439> iphone<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:05.159> actually<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
same size as an iphone it's actually a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
same size as an iphone it's actually a
little<00:02:05.610> thicker<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.360> we're<00:02:06.509> really<00:02:06.780> pushing

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
little thicker so we're really pushing

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.059 
little thicker so we're really pushing
it<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.710> its<00:02:07.950> limits<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.869> put<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.679> with
