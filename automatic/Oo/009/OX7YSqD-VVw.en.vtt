that I've got on and then kind of

that I've got on and then kind of
picking<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.739> enemies<00:03:03.010> often<00:03:03.250> staying<00:03:03.489> off

picking the enemies often staying off
the<00:03:03.880> rear<00:03:04.030> that's<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.360> really<00:03:04.570> important<00:03:04.959> thing

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
the rear that's a really important thing

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.750 
the rear that's a really important thing
but<00:03:05.530> for<00:03:05.769> scorestreaks<00:03:06.310> it's<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:06.580> mainly

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
but for scorestreaks it's just mainly

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.160 
but for scorestreaks it's just mainly
about<00:03:07.030> seeing<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.450> enemies<00:03:07.720> when<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.989> can

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
about seeing the enemies when you can

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.630 
about seeing the enemies when you can
and<00:03:08.440> not<00:03:08.650> having<00:03:08.830> them<00:03:09.010> too<00:03:09.190> high<00:03:09.340> like<00:03:09.519> the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
and not having them too high like the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.040 
and not having them too high like the
warbird<00:03:10.060> mister<00:03:10.330> but<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.690> that's<00:03:10.840> why<00:03:10.959> I've

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
warbird mister but so that's why I've

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.390 
warbird mister but so that's why I've
only<00:03:11.200> got<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.440> assault<00:03:11.739> drone<00:03:11.890> with<00:03:12.040> Rockets

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
only got the assault drone with Rockets

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.830 
only got the assault drone with Rockets
because<00:03:12.880> that's<00:03:13.000> actually<00:03:13.120> harder<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.600> shoot

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
because that's actually harder to shoot

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.210 
because that's actually harder to shoot
down<00:03:14.050> on<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.290> warbird<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.800> terms<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.070> just

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
down on the warbird in terms of just

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.380 
down on the warbird in terms of just
shooting<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.940> then<00:03:16.120> I've<00:03:16.209> got<00:03:16.330> the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
shooting it and then I've got the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.670 
shooting it and then I've got the
tracking<00:03:16.630> drones<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.230> add<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.620> little

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
tracking drones just to add that little

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.979

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
a little bit more if I want to get them

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.070 
a little bit more if I want to get them
around<00:03:21.519> corners<00:03:22.060> or<00:03:22.239> enemies<00:03:22.600> round<00:03:22.780> corners

the<00:03:39.040> blaster<00:03:39.340> presser<00:03:39.549> or<00:03:39.820> even<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.209> suppressor

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
the blaster presser or even a suppressor

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.210 
the blaster presser or even a suppressor
fall<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.170> my<00:03:41.290> mount<00:03:41.590> using<00:03:41.709> any<00:03:41.950> form<00:03:42.160> of

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
fall that my mount using any form of

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.380 
fall that my mount using any form of
suppressor<00:03:42.610> on<00:03:42.670> this<00:03:42.820> cluster<00:03:43.180> because<00:03:43.360> I

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
suppressor on this cluster because I

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.850 
suppressor on this cluster because I
don't<00:03:43.600> care<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.200> if<00:03:44.350> I'm<00:03:44.440> going<00:03:44.650> on<00:03:44.709> them

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
don't care but if I'm going on them

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.020 
don't care but if I'm going on them
streaks<00:03:45.160> I<00:03:45.250> don't<00:03:45.430> want<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.610> be<00:03:45.670> running<00:03:45.820> out

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
streaks I don't want to be running out

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.520 
streaks I don't want to be running out
of<00:03:46.060> ammo<00:03:46.329> in<00:03:46.510> case<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:47.019> spraying<00:03:47.320> some

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
of ammo in case and like spraying some

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.259 
of ammo in case and like spraying some
people<00:03:47.799> down<00:03:47.980> or<00:03:48.280> if<00:03:48.489> people<00:03:48.820> have<00:03:48.910> been<00:03:49.030> bunny

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
people down or if people have been bunny

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.550 
people down or if people have been bunny
rabbits<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.720> hopping<00:03:49.989> around<00:03:50.079> everywhere

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
rabbits and hopping around everywhere

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.720 
rabbits and hopping around everywhere
you<00:03:50.650> don't<00:03:50.769> want<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.010> be<00:03:51.070> down<00:03:51.220> for<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.519> sir

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
you don't want to be down for that sir

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.160 
you don't want to be down for that sir
that's<00:03:52.120> why<00:03:52.269> you<00:03:52.329> scavenge<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:52.900> into<00:03:53.079> the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
that's why you scavenge it into the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.479 
that's why you scavenge it into the
blast<00:03:53.350> pressure<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.769> is<00:03:53.829> it<00:03:53.950> needed<00:03:54.190> but

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
blast pressure it is it needed but

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.160 
blast pressure it is it needed but
that's<00:03:54.610> why<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.790> use<00:03:55.060> it<00:03:55.239> for<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.750> third<00:03:55.989> and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
that's why I use it for the third and

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.870 
that's why I use it for the third and
fourth<00:03:56.380> plus<00:03:56.680> up<00:03:56.890> what<00:03:57.070> I've<00:03:57.160> got<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.459> guys<00:03:57.610> is

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
fourth plus up what I've got you guys is

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.550 
fourth plus up what I've got you guys is
they<00:03:58.000> allowed<00:03:58.269> in<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.510> stealth<00:03:58.840> class<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.320> the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
they allowed in a stealth class and the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.720 
they allowed in a stealth class and the
reason<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.829> mentioned<00:04:00.160> them<00:04:00.250> together<00:04:00.430> is

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
reason I mentioned them together is

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.280 
reason I mentioned them together is
obviously<00:04:01.000> because<00:04:01.269> they<00:04:01.630> have<00:04:01.750> differences

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
obviously because they have differences

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.780 
obviously because they have differences
but<00:04:02.440> they're<00:04:02.590> kind<00:04:02.829> of<00:04:02.920> similar<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.400> they<00:04:03.700> do

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
but they're kind of similar and they do

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.009 
but they're kind of similar and they do
with<00:04:03.940> different<00:04:04.180> objectives<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:04.720> obviously

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
with different objectives so obviously

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.390 
with different objectives so obviously
allowed<00:04:05.230> you're<00:04:05.620> gonna<00:04:05.739> be<00:04:05.890> seen<00:04:06.070> on<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.250> rear

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
allowed you're gonna be seen on the rear

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.650 
allowed you're gonna be seen on the rear
down<00:04:06.549> but<00:04:06.670> obviously<00:04:06.940> stealth<00:04:07.239> you're<00:04:07.510> not

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
down but obviously stealth you're not

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.970 
down but obviously stealth you're not
gonna<00:04:07.780> be<00:04:07.900> seen<00:04:08.049> on<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.230> radar<00:04:08.350> anything<00:04:08.890> in

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
gonna be seen on the radar anything in

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.289 
gonna be seen on the radar anything in
this<00:04:09.100> class<00:04:09.310> set<00:04:09.459> up<00:04:09.549> is<00:04:09.640> kind<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:09.940> half<00:04:10.060> we're

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
this class set up is kind of half we're

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.150 
this class set up is kind of half we're
going<00:04:10.570> for<00:04:10.720> DNA<00:04:10.989> bomb<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.260> half<00:04:11.380> not<00:04:11.620> because

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
going for DNA bomb and half not because

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.350 
going for DNA bomb and half not because
I've<00:04:12.280> got<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.489> system<00:04:12.790> hacks<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.150> stuff<00:04:13.269> on

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
I've got the system hacks and stuff on

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.759 
I've got the system hacks and stuff on
but<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.540> have<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.750> warbird<00:04:14.110> as<00:04:14.230> well<00:04:14.410> the

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
but I have the warbird as well the

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.199 
but I have the warbird as well the
warbirds<00:04:15.130> kind<00:04:15.340> of<00:04:15.430> there<00:04:15.610> just<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:15.970> say<00:04:16.150> you

can call it and if you choose to and you

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.319 
can call it and if you choose to and you
don't<00:04:18.190> really<00:04:18.310> want<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.579> go<00:04:18.700> for<00:04:18.729> a<00:04:18.880> DNA<00:04:19.030> bomb

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
don't really want to go for a DNA bomb

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.060 
don't really want to go for a DNA bomb
certified<00:04:20.049> but<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.350> next<00:04:20.560> cluster<00:04:20.739> of<00:04:20.979> the

certified but the next cluster of the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.529 
certified but the next cluster of the
DNA<00:04:21.370> bomb<00:04:21.549> one<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:21.850> I<00:04:21.880> will<00:04:22.060> show<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.300> guys

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
DNA bomb one that I will show you guys

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.360 
DNA bomb one that I will show you guys
is<00:04:22.840> fully<00:04:23.289> optimized<00:04:23.710> for<00:04:23.919> going<00:04:24.100> for<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.250> DNA

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
is fully optimized for going for a DNA

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.100 
is fully optimized for going for a DNA
of<00:04:24.580> I'm<00:04:24.700> going<00:04:25.060> on<00:04:25.150> then<00:04:25.300> gun<00:04:25.539> streaks<00:04:25.870> rather

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
of I'm going on then gun streaks rather

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.810 
of I'm going on then gun streaks rather
than<00:04:26.320> having<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.830> choice<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.400> actually<00:04:27.669> just

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
than having the choice to actually just

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.460 
than having the choice to actually just
go<00:04:27.970> on<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.150> streak<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.600> then<00:04:28.960> go<00:04:29.110> on<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.289> gun

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
go on a streak and then go on a gun

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.200 
go on a streak and then go on a gun
streak<00:04:29.710> as<00:04:29.860> well<00:04:30.160> at<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.340> same<00:04:30.370> time<00:04:30.789> so<00:04:31.090> if

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
streak as well at the same time so if

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.580 
streak as well at the same time so if
you<00:04:31.270> didn't<00:04:31.510> catch<00:04:31.539> those<00:04:31.960> two<00:04:32.110> plus<00:04:32.350> ups

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
you didn't catch those two plus ups

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.750 
you didn't catch those two plus ups
right<00:04:32.770> there<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.100> only<00:04:33.280> differences<00:04:33.640> that

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
right there the only differences that

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.100 
right there the only differences that
are<00:04:33.880> made<00:04:34.090> who's<00:04:34.510> not<00:04:34.660> using<00:04:34.930> blast

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
are made who's not using blast

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.200 
are made who's not using blast
suppressor<00:04:35.229> on<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.950> loudclass<00:04:36.280> as<00:04:36.760> well<00:04:37.030> as

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
suppressor on the loudclass as well as

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.640 
suppressor on the loudclass as well as
not<00:04:37.360> using<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:37.660> suppressor<00:04:37.930> on<00:04:38.289> the

not using the suppressor on the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
loudclass and I'm using stockings

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.570 
loudclass and I'm using stockings
because<00:04:40.290> he<00:04:40.350> being<00:04:40.650> stealthy<00:04:41.130> you're<00:04:41.460> not

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
because he being stealthy you're not

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.770 
because he being stealthy you're not
gonna<00:04:41.670> be<00:04:41.820> really<00:04:42.090> running<00:04:42.270> around<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.630> map

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
gonna be really running around the map

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.820 
gonna be really running around the map
as<00:04:42.900> much<00:04:43.080> you're<00:04:43.230> gonna<00:04:43.350> be<00:04:43.500> moving<00:04:43.620> around

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
as much you're gonna be moving around

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.500 
as much you're gonna be moving around
but<00:04:44.070> not<00:04:44.190> as<00:04:44.310> fast<00:04:44.520> so<00:04:44.940> that's<00:04:45.060> why<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:45.270> don't

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
but not as fast so that's why I don't

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.970 
but not as fast so that's why I don't
use<00:04:45.540> stop<00:04:45.840> on<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.200> one<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:46.530> there<00:04:46.680> is<00:04:46.860> the

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
use stop on that one so there is the

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.960 
use stop on that one so there is the
stealth<00:04:47.190> class<00:04:47.400> on<00:04:47.520> your<00:04:47.550> screen<00:04:47.790> right<00:04:47.940> now

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
stealth class on your screen right now

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.150 
stealth class on your screen right now
and<00:04:48.180> then<00:04:48.630> here<00:04:48.900> is<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.230> loud<00:04:49.530> class<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:50.070> you

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
and then here is the loud class so you

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.710 
and then here is the loud class so you
can<00:04:50.250> pause<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.670> if<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.150> want<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.390> replicate

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
can pause that if you want to replicate

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.440 
can pause that if you want to replicate
those<00:04:52.140> so<00:04:52.650> now<00:04:52.680> for<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.310> final<00:04:53.580> cluster<00:04:54.210> which

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
those so now for the final cluster which

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.780 
those so now for the final cluster which
will<00:04:54.660> be<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.840> DNA<00:04:55.410> bomb<00:04:55.650> specified<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.580> well

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
will be a DNA bomb specified and well

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.400 
will be a DNA bomb specified and well

guys<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> quick-draw<00:04:59.640> stock<00:05:00.150> and

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
guys is a quick-draw stock and

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.520 
guys is a quick-draw stock and

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
suppressor it's kind of a mixture

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.830 
suppressor it's kind of a mixture
