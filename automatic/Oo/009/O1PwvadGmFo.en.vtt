together<00:02:36.690> their<00:02:37.230> whole<00:02:37.440> year<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:38.519> they

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
together their whole year and they

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.240 
together their whole year and they
they've<00:02:39.569> got<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> mission<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.920> think<00:02:41.129> that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.640 
they've got a mission and I think that
that's<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.700> lend<00:02:41.879> itself<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.379> much<00:02:43.379> more

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
that's going to lend itself to much more

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.319
