00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 or the chaux and compass and welcome to another 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.540
 title price of leads new weapons 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.849
 grenade launcher and much more ok then 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.950
 Let's start with this video because 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.780
 I recently found this 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.609
 information on the internet in the forum 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.590
 seven things that would be leaving the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.619
 in the description that all this has been 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.240
 found by sad and we live and they are 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.769
 will be leaving in the description ok but 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.349
 let's start with this since it has 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.910
 seemed quite interesting and may 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 be watching an image on the screen 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.260
 that as they see it, they simply appear 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.690
 some codes that in most of the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.969
 initials does not come out in bihar and if not 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.860
 would mean in cock and if they want 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.379
 translate would mean more or less 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.110
 bank robberies in the multiplayer mode 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.510
 ok and in the first place in the first 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.879
 point we can appreciate what it says and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.980
 in pib although it would be like a new bomb 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.670
 in the second point we can appreciate 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.620
 a few words that tells us to violate final 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.090
 but this refers more than anything to a 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 new audio that can be 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.860
 related to new audios of the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.670
 robberies to banks right after we see that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.909
 tells us that there will be new 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.920
 of what all this is doing 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.600
 new mode of vehicles that 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.909
 want to include with all this the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.520
 robberies to banks ok in the fourth point 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.159
 we see that he tells us a new contact with 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.229
 lester it will be to find new 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.700
 armed cars do not know what you mean 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.560
 very good with this I do not know if it's because of that 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.090
 new lane revel that has as a 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.399
 turret or that is one of the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.490
 special modifications right after 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.439
 tells us that we are going to have new clothes and 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.619
 here comes the most interesting thing that has been 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.050
 found bonus of the exclusive dlc the 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.850
 which is a gas peseta ok 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.039
 a pretty strange gas that could be 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.149
 a new deadly weapon and right after 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.740
 they tell us a xm25 grenade launcher no me 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.740
 I suppose this will be like a kind of 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.539
 AK-47 with an embedded grenade launcher or 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.610
 it may be a new modification of the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.220
 weapon not which would be perfect and me 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.459
 I would love not to just be able to go 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.770
 aiming with your assault rifle weapon or 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.750
 a special weapon and that with the key 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.910
 right simply instead of turning on the 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.100
 lantern that you release a grenade that 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.610
 I exploded instantly, that would not be very 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.110
 good 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.180
 armand in fact I would love that 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.980
 there would be a weapon with grenade launchers since 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.480
 grenade launcher today I do not like 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.370
 pretty since I do something 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.260
 complicated to change gun not but the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.780
 true that it would be super good right 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.880
 then we see that they tell us about new 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.920
 armed vehicles that was what they 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.540
 I was talking earlier that such 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.190
 once they refer to this new street in 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.980
 revel that if you can remember 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.470
 had a turret right after 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.840
 then they tell us the thermal pump not a 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.730
 bomb which maybe we are going to take a 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.940
 smoke and we can activate something 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.750
 thermal to be able to see by heat there 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.970
 sandwich 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.070
 terminal bomb would be like throwing a 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.310
 grenade and be able to see the enemies to 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.709
 through the heat that emerges your body or 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.330
 something very strange right after in the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.880
 next point you can see what they tell us 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.459
 new masks new mask and then we 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.370
 says in pija and jeff teague this would be a 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.840
 new contact and also either in the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.600
 person to whom we will be giving 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.730
 the haste and good robberies to banks to 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.340
 through which we live in the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.990
 big point 5 and now comes some of what 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.150
 more interesting and tells us in pegasus 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.340
 what would this mean that maybe 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.380
 we can buy a new vehicle from 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.130
 pieces to which work we are going to unlock 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.470
 with a million and a half dollars that ok 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.050
 this is believed to be the leader and goes 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.690
 to be to buy it or also you are going 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.180
 to be able to have and dock what is going 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.270
 making the military base just after 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.450
 he tells us he is in flight school 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.870
 with the leader to whom it was added in the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.850
 update 1.19 and at the last point 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.870
 but it is not so mentioned they tell us 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.820
 that a content pack of something else 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.640
 handles in which they are intended to 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.740
 come animals ok I do not know if with animals 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.420
 can refer more than anything to dogs 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.490
 of attack there tells us to horses but 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.990
 I believe that in horses in the great 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.970
 law effect do not have many meanings 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.980
 but attack dogs me that I know about 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.450
 rottweilers and things so you 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.000
 unwrap so they can also carry 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.980
 money to your base and a lot of things like that 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.170
 It does not do to me what sounds the most to me 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.910
 that they are trained dogs which 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.000
 unfold the tasks that you create 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.530
 convenient and you want to order them not me 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.510
 I think this can be very possible 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.860
 and referring to the animals and the 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.360
 you are really fine 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.710
 tell me what you think of all that of equal 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.169
 way if you saw some little things 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.900
 interesting will be made known and 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.940
 If I also have some ideas or things 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.520
