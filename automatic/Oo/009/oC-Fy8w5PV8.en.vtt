00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.110
 welcome from the year for the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.240
 brand new samsung galaxy tab it in the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.830
 have hand with a 8.4 inch screen 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.190
 It also came with a 10 5 inch 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.620
 screen presented both have the 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.610
 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution a victim 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.230
 core processor in it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.230
 continue with 19 and 1 5 gigahertz 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.730
 nice front button to wake up the gc 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.090
 is now also a fingerprint again 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.490
 in it 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.670
 same as samsung galaxy s 5 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.070
 both devices are 66 mm thin so that 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.870
 We also pull the 8.4 inch product and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.440
 We have the same colors for both 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.920
 selection 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.129
 once bronze titanium and then so 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.239
 a gold knows here in combination us 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.489
 Both can be seen so small 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 Pünktchen here someone press so pure 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.500
 can 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.789
 this is not for the covers this time 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.100
 magnetically attached but 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.809
 Click here, so to speak 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.149
 we have eight megapixel camera in the back 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.219
 plus a light and a 2 megapixel 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.199
 camera in front and of course one more 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.390
 sensor laterally again a few 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.250
 connections such as a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.490
 speaker infrared micro sd 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.170
 volume control on and off switch 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.540
 micro usb headphones and another one 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.970
 speakers in the silver version 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.670
 same with the big model I have 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.659
 also discovered a sim card slot 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.460
 if you compare it very briefly with 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.100
 an apple ipad mini we see that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.820
 although the ipad is supposed to be only 79 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.130
 only you explained that the display 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.710
 actually much much bigger at the time 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.509
 But collection is wide for it 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.740
 and maybe not ideal for that 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.500
 read website if now many say 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.630
 but at the sharpness and picture 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.659
 Speed ​​and quality is on everyone 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.920
 no two devices or is that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.509
 others by no means worse 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.409
 definitely thinner and much 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.579
 more comfortable in the probably 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.079
 everyday use then is too 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.420
 easier by that a little bit more 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.189
 plastic was used as I said it 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.950
 are a few heights to such as a 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.259
 We can just bookcover here 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.210
 it dock click click is necessary to briefly 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.670
 do it and then it comes here 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 make and take wonderful 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.740
 Of course there's also here 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.200
 understand king features such as 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.260
 example, the whole then just here 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.120
 set up on the table or if it is 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.920
 have a little smaller angle 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.590
 So, or with a whole 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.800
 low angle then correspondingly whole 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.900
 then flat would be just angled exactly 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.670
 to tap then probably completely 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.720
 pleasant also a very short comparison 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.000
 by the way, with the 10 inch device, the whole thing 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.830
 even with just such a protection 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.630
 I want to dock for the front 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.860
 Now, however, does not attach as 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.510
 said that should pull under here 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:48.280
 still very fast to the small one 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.860
 size comparison can see here 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.690
 of course considerably smaller the 84 inches 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.510
 but then again one 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.850
 detailed video with at 10 inches 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.769
 and separately, of course, both again 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.390
 Comparison so far technically so 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.880
 pretty much sings for both 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.680
 kitkat software and the like actually 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.610
 is relatively similar to finance and gravel 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.090
 Until next time 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.329
 this was the samsung galaxy tab it 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.360
 84 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.370
 in the first hands-on first shot to the 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.209
 next time our unforgettable 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.209
