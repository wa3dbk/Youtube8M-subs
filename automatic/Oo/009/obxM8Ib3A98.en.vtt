00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.200
 this time we have access to 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.209
 ville de windows 10 12 5 3 4 with this 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.759
 video that comes to us from china in it 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.009
 we can see first the agenda and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.050
 as we have seen with a new design that 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.359
 will allow us to take advantage of a style of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.850
 panorama mode but have the contacts 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.619
 so they say this time we see the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.570
 application of messages with the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.029
 possibility of through the bar 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.730
 lower add new messages and we see 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.440
 again like the rounded shapes 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.200
 they become a main part of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.120
 windows 10 we can see how the workshop already 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.520
 has improved and already occupies the screen as 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.840
 should be and not in miniature so that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.879
 it takes better advantage of the space in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 screen still so to improve in 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.710
 some aspects but you already have a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.050
 very very good aspect here we can see 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 the application outlook mail a novelty 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.770
 we were waiting because he was already playing 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.949
 a renewal of the mail and no doubt 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.570
 this application looks good 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.090
 we can see with the hamburger menu the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.530
 different folders 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.300
 and then we have the button 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 down configuration that will allow us 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.970
 access configuration options 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.970
 mail 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.160
 as we see we also have gestures to 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.290
 able to interact with the application and 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.880
 with the different emails so that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.860
 be much more comfortable to work with 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.960
 our our emails from our 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.760
 mobile phone certainly a great advantage 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.130
 there we can see how sliding towards 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.049
 like to the right we can mark a 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.800
 mail and to the left what 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.690
 we will eliminate 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.790
 another of the novelties is that if we press 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.040
 OK hamburger we can enter 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.620
 the calendar application of a 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.750
 very fast way again it would be outlook 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.190
 calendar promoting in this way 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.830
 of the outlook calendar service 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.210
 which is very very good as we see 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.880
 the interface has changed again 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.430
 completely and we can see week to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.590
 week and day to day in this bill it 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.680
 also includes project spartan that 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.930
 will have the possibility to see the web 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.730
 in a very different way as we see 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.130
 has the three access points 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.360
 inferior and with some options that already 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.330
 we have seen in the browser version 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.980
 of the desktop the configuration of fact 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.650
 a slightly reduced version appears 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.660
 for mobile phones it certainly has 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.520
 very good looking and has the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.340
 switches that we've been seeing in 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.080
 all the bits of windows 10 certainly a 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.670
 quite interesting change and that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.650
 We will see how it works 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.580
 wanting to try it so they can give the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.580
 adequate feedback 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.970
 as you see 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.739
 As you can see we have many of the options 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.260
 that I have commented and apart 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.750
 We have the option to share or a hub 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.550
 the hub is neither more nor less than in a 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.800
 same tab have the favorites the 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.000
 reading view and the way history 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.739
 that sliding from left to right 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.100
 we can access the different 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.320
 functions like what happens in windows 10 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.630
 As you can see, it 's like I told you but 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.820
 we can also access it by sliding 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.210
 so it's very interesting for a 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.210
 use better
