00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
piece wasn't stamped I use this scratch

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.130 
piece wasn't stamped I use this scratch
stone<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> touchstone<00:01:54.570> actually<00:01:55.079> is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
stone here it's a touchstone actually is

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.499 
stone here it's a touchstone actually is
what<00:01:55.289> it's<00:01:55.409> called<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.270> get<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> scratch

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
what it's called so I I get a scratch

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.450 
what it's called so I I get a scratch
it's<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.079> really<00:01:58.259> faint<00:01:58.560> fine<00:01:59.070> scratch

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's just a really faint fine scratch

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.709 
it's just a really faint fine scratch
there

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
there

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.690 
there
doesn't<00:02:01.409> damage<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> pieces<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.579> of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
doesn't damage the pieces just kind of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.340 
doesn't damage the pieces just kind of
like<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.360> were<00:02:03.479> rubbing<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.899> against<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.320> wall

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
like you were rubbing it against a wall

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.139 
like you were rubbing it against a wall
essentially<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.250> as<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> dark<00:02:05.939> surface

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
essentially it just as a dark surface

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.510 
essentially it just as a dark surface
there<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.750> then<00:02:07.259> here<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> 10-carat<00:02:08.160> test

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
there and then here is a 10-carat test

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.430 
there and then here is a 10-carat test
key<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> tip<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.019> kind<00:02:10.289> of

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
key so this the tip of this is kind of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.699 
key so this the tip of this is kind of
certified<00:02:11.120> exactly<00:02:12.120> 10<00:02:12.330> karat<00:02:12.690> also<00:02:13.470> put<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
certified exactly 10 karat also put the

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.070 
certified exactly 10 karat also put the
14-karat<00:02:14.489> one<00:02:14.640> down<00:02:14.910> here<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.540> tip<00:02:15.810> here

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
14-karat one down here so this tip here

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.430 
14-karat one down here so this tip here
is<00:02:16.230> 14<00:02:16.739> karat<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.420> put<00:02:18.630> those<00:02:18.780> down<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.380> then

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
is 14 karat so I put those down and then

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.589 
is 14 karat so I put those down and then
I<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.860> these<00:02:20.069> different<00:02:20.280> acids<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.300> 10

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
I have these different acids I have a 10

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.100 
I have these different acids I have a 10
karat<00:02:21.959> 49<00:02:22.560> para<00:02:23.010> 18<00:02:23.459> or<00:02:23.640> 22<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.930> find

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
karat 49 para 18 or 22 so I can find

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.770 
karat 49 para 18 or 22 so I can find
kind<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.730> carrot<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.150> gold<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.569> way

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
kind of the the carrot of gold this way

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.210 
kind of the the carrot of gold this way
as<00:02:27.930> well<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.319> I'll<00:02:28.440> add<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.800> 10<00:02:29.010> karat

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
as well so I'll add the 10 karat

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.180 
as well so I'll add the 10 karat
solution<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:31.050> these<00:02:31.200> two<00:02:31.440> scratches<00:02:31.980> there

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
solution to these two scratches there

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.300 
solution to these two scratches there
and<00:02:32.459> what<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:33.030> should<00:02:33.330> find<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.780> they<00:02:33.900> do

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
and what I should find is that they do

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.030 
and what I should find is that they do
they<00:02:35.310> kind<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.610> match<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.269> scratch<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.830> 10

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
they kind of match the scratch so the 10

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.240 
they kind of match the scratch so the 10
karat<00:02:38.250> under<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.910> 10<00:02:39.090> karat<00:02:39.319> solution<00:02:40.319> the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
karat under the 10 karat solution the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.920 
karat under the 10 karat solution the
centerpiece<00:02:41.849> should<00:02:42.180> do<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.420> same<00:02:42.599> thing<00:02:42.810> as

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
centerpiece should do the same thing as

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.930 
centerpiece should do the same thing as
the<00:02:43.080> 10<00:02:43.290> karat<00:02:43.470> scratch<00:02:43.860> then<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.250> 14<00:02:44.640> karat

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the 10 karat scratch then the 14 karat

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.030 
the 10 karat scratch then the 14 karat
this<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:45.959> should<00:02:46.140> fade<00:02:46.319> away<00:02:46.500> quicker<00:02:46.769> which

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
this one should fade away quicker which

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.059 
this one should fade away quicker which
is<00:02:47.190> what<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:47.459> kind<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.760> doing<00:02:48.030> there

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.789 

all<00:02:54.879> grain<00:02:55.180> sitting<00:02:55.659> around

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.990 

see<00:03:02.799> what<00:03:02.950> they

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
see what they

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000 
see what they
I<00:03:05.030> was<00:03:05.240> quite<00:03:05.510> surprised<00:03:05.960> you<00:03:06.380> know<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.530> didn't

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
I was quite surprised you know I didn't

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.440 
I was quite surprised you know I didn't
a<00:03:07.040> lot<00:03:07.280> for<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.610> new<00:03:07.730> overseas<00:03:08.299> but<00:03:08.629> I<00:03:08.900> can't

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.770 

where'd<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.380> get<00:03:12.500> them
