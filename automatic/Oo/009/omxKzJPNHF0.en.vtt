00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hi girls today I'm back here with 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.790
 more or less to you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.250
 and today I came to speak to you as you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.469
 have seen in the description on lipsticks 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.290
 similar to kylie jenner's lipsticks 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.220
 what people her lipsticks was crazy 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.920
 fever and only 12 thousand tons of max cause 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 I can not mistake one lipstick and one pencil 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.250
 I do not remember the name of now 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.820
 but I'll leave it here for you guys 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.609
 but summing up is a lipstick that not all 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.890
 world has access is by price and also 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.290
 Because it was a fever and you almost 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.180
 I did not find anywhere and pencils and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.700
 I confess that I did not even go looking 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.989
 exactly it because right then as it says 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.239
 the pink mouth bia 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.600
 we always have our first cousins 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.719
 which are bbb snow products are those 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.670
 Superb products then come show 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.920
 that some options that I have that I 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.600
 I always use it and I think it's very similar 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.000
 with lipsticks since then it has like that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.890
 you turn around without spending a lot percent 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.930
 exactly the button she uses 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.039
 and to know that betrayal and if it is only 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.199
 keep watching the video 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.479
 Let's start with that lipstick here that I 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.840
 I'm using it, it's beautiful and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.570
 wonderful is a ping lipstick that I 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.170
 I bought it at the express of this brand that I 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 now and a lot of people are comments on 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.150
 my videos that Korean kills 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.310
 skin that is terrible and drooling 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.229
 I use this lipstick to those who have never done evil 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.150
 none for me until now of course it has 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.939
 products that I dare not buy 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.159
 on express by tooth whitening 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.189
 All these things I do not even try 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.829
 base that is mac print these things I 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.570
 I do not even dare to buy but I already had 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.540
 a lot that I bought that today I 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.210
 use well - it's because I also care 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.759
 In this one, I had to give it to me. 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.909
 lipstick here people I have several tozzo 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.320
 a lot and I never felt anything in my mouth 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.990
 allergy in the copco strange stranger after 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.210
 I use a good time so I can say 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.729
 For you guys, it's cheap, it's Korean. 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.240
 and it's very good so it's that kishon color 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.060
 pink nor the crude and cool of this button 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.489
 he is super super durable he 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.319
 It lasted a lot in the mouth. I'll shoot it. 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.690
 You that I'm showing 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.490
 I'm going to use it here to get this 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.130
 breaker from break to firm 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.500
 bruna tavares's feminices I loved it 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.390
 that in that show that he recently 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.220
 It's saving me a lot. 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.990
 very well even if it 's button 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.570
 type that only comes out so it only leaves with 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.880
 Makeup remover does not help you scrub 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.250
 and pass the water he does not go out 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.060
 so on the one hand it is good for that detail 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.920
 huh 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.220
 He only goes out with a make-up remover. 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.220
 see 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.810
 she called a pen, I always say 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.600
 you pass some corrective base 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:59.590
 for the button to stay in the real color of it 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.510
 so get some corrective is 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.269
 in your mouth it all gets so horrible even 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.670
 At first I appear a zombie 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.350
 but it's good because so it will appear 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.350
 the color is real good button 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.900
 the other I make people that I have like 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.730
 option is a mix of button I mix 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.310
 this lipstick here dailus that the sis oni 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.530
 That a little kiss so my kiss is good 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.940
 like this here even the worst 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.579
 it's almost the same 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.079
 so I'll get this color here and mix it up 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:37.420
 with natura pencil in color 01 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.260
 it is human nature not nature 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.940
 watercolor 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.579
 so let's go the first step and get 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.049
 while he before them and carew already 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.370
 step by step over to the two 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.370
 stay together cap 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.440
 I've done it, I've been here, I'm going 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.350
 run to that lapse he is a rose 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:30.100
 A little darker and I'm going to 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:31.660
 above says he feels close to 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.370
 I have to show you, it 's a 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.710
 Lipstick that unfortunately I have only 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.210
 show of him is this one here little 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.240
 who wins from toast and when I made a 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.070
 purchase on the site and already indicates processor 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.440
 that he has button are very cute is 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.750
 of the sites button only a lipstick and 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.340
 very good quality and it is not very 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.919
 People who know what a pity 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.550
 because there are very beautiful things and many 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.760
 so they are signs there are matte lipsticks 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.919
 so this lipstick is lipstick in color 08 and I 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.780
 I only have the team that no people it 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.960
 It's wonderful and I'll pass on to you. 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.960
 see 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.000
 and this one here as well as the other 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.070
 and also does not have a matte effect but 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.190
 you can leave the effect using a 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.289
 poor lucid over and let's go last 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.630
 that people are the most beautiful more 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.180
 charming collection that pauses for the 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.919
 feminist tragedy of bruna tavares and 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.750
 People she devastates in the colors of lipsticks 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.639
 she does not have anything to say 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.370
 wonderful said button that sure 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.650
 which I think is more like one of the 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.259
 that the fall uses this from here people are a guy 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.389
 launched not too long ago that the color 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.880
 beautiful mate that she was inspired by the truth 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.160
 a lipstick in the color of the beautiful mouth of the film 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.750
 beautiful and the beast and incredible people how much is 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.030
 Look, I think it's really cool if 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.180
 inspired disney character 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.810
 people this color is magnificent only one 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.810
 for you now 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.949
 and look what color is wonderful not type 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.840
 I have to say is that it's common here in 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.280
 video is looking more pulled by a 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.560
 pink by rosa 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.720
 but he is a pink half pulled by a 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.539
 romantic a touch so brown knows 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.310
 that the most closed reason is very 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.020
 beautiful and cheap is wonderful then 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.270
 People I've got this video using 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.370
 a lipstick and I'll finish with this one because 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.870
 So beautiful, I'm going to be pissed. 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.430

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.919

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.430
 I hope you enjoyed the 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.349
 suggestions of lipsticks similar to those of 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.710
 All right, there are some that do not. 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.930
 are identical but even remember one 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.340
 I light the color of her lipstick and I hope 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.860
 that you liked the suggestions 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.159

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.430
 that you find your favorite to 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:10.470
 Me, this one, the favorite, picks up that one. 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.840
 tone is more closed brown and this 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.500
 here but my favorite like 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.569
 rose 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.490
