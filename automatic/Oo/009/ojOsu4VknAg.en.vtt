 so today I'm coming back to you 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.199
 with new words which will consist heil 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.419
 to revamp a doormat 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.890
 and not just any doormat that's 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:27.130
 a doormat simply by 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:29.050
 rubber that looks like you associate 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.489
 see these shoes it's this type of 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.829
 doormat there with non forms 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.559
 Baroque or arabesque type 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.750
 it's been a little earlier I know 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.710
 not if it's baroque or oriental in 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.070
 anyway they are pretty arabesques 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.839
 so this lease to his game buy them to 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.070
 madam at 4,099 so really cheap from 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.190
 everything and you will see that we can 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.839
 really make it look and turn it around and 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.390
 to do something really 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.960
 pretty so if this little one said white you 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.660
 interested 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.650
 keep looking so for this little 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.930
 i ladies tutorial or have to bahia 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.660
 are of this type there you can the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.220
 find in the bazaar stores so 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.720
 I know they have there are others 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.250
 with other reasons so if you 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.020
 prefer the other patterns you make 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.620
 really like you want that one 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.220
 so I found them at mach ladies and he 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.590
 will you need a bomb of this type 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.200
 if you do not have a bomb you can 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.870
 test with acrylic paint 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.490
 I have not tested possibly with 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.430
 acrylic paint and you can 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.510
 then to protect past painting 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.380
 a spray of varnish over me so me 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.670
 I will use 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.219
 the rest of my bomb effect metal is 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.829
 a golden bomb and that's it really 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.229
 everything you need is gone for 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.310
 the tutorial to paint simply 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.649
 my my carpet if I'm going to use 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.750
 just a little cardboard to protect 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.679
 underneath me I took an old 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.019
 calendars and here I'm going to start 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.489
 you said do not worry you 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.420
 do not need bombs and 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.040
 regular way 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.420
 it really has to make an effect 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.849
 a little patina 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.940
 so I'm going to take my bomb and I'm going 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.330
 make small, rather dry gestures 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.330
 this 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.560
 false 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.660
 then you just have to hold 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.319
 account of the drying time indicated on 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.790
 your paint bombs and that's what 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.860
 it looks like after half an hour of 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.910
 drying you can see that it gives 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.750
 really a nice little tea does that 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.280
 really gives a nice spinning effect and 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.200
 so now so the video is 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.970
 now finished I hope she 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.410
