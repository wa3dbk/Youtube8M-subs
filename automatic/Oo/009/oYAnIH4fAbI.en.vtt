00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.620
 his part contributed 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.660
 with a small amount of in-house 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.910
 belly bacon eaten with chive 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.350

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.480
 richard schwienbacher boss of all 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.480
 South Tyrolean becker has brought something 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.740
 to the south tyrol bacon 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.540
 no matter if belly or beating that belongs 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.910
 typical hard shakes like it does here 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 in his organic bakery in santa walburg 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.540
 will be produced 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.470
 The shaking bread dough exists in the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.050
 main thing made from rye and wheat flour 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.770
 water yeast salt is added to that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.770
 fennel and caraway 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.010
 every morning from half past five takes place in the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.390
 bakehouse the common shake place 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.440
 [Music] 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.180
 that day shaken by hand 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.810
 must be has its very special 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.810
 reason 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.820
 this is not true red sea and 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.880
 dry it sticks and therefore you have to 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.400
 now with bran and not smaller and 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.400
 then somehow this will be this original 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.530
 but barely a quarter today can offer that 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.190
 it is not poured anymore but it 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.420
 is sprayed by vending machines 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.420
 that's just like the farmers 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.720
 Shake off bread is extremely tasty 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.830
 and last for months 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.750
 [Music] 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.240
 that is used by many consumers in the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.460
 and appreciated abroad 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.410
 Shaking bread is becoming an important one 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.640
 become an export item 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.970
 Richard Schwienbacher has been producing since 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.400
 soon 30 years biobrot total 73 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.650
 various products including one 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.090
 local rye bread with yourself 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.300
 bred sourdough is produced 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.920
 The farmers just packed in something special 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.990
 100 prints 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.860
 that is different from the others 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.500
 in south Tyrol was the 100 dry the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.890
 rye bread that is very elastic 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.860
 it is in the flat bread and by the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.110
 that's a very soft dough that's it 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.510
 as in the middle point , it is a 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.600
 very elastic it is soft pastry and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.070
 you can see the hole here very much 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.410
 interesting if you like wheat flour 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.190
 you would not do such a thing 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.190
 nice bore
