as<00:01:12.979> far<00:01:13.159> as<00:01:13.220> Nick<00:01:13.369> Jones<00:01:13.580> style<00:01:13.909> goes<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:14.390> that

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
as far as Nick Jones style goes is that

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.330 
as far as Nick Jones style goes is that
it's<00:01:14.659> very<00:01:15.020> low<00:01:15.350> most<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.890> tunings<00:01:16.220> he

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
it's very low most of the tunings he

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.550 
it's very low most of the tunings he
used<00:01:16.610> were<00:01:17.299> low<00:01:18.549> in<00:01:19.549> pitch<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.299> obviously<00:01:20.930> at

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
used were low in pitch and obviously at

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.930 
used were low in pitch and obviously at
the<00:01:21.680> same<00:01:21.830> time<00:01:22.070> in<00:01:22.220> tension<00:01:22.670> on<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.909> neck

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
the same time in tension on the neck

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.469 
the same time in tension on the neck
which<00:01:23.390> means<00:01:23.690> that<00:01:23.840> we<00:01:24.130> get<00:01:25.130> this<00:01:25.250> very<00:01:25.640> snappy

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
which means that we get this very snappy

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.780 
which means that we get this very snappy
sound<00:01:26.899> quite<00:01:27.170> easy

push the string down into the guitar me
that's<00:01:57.280> how<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.459> get<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.850> most<00:01:57.969> resonance

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
made by John Pierce they're about the

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.670 
made by John Pierce they're about the
best<00:05:08.880> commercially<00:05:09.870> available<00:05:09.930> ones<00:05:10.229> you<00:05:10.530> can

best commercially available ones you can

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.400 
best commercially available ones you can
get<00:05:10.970> because<00:05:11.970> they're<00:05:12.450> not<00:05:12.630> too<00:05:12.870> long

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
get because they're not too long

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.219 
get because they're not too long
don't<00:05:13.620> buy<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:14.160> long<00:05:14.490> thumb<00:05:14.940> pick<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.479> don't<00:05:16.139> know

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
why they even exist

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.690 
why they even exist
they're<00:05:18.960> not<00:05:19.289> very<00:05:19.470> good<00:05:19.710> for<00:05:19.950> your<00:05:20.010> technique

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
they're not very good for your technique

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.490 
they're not very good for your technique
and<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:21.570> wouldn't<00:05:22.560> recommend<00:05:22.919> them<00:05:24.260> so<00:05:25.260> try<00:05:25.410> and

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
and I wouldn't recommend them so try and

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.469 
and I wouldn't recommend them so try and
get<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:25.620> short<00:05:25.950> thumb<00:05:26.520> pick<00:05:26.789> if<00:05:26.970> you<00:05:27.000> can<00:05:27.270> if<00:05:27.419> you

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
get a short thumb pick if you can if you

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:28.940 
get a short thumb pick if you can if you
can't<00:05:27.630> find<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.870> short<00:05:28.050> one<00:05:28.169> file<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.470> long<00:05:28.740> one

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
can't find a short one file a long one

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.990 
can't find a short one file a long one
down<00:05:30.620> that<00:05:31.620> just<00:05:31.830> again<00:05:32.100> it's<00:05:32.310> about<00:05:32.460> attack

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
down that just again it's about attack

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.450 
down that just again it's about attack
really<00:05:33.240> allows<00:05:33.539> us<00:05:33.570> to<00:05:33.840> get<00:05:33.960> a<00:05:33.990> bit<00:05:34.169> more

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
really allows us to get a bit more

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.900 
really allows us to get a bit more
attack<00:05:35.460> with<00:05:35.700> the<00:05:35.910> with<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.510> thumb<00:05:37.910> apart

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
attack with the with the thumb apart

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.210 
attack with the with the thumb apart
from<00:05:39.060> that<00:05:39.330> I'm<00:05:39.990> going<00:05:40.229> to<00:05:40.289> leave<00:05:42.169> the<00:05:43.169> song<00:05:44.100> to

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
from that I'm going to leave the song to

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.620 
from that I'm going to leave the song to
speak<00:05:44.430> for<00:05:44.580> itself<00:05:44.610> so<00:05:44.940> have<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.210> listen<00:05:45.510> to<00:05:45.539> the

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
speak for itself so have a listen to the

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.050 
speak for itself so have a listen to the
recording<00:05:46.370> I'm<00:05:47.370> not<00:05:47.520> going<00:05:47.700> to<00:05:47.760> take<00:05:47.880> the

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
recording I'm not going to take the

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.090 
recording I'm not going to take the
whole<00:05:48.240> thing<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.870> bits<00:05:49.080> but<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:49.560> hope<00:05:49.830> that's

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
whole thing to bits but I hope that's

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.820 
whole thing to bits but I hope that's
giving<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.520> some<00:05:50.820> insight<00:05:51.810> into<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.680> way

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
giving you some insight into the way

this song was played and hopefully I'll

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.240 
this song was played and hopefully I'll
