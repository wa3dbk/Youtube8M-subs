00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
dropoff situation but you got to kill a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.779 
dropoff situation but you got to kill a

bunch of people in the mix and you know

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.700 
bunch of people in the mix and you know
I<00:00:54.000> found<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> way<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.899> much<00:00:55.079> faster<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
I found a way to do it much faster and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.290 
I found a way to do it much faster and
more<00:00:55.800> efficiently<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.270> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.029 
more efficiently so what you do is
you'll<00:00:57.660> spawn<00:00:57.930> annual<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:58.890> give

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you'll spawn annual I think they give

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.740 
you'll spawn annual I think they give
you<00:00:59.100> an<00:00:59.190> Uzi<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.579> something<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.510> give<00:01:00.660> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750

you an Uzi or something they give you
some<00:01:00.930> random<00:01:01.260> gun<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:02.399> wants<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> do

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
some random gun and then wants you to do

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
and then once he comes it'll take like I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.310 
and then once he comes it'll take like I
don't<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.180> five<00:01:48.450> ten<00:01:48.479> seconds<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.229> you'll

van<00:02:25.640> back<00:02:26.090> up<00:02:26.270> quickly<00:02:26.600> go<00:02:26.900> down<00:02:27.110> into<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
van back up quickly go down into the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.810 
van back up quickly go down into the
little<00:02:27.650> ravine<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.100> then<00:02:28.220> come<00:02:28.370> back<00:02:28.400> up<00:02:28.550> and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
little ravine and then come back up and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.400 
little ravine and then come back up and
then<00:02:29.300> drive<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.780> objective<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.290> that's

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
then drive to the objective and that's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.600 
then drive to the objective and that's
pretty<00:02:30.560> much<00:02:30.680> all<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.010> have<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.160> do<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.430> drive

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
pretty much all you have to do the drive

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.880 
pretty much all you have to do the drive
is<00:02:31.790> kind<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.120> long<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:32.660> if<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.440> can<00:02:33.560> like<00:02:33.710> make

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
is kind of long so if you can like make

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.770 
is kind of long so if you can like make
it<00:02:34.040> more<00:02:34.130> efficient<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.730> don't<00:02:35.120> drive<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.630> this

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
it more efficient I don't drive it this

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.820 
it more efficient I don't drive it this
is<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.960> first<00:02:36.140> time<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.320> did<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.530> what<00:02:36.710> you're

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
is the first time I did it what you're

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.990 
is the first time I did it what you're
seeing<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:37.040> screen<00:02:37.100> here<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:37.550> my<00:02:37.670> driving

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
seeing on screen here so my driving

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.420 
seeing on screen here so my driving
isn't<00:02:38.240> as<00:02:38.510> efficient<00:02:38.960> as<00:02:38.990> possible<00:02:39.080> but<00:02:39.560> after

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
isn't as efficient as possible but after

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.890 
isn't as efficient as possible but after
I<00:02:40.460> did<00:02:40.640> after<00:02:40.820> we<00:02:41.000> did<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.210> for<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.360> long<00:02:41.570> time<00:02:41.870> I

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
I did after we did it for a long time I

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.200 
I did after we did it for a long time I
did<00:02:42.230> get<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:42.950> going<00:02:43.340> really<00:02:43.610> fast<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.150> it

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
did get it like going really fast and it

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.230 
did get it like going really fast and it
takes<00:02:44.420> me<00:02:44.660> alone<00:02:45.140> around<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:46.220> think<00:02:46.880> three

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
takes me alone around I think three

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.940 
takes me alone around I think three
minutes<00:02:47.600> are<00:02:47.720> two<00:02:47.930> minutes<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.380> do<00:02:48.530> this<00:02:48.680> so

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
minutes are two minutes to do this so

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.620 
minutes are two minutes to do this so
it's<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.670> really<00:02:49.880> fast<00:02:50.210> mission<00:02:50.570> I

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
it's it's a really fast mission I

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.940 
it's it's a really fast mission I
definitely<00:02:50.870> suggest<00:02:51.080> going<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> try<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.740> out

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
definitely suggest going to try this out

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.620 
definitely suggest going to try this out
and<00:02:52.010> once<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.310> get<00:02:52.430> here<00:02:52.580> all<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.910> do<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.390> you

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
and once you get here all you do is you

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.750 
and once you get here all you do is you
drive<00:02:53.870> right<00:02:54.170> into<00:02:54.320> this<00:02:54.590> little<00:02:54.800> shed<00:02:55.460> thing

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
drive right into this little shed thing

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.640 
drive right into this little shed thing
or<00:02:55.910> it's<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.090> garage<00:02:56.240> thing<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.930> then<00:02:57.440> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
or it's a garage thing and then the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.600 
or it's a garage thing and then the
mission<00:02:57.860> will<00:02:57.920> stop<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:58.340> guy<00:02:58.460> will<00:02:58.580> come

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
mission will stop this guy will come

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.650 
mission will stop this guy will come
running<00:02:58.790> out<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.120> house<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.570> then

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
running out of the house and then

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.390 
running out of the house and then
eventually<00:02:59.900> it'll<00:03:00.350> just<00:03:00.620> pause<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.190> game<00:03:01.220> and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
eventually it'll just pause the game and

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.360 
eventually it'll just pause the game and
say<00:03:02.120> blah<00:03:02.480> blah<00:03:02.780> you've<00:03:03.290> gotten<00:03:03.770> I<00:03:04.010> think<00:03:04.280> it's

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
thousand RP which is really really good

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.130 
thousand RP which is really really good
