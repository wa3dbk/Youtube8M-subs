00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
lot of fun they've allowed me to really

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110 
lot of fun they've allowed me to really
have<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> lot<00:00:37.080> of<00:00:37.290> lateral<00:00:37.800> agility<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.940> I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
have a lot of lateral agility which I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.660 
have a lot of lateral agility which I
haven't<00:00:39.809> had<00:00:39.930> much<00:00:40.290> before<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.489> other

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
haven't had much before with with other

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.600 
haven't had much before with with other
feet<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.570> rotation<00:00:43.110> allows<00:00:43.410> me<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.920> plant<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
feet the rotation allows me to plant and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.180 
feet the rotation allows me to plant and
move<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.059> ways<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.420> haven't<00:00:45.600> done<00:00:45.809> before

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
move in ways that I haven't done before

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.740 
move in ways that I haven't done before
especially<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:48.000> down<00:00:48.180> hills<00:00:48.480> I've

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
especially going like down hills I've

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.910 
especially going like down hills I've
always<00:00:48.960> had<00:00:49.079> trouble<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.620> downhill

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
always had trouble going downhill

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.709 
always had trouble going downhill
because<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.460> feel<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
because I feel like I have to kind of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.459 
because I feel like I have to kind of
fall<00:00:51.960> forward<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.280> foot<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
fall forward but with this foot the

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.470 
fall forward but with this foot the
rotation<00:00:55.610> compensates<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> movement

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
rotation compensates for the movement

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.819 
rotation compensates for the movement
downhill<00:01:00.230> like<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.320> remember<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> had<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
downhill like I remember I had a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.860 
downhill like I remember I had a
classmate<00:01:02.070> from<00:01:02.340> high<00:01:02.699> school<00:01:03.030> who<00:01:03.270> came<00:01:03.750> here

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
classmate from high school who came here

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
classmate from high school who came here
in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.050> first<00:01:04.229> year<00:01:04.470> when<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
in the first year when I was here and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.460 
in the first year when I was here and
other<00:01:05.850> people<00:01:06.119> would<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.240> surprised<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.229> kind

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
other people would be surprised and kind

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960 
other people would be surprised and kind
of<00:01:07.590> shocked<00:01:07.860> by<00:01:08.009> what<00:01:08.190> I<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.399> doing<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.789> she

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
of shocked by what I was doing and she

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.180 
of shocked by what I was doing and she
would<00:01:09.119> she<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:09.990> legitimately<00:01:10.560> confused

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
would she it was legitimately confused

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.859 
would she it was legitimately confused
because<00:01:11.610> she<00:01:11.789> didn't<00:01:12.000> understand<00:01:12.450> why<00:01:12.600> anyone

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
because she didn't understand why anyone

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
because she didn't understand why anyone
would<00:01:13.140> think<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> wouldn't<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.310> able<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
would think that I wouldn't be able to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
would think that I wouldn't be able to
do<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.650> never

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
do it and it's just and it has never

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.620 
do it and it's just and it has never
really<00:01:17.100> occurred<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.490> me<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.360> point

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
really occurred to me and at this point

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
really occurred to me and at this point
I've<00:01:18.930> been<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> amputee<00:01:19.890> long<00:01:20.130> enough

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
I've been in the amputee long enough

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730 
I've been in the amputee long enough
that<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.119> don't<00:01:21.900> even<00:01:22.020> really<00:01:22.229> notice<00:01:22.590> when

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that I don't even really notice when

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.350 
that I don't even really notice when
people<00:01:22.979> look<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.299> know

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
people look because it's you know

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.469 
people look because it's you know
they'll<00:01:24.600> look<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> look<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.009> my<00:01:26.100> legs<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
they'll look at a look at my legs so you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.730 
they'll look at a look at my legs so you
know<00:01:27.600> they'll<00:01:27.780> kind<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> look<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> second

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
know they'll kind of look for a second

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.219 
know they'll kind of look for a second
and<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> all<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.840> doesn't<00:01:31.140> really

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and you know it all it doesn't really

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
and you know it all it doesn't really
bother<00:01:31.439> me<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.009> know<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:33.000> know

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
bother me because I know what you know

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.730 
bother me because I know what you know
whatever<00:01:33.330> they<00:01:33.630> may<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.840> thinking<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.560> can

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
whatever they may be thinking I can

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.950 
whatever they may be thinking I can
exceed<00:01:35.009> their<00:01:35.159> expectations<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
exceed their expectations and the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
exceed their expectations and the
prosthetics<00:01:37.470> I've<00:01:37.619> had<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.220> always<00:01:38.490> allowed

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
prosthetics I've had have always allowed

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.810 
prosthetics I've had have always allowed
me<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:41.070> my<00:01:41.430> attitude<00:01:41.579> has

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
me to do that and is my attitude has

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.190 
me to do that and is my attitude has
always<00:01:42.000> been<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.390> nothing's<00:01:42.720> gonna<00:01:42.810> slow<00:01:43.049> me

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
always been that nothing's gonna slow me

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620 
always been that nothing's gonna slow me
down<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.680> if<00:01:44.340> honestly<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.090> only<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> best
