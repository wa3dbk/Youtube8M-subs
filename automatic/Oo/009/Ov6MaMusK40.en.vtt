00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.190
 advise you photoshop but here you go 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.410

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.899
 difficult but photofilter it is very 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.369
 easy here it is enough to understand 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:25.300

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:16.380
 almost but good and the blurs have when 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.250
 even so, and the fools not good I 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.120
 not going to continue so second step 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.360

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.310
 right click 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.230
 you do when you have filling 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.739
 opacity is not very important 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.299
 makes you ok so for your video if 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:00.540
 you want a contour was waiting he's going 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:07.680
 well sized for your video if 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.870
 you want an outline here let's go 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.819
 it's not a trick but will follow 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.940
 this video tutorial 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.380
 here you enlarge a little if you 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.380
 want to make an outline 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:30.110
 compound filling you make 37% 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:34.560
 that's almost almost it's almost 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.980
 that's it, I 'm not going to outline 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.780
 so here is second step here 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.430
 it is 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.790
 the rectangle where you will put your 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.060
 video also second step the boxes or 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.940
 where to put the pokemon if you want 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.670
 you can do you can put the 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.630
 photos that means your pokemon is not fighting 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.819
 your pokemon there photos of your pokemon 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.640
 either in care boxes in a 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.489
 pokéball me I use a pokéball by 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.890
 example like that I do not know me I 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.959
 Sincerely, I'm doing boxes 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.519
 as you I saw in the mail and 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.130
 play here you are case I 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.320
 make kasbah according to you 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.060
 according to your tastes so I made a 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.980
 little box is not very important 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:29.850
 it's just a demonstration so the 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.630
 pokemon that I'm going to put that will be to 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.860
 leagues the lite 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:40.889
 this is his end honig laly too 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.110
 resize the layer good it is very 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.810
 small because I did a little 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.330
 box but hey you can do some 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.370
 little boxes like you can do from 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.979
 very big boxes or average theses 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.860
 and this is hated by Libya 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.250
 it's big compared to good break 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.050
 short 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.560
 and so on you continue to do 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.539
 the other boxes the same way 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:12.000
 until it's six boxes really 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:14.789
 align then this is the next step 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.220
 the omega or sapphire pokemon logo 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:21.510
 alpha can download it from google 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.840
 of course that's me I reviewed omega so 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.940

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.360

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.250
