00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.389 
the direction you wanted to print so for
example<00:01:50.250> let's<00:01:50.970> print<00:01:51.960> hours<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.950> they'll

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
example let's print hours here they'll

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.760 
example let's print hours here they'll
be<00:01:53.520> facing<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.970> direction<00:01:54.439> right<00:01:55.439> click<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
be facing that direction right click on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.590 
be facing that direction right click on
it<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.670> go<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.149> want<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.479> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
it and you go do what you want with it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.520 
it and you go do what you want with it
so

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.289 

and<00:02:02.020> print<00:02:03.280> there<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.400> are<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:04.790> is<00:02:04.909> made<00:02:05.090> that

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
and print there we are so is made that

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.149 
and print there we are so is made that
now<00:02:05.810> with<00:02:05.869> vesa<00:02:06.350> comes<00:02:06.619> with<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.830> bunch<00:02:07.070> of

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
now with vesa comes with a bunch of

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.600 
now with vesa comes with a bunch of
options<00:02:07.340> like<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:09.560> can<00:02:09.860> change<00:02:10.280> for<00:02:10.459> brush

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
options like you can change for brush

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.090 
options like you can change for brush
size<00:02:10.850> like<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.390> see<00:02:11.600> me<00:02:11.750> do<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.410> can<00:02:12.680> create

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
size like you see me do you can create

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.710 
size like you see me do you can create
layers<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:13.880> we've<00:02:14.209> got<00:02:14.360> blue<00:02:14.569> in<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
layers so we've got blue in the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.460 
layers so we've got blue in the
background<00:02:15.080> now<00:02:15.200> let's<00:02:15.380> add<00:02:15.530> some<00:02:15.560> green<00:02:17.470> so

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
background now let's add some green so

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.420 
background now let's add some green so
you<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:18.680> crew<00:02:19.130> can<00:02:19.670> create<00:02:20.239> like<00:02:20.420> layers<00:02:20.720> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
you can crew can create like layers and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.010 
you can crew can create like layers and
you<00:02:22.430> can<00:02:22.550> continue<00:02:22.700> with<00:02:23.090> loads<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.900> different

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
you can continue with loads of different

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:33.759 
you can continue with loads of different
layers<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:29.770> print<00:02:31.510> value<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.600> like<00:02:33.080> adding<00:02:33.530> on

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
layers so print value is like adding on

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.800 
layers so print value is like adding on
layers<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.820> cannot<00:02:35.060> even<00:02:35.239> more<00:02:35.570> layers

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
layers and you cannot even more layers

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.770 
layers and you cannot even more layers
it's<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:36.350> ongoing<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:38.209> we<00:02:38.360> can<00:02:38.510> add<00:02:38.630> some

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
it's just ongoing so we can add some

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.070 
it's just ongoing so we can add some
blue<00:02:39.140> now<00:02:39.380> or<00:02:41.200> add<00:02:42.200> some<00:02:42.410> rad<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.900> get<00:02:45.050> a

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
blue now or add some rad so you get a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.140 
blue now or add some rad so you get a
general<00:02:45.410> idea<00:02:46.569> so<00:02:47.569> you<00:02:47.630> can<00:02:48.010> print<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.160> they

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
general idea so you can print that they

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.759 
general idea so you can print that they
are<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.690> can<00:02:50.930> just<00:02:50.959> create<00:02:51.319> loads<00:02:51.650> of

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
are so you can just create loads of

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.530 
are so you can just create loads of
layers<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.310> it's<00:02:52.489> creating<00:02:52.970> them<00:02:53.060> like<00:02:53.239> so

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
layers and it's creating them like so

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.350 
layers and it's creating them like so
and<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:54.680> can<00:02:54.830> do<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.040> bunch<00:02:55.400> stuff<00:02:55.550> with<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.209> as

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and you can do a bunch stuff with it as

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.809 
and you can do a bunch stuff with it as
well<00:02:56.630> such<00:02:57.019> as<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:57.350> can<00:02:57.530> copy<00:02:58.250> stuff<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.760> you

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
well such as you can copy stuff and you

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.000 
well such as you can copy stuff and you
can<00:02:59.000> paste<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.450> in<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.930> another<00:03:00.170> printing

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
can paste it in to another printing

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.430 
can paste it in to another printing
block<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.430> can<00:03:01.580> undo<00:03:01.940> what<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.239> lasted<00:03:02.690> redo

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
block you can undo what you lasted redo

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.800 
block you can undo what you lasted redo
watch<00:03:03.709> your<00:03:04.040> own<00:03:04.340> did<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.510> can<00:03:05.660> get<00:03:05.780> a

watch your own did you can get a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.600 
watch your own did you can get a
