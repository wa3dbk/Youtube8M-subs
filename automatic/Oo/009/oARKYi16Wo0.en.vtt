00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.470
 yes it is the biggest smartphone in the world 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.660
 with the samsung galaxy note 8 you can 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.800
 actually make phone calls as you like 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.679
 So also without 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.809
 handsfree and bluetooth altogether 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.730
 normal as you are used to and you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.340
 recognizes here already on the size 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.500
 despite 8 you should be able to reasonably 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.090
 still hold in your hand so is the handle 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.230
 So it is now somewhat but 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.660
 possible with one hand 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.880
 keep and serve with the others 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.130
 Of course, it is not a smartphone entirely 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.399
 sure but a tablet but it is called yes 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.860
 always in galaxy note 8.0 and from the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.270
 others go on the 1 and the 2 ago 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 the we all know these are some 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.180
 smartphones so devices on the go too 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.920
 to phone 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.420
 That's why I allowed myself now 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.980
 this comparison and above all things 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.649
 as I said it is technically and technically 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.329
 that was the big question the others 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.760
 specifications were indeed in advance 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.780
 actually already mostly known it 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.110
 is the in-house 8 core 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.450
 processor thus four cores 1.6 gigahertz 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.040
 are the clocked and what the internal 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.689
 Memory affects so there are three 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.130
 different versions like that too 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.990
 knows 16 32 and 64 gigabytes while still 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.790
 not quite clear which is one of them 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.270
 in germany then come on the market 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.890
 become 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.170
 then we have to wait and see what the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.750
 then provider then there 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.970
 looking out and prizes are natural 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.619
 also not yet learned 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.140
 otherwise that's meanwhile 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.720
 known at samsung's internal 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.579
 RAM with almost 2 GB with it 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.520
 twice as much as usual 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.409
 and from the screen as I said 8 should 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.270
 we have to deal with here 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.360
 in the resolution has now been here unfortunately 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.350
 it is not called but I have 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.020
 for here a front camera with 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.430
 I have 1.3 megapixels on the back 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.610
 a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.119
 the operating system is Android 4.1 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.009
 point 2 of the battery is firmly installed the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.070
 means here I can not open anything 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.409
 the still with the galaxy s3 for example 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.090
 that's why the sim card comes up here 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.239
 in and over here 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.450
 usd card also at least 64 gigabytes 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.220
 therefore you are capable of that 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.220
 memory space concerns on the safe 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.260
 side and it is very pleasantly stable 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.390
 I have to say if she knows you from 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.989
 the galaxy devices meanwhile that is 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.569
 nothing new 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.099
 new, however, is this little thing here 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.069
 this is a 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.739
 infrared interface yes no joke 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.420
 after htc that comes when now 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.030
 this tablet and it's natural 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.220
 As you know, yes, tablets are very much 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.810
 then used at home on the sofa then 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.489
 Of course, I 'm sitting practically saying 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.680
 on the sofa and can over the 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.220
 infrared control my tv 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.310
 my stereo etc as a remote control 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.180
 that's it over here remotely 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.430
 a fine story 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.420
 everything else is actually known 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.190
 functions 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.620
 that means I have, of course, again 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.930
 for example, this aspen 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.590
 you can do it this way in the yard 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.140
 recognize 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.579
 that means I do not touch the display 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.099
 Nevertheless, you will be in the preview 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.639
 what's behind each one 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.260
 appointment is hidden for note 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.139
 owner of course an old hat 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.269
 as well as these splitscreen stories 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.060
 that one out here for example now 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.489
 this side bar something out 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.040
 pull and thereby a one 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.930
 display division reached but i can 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.599
 of course, such a video I here 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.900
 run over this little icon here 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.560
 top right to such a miniature picture 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.150
 to form 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.880
 but I also think of the size 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.549
 lets me adapt and that I go everywhere 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.079
 so I can place it while 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.609
 I'm here on one side or 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.269
 maybe better up there like that 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.310
 watch video 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.440
 down here can edit my appointment 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.940
 And you can continue to do everything 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.799
 together at a glance 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.700
 Of course that works and as I said 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.680
 about this it about this this tool 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.239
 I can then use this edge bar here 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.840
 Other applications are not 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.269
 clean up and combine as needed 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.810
 the nothing else new that that since 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.359
 concerns 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.910
 it is already known in the usa 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.709
 be available in april when 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.900
 germany comes to samsung 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.300
 still a bit cloudy q2 so 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.860
 second quarter at some point prices were 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.440
 not mentioned yet and as I said 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.419
 which models of the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.490
 storage space is not yet 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.330
 known as it should have been times 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.330
 I still give it a bit 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.330
 phoning with the galaxy note 8
