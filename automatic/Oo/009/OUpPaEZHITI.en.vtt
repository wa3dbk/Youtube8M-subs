will<00:02:21.510> change<00:02:21.920> according<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.950> Moore's<00:02:23.400> law<00:02:23.670> it

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
will change according to Moore's law it

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.370 
will change according to Moore's law it
gets<00:02:24.209> better<00:02:24.660> every<00:02:24.870> day<00:02:25.560> it's
