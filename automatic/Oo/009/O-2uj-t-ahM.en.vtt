technique<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.510> nice<00:02:16.020> because<00:02:16.530> your

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
technique is really nice because your

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.490 
technique is really nice because your
body<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.370> generating<00:02:17.670> college

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
body is generating college

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.460 
body is generating college
and<00:02:18.740> it's<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.760> more<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.180> natural<00:02:20.470> tapered

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
and it's a more of a natural tapered

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.680 
and it's a more of a natural tapered
look<00:02:21.680> compared<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.610> fillers<00:02:23.030> sometimes

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
look compared to fillers sometimes

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.180 
look compared to fillers sometimes
because<00:02:23.960> fillers<00:02:24.290> can<00:02:24.380> sometimes<00:02:24.950> look<00:02:25.070> a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
because fillers can sometimes look a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.910 
because fillers can sometimes look a
little<00:02:25.430> bit<00:02:25.550> bumpy<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.750> using<00:02:27.410> your<00:02:27.770> own

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
little bit bumpy and using your own

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.460 
little bit bumpy and using your own
blood<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.460> kind<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:28.850> goes<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.390> very<00:02:29.570> smooth<00:02:30.170> and

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
blood it kind of goes in very smooth and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.920 
blood it kind of goes in very smooth and
it<00:02:31.040> generates<00:02:31.580> collagen<00:02:32.090> over<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.360> course<00:02:32.600> of

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
it generates collagen over the course of

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.380 
it generates collagen over the course of
several<00:02:33.290> weeks<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.830> months<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:35.000> that's<00:02:35.210> really

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
several weeks to months so that's really

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.800 
several weeks to months so that's really
nice<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.530> keeps<00:02:36.770> on<00:02:36.920> improving<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.810> Vampire

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
nice and it keeps on improving a Vampire

fill or region lab then the material
that<00:04:09.380> we're<00:04:09.500> using<00:04:09.769> acts<00:04:10.190> like<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.760> filler<00:04:11.150> as

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
that we're using acts like a filler as

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.410 
that we're using acts like a filler as
opposed<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.350> platelet-rich<00:04:12.830> plasma<00:04:13.150> which<00:04:14.150> is

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
opposed to platelet-rich plasma which is

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.840 
opposed to platelet-rich plasma which is
very<00:04:14.690> effective<00:04:15.200> but<00:04:15.380> it's<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.650> liquid<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.340> so

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
very effective but it's a liquid and so

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.789 
very effective but it's a liquid and so
if<00:04:16.910> we<00:04:17.030> wanted<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.359> add<00:04:17.540> volume<00:04:18.169> in<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.380> places

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
if we wanted to add volume in the places

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.530 
if we wanted to add volume in the places
that<00:04:18.830> need<00:04:19.130> volume<00:04:19.640> it's<00:04:19.880> better<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.390> use

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
that need volume it's better to use

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.320 
that need volume it's better to use
something<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:21.019> has<00:04:21.370> substance<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.640> it<00:04:22.760> like

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
something that has substance to it like

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.390 
something that has substance to it like
a<00:04:23.360> typical<00:04:23.690> filler<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.770> takes<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:25.040> couple<00:04:25.340> of

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
a typical filler it takes a couple of

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.010 
a typical filler it takes a couple of
days<00:04:25.550> for<00:04:25.820> the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
days for the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.080 
days for the
is<00:04:27.259> to<00:04:27.379> continue<00:04:27.949> but<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:28.550> get<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:28.819> immediate

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
is to continue but you get the immediate

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.200 
is to continue but you get the immediate
gratification<00:04:29.419> of<00:04:30.289> having<00:04:31.220> some<00:04:31.550> volume<00:04:32.030> and

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
gratification of having some volume and

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.330 
gratification of having some volume and
so<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:33.110> you<00:04:33.259> can<00:04:33.379> go<00:04:33.470> on<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.800> dinner<00:04:33.979> tonight

which I am very excited about but as far

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.159 
which I am very excited about but as far
as<00:04:54.590> not<00:04:54.949> having<00:04:55.129> any<00:04:55.340> downtime<00:04:55.849> not<00:04:56.840> missing

as not having any downtime not missing
any<00:04:57.289> work<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:57.919> be<00:04:58.009> able<00:04:58.129> to<00:04:58.340> be<00:04:58.490> camera-ready

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
for any kind of event I need to go to I

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.490 
for any kind of event I need to go to I
think<00:05:01.940> this<00:05:02.060> is<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.300> right<00:05:02.449> decision<00:05:02.930> for<00:05:03.349> me

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
think this is the right decision for me

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.149 
think this is the right decision for me
I<00:05:07.509> think<00:05:08.509> we<00:05:08.659> can<00:05:08.810> benefit<00:05:09.470> from<00:05:09.530> adding<00:05:10.099> a

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
I think we can benefit from adding a

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.029 
I think we can benefit from adding a
little<00:05:10.460> bit<00:05:10.610> here<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.330> make<00:05:12.050> this<00:05:12.319> area<00:05:12.650> look<00:05:12.830> a

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
little bit here to make this area look a

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.270 
little bit here to make this area look a
little<00:05:13.340> bit<00:05:13.490> younger

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.450

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
so again the Vampire Facelift is a

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.320 
so again the Vampire Facelift is a
designer<00:05:43.650> procedure<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.610> was<00:05:44.700> created<00:05:45.180> by

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
designer procedure that was created by

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.890 
designer procedure that was created by
dr.<00:05:45.390> Runnels<00:05:46.110> so<00:05:46.800> that<00:05:47.040> we<00:05:47.220> can<00:05:47.430> combine<00:05:47.730> in<00:05:48.300> a

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
dr. Runnels so that we can combine in a

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.540 
dr. Runnels so that we can combine in a
very<00:05:49.320> specific<00:05:49.740> way

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
very specific way

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.820 
very specific way

particular<00:05:56.520> goal<00:05:57.000> in<00:05:57.300> mind<00:05:57.570> is<00:05:57.810> to<00:05:58.140> restore
