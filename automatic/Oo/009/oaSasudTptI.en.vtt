00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
mine it and you want to make like a

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.270 
mine it and you want to make like a
circle<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:15.290> with<00:01:16.290> one<00:01:16.590> block<00:01:16.830> missing

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
circle but with one block missing

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.440 
circle but with one block missing
because<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.820> where<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.229> stone<00:01:19.530> will

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
because this is where the stone will

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.630 
because this is where the stone will
will<00:01:21.450> break<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> also<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.979> stone<00:01:23.310> will<00:01:23.490> be

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
will break this also the stone will be

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.810 
will break this also the stone will be
in<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> make<00:01:26.759> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in this bit here and you want to make a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.080 
in this bit here and you want to make a
sign<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> stop<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> water<00:01:28.470> from

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
sign here to stop the water from

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.609 
sign here to stop the water from
escaping<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.780> place<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.110> right<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.890> so

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
escaping and you place it right there so

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.100 
escaping and you place it right there so

small kind of like yeah the arrows so at

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.320 
small kind of like yeah the arrows so at
the<00:02:22.740> top<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.520> want<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:23.970> place

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
the top of this you want to just place

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.480 
the top of this you want to just place
one<00:02:24.690> lover<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.910> there<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.030> go<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.220> if<00:02:29.370> you

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
want you can cover that out with

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.470 
want you can cover that out with
anything<00:02:34.340> ok<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:36.239> i<00:02:37.250> guess<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.640> main<00:02:38.820> idea<00:02:39.270> is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
anything ok so i guess the main idea is

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.140 
anything ok so i guess the main idea is
the<00:02:39.870> love<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.620> souls<00:02:40.890> falling<00:02:41.459> down<00:02:41.670> onto

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
the love of souls falling down onto

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.560 
the love of souls falling down onto
running<00:02:42.510> water<00:02:43.790> ok<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.260> do<00:02:46.620> that

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
running water ok so if I just do that

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.720 
running water ok so if I just do that
let's<00:02:48.570> say<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.840> feel<00:02:49.640> like<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:52.190> if<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.400> place

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
let's say I feel like this if I place

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.300 
let's say I feel like this if I place
lava<00:02:54.060> here<00:02:54.570> but<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.650> should<00:02:57.770> see<00:02:58.770> it<00:02:58.950> makes

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
lava here but it should see it makes

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.750 
lava here but it should see it makes
this<00:03:01.280> makes<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.519> rooster<00:03:03.239> caws<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.760> lago

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
this makes this rooster caws it lago

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.160 
this makes this rooster caws it lago
falling<00:03:06.480> down<00:03:06.930> onto<00:03:07.560> moving<00:03:08.549> water<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:10.019> that's

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
falling down onto moving water so that's

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:28.470 
falling down onto moving water so that's
the<00:03:10.739> concept<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.580> it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.300 

yeah<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:32.570> purpose<00:03:33.020> of<00:03:33.260> making<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.890> smooth

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
yeah the purpose of making it smooth

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.020 
yeah the purpose of making it smooth
down<00:03:35.260> because<00:03:36.260> smooth<00:03:36.620> stone<00:03:36.950> gets<00:03:37.670> mind

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
down because smooth stone gets mind

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.270 
down because smooth stone gets mind
Fausta<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:41.840> should<00:03:42.110> be<00:03:42.140> quicker<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.830> mine

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
Fausta so it should be quicker to mine

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:52.930 
Fausta so it should be quicker to mine
then<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.390> couple<00:03:44.810> storm<00:03:45.230> generators<00:03:51.940> don't

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
then a couple storm generators don't

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.610 
then a couple storm generators don't
like<00:03:53.180> oh<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:55.940> guess<00:03:56.810> I'll<00:03:57.020> just<00:03:57.050> get<00:03:57.350> rid<00:03:57.530> of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
like oh I guess I'll just get rid of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.450 
like oh I guess I'll just get rid of
this<00:03:57.800> world<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.560> yeah<00:04:02.380> it's<00:04:03.380> pretty<00:04:03.530> compact<00:04:04.160> I

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
this world so yeah it's pretty compact I

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.030 
this world so yeah it's pretty compact I
think<00:04:04.790> more<00:04:05.270> compact<00:04:05.810> than<00:04:06.020> the<00:04:06.410> cobblestone

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
think more compact than the cobblestone

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.890 
think more compact than the cobblestone
generator<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:09.280> easy<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.610> make<00:04:10.820> I<00:04:13.690> guess<00:04:14.690> if

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
generator and easy to make I guess if

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.360 
generator and easy to make I guess if
you<00:04:15.050> wanted<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:15.910> could<00:04:16.910> put<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.540> piston<00:04:18.170> now

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.680 

thinking<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.460> that<00:04:22.670> will<00:04:22.880> work<00:04:23.090> i<00:04:23.450> should<00:04:23.840> walk

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:36.239 

okay<00:04:30.610> whoops

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:36.249 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:50.299 

get<00:04:36.999> a<00:04:37.029> piston<00:04:40.259> somewhat<00:04:41.259> leaves<00:04:44.159> okay<00:04:45.159> so

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:50.309 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:55.759 

there's<00:04:51.309> no<00:04:51.549> reason<00:04:51.999> why<00:04:52.149> I<00:04:52.179> shouldn't<00:04:52.539> walk

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:55.769 

00:04:55.769 --> 00:05:11.679 

okay

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:11.689 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:37.149 

let's<00:05:12.229> get<00:05:12.469> a<00:05:12.529> button<00:05:15.939> leave<00:05:16.939> oh<00:05:20.860> ok<00:05:35.949> well<00:05:36.949> yeah

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:47.399 
let's get a button leave oh ok well yeah
the<00:05:37.399> sign<00:05:37.699> is<00:05:38.029> in<00:05:38.239> front<00:05:44.829> yeah<00:05:45.829> okay<00:05:46.819> so

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
the sign is in front yeah okay so

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.499 
the sign is in front yeah okay so
putting<00:05:48.409> Pistons<00:05:49.039> doesn't<00:05:49.759> work<00:05:49.969> because<00:05:50.119> the

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
putting Pistons doesn't work because the

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.279 
putting Pistons doesn't work because the
sign<00:05:50.839> has<00:05:51.079> to<00:05:51.110> be<00:05:51.379> in<00:05:51.469> front<00:05:52.479> so<00:05:53.479> yeah<00:05:53.869> that's

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289
