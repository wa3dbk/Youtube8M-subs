just like that then from here I'm gonna
curve<00:00:15.009> in<00:00:15.160> two<00:00:15.490> lines<00:00:15.820> to<00:00:16.750> a<00:00:16.780> point<00:00:17.110> in<00:00:17.289> the

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
curve in two lines to a point in the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.070 
curve in two lines to a point in the
middle<00:00:17.619> just<00:00:17.980> below<00:00:18.280> that<00:00:18.460> straight<00:00:18.790> line

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
middle just below that straight line

the<00:01:56.109> top<00:01:56.140> here<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:57.429> a<00:01:57.549> curve<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.969> line<00:01:58.149> that

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
the top here and a curve a line that

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.700 
the top here and a curve a line that
comes<00:01:58.509> down<00:01:58.810> or<00:01:59.020> on<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.229> side<00:01:59.409> of<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.560> head

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
comes down or on the side of the head

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.969 
comes down or on the side of the head
and<00:01:59.950> swoops<00:02:00.579> out<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.020> then<00:02:02.109> I'll<00:02:02.229> do<00:02:02.499> the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
and swoops out and then I'll do the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.310 
and swoops out and then I'll do the
exact<00:02:03.310> same<00:02:03.549> thing<00:02:03.789> on<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.210> right<00:02:04.689> side<00:02:04.990> here

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
exact same thing on the right side here

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.679 
exact same thing on the right side here
making<00:02:05.530> sure<00:02:06.460> that<00:02:06.850> it's<00:02:06.999> roughly<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.509> same

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
making sure that it's roughly the same

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.589 
making sure that it's roughly the same
size<00:02:08.340> if<00:02:09.340> you're<00:02:09.520> here<00:02:09.729> I'm<00:02:09.880> gonna<00:02:10.000> curve<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:10.509> a

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
size if you're here I'm gonna curve in a

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.950 
size if you're here I'm gonna curve in a
line<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.260> that

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
line like that

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.080 
line like that
and<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.350> same<00:02:13.590> thing<00:02:13.800> for<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.070> side<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.910> I'm

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and the same thing for this side and I'm

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.930 
and the same thing for this side and I'm
just<00:02:15.150> gonna<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> series<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:15.960> overlaps<00:02:16.500> I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
just gonna do a series of overlaps I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.550 
just gonna do a series of overlaps I
come<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.300> looks<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.750> little<00:02:19.290> hairs

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
come in so it looks like little hairs

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.770 
come in so it looks like little hairs
now<00:02:20.310> I'll<00:02:20.460> do<00:02:20.580> one<00:02:20.730> final<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.510> I'm<00:02:21.690> gonna

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
now I'll do one final one and I'm gonna

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.040 
now I'll do one final one and I'm gonna
leave<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> gap<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.980> middle<00:02:23.160> here<00:02:23.930> come<00:02:24.930> in

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
leave a gap in the middle here come in

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.810 
leave a gap in the middle here come in
just<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.320> that

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
just like that

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.610 
just like that
up<00:02:26.820> here<00:02:27.150> let's<00:02:27.390> draw<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.630> little<00:02:27.900> bow<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.530> I'm

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
up here let's draw a little bow so I'm

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.830 
up here let's draw a little bow so I'm
gonna<00:02:28.740> draw<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> half<00:02:29.310> circle<00:02:29.340> or<00:02:30.180> semicircle

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
gonna draw a half circle or semicircle

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.890 
gonna draw a half circle or semicircle
the<00:02:31.320> top<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> middle<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:33.180> I'll<00:02:33.360> clear<00:02:33.720> out

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
the top in the middle and I'll clear out

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.580 
the top in the middle and I'll clear out
a<00:02:34.200> curve<00:02:34.770> like<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.520> one<00:02:35.700> side<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.590> this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
a curve like this on one side and this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.770 
a curve like this on one side and this
on<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> other<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.670> bow<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.270> then<00:02:39.570> just

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
on the other for the bow and then just

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.210 
on the other for the bow and then just
in<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.990> center<00:02:40.320> I'm<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:40.710> gonna<00:02:40.800> draw<00:02:40.950> two

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
in the center I'm just gonna draw two

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.060 
in the center I'm just gonna draw two
curved<00:02:41.520> lines<00:02:41.790> out<00:02:42.290> let's<00:02:43.290> draw<00:02:43.440> some<00:02:43.620> ears<00:02:43.860> in

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
curved lines out let's draw some ears in

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.700 
curved lines out let's draw some ears in
so<00:02:44.280> here<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:45.390> beside<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.720> boat<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:46.500> draw<00:02:46.680> a

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
so here just beside the boat we draw a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.730 
so here just beside the boat we draw a
curve<00:02:47.010> out<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.720> I'll<00:02:48.840> curve<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.230> back<00:02:49.470> in

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
curve out and I'll curve that back in

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.760 
curve out and I'll curve that back in
with<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.100> sharp<00:02:50.370> point<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.050> will<00:02:52.140> draw<00:02:52.410> in

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
with a sharp point and it will draw in

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.670 
with a sharp point and it will draw in
the<00:02:53.160> exact<00:02:53.430> same<00:02:53.640> shape<00:02:53.910> inside<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:54.990> year

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
the exact same shape inside of that year

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.620 
the exact same shape inside of that year
let's<00:02:56.580> do<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.790> same<00:02:57.000> thing<00:02:57.210> on<00:02:57.270> this<00:02:57.450> side

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
let's do the same thing on this side

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.320 
let's do the same thing on this side
here<00:02:57.990> making<00:02:58.170> sure<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.820> they're<00:03:00.000> roughly

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
here making sure that they're roughly

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.990 
here making sure that they're roughly
about<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.660> same<00:03:00.840> size<00:03:01.460> on<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.550> left<00:03:02.760> on<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
about the same size on the left on the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.560 
about the same size on the left on the
right<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:05.040> there's<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.340> head

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
right just like that so there's the head

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.750 
right just like that so there's the head
let's<00:03:06.570> get<00:03:06.780> into<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.050> body<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.560> here<00:03:08.490> I'm<00:03:08.700> just

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
let's get into the body so here I'm just

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.750 
let's get into the body so here I'm just
going<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.090> go<00:03:09.240> just<00:03:09.900> left<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.620> point<00:03:11.100> in

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
going to go just left of this point in

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.370 
going to go just left of this point in
chalk<00:03:12.060> herb<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:12.660> there's<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.900> little<00:03:13.140> bit<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.290> an

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
chalk herb so there's a little bit of an

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.590 
chalk herb so there's a little bit of an
overlap<00:03:13.680> here<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.820> then<00:03:14.940> I'll<00:03:15.030> draw<00:03:15.300> another

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
overlap here and then I'll draw another

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.900 
overlap here and then I'll draw another
line<00:03:15.990> just<00:03:16.380> picking<00:03:16.770> that<00:03:16.860> up<00:03:16.920> for<00:03:17.430> her<00:03:17.640> color

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
line just picking that up for her color

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.870 
line just picking that up for her color
and<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:19.470> can<00:03:19.650> put<00:03:20.040> some<00:03:20.160> decorative<00:03:20.490> stuff<00:03:20.730> in

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
and you can put some decorative stuff in

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.920 
and you can put some decorative stuff in
here<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.030> here<00:03:21.420> I'm<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:21.600> gonna<00:03:21.720> draw<00:03:21.900> a

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
little heart just on the end of her

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.390
