tricks to different tips that you can
use<00:00:29.650> out<00:00:30.650> on<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.830> trail<00:00:31.099> out<00:00:31.340> in<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.580> bush<00:00:31.790> to

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
use out on the trail out in the bush to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.880 
use out on the trail out in the bush to
make<00:00:32.090> your<00:00:32.210> life<00:00:32.360> easier<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:32.960> these<00:00:33.710> are

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
make your life easier and these are

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.160 
make your life easier and these are
skills<00:00:34.160> that<00:00:34.370> build<00:00:35.120> on<00:00:35.330> the<00:00:35.450> core<00:00:35.720> techniques

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
skills that build on the core techniques

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.900 
skills that build on the core techniques
that<00:00:36.320> we<00:00:36.410> teach<00:00:36.559> in<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.800> riding<00:00:36.980> schools<00:00:37.340> so

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
that we teach in the riding schools so

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.640 
that we teach in the riding schools so
this<00:00:38.059> is<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.210> technique<00:00:38.690> that<00:00:38.930> allows<00:00:39.350> you<00:00:39.620> to

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
this is a technique that allows you to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.740 
this is a technique that allows you to
cross<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.129> log<00:00:40.430> at<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.699> weird<00:00:40.940> angle<00:00:41.120> when<00:00:41.720> you

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
cross a log at a weird angle when you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.210 
cross a log at a weird angle when you
can't<00:00:42.050> get<00:00:42.170> square<00:00:42.530> onto<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:42.920> like<00:00:42.949> you

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
can't get square onto it like you

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.490 
can't get square onto it like you
normally<00:00:43.370> would<00:00:43.580> try<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.850> do<00:00:44.290> so<00:00:45.290> in<00:00:45.410> this

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
normally would try to do so in this

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.460 
normally would try to do so in this
technique<00:00:46.210> I'm<00:00:47.210> going<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:47.420> pull<00:00:47.900> the<00:00:48.050> bike<00:00:48.199> and

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
closed side of the log whereas you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.729 
closed side of the log whereas you
actually<00:01:02.539> want<00:01:02.690> your<00:01:02.780> foot<00:01:02.989> on<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.230> far<00:01:03.440> side

actually want your foot on the far side

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.040 
actually want your foot on the far side
so<00:01:04.250> as<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.670> bike<00:01:04.879> pivots<00:01:05.330> up<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.660> over<00:01:05.899> you

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
so as the bike pivots up and over you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.900 
so as the bike pivots up and over you
can<00:01:06.200> push<00:01:06.470> off<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.890> without<00:01:07.610> your<00:01:07.759> foot

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
can push off it without your foot

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.910 
can push off it without your foot
slipping<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:08.960> if<00:01:09.080> your<00:01:09.200> foots<00:01:09.410> up<00:01:09.500> on<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:09.740> log

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
slipping so if your foots up on the log

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.920 
slipping so if your foots up on the log
and<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.280> correct<00:01:10.580> place<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.330> next<00:01:11.509> step<00:01:11.600> is

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
and the correct place the next step is

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.080 
and the correct place the next step is
to<00:01:12.050> compress<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.590> bike<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.250> put<00:01:13.369> energy<00:01:13.610> into

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
to compress the bike and put energy into

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.779 
to compress the bike and put energy into
the<00:01:14.240> springs<00:01:14.660> to<00:01:14.990> relay<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.340> get<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.610> energy

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
the springs to relay to get the energy

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.790 
the springs to relay to get the energy
back<00:01:16.970> in<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.420> way<00:01:17.539> that<00:01:17.720> helps<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.050> like

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
back in a way that helps you like

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.260 
back in a way that helps you like
everything<00:01:19.220> with<00:01:19.340> extreme<00:01:19.700> enduros<00:01:20.149> all

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
everything with extreme enduros all

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.940 
everything with extreme enduros all
these<00:01:20.390> different<00:01:20.720> techniques<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.470> energy

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
these different techniques the energy

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.010 
these different techniques the energy
you<00:01:22.039> put<00:01:22.220> into<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.550> bike<00:01:22.759> is<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.570> energy<00:01:23.899> you

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
you put into the bike is the energy you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.870 
you put into the bike is the energy you
get<00:01:24.140> out<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.860> more<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:25.369> can<00:01:25.550> press

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
get out of it so the more you can press

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.120 
get out of it so the more you can press
the<00:01:26.479> more<00:01:26.660> rebound<00:01:27.110> effect<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.590> get<00:01:27.740> the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
the more rebound effect you get the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.710 
the more rebound effect you get the
lighter<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.520> bike<00:01:28.759> will<00:01:28.940> be<00:01:29.060> as<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.390> goes<00:01:29.539> up

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
lighter the bike will be as it goes up

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.020 
lighter the bike will be as it goes up
and<00:01:29.869> over<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.140> bowl<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:31.490> at<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.700> point<00:01:31.940> of

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
and over the bowl so at the point of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.880 
and over the bowl so at the point of
maximum<00:01:32.569> compression<00:01:32.929> we've<00:01:33.349> got<00:01:33.500> maximum

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
maximum compression we've got maximum

through my body and turn through much
also<00:01:54.649> in<00:01:55.009> my<00:01:55.099> head<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:56.090> rotate<00:01:56.450> my<00:01:56.599> body<00:01:56.630> around

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
also in my head to rotate my body around

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.960 
also in my head to rotate my body around
bringing<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.679> bike<00:01:57.860> with<00:01:58.099> me<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.429> throw<00:01:58.759> my

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
bringing the bike with me and throw my

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.419 
bringing the bike with me and throw my
energy<00:01:59.599> my<00:01:59.869> center<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.349> gravity<00:02:00.800> over<00:02:00.979> the

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
energy my center of gravity over the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:08.120 
energy my center of gravity over the
obstacles<00:02:01.970> bringing<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.780> bike<00:02:02.989> with<00:02:03.229> me

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.169 

so<00:02:09.130> even<00:02:09.310> if<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.459> don't<00:02:09.550> get<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.850> all<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.090> way

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
so even if you don't get it all the way

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.880 
so even if you don't get it all the way
over<00:02:10.330> in<00:02:10.509> one<00:02:10.690> movement<00:02:10.959> once<00:02:11.350> you're<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.680> here

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
over in one movement once you're in here

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.940 
over in one movement once you're in here
you're<00:02:12.520> basically<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.630> higher<00:02:13.810> hose<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.890> puts

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
you're basically you higher hose it puts

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.190 
you're basically you higher hose it puts
rotate<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.790> round<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.270> push<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:16.780> into<00:02:16.990> the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
rotate it round you push this into the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.470 
rotate it round you push this into the
log<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:18.069> energy<00:02:18.520> is<00:02:18.580> already<00:02:18.730> going<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.300> way

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
log the energy is already going that way

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.370 
log the energy is already going that way
it's<00:02:20.020> just<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.230> little<00:02:20.470> bit<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.830> push<00:02:22.380> and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
it's just a little bit of a push and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.150 
it's just a little bit of a push and
you're<00:02:23.530> over<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.620> don't<00:02:26.890> want<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.069> be

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
you're over what you don't want to be

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.800 
you're over what you don't want to be
doing<00:02:27.280> at<00:02:27.489> that<00:02:27.520> point<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:27.970> accelerating

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
doing at that point is accelerating

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.510 
doing at that point is accelerating
there's<00:02:29.080> no<00:02:29.200> grip<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> slippery<00:02:30.160> wet<00:02:30.310> log

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
there's no grip on the slippery wet log

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.729 
there's no grip on the slippery wet log
to<00:02:31.120> any<00:02:31.300> big<00:02:31.510> handfuls<00:02:31.989> just<00:02:32.470> going<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.650> make

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
to any big handfuls just going to make

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.250 
to any big handfuls just going to make
it<00:02:32.890> spin<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:34.060> grow<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.480> opportunity<00:02:35.140> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
it spin and grow the opportunity to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:49.880 
it spin and grow the opportunity to
thinks<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.590> are<00:02:35.709> off

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.830 

people<00:02:50.610> talking<00:02:50.820> all<00:02:51.120> around<00:02:51.510> pants<00:02:51.960> hey

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
people talking all around pants hey

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.730 
people talking all around pants hey
oh<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.709> were<00:02:56.950> starving
