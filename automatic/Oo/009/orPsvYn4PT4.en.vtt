00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.740
 not so long ago yoga 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.110
 was the Indian meditation and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.330
 movement theory as hippie esotericism 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.710
 frowned upon but now 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 more and more scientific 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.240
 Find out about the positive effect 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.939
 from yoga, it has become one 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.160
 recognized sporting activity and too 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.900
 A trend established an advantage of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.029
 Yoga is the holistic way of life 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.279
 Movement programs with gentle but 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.080
 intensive exercises will be both the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.570
 physical fitness and the physical 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.940
 balance strengthened as well as the mental 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 Balance promotes the principle 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.960
 Based on controlled breathing and the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.800
 Association of muscle tension and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.940
 Relaxation 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.250
 when viewed from physiology view 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.059
 tension in one or even physics yes 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.660
 if you are somewhere in another place 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.120
 relaxed 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.460
 then, for example, there is an influence 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.770
 water yes that's like a pump and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.039
 these same principles are used in yoga 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.589
 you can use it in the liquid 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.930
 body like blood and everything yours 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.170
 limit in motion 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.760
 Her body will be washed away by yoga 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.010
 So uses a cleaning and 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.380
 detoxification principle that in ours 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.299
 Body is already built in and through 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.100
 can practice regularly so too 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.290
 bad habits ours 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.110
 health burden almost on its own 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.150
 Several men and women disappear 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.430
 also have stopped smoking too 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.689
 of course I come to the lessons 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.610
 make your own body easy 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.009
 started to feel better 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.960
 note they do not fit into the need 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.659
 so the people first make their diet 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.130
 by itself of by itself 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.259
 nature out because they notice 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.610
 that does not fit anymore this is like one 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.610
 Brocken comes in 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.580
 And that's what I find so exciting about yoga 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.040
 do with one 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.870
 because of its positive effects like yoga 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.580
 backache headache as well 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.560
 has shoulder and neck tension 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.650
 meanwhile yoga classes are also being taught by 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.050
 supported and also as health insurance 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.030
 ground the opposite pole to the stressful everyday life 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.310
 has won yoga in popularity 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.730
 i do yoga because i like it in everyday life 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.610
 helps to shut down the work like 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.360
 Stress let me go in general too 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.730
 relax but also make an effort and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.560
 keep fit because yoga drives the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.190
 pulse in the height and sweat on the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.720
 forehead 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.790
 especially for the start of the day 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.010
 some easy stretching exercises are suitable 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.209

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:42.120

 with our feet we press against the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.610
 ground and pull us apart with 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.010
 out of satin arms go down the 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.050

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.769
 below and will be your hands 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.459

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.310
 as well as the rooms on the left side 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.700
 we take apart and dive 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.870
 from now on we come in the lower part 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.650
 body easily they bend knee our 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.930
 Bring the sacrum slightly forward 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.380

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.480
