so<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.750> here<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.019> are<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.230> Eiffel<00:00:13.440> Tower<00:00:13.700> I<00:00:14.700> aim

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
so so here we are the Eiffel Tower I aim

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.359 
so so here we are the Eiffel Tower I aim
it<00:00:15.360> up<00:00:15.630> at<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.020> sky<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.289> can<00:00:16.619> see<00:00:16.680> all<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
it up at the sky you can see all the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.519 
it up at the sky you can see all the
various<00:00:17.760> colors<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.330> purples<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.930> pinks<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
various colors the purples and pinks and

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.490 
various colors the purples and pinks and
peaches<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.539> it's<00:00:21.539> really<00:00:21.779> really<00:00:21.990> nice<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
peaches and it's really really nice the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.349 
peaches and it's really really nice the
lights<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.640> starting<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.029> come<00:00:24.119> on

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
lights are just now starting to come on

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.410 
lights are just now starting to come on
the<00:00:24.449> Eiffel<00:00:24.720> Tower<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.910> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.269> my

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the Eiffel Tower and you can see my

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.390 
the Eiffel Tower and you can see my
camera<00:00:27.630> down<00:00:27.930> here<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.529> splayed<00:00:28.920> out<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.279> his

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
camera down here it's splayed out on his

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.030 
camera down here it's splayed out on his
tripod<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:30.150> wide<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.449> low<00:00:31.109> most<00:00:31.619> tripods

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
tripod really wide and low most tripods

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920 
tripod really wide and low most tripods
can<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.480> my<00:00:33.540> little<00:00:33.660> rain

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
can do this and I have my little rain

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.470 
can do this and I have my little rain
sleeve<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.860> kneel<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.390> I

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
sleeve there that I kneel on because I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.150 
sleeve there that I kneel on because I
can't<00:00:36.690> stand<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.020> catcher's<00:00:37.530> mitt<00:00:37.770> position

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
can't stand that catcher's mitt position

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.630 
can't stand that catcher's mitt position
too<00:00:38.340> long<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:40.980> here's<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> thing<00:00:41.579> with

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
too long and so here's the thing with

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.340 
too long and so here's the thing with
the<00:00:41.940> reflection<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> normally<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> cameras

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the reflection so normally the cameras

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
the reflection so normally the cameras
up<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.530> okay<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> wide-angle

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
up here okay and I have a wide-angle

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520 
up here okay and I have a wide-angle
lens<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.899> actually<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.410> way

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
lens so I can actually get all the way

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.400 
lens so I can actually get all the way
to<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> top<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.870> top<00:00:52.050> e<00:00:52.079> Eiffel

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
to the top of this the top e Eiffel

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.069 
to the top of this the top e Eiffel
Tower<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.129> way<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
Tower all the way down there with the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
Tower all the way down there with the
lens<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.500> camera<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> see

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
lens on my camera and you can see

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
lens on my camera and you can see
there's<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> pretty<00:00:57.719> nice<00:00:57.930> reflection<00:00:58.739> right

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
there's a pretty nice reflection right

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.729 
there's a pretty nice reflection right
but<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.530> take<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.160> camera<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.229> lower

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
but if you take the camera and and lower

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.200 
but if you take the camera and and lower
it<00:01:04.920> way<00:01:05.070> down<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.670> rid<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.970> dead

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it way down you get rid of this dead

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330 
it way down you get rid of this dead
space<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> middle<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.590> by<00:01:07.710> dead<00:01:07.890> space<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
space in the middle and by dead space I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.969 
space in the middle and by dead space I
mean<00:01:08.630> see<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> area<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.830> will

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
mean see this area right here this will

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
mean see this area right here this will
occupy<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.490> lot<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> photo<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
occupy a lot of the photo and this is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.340 
occupy a lot of the photo and this is
all<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.740> sort<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.540> dead<00:01:15.540> space<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.110> bad

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
all just sort of dead space it's not bad

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
all just sort of dead space it's not bad
but<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.580> rid<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.060> maximize

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
but we can get rid of it and maximize

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
but we can get rid of it and maximize
the<00:01:18.630> reflection<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.710> watch<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.009> happens<00:01:20.369> as

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the reflection so watch what happens as

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280 
the reflection so watch what happens as
the<00:01:20.820> camera<00:01:21.210> gets<00:01:21.390> lower<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.930> lower<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the camera gets lower and lower and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.490 
the camera gets lower and lower and
lower<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.619> lower<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.570> down<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.080> right

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
lower and lower to get down here right

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.300 
lower and lower to get down here right
and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.430> sort<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.000> action<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
and then you get this sort of action and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
and then you get this sort of action and
it's<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.520> much<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:29.790> interesting<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.630> me

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it's just much more interesting to me

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.539 
it's just much more interesting to me
it's<00:01:31.409> almost<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> water<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> goes<00:01:32.340> all

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
it's almost like the water it goes all

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.450 
it's almost like the water it goes all
the<00:01:32.579> way<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.180> horizon<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> get

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the way to the horizon and then you get

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.100 
the way to the horizon and then you get
all<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.850> various<00:01:36.180> colors<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> reflection

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
all the various colors in the reflection

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.370 
all the various colors in the reflection
up<00:01:38.009> high<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.240> down<00:01:39.479> low

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
up high and down low

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.679 
up high and down low
okay<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.759> let<00:01:41.880> me<00:01:41.969> show<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> settings

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
okay so let me show you the settings

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.690 
okay so let me show you the settings
here<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.789> is<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> Nikon<00:01:45.659> d3x<00:01:46.140> I've<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
here so this is a Nikon d3x I've got a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
here so this is a Nikon d3x I've got a
14<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> 24<00:01:48.299> lens<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:51.619> which<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.740> just

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
14 to 24 lens on there which is just

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.090 
14 to 24 lens on there which is just
wide<00:01:53.100> enough<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.490> everything<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.939> need

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
wide enough to get everything we need

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.080 
wide enough to get everything we need
let<00:01:56.100> me<00:01:56.130> pull<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.429> up<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.880> get<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> settings

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
let me pull this up to get the settings

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.319 
let me pull this up to get the settings
all<00:02:00.090> right<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.720> are<00:02:00.899> at<00:02:00.929> F<00:02:01.619> 13<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.970> will<00:02:03.119> get

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
all right we are at F 13 that will get

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.880 
all right we are at F 13 that will get
everything<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.110> focus<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:06.210> ISO<00:02:06.720> down<00:02:07.140> here<00:02:07.530> is

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
everything in focus the ISO down here is

at 104 low noise I'm an auto bracketing
five<00:02:13.319> stops<00:02:13.880> okay<00:02:14.880> bracketing<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.599> those

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
five stops okay bracketing and those

we'll<00:02:19.560> go<00:02:19.680> ahead<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.920> fire<00:02:20.370> away<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:21.090> I'll

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
we'll go ahead and fire away here I'll

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the nature of this thing but the the

the nature of this thing but the the
dark<00:02:47.340> one<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.870> me<00:02:49.220> looks<00:02:50.220> quite<00:02:50.459> good<00:02:50.489> maybe<00:02:50.819> if

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
dark one to me looks quite good maybe if

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.990 
dark one to me looks quite good maybe if
I<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.120> get<00:02:51.209> really<00:02:51.510> tight<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.900> here

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
there that's a you can see a little bit

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.370 
there that's a you can see a little bit
of<00:02:55.560> what<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.739> dark<00:02:55.920> dark<00:02:56.310> one<00:02:56.459> looks<00:02:56.639> like<00:02:57.380> but

to record this video alright and then

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.129 
to record this video alright and then
one<00:03:09.180> other<00:03:09.329> thing<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.750> check<00:03:09.959> when

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
one other thing you can check when

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.559 
one other thing you can check when
you're<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:10.380> done<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.180> check<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
you're all done is you can check the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.099 
you're all done is you can check the
histogram<00:03:13.400> okay<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.940> histogram<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.389> at<00:03:15.959> this

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
histogram okay the histogram is at this

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:16.849 
histogram okay the histogram is at this
area<00:03:16.380> right<00:03:16.500> here

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
area right here

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.860 
area right here
don't<00:03:17.100> let<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.310> scare<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.790> when<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.630> lines

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
don't let this scare you when the lines

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.199 
don't let this scare you when the lines
over<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.380> left<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:20.400> means<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.030> there

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
over to the left that means that there

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.470 
over to the left that means that there
is<00:03:21.359> a<00:03:21.389> lot<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.720> darkness<00:03:22.440> okay<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.489> lines<00:03:24.209> over

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
is a lot of darkness okay and lines over

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150 
is a lot of darkness okay and lines over
to<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> right<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.590> more<00:03:25.859> brightness

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
to the right is it is more brightness

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.789 
to the right is it is more brightness
and<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.060> as<00:03:27.209> we<00:03:27.359> go<00:03:27.510> across<00:03:27.780> our<00:03:28.079> exposures

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
and so as we go across our exposures

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.949 
and so as we go across our exposures
here<00:03:29.069> you<00:03:29.549> see<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:29.850> like<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.970> wave<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.660> moves

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
here you see it's like a wave that moves

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.059 
here you see it's like a wave that moves
from<00:03:31.079> left<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.440> right

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
from left to right

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.030 
from left to right
alright<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.120> if<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:34.019> move<00:03:34.230> if<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.829> if

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
alright so you if that move if that if

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.770 
alright so you if that move if that if
that<00:03:35.549> wave<00:03:35.700> moves<00:03:36.120> all<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.359> way<00:03:36.510> from<00:03:36.690> the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
that wave moves all the way from the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.539 
that wave moves all the way from the
left<00:03:36.930> all<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.349> way<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.650> right<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:38.340> means

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
left all the way to the right it means

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.030 
left all the way to the right it means
you<00:03:38.790> swept<00:03:39.299> across<00:03:39.480> all<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.989> light<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.920> you

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
you swept across all the light and you

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.190 
you swept across all the light and you
got<00:03:41.190> all<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.639> light<00:03:41.790> on<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> scene<00:03:42.329> all<00:03:43.139> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
got all the light on the scene all the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.020 
got all the light on the scene all the
light<00:03:43.859> that<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.310> course<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.670> human<00:03:44.910> eye<00:03:45.000> can

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
light that of course the human eye can

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.830 
light that of course the human eye can
see
