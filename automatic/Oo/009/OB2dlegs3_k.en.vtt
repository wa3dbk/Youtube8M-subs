00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
guys what I get out this dead orbit

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.220 
guys what I get out this dead orbit
package<00:00:19.650> yep<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:21.420> see<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.109> is

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
package yep you see that that is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
package yep you see that that is
revenant<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.070> armor<00:00:23.490> shader<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.119> I've<00:00:24.240> been

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
revenant the armor shader that I've been

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.170 
revenant the armor shader that I've been
trying<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> get<00:00:25.320> since<00:00:25.859> God<00:00:26.369> knows<00:00:26.400> when<00:00:26.640> i<00:00:27.150> am

ranked<00:00:27.539> 61<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.830> dead<00:00:29.099> orbit<00:00:29.429> now<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
ranked 61 with dead orbit now and that

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.120 
ranked 61 with dead orbit now and that
is<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> last<00:00:30.720> shader<00:00:31.109> i<00:00:31.289> needed<00:00:31.769> from<00:00:31.949> dead

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
is the last shader i needed from dead

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.910 
is the last shader i needed from dead
orbit<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.550> i<00:00:32.640> am<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.390> am<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.290> freaking<00:00:34.770> happy

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
orbit and i am so I am so freaking happy
I<00:00:35.100> finally<00:00:35.460> got<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.270> does<00:00:36.480> look<00:00:36.750> really

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I finally got it and it does look really

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.160 
I finally got it and it does look really
nice<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> hunter<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.629> video<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
nice on the hunter this is a video that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.889 
nice on the hunter this is a video that
I<00:00:40.410> captured<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> ps4<00:00:41.760> luckily<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.450> smack

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
I captured on the ps4 luckily I smack

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.869 
I captured on the ps4 luckily I smack
that<00:00:43.140> share<00:00:43.469> button<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.280> saved<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> my

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that share button and I saved it to my

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
that share button and I saved it to my
hard<00:00:45.120> drive<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> guys<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.739> can

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
hard drive just for you guys so you can

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.950 
hard drive just for you guys so you can
watch<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.820> see<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.660> does

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
watch it and you can see that it does

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.979 
watch it and you can see that it does
happen<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.789> shaders<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
happen you do get shaders it's just a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.110 
happen you do get shaders it's just a
case<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.680> grinding<00:00:53.399> those<00:00:53.489> levels<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
case of just grinding those levels and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.479 
case of just grinding those levels and
you<00:00:54.180> will<00:00:54.420> eventually<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:55.260> them<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you will eventually get them so here it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.160 
you will eventually get them so here it
is<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> hunter<00:00:57.420> I've<00:00:57.690> got<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> female

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
is on the hunter I've got a female

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
is on the hunter I've got a female
hunter<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.010> looks<00:00:59.250> different<00:00:59.520> from

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
hunter and it looks different from

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.000 
hunter and it looks different from
female<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.809> male<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.469> reason<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
female and male for some reason like the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.490 
female and male for some reason like the
pants<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.670> completely<00:01:03.329> white<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> male

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
pants are completely white on a male

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.620 
pants are completely white on a male
even<00:01:04.830> though<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.580> shader<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.180> completely

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
even though the shader is completely

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.090 
even though the shader is completely
black<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.170> black<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.470> gray<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> don't

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
black it's like black and gray I don't

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.160 
black it's like black and gray I don't
understand<00:01:08.610> why<00:01:09.240> there's<00:01:09.510> still<00:01:09.720> white<00:01:09.960> bits

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
understand why there's still white bits

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.320 
understand why there's still white bits
in<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.920> anyway<00:01:11.310> apparently<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.150> looks

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
in it but anyway apparently it looks

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.940 
in it but anyway apparently it looks
best<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> Titan<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:13.830> be

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
best on the Titan because it will be

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
best on the Titan because it will be
just<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.340> black<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.450> I'm<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> keep<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
just all black but I'm going to keep it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.170 
just all black but I'm going to keep it
on<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.350> hunter<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.400> yeah<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:17.909> see<00:01:18.150> i

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
on my hunter so yeah as you can see i

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.719 
on my hunter so yeah as you can see i
have<00:01:18.390> other<00:01:18.840> changes<00:01:19.320> i<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.710> bittersteel<00:01:20.250> as

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
have other changes i have bittersteel as

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
have other changes i have bittersteel as
well<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.150> from<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.960> orbit<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.530> all

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
well which is from that orbit I have all

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.789 
well which is from that orbit I have all
the<00:01:22.920> dead<00:01:23.909> orbit<00:01:24.210> shaders<00:01:24.540> got<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> Hanged

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the dead orbit shaders got the Hanged

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
the dead orbit shaders got the Hanged
Man<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.460> well<00:01:26.970> I'll<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.330> show<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.689> what

Man as well I'll just show you what

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.160 
Man as well I'll just show you what
bittersteel<00:01:28.350> looks<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.509> this

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
bittersteel looks like there you go this

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.700 
bittersteel looks like there you go this
is<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.470> Hanged<00:01:31.799> Man<00:01:32.180> helmet<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.659> black<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
is now Hanged Man helmet is black and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.740 
is now Hanged Man helmet is black and
you've<00:01:34.950> got<00:01:35.040> black<00:01:35.340> chest<00:01:35.670> plate<00:01:35.970> black<00:01:36.360> kind

of knee pads and then we have the
nowhere<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.590> quite<00:01:40.829> quite<00:01:41.280> rare<00:01:41.640> as

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
nowhere which is quite quite rare as

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.240 
nowhere which is quite quite rare as
well<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.380> much<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.649> more<00:01:43.860> white<00:01:44.220> than

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
well as much it's more white than

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.950 
well as much it's more white than
anything<00:01:44.909> else<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> got<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> bit<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.750> gray

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
anything else and you got a bit of gray

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.350 
anything else and you got a bit of gray
so<00:01:46.649> yeah<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:46.979> more<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.700> silver<00:01:48.180> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so yeah that's more like a silver and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.270 
so yeah that's more like a silver and
grey<00:01:48.659> shader<00:01:49.110> rather<00:01:49.409> than<00:01:49.590> black<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.159> know

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
grey shader rather than black you know

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.770 
grey shader rather than black you know
like<00:01:50.430> dead<00:01:50.640> orbit<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.240> pretty<00:01:51.360> much<00:01:51.570> all

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
like dead orbit is just pretty much all

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.690 
like dead orbit is just pretty much all
black<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.979> yeah<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:53.460> obviously

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
black so yeah and then obviously

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.030 
black so yeah and then obviously
revenant<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.990> bit<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.320> Steel<00:01:55.500> no<00:01:55.829> way

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
revenant so you have bit of Steel no way

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.399 
revenant so you have bit of Steel no way
a<00:01:56.070> Hanged<00:01:56.430> Man<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.000> revenant<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.719> they<00:01:58.259> are

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
a Hanged Man and revenant and they are

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.350 
a Hanged Man and revenant and they are
all<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> shaders<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.399> guys<00:01:59.610> so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
all the shaders for you guys so

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.870 
all the shaders for you guys so
hopefully<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.990> guys<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.590> eventually<00:02:02.340> found

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
hopefully you guys have eventually found

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.060 
hopefully you guys have eventually found
revenant<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.540> not<00:02:03.780> let<00:02:04.049> me<00:02:04.079> know<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.770> rank

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
revenant if not let me know what rank

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.709 
revenant if not let me know what rank
you<00:02:05.250> are<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:06.060> i'm<00:02:06.210> pretty<00:02:06.420> sure

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
you are because i'm pretty sure

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.690 
you are because i'm pretty sure
everyone's<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.649> near<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> rank

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
everyone's going to be near to the rank

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.980 
everyone's going to be near to the rank
I

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
I

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.450 
I
and<00:02:09.080> if<00:02:09.230> you<00:02:09.320> haven't<00:02:09.470> got<00:02:09.710> it<00:02:09.830> yet<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.220> know

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
and if you haven't got it yet I know

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.130 
and if you haven't got it yet I know
some<00:02:10.850> people<00:02:10.880> have<00:02:11.180> been<00:02:11.270> really<00:02:11.510> lucky<00:02:11.840> and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
some people have been really lucky and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.480 
some people have been really lucky and
got<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.440> really<00:02:13.160> early<00:02:13.460> on<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:15.410> crazy<00:02:15.770> but

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
got it really early on and is crazy but

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.910 
got it really early on and is crazy but
I<00:02:16.670> think<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.720> revenant<00:02:18.230> shader<00:02:18.470> looks<00:02:18.770> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
I think the revenant shader looks the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.740 
I think the revenant shader looks the
best<00:02:19.100> with<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.400> Exile<00:02:19.880> game<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.300> look<00:02:20.480> at<00:02:20.600> my

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
best with the Exile game you look at my

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.270 
best with the Exile game you look at my
trousers<00:02:21.320> right<00:02:21.470> now<00:02:21.620> there's<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:21.890> black

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
trousers right now there's like black

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.120 
trousers right now there's like black
camo<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:23.390> looks<00:02:23.690> freaking<00:02:24.140> awesome<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.710> it's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
camo it looks freaking awesome and it's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.160 
camo it looks freaking awesome and it's
the<00:02:25.250> shader<00:02:25.490> I've<00:02:25.880> been<00:02:26.150> using<00:02:26.360> since<00:02:26.870> this

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
the shader I've been using since this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.710 
the shader I've been using since this
video<00:02:27.530> what<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.370> by<00:02:28.820> capturing<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.420> video

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
video what is by capturing this video

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.860 
video what is by capturing this video

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
dead orbit levels and yeah you will get

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.690 
dead orbit levels and yeah you will get
it<00:02:41.840> anyway<00:02:42.500> guys<00:02:42.680> hopefully<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.340> enjoyed<00:02:43.580> the
