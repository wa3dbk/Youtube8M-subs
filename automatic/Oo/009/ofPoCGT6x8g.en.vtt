00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.499
 hi how about how are people here from 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.110
 new to mike as you can see here 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:08.180
 we continue with the lane guidance and what 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.550
 I will introduce you now is the different 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.680
 types of lanes in these types 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.990
 new to put neither fear nor burgos of 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.269
 these signs the first thing that 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.759
 I'll explain what the range is, the range is 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.369
 distance you can from where you can 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.470
 throw a champion among more rank 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.210
 from further away you can kill a clip or 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.390
 shoot 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.160
 normally half speak as between 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.150
 550 so the intermediate we're going to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.520
 take as 550 h normally has 600 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.400
 of rank are 50 more than normal 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:49.769
 clint has 650 are 100 more because it has 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:53.600
 550 driven has 550 is real 550 grapes 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.730
 is for a low level is it has 525 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.170
 links also in his facet of submachine gun 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.379
 it has 525 and its missile facet 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.670
 it has 75 more so it has 600 but this 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.250
 range is climbing with mahou is the same 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.330
 525 but with its passive gives 600 and also 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.880
 is increasing the 100 has 550 my 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.490
 strong have 550 win have 525 25 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.820
 less than normal civil is from those of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.510
 lowest rank has 500 are 50 under 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.200
 the normal 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.900
 Tristana has 550 but his passive 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.690
 Makes you have 9 of rank in each level 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.240
 so approximately at a level 12 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.780
 they already have a range that kate singh twitch 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:50.270
 has 550 several has 25 plus has 575 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.159
 and 20 has 550 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.140
 and they will ask this what is it for? 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.560
 the truth the champions with more rank you 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.229
 they serve for to quote much better and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.429
 to start this is going to look a little 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.799
 better so this this and ying are my 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.390
 champions to make it easier 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.120
 forniÃ©s 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.069
 and good here would be this category the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.800
 true for me all the radicals are 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.950
 good but if I could stay between 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.520
 two one of the tall guns and one of the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.520
 Lower 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.520
 I would stay between Kate zinc and bein 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.410
 the runes 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.990
 the moons are standard for the I will 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.980
 Carris are damage marks are 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:41.670
 approximately as let me exactly 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.880
 see to see how much they are worth 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.880
 runes 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.620
 would marks of damage would be attack 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.460
 physical 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.910
 they cost 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:58.030
 he does not tell me but I think they are worth 44 410 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.800
 the glyphs are going to be armor to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.800
 all are all armor these 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.450
 sorry the glyphs are of resistance 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.450
 magical the seals are those of armor 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.870
 this is the one of lis forgiveness now yes they are 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.269
 those of armor and these zones of 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.620
 magic resistance the glyphs are of 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.200
 magical resistance the seals are from 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.940
 armor and on and off 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.250
 essences we're going to put two stealing 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.680
 life these cost 2000 all the rest 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.470
 I think it costs 400 days if I do not 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.230
 wrong and a removes essence of damage 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.129
 would be 2 once of damage and two of theft 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.379
 of life 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.860
 the rest is damage armor and resistance 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:42.050
 magical 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.950
 in the master's degrees we are going to put 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.060
 21 points in attack 9 in defense 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.220
 boosting the speed of 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.950
 attack the cidh is it helps you a bit 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.480
 for additional damage on minions that 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.240
 helps you heal every time you kill 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.830
 a unit this does more damage with pawns 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.350
 and here enhancing a bit the d 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.850
 here I have a little armor and life 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.850
 for a little more endurance 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.340
 and this would be the guide in quotes for 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.990
 there are some champions who have 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.989
 different routes different masters 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.150
 but normally they are based on the same 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.030
 because because they are all the range in the 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.270
 that could change a bit would be working 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.790
 and it's real nothing else instead of instead of 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.130
 the runes of these magical resistance 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.590
 we removed four of these resistance 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.520
 magic and we get mana regeneration 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.919
 that I think here I have 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.270
 I do not have in this story but they are four 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.520
 of mana regeneration every five 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.289
 seconds and ready with that and in the 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.139
 masters we would also put in instead of 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.020
 nine points here we would get three points 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.729
 in the regeneration of manises would be all 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.969
 I hope you like the guide 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.949
 they are the champions that 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.360
 that they should use for the a of 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.659
 conventional caries minus we have 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.409
 boroughs that no longer includes us at all 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:04.249
 to start 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:06.569
 I highly recommend kid link and james 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:09.889
 so I hope you liked the 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:12.909
 like if they liked it 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.909
 thank you very much
