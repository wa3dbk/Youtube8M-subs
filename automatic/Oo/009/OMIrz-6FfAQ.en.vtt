Adam here from Northwest slackline I

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.550 
Adam here from Northwest slackline I
just<00:00:02.970> got<00:00:03.090> done<00:00:03.240> wreath<00:00:03.449> reading<00:00:03.810> 180<00:00:04.259> feet<00:00:04.470> of

just got done wreath reading 180 feet of

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.860 
just got done wreath reading 180 feet of
rage<00:00:04.770> line<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:06.029> wanted<00:00:06.299> briefly<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.690> talk

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
rage line and I wanted briefly to talk

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.660 
rage line and I wanted briefly to talk
about<00:00:07.140> what<00:00:07.410> threading<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.859> line<00:00:08.040> means<00:00:08.309> and

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
about what threading a line means and

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.669 
about what threading a line means and
the<00:00:08.910> one<00:00:09.059> or<00:00:09.150> two<00:00:09.269> pitfalls<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.530> might

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
the one or two pitfalls that you might

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.870 
the one or two pitfalls that you might
run<00:00:10.800> into<00:00:10.860> when<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.370> do<00:00:11.580> it

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
run into when you do it

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.280 
run into when you do it
they're<00:00:12.540> already<00:00:12.690> some<00:00:12.900> pretty<00:00:13.080> decent

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
they're already some pretty decent

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.959 
they're already some pretty decent
videos<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.980> YouTube<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.549> how<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.700> thread<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
videos on YouTube for how to thread a

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.880 
videos on YouTube for how to thread a
line<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.839> don't<00:00:16.230> think<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> need<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.650> show<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
line so I don't think I need to show a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.290 
line so I don't think I need to show a
whole<00:00:17.100> lot<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> just<00:00:17.820> wanted<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.119> sort

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
whole lot of that I just wanted to sort

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.460 
whole lot of that I just wanted to sort
of<00:00:18.359> talk<00:00:18.480> about<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.080> or<00:00:19.199> two<00:00:19.350> mistakes

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
of talk about the one or two mistakes

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.040 
of talk about the one or two mistakes
that<00:00:19.830> aren't<00:00:20.789> mentioned<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.300> those<00:00:21.449> videos<00:00:21.810> so

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
that aren't mentioned in those videos so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.460 
that aren't mentioned in those videos so
as<00:00:22.619> you're<00:00:23.279> probably<00:00:23.490> aware<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.119> lot<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> nylon

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
as you're probably aware a lot of nylon

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.859 
as you're probably aware a lot of nylon
lines<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.010> some<00:00:26.310> polyester<00:00:26.640> lines<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.689> here's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
lines and some polyester lines so here's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.560 
lines and some polyester lines so here's
a<00:00:27.900> nylon<00:00:28.199> line<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.710> tubular<00:00:29.070> meaning<00:00:29.789> you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
a nylon line are tubular meaning you

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.089 
a nylon line are tubular meaning you
know<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.840> they<00:00:30.990> sort<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.590> open<00:00:31.830> up<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
know that they sort of open up like a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.459 
know that they sort of open up like a
hose<00:00:32.399> there's<00:00:33.180> an<00:00:33.360> inside<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.050> them<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
hose there's an inside to them that you

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.680 
hose there's an inside to them that you
can<00:00:34.500> access<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.059> here's<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> type<00:00:36.540> of

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
can access and then here's a type of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.000 
can access and then here's a type of
polyester<00:00:37.070> tubular<00:00:38.070> line<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:39.469> also<00:00:40.469> if<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
polyester tubular line that also if I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
polyester tubular line that also if I
squeeze<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> right<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.760> sort<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.270> open<00:00:42.510> up

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
squeeze it right will sort of open up

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.310 
squeeze it right will sort of open up
and<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> inside<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> when<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and you can see the inside so when it

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.600 
and you can see the inside so when it
comes<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> those<00:00:46.559> lines<00:00:46.770> since<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.250> put

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
comes to those lines since you can put

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.979 
comes to those lines since you can put
something<00:00:47.789> inside<00:00:48.180> them<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.480> could<00:00:48.660> thread<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
something inside them you could thread a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
something inside them you could thread a
thinner<00:00:49.260> line<00:00:49.500> inside<00:00:49.950> them<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
thinner line inside them and then the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.580 
thinner line inside them and then the
idea<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.750> strength<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> outer

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
idea is that the strength of the outer

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.010 
idea is that the strength of the outer
line<00:00:52.800> plus<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> strength<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> inner<00:00:53.579> line

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
line plus the strength the inner line

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.240 
line plus the strength the inner line
through<00:00:55.020> some<00:00:55.170> sort<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> complex<00:00:55.770> equation

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
through some sort of complex equation

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
through some sort of complex equation
that<00:00:56.370> no<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.610> quite<00:00:56.850> knows<00:00:57.059> will<00:00:57.629> add

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that no one quite knows will add

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.510 
that no one quite knows will add
together<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.440> make<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> whole<00:00:58.920> total<00:00:59.340> line

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
together and make the whole total line

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.689 
together and make the whole total line
stronger<00:01:00.170> than<00:01:01.170> either<00:01:01.620> single<00:01:02.340> piece<00:01:02.520> by

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
stronger than either single piece by

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.429 
stronger than either single piece by
themselves<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.359> probably<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.019> a

linear<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.070> know<00:01:05.360> two<00:01:06.360> plus<00:01:06.540> two<00:01:06.659> equals<00:01:06.960> four

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.719 
mostly fallen out of favor nowadays
because<00:01:12.420> they're<00:01:12.659> sort<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.990> newer

slacklining<00:01:16.680> types<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.250> lines<00:01:17.720> but<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.960> a

slacklining types of lines but for a

threading<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.650> still<00:01:22.860> somewhat<00:01:23.759> widely<00:01:24.030> used

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
threading is still somewhat widely used

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.249 
threading is still somewhat widely used
so<00:01:24.680> if<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.920> need<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> thread<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.400> own<00:01:26.610> line

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
so if you need to thread your own line

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.260 
so if you need to thread your own line
there<00:01:28.259> are<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.710> or<00:01:28.770> two<00:01:28.890> pitfalls<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
there are just one or two pitfalls the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.719 
there are just one or two pitfalls the
method<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.650> use<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.250> using<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
method that I like to use is using a

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.160 
method that I like to use is using a
dowel<00:01:32.939> or<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.240> rod<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.450> something<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.079> you

dowel or a rod or something that you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 
dowel or a rod or something that you
sort<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.409> shove<00:01:34.710> into<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> line<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.549> scrunch

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
sort of shove into the line and scrunch

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.520 
sort of shove into the line and scrunch
the<00:01:36.299> line<00:01:36.450> down<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.079> then<00:01:37.170> pull<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
the line down on it and then pull the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.810 
the line down on it and then pull the
line<00:01:37.680> off<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.070> other<00:01:38.189> end<00:01:40.369> usually<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> attach

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
line off the other end usually I attach

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.179 
line off the other end usually I attach
the<00:01:42.479> line<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.350> I'm<00:01:43.439> threading<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.950> sort<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the line that I'm threading the sort of

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.580 
the line that I'm threading the sort of
core<00:01:44.549> skinnier<00:01:45.479> line<00:01:45.689> directly<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.380> that

core skinnier line directly to that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.190 
core skinnier line directly to that
dowel<00:01:46.880> one<00:01:47.880> major<00:01:48.119> pitfall<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.049> can

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
dowel one major pitfall is that it can

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
dowel one major pitfall is that it can
come<00:01:49.560> off<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> needs<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.149> attached

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
come off so it needs to be attached

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.789 
come off so it needs to be attached
really<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.079> actually<00:01:52.229> drill<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> hole

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
really well I actually drill a hole

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.280 
really well I actually drill a hole
through<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> dowel<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.549> sew<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.200> if

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
through the dowel and sew it on and if

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.870 
through the dowel and sew it on and if
you<00:01:55.409> duct<00:01:55.590> tape<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.130> will<00:01:56.280> eventually<00:01:56.670> pull

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
you duct tape it it will eventually pull

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.090 
you duct tape it it will eventually pull
off<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.259> would<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> source<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.860> much

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
off and that would be a source of much

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.289 
off and that would be a source of much
frustration<00:01:59.310> because<00:01:59.820> either<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
frustration because either you have to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.179 
frustration because either you have to
rethread<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.719> entire<00:02:01.049> line<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> cut

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
rethread the entire line we have to cut

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.649 
rethread the entire line we have to cut
it<00:02:02.219> where<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.640> where<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.030> pulled<00:02:03.240> off<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
it where it where it pulled off and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.240 
it where it where it pulled off and
inevitably<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> always<00:02:04.409> pulls<00:02:04.770> off<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.159> know

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
inevitably it always pulls off you know

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.010 
inevitably it always pulls off you know
eighty<00:02:06.149> percent<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.869> there<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:09.020> for

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
eighty percent of the way there so for

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.720 
eighty percent of the way there so for
instance<00:02:10.319> I've<00:02:10.530> I've<00:02:10.890> left<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.400> part<00:02:11.610> where

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
instance I've I've left the part where

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.979 
instance I've I've left the part where
it<00:02:11.790> popped<00:02:11.970> out<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> ridge<00:02:12.420> line<00:02:12.629> on<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
it popped out of the ridge line on and

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.390 
it popped out of the ridge line on and
you<00:02:13.349> can<00:02:13.470> see<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.770> sewed<00:02:14.099> it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
you can see that I sewed it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.910 
you can see that I sewed it
so<00:02:14.730> that's<00:02:14.909> I<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.720> made<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> notch<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.560> then

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so that's I like made a notch and then

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.970 
so that's I like made a notch and then
drill<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.190> hole<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.489> sewed<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.890> that's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
drill the hole and sewed it on so that's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.369 
drill the hole and sewed it on so that's
one<00:02:20.220> sort<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.549> good<00:02:20.700> tip<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:20.970> have<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.390> some

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
one sort of good tip I have for you some

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.110 
one sort of good tip I have for you some
people<00:02:22.500> like<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.890> thread<00:02:23.159> just<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.940> dowel

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
people like to thread just the dowel

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.910 
people like to thread just the dowel
with<00:02:24.390> like<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.780> piece<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:25.709> strong

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
with like a piece of really strong

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.559 
with like a piece of really strong
fishing<00:02:26.280> line<00:02:26.430> through<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.879> then<00:02:27.269> pull<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
fishing line through and then pull the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.089 
fishing line through and then pull the
fishing<00:02:27.750> line<00:02:27.900> with<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.409> core<00:02:28.620> attached<00:02:28.890> to

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
fishing line with the core attached to

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.089 
fishing line with the core attached to
it<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.730> only<00:02:29.879> problem<00:02:30.120> with<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:31.099> your

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
it the only problem with that is your

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.490 
it the only problem with that is your
core<00:02:32.940> line<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.360> more<00:02:33.510> likely<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.840> twist<00:02:34.230> when

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
core line is more likely to twist when

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.809 
core line is more likely to twist when
you<00:02:34.560> do<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.280> get<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> twist<00:02:35.700> in

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
you do that and if you get a twist in

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.270 
you do that and if you get a twist in
the<00:02:35.909> core<00:02:36.060> line<00:02:36.530> your<00:02:37.530> life<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:37.920> not<00:02:38.040> going<00:02:38.190> to

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the core line your life is not going to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.920 
the core line your life is not going to
be<00:02:38.370> good<00:02:38.610> trying<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.120> fix<00:02:39.329> that<00:02:39.480> it's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
be good trying to fix that it's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.869 
be good trying to fix that it's
sometimes<00:02:40.110> easier<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.829> start<00:02:41.069> over<00:02:41.340> so

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
sometimes easier just to start over so

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.520 
sometimes easier just to start over so
sort<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.209> pitfall<00:02:42.510> number<00:02:42.599> two<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:42.989> don't<00:02:43.290> let

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
sort of pitfall number two is don't let

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.770 
sort of pitfall number two is don't let
it<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.709> twisted<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.430> goes<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.819> they<00:02:45.659> need

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
it get twisted as it goes in they need

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.949 
it get twisted as it goes in they need
to<00:02:45.930> stay<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.590> know<00:02:46.620> flat<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.849> made<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:48.780> well

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
to stay you know flat and made it well

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.099 
to stay you know flat and made it well
and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:51.030> biggest<00:02:51.420> pitfall<00:02:51.780> may<00:02:51.959> be<00:02:52.019> the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
and then the biggest pitfall may be the

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.210 
and then the biggest pitfall may be the
one<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.260> should<00:02:52.349> have<00:02:52.500> mentioned<00:02:52.680> first<00:02:53.010> so

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
one I should have mentioned first so

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.460 
one I should have mentioned first so
it's<00:02:53.340> pitfall<00:02:53.640> number<00:02:53.849> one<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.840> often

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
it's pitfall number one is that often

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.900 
it's pitfall number one is that often
will<00:02:55.590> people<00:02:55.769> use<00:02:55.920> some<00:02:56.310> sort<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.519> skinny

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
will people use some sort of skinny

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.309 
will people use some sort of skinny
metal<00:02:57.269> rod<00:02:57.450> something<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.079> where<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
metal rod something like this where the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.280 
metal rod something like this where the
end<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.700> an<00:02:59.819> exaggeration<00:03:00.359> but<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
end is this is an exaggeration but the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.160 
end is this is an exaggeration but the
end<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.530> kind<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.859> sharp<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:05.430> would<00:03:05.579> think

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
end is kind of sharp and you would think

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.140 
end is kind of sharp and you would think
even<00:03:07.170> with<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:07.590> sort<00:03:07.799> of<00:03:07.829> squared<00:03:08.190> ends<00:03:08.549> that

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
even with with sort of squared ends that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.069 
even with with sort of squared ends that
are<00:03:09.269> rounded<00:03:09.569> where<00:03:09.659> you<00:03:09.750> couldn't<00:03:09.989> hurt

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
are rounded where you couldn't hurt

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.210 
are rounded where you couldn't hurt
yourself<00:03:10.409> with<00:03:10.560> them<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.799> would<00:03:10.920> think<00:03:10.950> that

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
yourself with them you would think that

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.619 
yourself with them you would think that
would<00:03:11.340> be<00:03:11.370> safe<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.299> fact<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.599> actually

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
would be safe but in fact it actually

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.410 
would be safe but in fact it actually
separates<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:14.069> weave<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:15.000> webbing<00:03:15.329> if

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
separates the weave on the webbing if

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.849 
separates the weave on the webbing if
you're<00:03:15.569> not<00:03:15.690> careful<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.260> when<00:03:16.409> you<00:03:16.500> pull<00:03:16.739> the

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
you're not careful so when you pull the

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.589 
you're not careful so when you pull the
webbing<00:03:17.190> when<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.670> scrunch<00:03:17.909> it<00:03:18.060> down<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.450> to

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
webbing when you scrunch it down on to

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.860 
webbing when you scrunch it down on to
the<00:03:18.630> rod<00:03:20.120> you're<00:03:21.120> gonna<00:03:21.269> want<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.540> webbing<00:03:21.780> to

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
the rod you're gonna want the webbing to

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.599 
the rod you're gonna want the webbing to
come<00:03:22.019> straight<00:03:22.349> on<00:03:22.650> you're<00:03:23.130> not<00:03:23.250> gonna<00:03:23.370> want

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
come straight on you're not gonna want

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.360 
come straight on you're not gonna want
it<00:03:24.169> let's<00:03:25.169> see<00:03:25.290> if<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.470> can<00:03:25.650> you're<00:03:26.160> not<00:03:26.190> gonna

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
it let's see if I can you're not gonna

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.099 
it let's see if I can you're not gonna
want<00:03:26.609> it<00:03:26.700> laying<00:03:27.030> down<00:03:27.269> like<00:03:27.299> this<00:03:27.690> you're

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
want it laying down like this you're

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.270 
want it laying down like this you're
gonna<00:03:28.169> want<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.530> webbing<00:03:28.769> suspended

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
gonna want the webbing suspended

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.729 
gonna want the webbing suspended
straight<00:03:29.609> out<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:30.989> comes<00:03:31.200> nicely<00:03:31.500> on

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
straight out so that it comes nicely on

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.440 
straight out so that it comes nicely on
to<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.889> rod<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.669> more<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.030> end<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.299> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
to the rod and the more the end of the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.809 
to the rod and the more the end of the
rod<00:03:33.629> is<00:03:33.780> tapered<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:34.980> webbing<00:03:35.250> can't<00:03:35.489> bind

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
rod is tapered so the webbing can't bind

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.699 
rod is tapered so the webbing can't bind
or<00:03:36.060> catch<00:03:36.209> on<00:03:36.419> it<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.690> separate<00:03:36.959> weave<00:03:37.169> the

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
or catch on it and separate weave the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.339 
or catch on it and separate weave the
better<00:03:37.980> off<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.459> are<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.750> reason<00:03:40.079> I<00:03:40.169> was

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
better off you are the reason I was

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.869 
better off you are the reason I was
wreath<00:03:40.799> reading<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.129> region<00:03:41.430> was<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.730> show

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
wreath reading this region was to show

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.059 
wreath reading this region was to show
you<00:03:41.940> folks<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.450> because<00:03:42.889> when<00:03:43.889> it<00:03:43.980> was

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
you folks this because when it was

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.890 
you folks this because when it was
threaded<00:03:44.340> originally<00:03:44.819> which<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.269> didn't<00:03:45.540> do<00:03:45.690> it

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
threaded originally which I didn't do it

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.909 
threaded originally which I didn't do it
actually<00:03:46.440> did<00:03:46.590> separate<00:03:46.949> in<00:03:47.129> some<00:03:47.310> places<00:03:48.919> and

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
actually did separate in some places and

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.439 
actually did separate in some places and
I<00:03:50.430> don't<00:03:50.790> know<00:03:50.879> how<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.060> affects<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
I don't know how that affects the

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.270 
I don't know how that affects the
strength<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.870> webbing<00:03:52.139> but<00:03:52.319> I'm<00:03:52.859> sort<00:03:53.250> of

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
strength of the webbing but I'm sort of

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.099 
strength of the webbing but I'm sort of
anal<00:03:53.549> about<00:03:53.669> just<00:03:54.510> everything<00:03:54.840> looking

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
anal about just everything looking

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.449 
anal about just everything looking
pretty<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.799> kind<00:03:55.949> of<00:03:55.980> thing<00:03:56.190> annoys

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
pretty and so that kind of thing annoys

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.089 
pretty and so that kind of thing annoys
me<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.480> way<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:57.660> best<00:03:58.530> get<00:03:58.680> around<00:03:58.859> that<00:03:59.010> is

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
me so the way to best get around that is

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.220 
me so the way to best get around that is
just<00:03:59.250> go<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.459> Home<00:03:59.609> Depot<00:03:59.639> and<00:04:00.150> buy<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.840> wooden

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
just go to Home Depot and buy a wooden

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.439 
just go to Home Depot and buy a wooden
dowel<00:04:01.470> that's<00:04:02.190> exactly<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.849> right<00:04:02.970> size<00:04:03.209> to

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
dowel that's exactly the right size to

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.210 
dowel that's exactly the right size to
fit<00:04:03.599> inside<00:04:03.840> your<00:04:03.900> your<00:04:04.379> webbing<00:04:04.739> if<00:04:04.859> you're

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
fit inside your your webbing if you're

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.740 
fit inside your your webbing if you're
using<00:04:05.400> inch<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> quarter<00:04:05.940> that's<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.329> 5/8

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
using inch and a quarter that's a 5/8

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.710 
using inch and a quarter that's a 5/8
dowel<00:04:07.190> if<00:04:08.190> you're<00:04:08.400> using<00:04:08.519> one<00:04:08.849> inch<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.269> can't

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
dowel if you're using one inch I can't

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.300 
dowel if you're using one inch I can't
remember<00:04:09.840> offhand<00:04:10.079> but<00:04:10.349> I'm<00:04:10.530> guessing<00:04:10.709> it's<00:04:11.190> a

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
remember offhand but I'm guessing it's a

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.539 
remember offhand but I'm guessing it's a
1/2<00:04:11.790> probably<00:04:12.680> dowel<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.980> then<00:04:14.099> just<00:04:14.310> sand

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
1/2 probably dowel and then just sand

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.189 
1/2 probably dowel and then just sand
the<00:04:14.669> end<00:04:14.790> down<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.150> it's<00:04:15.269> nice<00:04:15.389> and<00:04:15.449> nice<00:04:16.019> and

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
the end down so it's nice and nice and

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.759 
the end down so it's nice and nice and
rounded<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:17.900> then<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:18.989> scrunch<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.380> on<00:04:19.500> and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
rounded and then you scrunch it on and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.120 
rounded and then you scrunch it on and
pull<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.760> down<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.180> just<00:04:21.209> repeat<00:04:22.010> it's<00:04:23.010> gonna

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
pull it down and just repeat it's gonna

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.520 
pull it down and just repeat it's gonna
take<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.700> don't<00:04:24.690> know<00:04:24.750> once<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.200> get<00:04:25.349> good
