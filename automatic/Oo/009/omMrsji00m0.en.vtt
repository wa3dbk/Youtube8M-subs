do<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.830> believe<00:01:27.190> that<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.880> white<00:01:28.300> manager

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
do you believe that a white manager

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.469 
do you believe that a white manager
would<00:01:29.020> have<00:01:29.050> had<00:01:29.289> to<00:01:29.470> wait<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:30.819> wait<00:01:31.000> so<00:01:31.240> long

for<00:01:31.720> his<00:01:31.869> next<00:01:32.110> appointment<00:01:32.409> well<00:01:33.159> first<00:01:33.369> of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
for his next appointment well first of

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.620 
for his next appointment well first of
all<00:01:33.549> I<00:01:33.610> think<00:01:33.880> that<00:01:33.970> white<00:01:34.149> managers<00:01:34.539> are

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
all I think that white managers are

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.600 
all I think that white managers are
given<00:01:34.840> longer<00:01:35.229> when<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.560> get<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:35.740> job<00:01:35.979> right

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
given longer when you get a job right

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.650 
given longer when you get a job right
longer<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.209> fail

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
longer to fail

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.570 
longer to fail
yeah<00:01:38.110> because<00:01:38.770> as<00:01:39.069> soon<00:01:39.190> as<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:39.399> lose<00:01:39.520> a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
yeah because as soon as you lose a

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.059 
yeah because as soon as you lose a
couple<00:01:39.789> matches<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.479> are<00:01:40.599> out<00:01:40.720> because<00:01:41.619> he

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
couple matches you are out because he

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.010 
couple matches you are out because he
it's<00:01:42.340> almost<00:01:42.610> as<00:01:42.759> if<00:01:42.789> they<00:01:43.720> don't<00:01:43.869> really

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
it's almost as if they don't really

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.029 
it's almost as if they don't really
believe<00:01:44.319> it<00:01:44.440> in<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.560> first<00:01:44.739> place<00:01:44.920> but

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
believe it in the first place but

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.650 
believe it in the first place but

you're<00:01:46.869> not<00:01:46.899> successful<00:01:47.530> straight<00:01:47.920> away<00:01:48.129> it's

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
you're not successful straight away it's

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.419

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
think is that well I thought I would I

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.930 
think is that well I thought I would I
always<00:02:19.300> look<00:02:20.140> at<00:02:20.260> racism<00:02:21.010> in<00:02:21.250> two<00:02:21.370> ways<00:02:21.580> overt

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
always look at racism in two ways overt

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.400 
always look at racism in two ways overt
racism<00:02:22.269> which<00:02:22.569> was<00:02:22.690> obviously<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.110> way<00:02:23.200> that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
racism which was obviously the way that

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.809 
racism which was obviously the way that
it<00:02:23.500> was<00:02:23.620> 30<00:02:23.920> years<00:02:24.129> ago<00:02:24.250> where<00:02:24.489> what<00:02:24.700> he's

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
it was 30 years ago where what he's

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:25.800 
it was 30 years ago where what he's
doing<00:02:25.239> what<00:02:25.360> they're<00:02:25.480> doing

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
doing what they're doing

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.750 
doing what they're doing
yeah<00:02:26.019> I'm<00:02:26.200> passive<00:02:26.709> racism<00:02:27.129> which<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.459> what<00:02:27.610> we

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
yeah I'm passive racism which is what we

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.280 
yeah I'm passive racism which is what we
see<00:02:27.970> now<00:02:28.180> whereby<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:28.810> don't<00:02:28.959> see<00:02:29.080> lots<00:02:29.230> of

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
see now whereby we don't see lots of

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.540 
see now whereby we don't see lots of
people<00:02:29.500> doing<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.769> but<00:02:29.920> people<00:02:30.159> still<00:02:30.280> feel

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
people doing it but people still feel

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.280 
people doing it but people still feel
that<00:02:30.760> way<00:02:30.909> but<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.450> can't<00:02:31.629> prove<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.959> now<00:02:32.230> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
that way but you can't prove it now the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.559 
that way but you can't prove it now the
problem<00:02:32.590> we<00:02:32.680> have<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.159> that<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.550> chairman<00:02:34.450> may

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
problem we have is that a chairman may

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.259 
problem we have is that a chairman may
say<00:02:34.810> I'm<00:02:35.620> not<00:02:35.950> giving<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.519> job<00:02:36.730> not

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
say I'm not giving in the job not

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.420 
say I'm not giving in the job not
because<00:02:37.510> he's<00:02:37.629> black<00:02:38.080> yeah<00:02:38.830> yeah<00:02:39.040> I'm<00:02:39.220> not

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
because he's black yeah yeah I'm not

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.009 
because he's black yeah yeah I'm not
giving<00:02:39.879> in<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.000> job<00:02:40.209> because<00:02:40.599> I<00:02:40.720> don't<00:02:40.870> think

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
giving in a job because I don't think

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.000 
giving in a job because I don't think
it's<00:02:41.110> good<00:02:41.230> enough

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
it's good enough

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.130 
it's good enough
but<00:02:42.580> then<00:02:42.670> if<00:02:42.760> he<00:02:42.790> was<00:02:42.970> asking<00:02:43.299> himself<00:02:43.420> why

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
but then if he was asking himself why

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.110 
but then if he was asking himself why
don't<00:02:44.349> I<00:02:44.409> think<00:02:44.620> he's<00:02:44.709> good<00:02:44.830> enough<00:02:44.939> it<00:02:45.939> would

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
don't I think he's good enough it would

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.910 
don't I think he's good enough it would
be<00:02:46.180> because<00:02:46.329> he's<00:02:46.569> black<00:02:46.750> right<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:47.829> that's

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
be because he's black right but that's

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.710 
be because he's black right but that's
in<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.159> subconscious<00:02:48.489> but<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.329> handle<00:02:49.599> is

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
in the subconscious but the handle is

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.660 
in the subconscious but the handle is
where<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.079> passive<00:02:50.470> racism<00:02:50.860> comes<00:02:51.099> in<00:02:51.310> which

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
where the passive racism comes in which

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.220 
where the passive racism comes in which
a<00:02:51.879> lot<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.180> people<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.540> based<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.049> their

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
a lot of people have based on their

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.390 
a lot of people have based on their
perception<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.890> International

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
perception of the International

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.049 
perception of the International
capabilities<00:02:54.939> of<00:02:55.150> black<00:02:55.510> people<00:02:55.810> generally
