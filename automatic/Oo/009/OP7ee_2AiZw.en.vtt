00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.999 
middle but I like my wigs off to the
side<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.320> why<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.560> looks<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.829> this

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
side and that's why it looks like this

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.670 
side and that's why it looks like this
so<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.540> looked<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.290> hair<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.649> can

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
so if you looked up the hair you can

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.460 
so if you looked up the hair you can
also<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.579> brute<00:01:50.820> are<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.329> black<00:01:51.659> so

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
also see that the brute are all black so

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.289 
also see that the brute are all black so
it's<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.189> black<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> top<00:01:54.090> it's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it's not just black at the top it's

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.179 
it's not just black at the top it's
literally<00:01:54.810> black<00:01:55.110> throughout<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.649> entire

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
literally black throughout the entire

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.429 
literally black throughout the entire
root<00:01:57.000> area<00:01:58.250> okay<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.369> that's<00:02:00.170> really<00:02:01.170> really

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
root area okay so that's really really

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
root area okay so that's really really
good<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.829> also<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> density<00:02:03.570> of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
good I also really like the density of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200 
good I also really like the density of
the<00:02:03.780> hair<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.560> full<00:02:05.100> body<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.790> doesn't<00:02:06.030> feel

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the hair it's full body it doesn't feel

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.059 
the hair it's full body it doesn't feel
really<00:02:06.509> light<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> stringy<00:02:07.380> doesn't<00:02:07.920> feel

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
really light and stringy doesn't feel

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.770 
really light and stringy doesn't feel
like<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.819> sort<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.149> see<00:02:09.420> through<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
like you can sort of see through the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.839 
like you can sort of see through the
hair<00:02:10.020> at<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.679> ends<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> hair<00:02:11.280> are

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
hair at all the ends of the hair are

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.390 
hair at all the ends of the hair are
straight<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.750> sort<00:02:13.080> of

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
straight but I sort of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.550 
straight but I sort of
my<00:02:13.549> Flatiron<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.209> bumped<00:02:14.569> it<00:02:14.659> in<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:15.049> little

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
my Flatiron and bumped it in a little

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.320 
my Flatiron and bumped it in a little
bit<00:02:15.709> just<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.430> give<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.700> little<00:02:16.790> bit<00:02:17.000> more<00:02:17.180> of

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
bit just to give it a little bit more of

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.089 
bit just to give it a little bit more of
a<00:02:17.420> nicer<00:02:17.780> look<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.230> way<00:02:18.349> that<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.560> pushed<00:02:18.860> mine
