00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi everyone i'm riccardo of style 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.200
 apple.it and this is my unboxing 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:17.699
 of the sixth generation aipo touch 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:19.199
 let's start the ipod touch known by 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.510
 always like the younger brother 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.000
 of the iPhone for this sixth generation 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 has been updated keeping 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.930
 exactly the same aesthetics as 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.699
 fifth generation but with big ones 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.500
 upgrade regarding the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.570
 internal components 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.760
 in the meantime let's talk to you 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.719
 open the package that opens as at 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.960
 usually always the same way 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:49.260
 we have the ipod touch we put in first 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.910
 for a second aside and then we see a 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.960
 quickly the content of the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.469
 package 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.379
 if I can magically open it then 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.559
 classic apple welcome books 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.409
 then the main instructions e 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.780
 apple stickers as usual then cable 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.270
 standard lightning length one meter 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.280
 in the package as there is not always 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.650
 the power supply then to charge the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 battery or via USB with the computer 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.509
 or you have to buy it separately 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.420
 charger and then there's this version 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.549
 special of the year pots that are without 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.220
 microphone then compared to those 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.210
 of the iPhone do not have nor remote control in the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.500
 microphone then just the poz 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 simplified let's say for the rest the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.939
 empty package and very very simple 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.369
 if not to destroy it before shah 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.829
 lose here we are 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.720
 the color I was given in 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.880
 supplied in this case is blue 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.159
 electric which is one of the new colors e 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.500
 this ipod touch compared to the models 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.420
 previous 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.030
 introduces exactly three points 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.729
 fundamental three novelties the first is perhaps 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.700
 the most important is in the processor that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.500
 now it's the apple 8 processor with lo 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 same let's say the same performances 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.239
 in the same processor that we find 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.330
 on the iPhone 6 with a processor 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.940
 m8 movement 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.770
 so we have more information when 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.600
 let's say let's use the ipod touch in 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.530
 sports field we say in the field 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.750
 fitness and particular thing that having 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.970
 a screen with lower resolution 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.400
 then the same screen as the iPhone 5 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.500
 in theory the processor should have 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.260
 less load to manage and therefore 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.420
 theoretically it can be more powerful 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.490
 compared to the iPhone 6 and even more so 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.080
 compared to a fan 6 plus 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.540
 this is obviously something to see 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.580
 so we'll do some second test 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.710
 very very important news is the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.020
 camera that now reaches 8 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.880
 megapixels and from what I understand has more or 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.430
 less the same technical characteristics 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.220
 of the iPhone 5 s camera then 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.700
 a respectable camera 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.490
 here it is not be able to let you 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.190
 see a moment closer is gifted 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.440
 of flash LED microphone and the classic 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.670
 around metal protection 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.340
 so the design as you can see 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.380
 exactly the new color as usual 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.170
 blue is definitely nicer than 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.370
 what we saw last year 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.150
 in the lower part we find i 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.180
 classic 3.5mm headphone jack 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.610
 lightning connector and speaker 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.590
 front part we have home button without 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.220
 traces of therefore remains from key 1 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.739
 traditional and facetime camera of 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.200
 side here they are keys to raise 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.910
 lower the volume and nothing else 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.160
 of particular 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.200
 in the coming days I will put to the test 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.390
 a little bit better this ipod 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.750
 doing some performance tests 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.030
 and how kind of object is very much 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.250
 used for gaming by kids 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.370
 so we'll do some in-depth tests 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.860
 regarding games and 3D graphics 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.900
 we will see for a moment how he gets by and for 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.430
 any deepening anything 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.180
 that you want to know in particular of 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.310
 this ipod 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.230
 do not hesitate to leave me a comment here 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.269
 below just on this video like this 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.360
 will try to include all the answers 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:13.000
 in the next video this video 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.489
 ends here i am riccardo this is 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.450
 been apple style and we'll see you at 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.450
 next video
