hello everyone in this video I'll be
doing<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.790> review<00:00:02.820> on<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.510> Gans<00:00:03.810> 3

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
doing a review on the Gans 3

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.460 
doing a review on the Gans 3
57-millimeter<00:00:05.100> 3<00:00:05.640> by<00:00:05.759> 3<00:00:06.020> thanks<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.140> cubes

57-millimeter 3 by 3 thanks to cubes

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.410 
57-millimeter 3 by 3 thanks to cubes
easy<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:07.980> sending<00:00:08.280> me<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.550> cube<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
easy for sending me this cube the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.240 
easy for sending me this cube the
feeling<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.870> us<00:00:09.990> puzzling<00:00:10.139> very<00:00:10.650> smooth<00:00:10.950> with

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
feeling of us puzzling very smooth with

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.549 
feeling of us puzzling very smooth with
only<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.519> slight<00:00:11.730> bump<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.330> each<00:00:12.480> turn<00:00:12.809> this

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
only a slight bump on each turn this

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.650 
only a slight bump on each turn this
puzzle<00:00:13.920> has<00:00:14.040> average<00:00:14.610> speed<00:00:14.940> not<00:00:15.330> too<00:00:15.480> fast

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
puzzle has average speed not too fast

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.310 
puzzle has average speed not too fast
not<00:00:15.990> too<00:00:16.139> slow<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.010> very<00:00:17.039> easy<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.520> control

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
not too slow and very easy to control

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
not too slow and very easy to control
the<00:00:19.320> corner<00:00:19.619> cutting<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.100> excellent<00:00:20.699> well

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the corner cutting is excellent well

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.109 
the corner cutting is excellent well
over<00:00:21.420> 45<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.320> reverse<00:00:22.740> about<00:00:23.640> three-fourths

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
over 45 and reverse about three-fourths

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.109 
over 45 and reverse about three-fourths
of<00:00:24.240> QB<00:00:24.600> with<00:00:24.750> almost<00:00:25.050> no<00:00:25.320> force<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:26.760> rounded

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
of QB with almost no force the rounded

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.700 
of QB with almost no force the rounded
centers<00:00:27.449> definitely<00:00:28.050> help<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.320> reverse

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
centers definitely help with reverse

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.019 
centers definitely help with reverse
cutting<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> reverse<00:00:29.609> cutting<00:00:29.939> is

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
cutting and the reverse cutting is

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.400 
cutting and the reverse cutting is
better<00:00:30.240> than<00:00:30.390> any<00:00:30.570> Q<00:00:30.840> wait<00:00:30.960> I've<00:00:31.050> ever<00:00:31.140> seen

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
better than any Q wait I've ever seen

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.830 
better than any Q wait I've ever seen
this<00:00:32.279> cube<00:00:32.579> has<00:00:32.700> absolutely<00:00:33.180> no<00:00:33.360> chance<00:00:33.600> at

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
this cube has absolutely no chance at

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.049 
this cube has absolutely no chance at
popping<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.410> twisted<00:00:34.860> corners<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.760> really

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
popping or twisted corners it really

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.330 
popping or twisted corners it really
just<00:00:36.210> can't<00:00:36.480> happen<00:00:36.719> even<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> try<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.070> take

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
just can't happen even if I try to take

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.490 
just can't happen even if I try to take
out<00:00:38.430> an<00:00:38.610> edge<00:00:38.730> piece<00:00:38.969> very<00:00:39.270> difficult<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
out an edge piece very difficult and the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.639 
out an edge piece very difficult and the
corners<00:00:40.800> take<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> lot<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> force<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> twist<00:00:42.090> on

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
corners take a lot of force to twist on

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
corners take a lot of force to twist on
the<00:00:43.649> other<00:00:43.770> hand<00:00:43.950> however<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.789> cube<00:00:45.059> has<00:00:45.180> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the other hand however this cube has a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.470 
the other hand however this cube has a
definite<00:00:45.660> problem<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.230> lock<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:47.090> as<00:00:48.090> i<00:00:48.239> turn

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
definite problem with lock up as i turn

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.299 
definite problem with lock up as i turn
the<00:00:48.660> puzzle<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.230> pieces<00:00:49.440> seem<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.010> move<00:00:50.160> away

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the puzzle the pieces seem to move away

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.590 
the puzzle the pieces seem to move away
from<00:00:50.489> each<00:00:50.789> other<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.270> come<00:00:51.480> out<00:00:51.570> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
from each other and just come out of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.799 
from each other and just come out of
alignment<00:00:53.120> it's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.329> difficult<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
alignment it's a bit difficult to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.420 
alignment it's a bit difficult to
explain<00:00:55.110> how<00:00:55.410> happens<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.190> try<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
explain how happens but when I try to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.979 
explain how happens but when I try to
execute<00:00:56.789> last<00:00:57.149> layer<00:00:57.360> algorithms<00:00:57.840> in

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
execute last layer algorithms in

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.779 
execute last layer algorithms in
particular<00:00:58.469> i<00:00:58.620> end<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:58.949> lots<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.399> lockup

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
particular i end up with lots of lockup

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.599 
particular i end up with lots of lockup
and<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.570> really<00:01:00.780> slows<00:01:01.020> down<00:01:01.199> my<00:01:01.410> solves<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
and it really slows down my solves the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.100 
and it really slows down my solves the
only<00:01:02.820> other<00:01:02.969> problem<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.750> cube

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
only other problem I have with this cube

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.410 
only other problem I have with this cube
is<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> appearance<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.640> circular<00:01:06.060> centers

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
is the appearance the circular centers

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.719 
is the appearance the circular centers
are<00:01:06.600> effective<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.350> ugly<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> stickers

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
are effective but ugly and the stickers

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.940 
are effective but ugly and the stickers
are<00:01:08.820> definitely<00:01:09.299> not<00:01:09.450> good<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.619> puzzle

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
are definitely not good this puzzle

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.560 
are definitely not good this puzzle
doesn't<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.549> many<00:01:11.729> solves<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
doesn't have that many solves on it and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.350 
doesn't have that many solves on it and
there<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:12.810> several<00:01:13.049> noticeable<00:01:13.680> chips

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
there are several noticeable chips

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.580 
there are several noticeable chips
overall<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.600> would<00:01:15.659> say<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.110> gains<00:01:16.320> three

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
overall I would say the gains three

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
overall I would say the gains three
57-millimeter<00:01:17.310> three<00:01:17.729> by<00:01:17.850> three<00:01:18.090> gets<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.390> b+

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
57-millimeter three by three gets a b+

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.010 
57-millimeter three by three gets a b+
grade<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.280> bad<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> CQ<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.750> probably

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
grade it's not bad as a CQ but probably

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.749 
grade it's not bad as a CQ but probably
not<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.350> par<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:22.979> current<00:01:23.220> best<00:01:23.520> that

unique and smooth feeling you might want

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
unique and smooth feeling you might want
to<00:01:27.689> try<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.950> you're<00:01:29.070> into

to try this out or if you're into

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.920 
to try this out or if you're into
special<00:01:29.909> mechanisms<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.540> collecting

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
puzzles other than that it's probably

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.830 
puzzles other than that it's probably
not<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.689> worth<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.049> buy<00:01:35.540> I'm<00:01:36.540> now<00:01:36.780> I'm

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
not going to be worth to buy I'm now I'm

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.240 
not going to be worth to buy I'm now I'm
just<00:01:36.930> going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> few<00:01:37.590> solves<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> this

just going to do a few solves on this

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.280 
just going to do a few solves on this
