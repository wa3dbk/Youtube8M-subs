00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.270
 Welcome to the world of singing 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.450
 the protection system for tires that is applied very 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.669
 easily 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.289
 step 1 location 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.570
 I posted the vehicle in the work area taking care that the valve 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:18.390
 filling is in the inner quadrant of the tire 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.609
 Place the joanito equipment near the vehicle by checking the inventory 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.050
 of necessary tools in passes bayito filling pump screwdriver 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.800
 extractor of this style 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.790
 meter for air pressure 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.450
 speaks of reference coalition 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.670
 Step 2 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.730
 preparation of the senator system by michoacÃ¡n 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.800
 verify that the seal of the impasse is closed with the help of the screwdriver 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.940
 lift the ring from the mouth of the reservoir 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.890
 and to the effort and mind until completely unfolding the plastic neck of the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.680
 bottles 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.270
 I turned the black lid and removed 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.980
 requires the safety plastic ensuring that the mouth of the container is 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.230
 lift to subsequently insert the filling pump 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.050
 insert the pump tube to the bottom of the reservoir and adjust the thread 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.300
 black located on the top 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.680
 check the position of the key so that it is closed 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.330
 fulcar filling pump 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.710
 Once the filling pump is inserted in the container, we will pass the bleeding that occurs 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.220
 makes the pump by performing a cycle that travels within the same system 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.540
 remove the lid located on the side of the root reservoir of an article that the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.100
 filling pump terminal on the container valves to complete 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 the connection 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.960
 making sure the key is closed 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.740
 to the stem up 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.700
 and then there will be the key to the pump terminal 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.080
 press the stem and appreciate how the baritone fluid advances through the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.060
 hose 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.530
 at the end close the key of the filling pump 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 Step 4 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.770
 installation of the pavilion in the same article 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.800
 Check the measurements that are on the edge of the tire and look for the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.810
 catalog the quantity of the country where you left for that tire 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.150
 work appreciate two columns with a minimum value and a maximum value 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.010
 this depends on the type of roads through which the automobile transits in any case 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.100
 you must apply to the tire a measurement between these two values 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.730
 you must fill up the amount recommended by the manufacturer 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:19.569
 it's worth up from scion said what the measure indicator in the part 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.859
 top of it by adjusting the screw to fix it 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.430
 insert the district exhaust to open the tire valve and then 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.109
 Insert the terminal of the swamp pump ensuring that there is no 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.229
 year escape open the container key and press the stem until 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.639
 the end of the measure 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.469
 and repeat the procedure with the remaining amount required before the 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.679
 baritone 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:46.329
 then remove the terminal of the pump connected to the filling valve 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.919
 of the tire 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.870
 and quickly the being of the pistil verifying that there is no leakage of 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:52.669
 Yesterday 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.739
 paper and place the sticker to indicate that the tire is protected with 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:57.879
 terror 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.689
 Finally check the air pressure of the tire to replace the loss 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.359
 by leakage during installation 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.309
 again purge by inserting the pump terminal and the valve of the 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.629
 container to download the remaining content 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.739
 close the key and remove the nozzle from the container by cleaning the remains of 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.319
 asphalt 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.549
 travel approximately five kilometers so that the force 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.549
 centrifuge distributes the product over the entire surface 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.699
 and adhere to the walls of the tire 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.189
 In this way the vibration caused by the product that is 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.069
 is deposited in the background 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.030
 Washington 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.709
 It is easy to install 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.369
 and it is the best protection system for tires that exists
