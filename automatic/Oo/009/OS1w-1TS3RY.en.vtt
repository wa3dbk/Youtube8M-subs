00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.530
 born and they were going to kill him to turn him 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.620
 in flesh 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.660
 however, Miguel was very lucky and 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.340

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.730
 weak and sick because of the bad 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.620
 conditions in which he lived we gave him 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.990
 veterinary care but I was so 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.420

 he slept soundly all night by 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.079

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.690
 hot and this and it felt safe 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.159
 today he woke up better and with more energy has 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.170
