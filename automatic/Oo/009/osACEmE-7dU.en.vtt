[Music]

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.850 

you<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.610> your<00:00:12.090> linear<00:00:12.570> force<00:00:12.990> which<00:00:13.620> is

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
you have your linear force which is

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.430 
you have your linear force which is
stepping<00:00:14.370> up<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.820> court<00:00:15.179> moving<00:00:16.049> through<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
stepping up the court moving through the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.429 
stepping up the court moving through the
ball<00:00:16.680> your<00:00:17.130> weight<00:00:17.340> travels<00:00:18.000> behind<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.109> shot

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
ball your weight travels behind the shot

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.439 
ball your weight travels behind the shot
to<00:00:20.189> give<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.609> power<00:00:21.289> you<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.470> ground<00:00:22.800> Force

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
to give the power you have ground Force

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.170 
to give the power you have ground Force
which<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.920> stacking<00:00:25.920> your<00:00:26.039> weight<00:00:26.279> down<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
which is stacking your weight down and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.009 
which is stacking your weight down and
then<00:00:28.109> letting<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.710> weight<00:00:29.369> explode<00:00:30.300> upwards

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
then letting that weight explode upwards

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.850 
then letting that weight explode upwards
with<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> shock<00:00:33.140> that's<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.320> very<00:00:34.559> powerful

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
with the shock that's a very powerful

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.410 
with the shock that's a very powerful
force<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.640> well<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:38.520> third<00:00:38.760> force<00:00:39.180> you

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
force as well and the third force you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.319 
force as well and the third force you
have<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> call<00:00:40.670> circular<00:00:41.670> force<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
have is what I call circular force and

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.110 
have is what I call circular force and
that<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> arm<00:00:43.530> swinging<00:00:44.399> around<00:00:44.610> your

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that is the arm swinging around your

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.400 
that is the arm swinging around your
body<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.260> circular<00:00:46.620> motion

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.650 

notice<00:00:52.410> how<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> head<00:00:53.010> sinks<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
notice how the head sinks down to the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.389 
notice how the head sinks down to the
height<00:00:54.930> where<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.260> shoulders<00:00:55.800> originally

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
height where the shoulders originally

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.510 
height where the shoulders originally
started<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.960> body<00:00:58.199> absorbs<00:00:58.829> energy<00:00:59.399> in

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
started as the body absorbs energy in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
started as the body absorbs energy in
preparation<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.480> unleash<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.079> ground<00:01:01.350> force

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
preparation to unleash the ground force

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.020 
preparation to unleash the ground force
upwards<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.379> energy<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.890> released<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
upwards as the energy is released the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.630 
upwards as the energy is released the
body<00:01:06.210> rises<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.170> its<00:01:07.290> original<00:01:07.470> height<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
body rises to its original height and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.510 
body rises to its original height and
can<00:01:09.510> even<00:01:09.720> come<00:01:10.110> off<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.409> ground<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.310> ball

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
can even come off the ground if the ball

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.649 
can even come off the ground if the ball
is<00:01:11.700> struck<00:01:11.970> hard<00:01:12.479> enough<00:01:14.119> Justin<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.270> again

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
is struck hard enough Justin is again

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.960 
is struck hard enough Justin is again
moving<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.470> playing<00:01:16.799> close<00:01:17.189> stance<00:01:17.520> four

to play four hands near the sidelines

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:35.090 
to play four hands near the sidelines
this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> great<00:01:29.310> movement<00:01:29.729> drill<00:01:34.070> then<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.429 

it<00:01:45.369> is<00:01:45.549> important<00:01:46.149> for<00:01:46.420> every<00:01:46.750> player<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.320> be

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
it is important for every player to be

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.440 
it is important for every player to be
able<00:01:47.619> to<00:01:47.799> separate<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.609> movements<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.240> their

upper body from the movements of the
lower<00:01:52.090> body<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:53.439> have<00:01:53.560> created<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.429> eye

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
lower body we have created the eye

the shoulders and the hips
notice<00:02:05.679> how<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:05.890> eye<00:02:06.069> rotates<00:02:06.939> a<00:02:07.179> lot<00:02:07.479> whilst

notice how the eye rotates a lot whilst
the<00:02:08.349> rubberized<00:02:08.709> triangle<00:02:09.610> compresses<00:02:10.420> and

the rubberized triangle compresses and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.890 
the rubberized triangle compresses and
moves<00:02:11.349> very<00:02:11.709> little<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.540> comparison<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.660> the
