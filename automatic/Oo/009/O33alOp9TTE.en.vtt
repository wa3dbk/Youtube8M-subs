00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
you are invincible and I recalled a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.609 
you are invincible and I recalled a
couple<00:00:21.570> days<00:00:21.660> ago<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> was<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.380> this

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
couple days ago that I was in this

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.720 
couple days ago that I was in this
parking<00:00:22.949> lot<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.189> there's<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> bunch<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.550> cars

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
parking lot and there's a bunch of cars

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
parking lot and there's a bunch of cars
now<00:00:23.970> as<00:00:24.210> I've<00:00:24.449> said<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.320> invincibility

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
now as I've said the invincibility

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.310 
now as I've said the invincibility
requires<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.699> hit<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> left<00:00:27.300> button<00:00:27.660> on

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
requires you to hit the left button on

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.130 
requires you to hit the left button on
the<00:00:28.439> d-pad<00:00:28.849> therefore<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> do

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the d-pad therefore you have to do

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.870 
the d-pad therefore you have to do
invincibility<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:34.670> sticky<00:00:35.670> bombs

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
invincibility and then do sticky bombs

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180 
invincibility and then do sticky bombs
because<00:00:36.420> otherwise<00:00:36.739> you're<00:00:37.739> gonna<00:00:37.800> set<00:00:38.100> them

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
because otherwise you're gonna set them

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
because otherwise you're gonna set them
off<00:00:38.309> when<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:38.820> doing<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> cheat<00:00:39.570> itself

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
off when you are doing the cheat itself

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.420 
off when you are doing the cheat itself
and<00:00:41.120> that's<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.239> no<00:00:42.390> good<00:00:42.739> now<00:00:43.739> remember<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and that's a no good now remember the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.979 
and that's a no good now remember the
maximum<00:00:44.850> amount<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> explosives<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.840> can

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
maximum amount of explosives you can

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.220 
maximum amount of explosives you can
have<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.829> time<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.430> 20<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.930> can't

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
have out at one time is 20 so you can't

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.970 
have out at one time is 20 so you can't
go<00:00:49.350> above<00:00:49.620> 20<00:00:50.510> explosives<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.170> therefore<00:00:52.590> let

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
go above 20 explosives so therefore let

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.830 
go above 20 explosives so therefore let

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.860 
leave you alone the problem is when you
get<00:02:26.359> a<00:02:26.420> bunch<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.720> cars<00:02:26.989> together<00:02:27.709> in<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.549> row<00:02:28.870> if

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
get a bunch of cars together in a row if

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.900 
get a bunch of cars together in a row if
you<00:02:30.109> move<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.530> camera<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.190> don't<00:02:31.549> look<00:02:31.790> at

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
you move the camera and don't look at

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.550 
you move the camera and don't look at
them<00:02:32.060> for<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.269> second<00:02:32.660> they'll<00:02:33.200> start<00:02:33.500> to

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
them for a second they'll start to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.870 
them for a second they'll start to
vanish<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:36.380> goal<00:02:36.620> here<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.220> steal<00:02:37.700> a

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
vanish so the goal here is to steal a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.509 
vanish so the goal here is to steal a
bunch<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.329> cars<00:02:38.540> get<00:02:38.930> them<00:02:39.019> all<00:02:39.170> lined<00:02:39.470> up<00:02:39.680> but

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
bunch of cars get them all lined up but

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.110 
bunch of cars get them all lined up but
always<00:02:40.910> keep<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.870> camera<00:02:42.350> facing<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:43.819> pile

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
always keep the camera facing the pile

00:02:44.120 --> 00:03:15.610 
always keep the camera facing the pile
of<00:02:44.480> cars

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.309 

all<00:03:16.620> right<00:03:17.129> that<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.670> just<00:03:18.299> about<00:03:18.599> every<00:03:19.049> car

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
all right that is just about every car

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.619 
all right that is just about every car
in<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:20.040> parking<00:03:20.250> lot<00:03:20.609> F<00:03:20.879> a<00:03:21.120> night<00:03:21.390> might

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
in the parking lot F a night might

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.360 
in the parking lot F a night might
missed<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.989> few<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.920> don't<00:03:23.069> want<00:03:23.189> to<00:03:23.280> take

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
missed a few but I don't want to take

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.430 
missed a few but I don't want to take
any<00:03:23.519> more<00:03:23.640> chances<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:24.150> cars<00:03:24.540> disappearing<00:03:25.349> on

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
any more chances of cars disappearing on

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.539 
any more chances of cars disappearing on
me<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.459> let's<00:03:26.849> make<00:03:27.239> this<00:03:27.359> shit<00:03:27.510> happen<00:03:28.549> all

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
me so let's make this shit happen all

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:29.839 
me so let's make this shit happen all
right

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
right

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.580 
right
so<00:03:30.150> unfortunately<00:03:30.389> there's<00:03:31.139> no<00:03:31.230> real<00:03:31.409> good

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
so unfortunately there's no real good

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.170 
so unfortunately there's no real good
way<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.829> get<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.069> good<00:03:32.250> feel<00:03:32.549> for<00:03:32.579> this

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
way to get a good feel for this

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.210 
way to get a good feel for this
explosion<00:03:33.599> because<00:03:34.530> they've<00:03:34.799> only<00:03:34.950> got

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
explosion because they've only got

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.819 
explosion because they've only got
limited<00:03:35.579> camera<00:03:36.150> space<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.379> let<00:03:37.560> us<00:03:37.590> count

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
limited camera space but so let us count

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.759 
limited camera space but so let us count
it<00:03:37.980> down<00:03:38.159> to<00:03:38.489> blowing<00:03:38.849> up<00:03:39.030> these<00:03:39.239> 30-ish<00:03:40.200> some

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
it down to blowing up these 30-ish some
