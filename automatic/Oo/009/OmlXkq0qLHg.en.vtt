00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
memories so if you stamp it he may

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.930 
memories so if you stamp it he may
actually<00:02:26.170> remember<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.160> stamping<00:02:27.700> brute

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
so laser cutting it's a great process

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.350

about these rotors what about the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.990 
about these rotors what about the
install<00:03:49.930> process<00:03:49.959> how<00:03:50.560> does<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:50.769> run<00:03:50.950> well<00:03:51.489> I

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
install process how does that run well I

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.910 
install process how does that run well I
would<00:03:52.329> say<00:03:52.600> they<00:03:53.079> still<00:03:53.380> it's<00:03:53.560> very<00:03:53.709> simple

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
would say they still it's very simple

would say they still it's very simple
you<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.220> take<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:54.700> stock<00:03:54.910> rotors<00:03:55.120> out<00:03:55.420> put

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
you just take the stock rotors out put

you just take the stock rotors out put
the<00:03:56.019> store<00:03:56.230> owners<00:03:56.590> but<00:03:56.709> I<00:03:56.769> put<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.310> gaffer

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
the store owners but I put the gaffer

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.860 
the store owners but I put the gaffer
rotors<00:03:58.000> back<00:03:58.180> on<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:59.190> bolt<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.579> new<00:04:01.299> lock<00:04:01.600> tight

the store the stock torque specification

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.050 
the store the stock torque specification
the<00:04:08.950> one<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.250> you're<00:04:09.310> holding<00:04:09.489> for<00:04:09.730> example

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
the one that you're holding for example

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.610 
the one that you're holding for example
is<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.150> full<00:04:10.450> floating<00:04:10.690> unit<00:04:11.079> that<00:04:11.260> means<00:04:11.440> that

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
is a full floating unit that means that

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.440 
is a full floating unit that means that
the<00:04:11.769> outside<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.549> inside<00:04:12.579> blade<00:04:13.120> float

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
the outside and the inside blade float

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.449 
the outside and the inside blade float
from<00:04:13.750> each<00:04:13.900> other<00:04:14.109> it's<00:04:14.950> something<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.430> a

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
from each other it's something that a

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.430 
from each other it's something that a
lot<00:04:15.519> of<00:04:15.670> consumers<00:04:16.030> are<00:04:16.299> very<00:04:16.479> interested<00:04:17.049> so

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
lot of consumers are very interested so

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.289 
lot of consumers are very interested so
that's<00:04:17.709> another<00:04:17.950> point<00:04:18.250> from<00:04:18.789> floating<00:04:19.060> and

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
that's another point from floating and

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.060 
that's another point from floating and
gives<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.630> lot<00:04:19.750> more<00:04:19.810> feel<00:04:20.229> because<00:04:20.440> the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
gives you a lot more feel because the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.800 
gives you a lot more feel because the
brake<00:04:21.280> pad<00:04:21.519> on<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.640> road<00:04:21.910> track<00:04:22.330> each<00:04:22.539> other

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
brake pad on the road track each other

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.510 
brake pad on the road track each other
instead<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.800> solid<00:04:24.190> units<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:24.940> know

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
instead of solid units that you know

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.980 
instead of solid units that you know
go<00:04:25.789> one<00:04:25.970> direction<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.479> Pat<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.870> other

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
go one direction and Pat the other

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.629 
go one direction and Pat the other
direction<00:04:27.199> so<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:27.949> basically<00:04:28.069> prevents

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
direction so it basically prevents

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.369 
direction so it basically prevents
warping<00:04:29.030> any<00:04:29.300> issues<00:04:29.599> from<00:04:29.720> developing<00:04:30.199> there

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:30.379 
warping any issues from developing there

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.790 
warping any issues from developing there
yeah<00:04:30.800> we're<00:04:31.129> being<00:04:31.569> excessive<00:04:32.569> heat<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:32.900> it

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
yeah we're being excessive heat and it

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.680 
yeah we're being excessive heat and it
prevents<00:04:34.310> any<00:04:34.490> of<00:04:34.639> those<00:04:34.819> and<00:04:35.120> also<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.539> gives

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
prevents any of those and also it gives

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.499 
prevents any of those and also it gives
you<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.870> lot<00:04:36.020> better<00:04:36.199> brain<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.710> ever<00:04:36.830> feel

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
you a lot better brain to ever feel
