the conductor of the choir was my first

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.020 
the conductor of the choir was my first
prototype<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.439> watching<00:00:32.250> him<00:00:32.640> conducting

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
prototype and so watching him conducting

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.600 
prototype and so watching him conducting
us<00:00:33.630> gave<00:00:34.469> me<00:00:34.500> an<00:00:34.680> idea<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
us gave me an idea that this is what I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.119 
us gave me an idea that this is what I
wanted<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.450> myself<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.890> when

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
wanted to do myself and so this is when

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.549 
wanted to do myself and so this is when
it<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.370> started<00:00:39.030> what<00:00:39.719> would<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.079> say<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it all started what would you say the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.860 
it all started what would you say the
essential<00:00:41.100> skills<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.760> needs<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
essential skills one needs to be a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.229 
essential skills one needs to be a
successful<00:00:43.320> conductor<00:00:44.010> well<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> think<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
successful conductor well I think that

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.959 
successful conductor well I think that
of<00:00:45.450> course<00:00:45.600> musical<00:00:46.289> gift<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.160> primary

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
of course musical gift is a primary

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.470 
of course musical gift is a primary
important<00:00:48.660> without<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.469> cannot<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
important without it one cannot be a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.889 
important without it one cannot be a
conductor<00:00:52.370> leading<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> performance<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.840> also

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
conductor leading a performance but also

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.790 
conductor leading a performance but also
a<00:00:55.590> certain<00:00:56.190> human<00:00:56.520> qualities<00:00:57.410> for<00:00:58.410> example<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
a certain human qualities for example of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
a certain human qualities for example of
leadership<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.609> are<00:01:00.030> essential<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:00.660> in

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
leadership that are essential because in

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
leadership that are essential because in
the<00:01:01.230> end<00:01:01.260> conductor<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:02.699> who

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the end conductor is the one who

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.990 
the end conductor is the one who
presents<00:01:03.270> his<00:01:03.510> vision<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.379> work<00:01:04.729> shares<00:01:05.729> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
presents his vision of a work shares it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.820 
presents his vision of a work shares it
with<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.600> colleagues<00:01:06.840> who<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.650> be

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
with the colleagues who will be

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.920 
with the colleagues who will be
realizing<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.880> together<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.330> him<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.750> with

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
realizing it together with him or with

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.520 
realizing it together with him or with
her<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:11.130> vision<00:01:11.670> has<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.000> convincing

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
her and that vision has to be convincing

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.280 
her and that vision has to be convincing
so<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.760> whole<00:01:15.210> conglomeration<00:01:15.450> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
so you have a whole conglomeration of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.859 
so you have a whole conglomeration of
qualities<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:16.979> are<00:01:17.369> all<00:01:17.520> mixed<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.509> example

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
qualities that are all mixed for example

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.070 
qualities that are all mixed for example
I<00:01:18.990> believe<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.830> people<00:01:20.430> will<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:21.439> better<00:01:22.439> and

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
I believe that people will do better and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.929 
I believe that people will do better and
much<00:01:25.080> more<00:01:25.290> willingly<00:01:25.680> something<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> they

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
much more willingly something that they

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.420 
much more willingly something that they
genuinely<00:01:27.420> believe<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:28.200> convincing<00:01:28.920> rather

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
genuinely believe is convincing rather

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760 
genuinely believe is convincing rather
than<00:01:29.640> they're<00:01:29.850> forced<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.560> reason

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
than they're forced to do for one reason

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.100 
than they're forced to do for one reason
or<00:01:32.070> another<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:34.250> always<00:01:35.390> music<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
or another so as always music and and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.280 
or another so as always music and and
and<00:01:37.560> life<00:01:38.009> are<00:01:38.250> inseparable<00:01:39.140> there's<00:01:40.140> one

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and life are inseparable there's one

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.200 
and life are inseparable there's one
other<00:01:40.409> party<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.130> didn't<00:01:41.400> mention<00:01:41.549> there<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
other party you didn't mention there and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.460 
other party you didn't mention there and
I<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.390> wondering<00:01:42.780> do<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.590> yes<00:01:44.430> to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
I was wondering do you have to be yes to

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.039 
I was wondering do you have to be yes to
really<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.619> care<00:01:47.369> what<00:01:48.299> other<00:01:48.479> people<00:01:48.869> might

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
really not care what other people might

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.639 
really not care what other people might
say<00:01:49.470> about<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.070> once<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.149> understand<00:01:51.780> well<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
say about you once you understand well I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.600 
say about you once you understand well I
would<00:01:52.950> probably<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.850> say<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.649> don't<00:01:56.219> care

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
would probably not say that I don't care

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.940 
would probably not say that I don't care
about<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.360> other<00:01:57.630> people<00:01:58.020> say<00:01:58.680> or<00:01:58.920> think

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
about what other people say or think

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.940 
about what other people say or think
because<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.540> presumption<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.469> their

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
because that is presumption of their

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.289 
because that is presumption of their
stupidity<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.990> they<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.350> ideas<00:02:05.240> they<00:02:06.240> do

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
stupidity and they do have ideas they do

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.339 
stupidity and they do have ideas they do
have<00:02:06.659> their<00:02:06.719> own<00:02:07.280> visions<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.489> music<00:02:09.349> often

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
have their own visions of music often

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.300 
have their own visions of music often
they<00:02:10.470> do<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.830> their<00:02:10.860> own

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
they do have their own

they do have their own
experience<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.630> am<00:02:12.930> actually

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
experience of it so I am actually

interested<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:14.730> others<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.420> bring

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
interested in what others have to bring

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.260 
interested in what others have to bring
what<00:02:16.800> I'm<00:02:16.950> trying<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.340> do<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.760> what<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.209> I

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
what I'm trying to do and what I think I

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.410 
what I'm trying to do and what I think I
ought<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.140> when<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> first<00:02:19.950> face<00:02:20.370> them<00:02:20.730> my

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
ought to do is when I first face them my

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.830 
ought to do is when I first face them my
colleagues<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.020> an<00:02:22.170> orchestral<00:02:22.680> choir<00:02:23.040> or

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
singers for sending with me is to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.460 
singers for sending with me is to
present<00:02:26.550> them<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.090> idea<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.510> i<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
present them the idea that i have a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.160 
present them the idea that i have a
concept<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.640> work<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.120> at<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> same<00:02:31.110> time

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
concept of the work and at the same time

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.949 
concept of the work and at the same time
while<00:02:32.010> giving<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.519> I'm<00:02:32.670> receiving<00:02:33.209> theirs<00:02:33.630> and

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
while giving it I'm receiving theirs and

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.620 
while giving it I'm receiving theirs and
that<00:02:34.019> I'm<00:02:34.800> comparing<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.519> two<00:02:35.760> how<00:02:36.360> they

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
that I'm comparing the two how they

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.160 
that I'm comparing the two how they
correspond<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.580> way<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:39.930> all<00:02:39.959> of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
correspond and in a way it is for all of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
correspond and in a way it is for all of
us<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.920> why<00:02:41.069> we<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.640> rehearse

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
us and this is why we have to rehearse

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.090 
us and this is why we have to rehearse
it<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.810> all<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.080> us<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.230> find<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:45.360> kind<00:02:45.690> of

it is for all of us to find the kind of

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.039 
it is for all of us to find the kind of
fusion<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.340> ideas<00:02:48.090> which<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.750> can<00:02:48.900> live

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
fusion of ideas which you can live

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.050 
fusion of ideas which you can live
harmoniously<00:02:49.260> together<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:50.910> no

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
harmoniously together and so it is no

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.910 
harmoniously together and so it is no

word I would call it is simply to be
convinced<00:03:05.310> by<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.360> validity<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:07.080> your<00:03:07.319> point

of<00:03:07.920> view<00:03:07.980> which<00:03:08.640> certainly<00:03:09.269> excludes<00:03:09.989> the

the idea that your point of view is

the idea that your point of view is

I<00:03:28.230> think<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.340> for<00:03:29.880> example<00:03:30.000> every<00:03:30.540> athlete

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
I think that for example every athlete

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.240 
I think that for example every athlete
every<00:03:31.760> champion<00:03:32.760> believes<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:34.049> in<00:03:34.590> his<00:03:34.980> or<00:03:35.220> her

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
every champion believes in in his or her

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.140 
every champion believes in in his or her
ability<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:38.370> deliver<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.819> performance

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
ability to to deliver the performance

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.229 
ability to to deliver the performance
which<00:03:39.510> will<00:03:39.720> enable<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:40.230> person<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.769> win<00:03:41.239> in

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
which will enable this person to win in

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.650 
which will enable this person to win in
some<00:03:42.660> ways<00:03:42.900> we<00:03:43.200> are<00:03:43.500> similar<00:03:44.069> to<00:03:44.250> athletes<00:03:44.940> but

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
some ways we are similar to athletes but

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.840 
some ways we are similar to athletes but
that<00:03:46.079> does<00:03:46.290> not<00:03:46.319> preclude<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:47.400> fact<00:03:47.670> it

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
that does not preclude in fact it

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.150 
that does not preclude in fact it
requires<00:03:48.269> lots<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.900> doubts<00:03:49.139> during<00:03:50.040> the

process when we are working on the on

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.410 
process when we are working on the on
the<00:03:52.620> work<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.069> art<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.519> we<00:03:54.030> have<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.269> question

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
the work of art and we have to question

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.069 
the work of art and we have to question
every<00:03:55.230> single<00:03:55.739> aspect<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.600> once

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
every single aspect of it and then once

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.840 
every single aspect of it and then once
we<00:03:58.290> are<00:03:58.350> doing<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.799> we<00:03:58.950> have<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.190> question<00:03:59.700> and

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
we are doing it we have the question and

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.660 
we are doing it we have the question and
we<00:04:00.090> do<00:04:00.470> everything<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.829> we<00:04:01.889> do<00:04:02.190> with<00:04:02.459> it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
we do everything that we do with it

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.819 
we do everything that we do with it
because<00:04:03.660> without<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.049> one<00:04:04.380> can<00:04:04.560> never<00:04:04.709> have

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
because without that one can never have

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.090 
because without that one can never have
any<00:04:05.220> progress<00:04:05.519> one<00:04:05.850> can<00:04:06.060> ever<00:04:06.209> really<00:04:07.100> evolve

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
any progress one can ever really evolve

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.940 
any progress one can ever really evolve
together<00:04:08.940> with<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.389> piece<00:04:09.690> because<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.769> work

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
together with the piece because the work

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.129 
together with the piece because the work
work<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.519> music<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:12.569> simply<00:04:12.959> something

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
work of music it is simply something
