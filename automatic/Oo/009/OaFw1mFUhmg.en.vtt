00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 the bad explanations that the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.179
 witnesses of jehova in juan 20 28 says 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.630
 then tom치s answered and said sir 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.849
 mine and my god the explanation they give him 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 the witnesses of jehovah is the following 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.160
 Tomas when he said my lord and my God 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.980
 it was just an expression of surprise 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.289
 admiring yourself is not telling Jesus 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.349
 because Jesus is not god according to them 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.810
 jesus alone is the son of god is like 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.260
 when you see an accident and you say god 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.230
 mine or maybe you could say wrong 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.350
 brad good put more was surprised and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.170
 said my Lord and my God 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.359
 well here I start talking because I 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.280
 what I mentioned earlier was all 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.360
 the explanation that the witnesses of 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.820
 jehova give about john 2028 that 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.070
 explanation is wrong and does not fit with the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.110
 word of god them with that 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.719
 explanation they want you to believe that 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.899
 jesus is not god and that he is only his son 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.409
 nothing else we notice that in the verse of 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:12.649
 juan 20 28 says the following tom치s him 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.720
 said my Lord and my God to be this 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.750
 article you can not get this 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.420
 explanation of the witnesses of jehova 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.119
 let's read again the verse tom치s le 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.929
 said my Lord and my God, let's notice that 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:32.030
 Tom치s told him he said he repeated he told him 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:34.190
 He said to whom he told Jesus to 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.619
 being this article does not allow you 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.960
 stupid explanation that the witnesses of 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.090
 jehova they give to such a verse but without 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.310
 However, if this article does not 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.709
 was there then maybe it could be 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.960
 accept the witnesses' explanation 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.950
 of jehova but as it is there is a 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.350
 too bad for him 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.270
 since they always want to change the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.430
 word of God making the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.390
 people that Jesus is an inferior being and 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.060
 different from father 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.110
 another of his stupid explanations is 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.450
 of jesus on the wood when in juan 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.240
 2025 says the following accordingly 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.240
 the other disciples told him we have 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.100
 seen the gentleman but he told them less 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.350
 that you see in your hands the impression of 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.020
 nails and put my finger in the print of 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.810
 the nails and put my hand in his side 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.550
 I will not believe the verse in any way 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.300
 that we just read makes us understand 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.989
 two very important things one there are nails 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.020
 in plural two the impression of the nails 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.090
 is in the plural hands now let's compare 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.190
 this statement with one of the drawings 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.590
 that was published by the organization of 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.830
 the witnesses of jehova if you notice 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.050
 in the drawing how many nails are there 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.140
 answer one what happened to the other nail 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.030
 it was stolen the impression of the nails 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.050
 it's not in the hands but rather in 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.850
 the wrists before the joints 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.730
 obviously this drawing has nothing of 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.340
 biblical the bible says that they were used 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.080
 nails in the plural this is because their 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.570
 arms were separated 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.540
 also the bible says that about its 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.400
 head was put on a sign this indicates 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.200
 that the hands were not above 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.820
 the head of Jesus as we see in the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.480
 witness painting 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.240
 matteo 27 37 and put on his head 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.360
 his written cause this is jesus the king of 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.400
 the Jews a better representation of the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.830
 biblical story would be represented with 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.280
 two nails one in each hand and the sign 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.080
 on his head not on his hands 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.470
 you can argue that the cross is a 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.630
 pagan symbol this I do not argue 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.030
 after all perhaps the Romans did not 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.220
 they were pagans it is logical that their 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.980
 torture instruments are also 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.470
 this evidence that we have seen does not want 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.600
 say that we should venerate the cross the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.720
 cross should not be worshiped or worshiped 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.850
 since it was a weapon to kill like that 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.060
 as is the electric chair the living room 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.430
 of gas the lethal injection etcetera like 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.100
 you have been able to see Jesus died in a 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.380
 cross the drawings of the witnesses of 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.900
 jehova that are based on their doctrine not 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.989
 they match what the bible teaches 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.269
 the bible should be our total guide if 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.859
 you ignore this evidence despite 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.620
 what the bible says you simply 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.270
 is ignoring God and is idolizing 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.639
 his organization jesus said matteo 1037 the 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.310
 who loves father or mother more than me is not 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.979
 worthy of me and the one who loves son or daughter more 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.530
 that is not worthy of my love you to 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:40.070
 the organization more than jesus you 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.360
 has the answer blessings to everything 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.360
