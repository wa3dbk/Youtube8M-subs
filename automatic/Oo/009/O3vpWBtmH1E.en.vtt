00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.509
 and then there's beauty here and the manu in the day 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.210
 Today I'm going to be talking about the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.189
 droid x is what he is he is other 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.189
 Resident is for android on ec in video 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.619
 Last I told you about the bluescks, right? 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.340
 I only taught how to install after I 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.980
 I'll give more but details about him and 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 Ways to use it beauty then I'll close 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 here is one of the highlights and there has already 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.680
 here for me the droid x 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.629
 Ok so then he is he is much more 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.360
 Simple, I'd say to move. 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.489
 he does not have much freshness, he's coming 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 here with all the cute short cuts to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.480
 You are you too. You can play the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.899
 settings you can do is to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.450
 several other things and his cool is 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.950
 so he has the option to view the heavens 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.610
 easter eggs 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.210
 hello and if in the case is with 14 points 2.2 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.729
 huh 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.340
 I do not know if the manufacturer will 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.880
 update this is not Android here to 14.4 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.840
 But to give you already play a little 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:33.240
 so I 'm going to close here we go there 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:37.470
 in the browser and type strong droid x.com 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.350
 a droid 4xp.com and then when you enter 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.530
 on his page he already offers you 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.790
 you download the emulator is the simulator 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.759
 crazy new in the case and the differential of it 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.220
 is that it can also be controlled 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.070
 by smartphone, right? 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.259
 It's really cool, there you can for one. 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.659
 example on your tv 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.180
 I already did this test and control by 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.459
 Cell phone, it's really cool , it's really cool 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.560
 So we'll go down there, the simulator. 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.000
 When I finish and we'll be back soon. 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.760
 is opening the installer 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.920
 néné and there is the following you put where 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.600
 You want him to save I do not move. 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.380
 In this I let him save where he 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.350
 want to 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.220
 so the people on the x droid here 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.080
 yet it has still lack 50% for him 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.760
 the installation is because it takes so long 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.140
 the two bluestacks and the x droid because 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.290
 He has to hit because he has to 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.780
 download all the emulator source code and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.990
 So, it does not take long. 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.120
 the droid x it already has the function to stay 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.890
 installing minimized so that you 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.800
 can do other things but nothing 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.280
 prevents you from taking a look too 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.600
 huh 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.920
 here he goes installing it goes 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.930
 giving you a few tips than what 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.380
 the program is capable every time you 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.440
 open it will carry it like that for you 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.680
 It will always start in this window here ok 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.480
 so you can also expand on it 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.549
 that the volume becomes smooth 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.570
 has dedicated volume buttons 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.600
 the volume here 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.570
 Here you have more options, 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.510
 screen 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:38.080
 Who created who is the manufacturer, right? 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:40.510
 here you can vibrate until I do not know that 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.950
 function is this type save to the screen but 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.280
 she 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.620
 finally you can give print né, that is if 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.380
 You 're playing, do you want to talk? 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.900
 Bridges of the hour, this is nice for here. 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.209
 share with people there go there strip 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.140
 photo and everything is quiet 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.390
 you can also simulate your location 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.570
 I do not know what it's good for, but I 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.410
 I believe that if I think that privatizing 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.390
 should be interesting here is as follows 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.500
 for you to use your cell phone with 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.769
 controller 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.190
 You can enter this ip here by 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.039
 your mobile phone browser or 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.970
 Copy the photo of the qr code 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:26.860
 and then you download an application that is 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.159
 droid x for you to get account 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.500
 directly from your smartphone or if you 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:36.759
 your future crimes screen will not have 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.490
 The secret here is for you to set 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.509
 be yourself if you have a game you put here 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.530
 huh 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:46.659
 click the keys you want it to 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.370
 obey when the game is running and 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.520
 then the game will run donkey is the same 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.610
 The process is you put an account 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.069
 existing agreement, you agree to the 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.529
 And then beauty ready, it's already good here. 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:03.219
 So this is it, folks, it's just for show. 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:07.870
 same as kia you can get a 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:11.830
 another is another alternative is case 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.139
 you are not productive or productive 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.750
 managed to install the blues taxi you have 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.340
 another alternative is the droid 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.770
 fourche soc 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.529
 It's the same thing understood only that it is 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.050
 much more basic he I believe it is 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:29.020
 much lighter than the bluestacks it already 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.969
 is herein predefined shortcuts ie 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.860
 You're not breaking his head so much and he's 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.199
 already makes things easier for you 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.729
 so the difference you will see in 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.300
 some games, right? 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.669
 here you can program the 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.529
 where they are going to stay and what 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.020
 keys that will activate them and which 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:49.389
 functions they will get in the blues taxi he 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.289
 is already preset so if it is missing 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.639
 option is going to be kind of difficult said 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.930
 adapt in-game 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:01.870
 but you still have one is that 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.599
 ability to control by smartphone that 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.479
 Then I'll be teaching and that's 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:09.699
 cool this idea then to start 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.680
 That's it for not being a video 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.839
 very large 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.719
 it was just to teach how to install 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:17.860
 you explore any doubt let us 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:22.349
 comments 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.349
 And that's it folks, be fine
