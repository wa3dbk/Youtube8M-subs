00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.499 
ones so I started with a peperomia and
this<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> bromeliad<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.340> broke<00:01:59.549> off<00:01:59.759> aim

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
this is a bromeliad that broke off aim

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.200 
this is a bromeliad that broke off aim
in<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:00.960> garden<00:02:01.430> but<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.790> filled<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
in my garden but I have filled it with a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.780 
in my garden but I have filled it with a
very<00:02:03.450> loose<00:02:03.719> potting<00:02:04.530> soil<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.729> is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
very loose potting soil and that this is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.340 
very loose potting soil and that this is
only<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.119> four-inch<00:02:06.479> plant<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.020> didn't<00:02:07.259> have

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
only a four-inch plant so I didn't have

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.350 
only a four-inch plant so I didn't have
to<00:02:07.469> dig<00:02:07.619> too<00:02:07.799> much<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.280> put<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.670> there

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
to dig too much I just put it in there

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.260 
to dig too much I just put it in there
and<00:02:09.599> then<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:10.319> topped<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:10.890> soil<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.819> then

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
and then I topped it with soil and then

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.460 
and then I topped it with soil and then
what<00:02:12.540> I've<00:02:12.660> done<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.110> I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
