this<00:04:07.669> game<00:04:07.729> but<00:04:08.419> it's<00:04:08.689> just<00:04:09.049> so<00:04:09.469> strange<00:04:10.099> to

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
this game but it's just so strange to

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.059 
this game but it's just so strange to
have<00:04:10.669> James<00:04:11.389> Bond<00:04:11.719> do<00:04:12.049> these<00:04:12.229> extravagant

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
have James Bond do these extravagant

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.270

flips<00:04:13.459> in<00:04:13.609> the<00:04:13.639> air<00:04:13.759> and<00:04:14.239> then<00:04:14.810> fight<00:04:15.590> snakes

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
flips in the air and then fight snakes

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.879 
flips in the air and then fight snakes
and<00:04:16.729> barrels<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:17.570> boxes<00:04:17.810> falling<00:04:18.440> on<00:04:18.560> him<00:04:18.769> and

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
and barrels and boxes falling on him and

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.629 
and barrels and boxes falling on him and
fish<00:04:19.549> it's<00:04:20.269> just<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:20.840> not<00:04:21.199> James<00:04:21.650> Bond<00:04:22.130> it's

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
fish it's just so not James Bond it's

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.850 
fish it's just so not James Bond it's
almost<00:04:22.909> like<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.210> cartoon<00:04:23.539> parody<00:04:24.169> of<00:04:24.560> James

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860

Bond<00:04:25.190> it's<00:04:25.639> like<00:04:25.849> a<00:04:25.880> Hot<00:04:26.360> Shots<00:04:26.779> version

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
wacky enemies the gameplay reminds me a

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.700 
wacky enemies the gameplay reminds me a
little<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.640> go-go<00:04:32.910> 13<00:04:33.570> just<00:04:33.810> with<00:04:34.110> much<00:04:34.470> better

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
little of go-go 13 just with much better

and all that jazz which is kind of

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.170 
and all that jazz which is kind of
consistent<00:04:46.800> because<00:04:47.100> there<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.550> music<00:04:47.970> in<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
consistent because there is music in the

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.380 
gameplay
maybe<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.860> game<00:04:53.040> would<00:04:53.400> be<00:04:53.550> better<00:04:53.790> with<00:04:54.180> some

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
maybe the game would be better with some

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.540 
maybe the game would be better with some
music<00:04:54.600> or<00:04:54.840> maybe<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.650> music<00:04:56.010> they<00:04:56.160> had<00:04:56.340> for

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
music or maybe the music they had for

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.430 
music or maybe the music they had for
the<00:04:56.640> game<00:04:56.790> was<00:04:56.910> so<00:04:57.120> bad<00:04:57.330> that<00:04:57.360> if<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.170> game<00:04:58.290> is

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
the game was so bad that if the game is

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.870 
the game was so bad that if the game is
better<00:04:58.590> off<00:04:58.860> without<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.250> music<00:04:59.550> who<00:04:59.700> knows

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
better off without the music who knows

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.030 
better off without the music who knows
but<00:05:00.300> yeah<00:05:00.780> that's<00:05:00.990> just<00:05:01.080> another<00:05:01.440> anomaly<00:05:01.800> of

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
but yeah that's just another anomaly of

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.460 
but yeah that's just another anomaly of
the<00:05:02.160> game<00:05:02.460> no<00:05:03.150> music<00:05:03.540> in<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.750> gameplay<00:05:03.930> for

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
the game no music in the gameplay for

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.350 
the game no music in the gameplay for
how<00:05:04.590> weird<00:05:04.920> this<00:05:05.100> game<00:05:05.370> is<00:05:05.550> it's<00:05:05.790> ultimately

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
how weird this game is it's ultimately

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.330 
how weird this game is it's ultimately
pretty<00:05:06.900> fun<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.590> probably<00:05:07.800> one<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.130> the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
pretty fun and probably one of the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.790 
pretty fun and probably one of the
better<00:05:08.640> game<00:05:09.390> Gear<00:05:09.690> games<00:05:09.960> but<00:05:10.260> then<00:05:10.470> again<00:05:10.620> I

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
better game Gear games but then again I

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.670 
better game Gear games but then again I
haven't<00:05:11.160> played<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.580> many<00:05:12.120> yet<00:05:12.540> James<00:05:13.320> Bond
