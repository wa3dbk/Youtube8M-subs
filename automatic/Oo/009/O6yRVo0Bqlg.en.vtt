about a thousand pounds more you could

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
buy a 2.7 diesel a for Audi estates but

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.550 
buy a 2.7 diesel a for Audi estates but
actually<00:04:26.120> has<00:04:26.270> less<00:04:26.449> brake<00:04:26.780> horsepower<00:04:27.289> than

I<00:04:35.320> think<00:04:36.320> mid-range<00:04:36.710> 508<00:04:37.490> would<00:04:38.389> complete

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
I think mid-range 508 would complete

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.120 
I think mid-range 508 would complete
more<00:04:40.849> with<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.470> Vauxhall<00:04:42.470> Insignia<00:04:42.650> now

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
more with the Vauxhall Insignia now

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.439 
more with the Vauxhall Insignia now
they're<00:04:43.280> quite<00:04:43.460> similar<00:04:43.729> in<00:04:44.030> terms<00:04:44.210> of

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
they're quite similar in terms of

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.550 
they're quite similar in terms of
dimension<00:04:45.320> burning<00:04:45.889> me<00:04:47.560> understanding

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
future with the 508 diesel is the

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.920 
future with the 508 diesel is the
greater<00:04:51.410> brake<00:04:51.919> horsepower<00:04:52.479> further<00:04:53.479> after

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
think P about it well for me it's not

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.480 
think P about it well for me it's not
practical<00:05:23.240> enough<00:05:23.780> as<00:05:23.990> in<00:05:24.110> this<00:05:24.229> Lane<00:05:24.530> I<00:05:24.860> mean

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
practical enough as in this Lane I mean

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.070

Barry reminding you driving a stay down

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.980 
Barry reminding you driving a stay down
here<00:05:27.319> yeah<00:05:28.780> it's<00:05:29.780> reduced<00:05:30.560> size<00:05:31.009> at<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.490> back

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
here yeah it's reduced size at the back

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.149 
here yeah it's reduced size at the back
and<00:05:32.990> then<00:05:33.199> imagine<00:05:33.349> you<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.770> me<00:05:33.860> else<00:05:33.949> get

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
and then imagine you and me else get

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.760 
and then imagine you and me else get
lots<00:05:34.699> of<00:05:34.819> things<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:35.300> he<00:05:35.389> would<00:05:35.659> to<00:05:36.470> me<00:05:36.590> it's
