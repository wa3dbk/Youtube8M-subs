00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.490
 Hi, welcome to the painting on the street. 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.130
 we talk about the development 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.430
 embryonic of animals 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.380
 I showed targeting with training 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.800
 the gastroplasty is the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.950
 to organize 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.980
 there I said that gastroplasty can not 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.060
 be different according to the 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.720
 animals 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.180
 In this class I want to show this difference. 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 I'm going to draw here first a 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.990
 young gastronomy that spent squid can 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.200
 go through some different paths 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:49.030
 there are animals that gastronomy is 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.630
 formed for example the interest 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.550
 the phylum so it was is the only edge that 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.079
 have animals that do not have 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.980
 during the period 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:06.119
 politicians do not go through the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.659
 gastro action but most animals 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.770
 the action is spent and there are 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:18.510
 two possibilities the first is when 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.920
 formation of two leaflets 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.400
 embryonic 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:30.340
 so I'm representing here in green 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.220
 the formation of the millionaire ectoderm 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.420
 external and here more internally in the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.590
 spent 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.290
 we have the in der in the then in this case 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.619
 as there were only two 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.150
 embryonic leaflets we say that 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:52.299
 these animals are plastic animals 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.780
 the only child of plastic animals is 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.830
 the thread of kylie Darius where the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.400
 jellyfish anemones in the other children 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.860
 spending does not occur during the 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.010
 the three germ layers 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.040
 ectoderm that is here again 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.830
 represented the endoderm of one here of 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.400
 yellow in the region 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:26.470
 year and in the intermediate region we have 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.330
 the same term as the formation of three 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.820
 embryonic leaflets 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:36.280
 we say that these animals are tri 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.250
 plastics and as I said excluding 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.950
 polyphenols and cnidarians the other yarns 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.470
 They are tri baste costs but this 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.040
 rating does not end here 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.200
 why the tri animals still spent us 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:56.950
 may be subdivided into this subdivision 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.820
 is related to the presence of a 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.510
 very important cavity that is called 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.390
 of being loma in a cavity full of 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.280
 and it is very important because it 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.330
 space for growth 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.550
 of the organs 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.520
 Furthermore it gives support for 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.959
 musculature functioning as skeleton 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.050
 hydrostatic and what are the 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.380
 ratings in relation to its UN in 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:34.110
 bonn there are animals that present 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:38.350
 only in der derba even the dermis and 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:42.130
 ectoderm without the breast seal these animals 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.330
 are called then already sealed beloved and 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.070
 as example we have the flatworms 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.620
 there are animals that have here the 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.070
 derman and the same theme 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.400
 only in the same hostel is a 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:02.380
 cavity and in this capacity 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:07.600
 there will be accumulation of liquid and that is from here 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:12.400
 what is the celomar notice that the sky mama 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.070
 is a cavity completely coated by the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.570
 even the dermis and here but externally 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:23.740
 is the ceiling to derma these animals are 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:27.479
 selected animals and example that 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.030
 we have the mollusc annelids 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:34.930
 echinoderms all these 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:39.310
 are selected and there is a 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.660
 type that presents the term and logo 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:47.230
 next is the seal mama 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:50.080
 note that these eluma are delimited 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.680
 endoderm is one that is here in the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.340
 region and also by the same 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.600
 the pink dermis and what is the 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:05.200
 then hector dermo like these and luma no 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.280
 is completely coated at least 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:13.210
 the dermis we say that these animals 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:16.180
 are perceived from the beloved seal and there 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.000
 only one thread with this characteristic 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.690
 which is the phylum nematoda the end of 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.150
 cinematerna myths and to finish want 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.300
 show only one type of classification 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.480
 and usually appears there in the vestibular 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.560
 I will draw that again to gastro 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.100
 young 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.010
 this internal cavity that gives gastro is 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.920
 called hot air is a 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.940
 digestive cavity 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.650
 there is the hole that is called the 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.460
 buzz topo 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:54.520
 This hole communicates between the 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.610
 architect and here the external environment 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.740
 from it we can classify the 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.980
 animals in two ways 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.970
 when this but top first gives rise to 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.480
 mouth 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:13.300
 we say that animals are pro 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:16.200
 tostones the personal tip is here in the name 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.350
 Why soon means first. 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:24.180
 primitive stoma means mouth then 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:30.090
 in this case the mouth is formed first 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:34.390
 only if the top gives rise to 11 years 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:38.380
 these animals are classified as 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:41.070
 I have the tonics, the mouth will originate 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.280
 then with embryonic development 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.430
 and 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.960
 right here and that we can and chordate 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:53.419
 the other children are deuter tones 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.360
 protons end up here with 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:59.810
 these characteristics and in the next class 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.580
 I'll do a review on all of them. 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.580
 do not lose until then
