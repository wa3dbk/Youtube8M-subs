00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:13.450
 Hernan Ariaga is one of the men 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.700
 most loving of the caribbean of the us because 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.759
 that's the guru of the mansions that says 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.010
 Javier we are not going to get into the world 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.039
 hernan's decorative arriaga with much 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.529
 glamor this is your house 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.570
 we have the concept here that is 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.599
 good goes with the floor that is already true 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.550
 can teach with a modern piece of furniture with 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.930
 straight lines also with a base 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.640
 old because good I always wanted 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.530
 accompany the original architecture of the 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.760
 good house this I'm not going to ask you 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.479
 because it's like that potato can not 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.640
 call nervous this decoration or you 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.400
 you eat effect increasing as you 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.650
 you eat it this way this table by 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.869
 example is a wonder is a tree 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.839
 have plants inside the house 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:00.519
 recommended always if the plant is 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.530
 happy is because the energy of the house 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.400
 is balanced to me it dries up on everything 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 and the cactus dries up 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:16.540
 I wanted to know your bed there is a problem 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.520
 that will be a hot bed in the fairies 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.130
 that puts the pillows then we go to 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.020
 see what down see what a wonder this is 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.210
 which is for example this is not this is 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:34.600
 chinchilla good controversial subject 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:36.520
 well let's not go into details like me 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.330
 designs on the walls that you have for 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.100
 course somewhere special are 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.080
 windows of an old church and are 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.760
 rescued from a demolition so 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.070
 good are very important elements in 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.410
 how much about architecture do you think 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.640
 that we were out of the closet 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.530
 is wrong now we enter gentlemen and 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.450
 look who marveled never seen a 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.520
 so glamorous closet this seems part 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.160
 from the carolina herrera store or the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.090

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.420
 things is an idea store 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.090
 If I asked you for a gold toilet 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.980
 you would be able to do everything good 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.970
 depends when you are willing to pay and 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.970
 it would not last for me 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.069
 another toilet like this to clean the 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.069
 things English is used a lot 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.540

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.330

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.330
