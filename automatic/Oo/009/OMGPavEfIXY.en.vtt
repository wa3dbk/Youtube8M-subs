00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.330 

60<00:00:58.510> now<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.570> wing<00:00:59.870> mirrors<00:01:00.260> are<00:01:00.590> very<00:01:00.649> narrow

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
60 now the wing mirrors are very narrow

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.600 
60 now the wing mirrors are very narrow
but<00:01:02.059> they're<00:01:02.270> long<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.040> that<00:01:04.040> length<00:01:04.250> makes

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
but they're long and that length makes

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.210 
but they're long and that length makes
up<00:01:04.850> for<00:01:05.059> that<00:01:05.089> narrow<00:01:05.479> part<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.860> vision<00:01:07.040> is

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
up for that narrow part so the vision is

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.649 
up for that narrow part so the vision is
actually<00:01:07.310> quite<00:01:07.729> good<00:01:07.760> and<00:01:08.390> they've<00:01:08.479> got<00:01:08.630> a

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
actually quite good and they've got a

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.450 
actually quite good and they've got a
healthy<00:01:09.260> blind<00:01:10.130> spots<00:01:11.710> pass<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.950> mirror<00:01:13.159> -

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
healthy blind spots pass the mirror -

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.370 
healthy blind spots pass the mirror -
which<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.820> very<00:01:14.060> useful<00:01:14.270> for<00:01:14.930> every<00:01:15.170> vehicle

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
the rearview vish is not bad the

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.480 
the rearview vish is not bad the
headrests<00:01:20.630> don't<00:01:20.900> really<00:01:21.470> obstruct<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.159> view

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
headrests don't really obstruct the view

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.290 
headrests don't really obstruct the view
at<00:01:23.420> all<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:23.899> that's<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.200> good<00:01:24.380> one<00:01:25.300> centers

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300

out nice and simply the dashboard is a

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.529

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
bit plasticky

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.540 
bit plasticky
but<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.229> doesn't<00:01:33.680> feel<00:01:33.800> that<00:01:33.860> bad<00:01:34.280> actually

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
but it doesn't feel that bad actually

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.540

normally<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.619> Japanese<00:01:36.619> cars<00:01:36.950> are<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.250> bit

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
normally the Japanese cars are a bit

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.790 
normally the Japanese cars are a bit
cheesy<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.810> tacky<00:01:39.080> on<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.470> inside

does<00:01:42.170> feel<00:01:42.410> a<00:01:42.470> bit<00:01:42.670> better<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.910> must<00:01:44.240> admit<00:01:44.539> it

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
does feel a bit better I must admit it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.440 
does feel a bit better I must admit it
looks<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.140> bit<00:01:45.170> better<00:01:45.440> -<00:01:45.920> if<00:01:46.850> anything<00:01:47.330> it

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
looks a bit better - if anything it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.300 
looks a bit better - if anything it
feels<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.780> bit<00:01:47.810> digital<00:01:48.410> walkush<00:01:48.920> when<00:01:49.220> I

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
feels a bit digital walkush when I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.539 
feels a bit digital walkush when I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
Japan now the ride itself is

Japan now the ride itself is

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
noise coming from the car at all except

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.479 
noise coming from the car at all except
for<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.640> noise<00:02:07.289> of<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.560> wheels<00:02:08.830> rolling<00:02:09.190> down

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
for the noise of the wheels rolling down

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.820 
for the noise of the wheels rolling down
the<00:02:09.610> road<00:02:09.819> I<00:02:10.149> am<00:02:10.629> aware<00:02:10.989> of<00:02:11.170> noise<00:02:11.379> underneath

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
the road I am aware of noise underneath

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.410 
the road I am aware of noise underneath
the<00:02:12.010> car<00:02:12.360> not<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> mechanical<00:02:14.049> noise<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.530> much

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the car not a mechanical noise so much

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.180 
the car not a mechanical noise so much
so<00:02:16.420> maybe<00:02:17.170> there<00:02:17.560> could<00:02:17.739> be<00:02:17.799> a<00:02:17.920> bit<00:02:18.160> more

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
so maybe there could be a bit more

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.330 
so maybe there could be a bit more
soundproofing<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.269> floor<00:02:19.540> pan<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:21.190> as

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
for the engine well I can't even hear it

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.680

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.010 

then<00:02:27.320> there's<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.680> bit<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.100> racket<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:28.670> it's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
then there's a bit of a racket but it's

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.080 
then there's a bit of a racket but it's
it's<00:02:30.020> not<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> big<00:02:30.440> engine<00:02:30.830> vehicle<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.670> small

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
it's not a big engine vehicle the small

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.670 
it's not a big engine vehicle the small
engines<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.630> have<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.840> make<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.020> big<00:02:33.230> noise<00:02:33.440> to

engines to have to make a big noise to
get<00:02:33.860> going<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.480> certainly<00:02:35.750> not

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
get going and it's certainly not

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.010 
get going and it's certainly not
excessive<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.970> steering<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.690> very

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
excessive the steering is very

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.810 
excessive the steering is very
responsive<00:02:39.890> actually<00:02:40.250> I'm<00:02:40.370> really<00:02:40.520> quite

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
responsive actually I'm really quite

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.620 
responsive actually I'm really quite
impressed<00:02:40.940> with<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:42.820> do<00:02:43.820> feel<00:02:44.270> like<00:02:44.300> I'm

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
impressed with it I do feel like I'm

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.770 
impressed with it I do feel like I'm
connecting<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.800> road<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.070> little<00:02:46.430> bit<00:02:46.780> it's

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
connecting to the road a little bit it's

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.050 
connecting to the road a little bit it's
more<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.440> more<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.100> road<00:02:49.340> connection<00:02:49.910> than

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
more of a more of a road connection than

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.280 
more of a more of a road connection than
a<00:02:50.090> power<00:02:50.360> steering<00:02:50.720> connection<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
a power steering connection and the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.560 
a power steering connection and the
power<00:02:54.920> steering<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.790> actually<00:02:56.090> quite<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.360> nice

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
power steering is actually quite a nice

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.630 
power steering is actually quite a nice
balance<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.440> find<00:02:57.740> with<00:02:57.920> some<00:02:58.130> vehicles<00:02:59.320> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
balance I find with some vehicles the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.360 
balance I find with some vehicles the
power<00:03:01.640> steering<00:03:02.000> can<00:03:02.330> be<00:03:02.620> just<00:03:03.620> too<00:03:03.800> much<00:03:04.070> so

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
power steering can be just too much so

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.070 
power steering can be just too much so
you<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.730> basically<00:03:05.180> fit<00:03:05.660> in<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.870> power

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
you just basically fit in the power

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.300 
you just basically fit in the power
steering<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.800> don't<00:03:06.980> want<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.160> feel

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
steering and you don't want to feel

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.770 
steering and you don't want to feel
completely<00:03:07.730> anesthetized<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.630> whole

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
I'm really quite impressed with how the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.710 
I'm really quite impressed with how the
road<00:03:17.510> how<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:17.990> car<00:03:18.350> sticks<00:03:18.710> to<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.950> road<00:03:19.130> it's

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
road how the car sticks to the road it's

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.900 
road how the car sticks to the road it's
it<00:03:20.720> floats<00:03:21.050> more<00:03:21.350> effortlessly<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.430> gear

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
it floats more effortlessly the gear

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.310 
it floats more effortlessly the gear
track<00:03:23.210> it<00:03:23.360> once<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.630> get<00:03:23.750> used<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
track it once you get used to the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.190 
track it once you get used to the
gearbox<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:25.630> you're<00:03:26.630> not<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:26.990> aggressive

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
gearbox and you're not so aggressive

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.530 
gearbox and you're not so aggressive
with<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.220> allow<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.610> car<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.000> develop

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
with it and you allow the car to develop

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.640 
with it and you allow the car to develop
speed<00:03:29.930> more<00:03:30.890> on<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.070> gradual<00:03:31.550> basis<00:03:32.060> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
speed more on a gradual basis the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.050 
speed more on a gradual basis the
transition<00:03:33.650> can<00:03:33.770> actually<00:03:34.070> be<00:03:34.220> very<00:03:34.459> nice<00:03:34.760> you

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
transition can actually be very nice you

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
from the engine which is a bit

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.100 
from the engine which is a bit
distracting<00:03:52.520> do<00:03:53.300> you<00:03:53.390> know<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.570> steering<00:03:53.959> I'd

I don't know whether this is because

connecting with my environment at all I

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.480 
connecting with my environment at all I
feel<00:05:03.220> like<00:05:03.370> I'm<00:05:03.550> in<00:05:03.669> a<00:05:03.729> plastic<00:05:04.150> bubble<00:05:04.419> and

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.570 

it<00:05:07.789> doesn't<00:05:08.300> seem<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:09.139> have<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.470> harmony<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.520> I

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
it doesn't seem to have a harmony that I

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.980 
it doesn't seem to have a harmony that I
would<00:05:10.849> have<00:05:10.970> been<00:05:11.150> so<00:05:11.360> ceated<00:05:11.810> with<00:05:11.960> Honda

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
would have been so ceated with Honda

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.930 
would have been so ceated with Honda
it's<00:05:14.990> almost<00:05:15.289> a<00:05:15.470> bit<00:05:15.650> too<00:05:15.919> efficient<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.729> only

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
it's almost a bit too efficient the only

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.879 
it's almost a bit too efficient the only
other<00:05:17.270> cars<00:05:17.599> I<00:05:17.780> can<00:05:17.810> think<00:05:18.139> of<00:05:18.380> that<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.620> like

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
so much power steering there's so much

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.520 
so much power steering there's so much
electrical<00:05:28.599> contribution<00:05:29.599> to<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.870> driving

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
electrical contribution to the driving

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.279 
electrical contribution to the driving
that<00:05:30.710> you<00:05:31.490> drive<00:05:31.789> down<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.210> road<00:05:32.419> you<00:05:32.690> you

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.770 
bubble so I get the same sort of thing
with<00:05:39.979> this<00:05:40.099> car<00:05:40.430> I<00:05:40.819> would<00:05:41.240> say<00:05:41.389> to<00:05:41.449> anybody
