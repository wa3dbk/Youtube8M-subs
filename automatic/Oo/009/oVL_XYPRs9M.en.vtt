to artists and with that it's like I

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.220 
to artists and with that it's like I
produced<00:00:17.070> every<00:00:17.400> record<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.480> mixtape<00:00:18.869> so

produced every record on the mixtape so
I<00:00:19.500> was<00:00:19.949> still<00:00:20.400> producing<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.119> making<00:00:21.390> all

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
I was still producing and making all

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.720 
I was still producing and making all
these<00:00:21.630> beats<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.859> had<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> bunch<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.609> these

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
these beats and I had a bunch of these

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.070 
these beats and I had a bunch of these
left<00:00:23.939> over<00:00:24.180> from<00:00:24.300> not<00:00:24.539> really<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.960> know

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
left over from not really you know

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.050 
left over from not really you know
getting<00:00:25.470> any<00:00:25.650> placements<00:00:26.279> say<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> was<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
getting any placements say I was a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.029 
getting any placements say I was a
little<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.660> really<00:00:27.769> angry<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:28.949> it

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
little not really angry but it

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.400 
little not really angry but it
definitely<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.609> gave<00:00:29.789> me<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.289> motivation<00:00:31.289> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
definitely it gave me that motivation I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.590 
definitely it gave me that motivation I
felt<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.769> needed<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.099> prove<00:00:32.369> something

and<00:01:48.240> away<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.860> doing<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.579> did<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and away and it doing what it did the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.630 
and away and it doing what it did the
first<00:01:51.119> week<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> me<00:01:52.259> being<00:01:52.500> proud<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
first week and me being proud of it the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
first week and me being proud of it the
next<00:01:54.360> step<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.630> could<00:01:54.780> take<00:01:54.899> independently

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
next step I could take independently

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.889 
next step I could take independently
would<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.369> only<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.090> mix<00:01:57.450> tape<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
would have to only be a mix tape and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.170 
would have to only be a mix tape and
then<00:01:58.110> another<00:01:58.469> independent<00:01:58.799> album<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.490> while

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
then another independent album and while

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.030 
then another independent album and while
I<00:02:00.210> try<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> work<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.049> other<00:02:01.200> bigger<00:02:01.500> things<00:02:01.799> but

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
I try to work on other bigger things but

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.709 
I try to work on other bigger things but
that<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.460> probably<00:02:02.610> take<00:02:02.969> way<00:02:03.240> longer<00:02:03.270> than

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
that will probably take way longer than

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.170 
that will probably take way longer than
if<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.770> had<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.040> machine<00:02:05.399> behind<00:02:05.610> me<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.119> just

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
if I had the machine behind me and just

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.900 
if I had the machine behind me and just
an<00:02:06.840> extra<00:02:07.229> steroids<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.489> push<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
an extra steroids to just push it and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.529 
an extra steroids to just push it and
take<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> next<00:02:09.420> level<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.050> take<00:02:10.349> it

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
take it to the next level and take it

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.080 
take it to the next level and take it
to<00:02:10.629> you<00:02:10.929> know<00:02:11.019> take<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.260> further<00:02:11.560> without

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
to you know take it further without

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.300 
to you know take it further without
changing<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.239> momentum<00:02:13.719> or<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.739> quality<00:02:15.280> or

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
changing the momentum or the quality or

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.539 
changing the momentum or the quality or
the<00:02:15.459> consistency<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:16.510> that's<00:02:17.079> why<00:02:17.319> we<00:02:17.709> stayed

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
the consistency and that's why we stayed

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.920 
the consistency and that's why we stayed
independent<00:02:19.060> long<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.359> wasn't<00:02:19.629> like<00:02:19.719> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
independent long it wasn't like the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.899 
independent long it wasn't like the
label<00:02:20.319> offers<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:20.980> came<00:02:21.219> after<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
label offers just came after the

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.280 
label offers just came after the
independent<00:02:22.329> out<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.569> they<00:02:22.629> came<00:02:22.810> before<00:02:22.959> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
independent out and they came before the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.470 
independent out and they came before the
independent<00:02:23.739> album<00:02:23.920> also<00:02:24.069> but<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:25.239> show

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
independent album also but the show

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.110 
independent album also but the show
improved<00:02:25.900> from<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.950> independent<00:02:27.189> how<00:02:27.579> gave

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
improved from the independent how gave

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.149 
improved from the independent how gave
us<00:02:28.329> more<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.659> that<00:02:28.810> creative<00:02:29.260> control<00:02:29.590> which

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
us more of that creative control which

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.759 
us more of that creative control which
is<00:02:30.430> all<00:02:30.879> I<00:02:30.909> really<00:02:31.060> look<00:02:31.480> for<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:32.319> I<00:02:32.349> weren't

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
is all I really look for that I weren't

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.199 
is all I really look for that I weren't
from<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.069> label<00:02:33.459> more<00:02:33.640> than<00:02:33.819> that<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.150> know

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
from the label more than that you know

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.550 
from the label more than that you know
backing<00:02:34.689> and<00:02:34.840> everything<00:02:35.079> but<00:02:35.200> I'm<00:02:35.349> really

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
backing and everything but I'm really

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.929 
backing and everything but I'm really
just<00:02:35.769> more<00:02:35.950> concerned<00:02:36.159> about<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.670> creative

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
just more concerned about the creative

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.940 
just more concerned about the creative
control<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.359> being<00:02:37.569> able<00:02:37.689> to<00:02:37.900> do<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.709> same

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
control and being able to do the same

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.929 
control and being able to do the same
thing<00:02:39.849> but<00:02:40.180> have<00:02:40.540> them<00:02:40.840> do<00:02:41.139> even<00:02:41.500> more<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:42.280> it's

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
thing but have them do even more so it's

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.369 
thing but have them do even more so it's
like<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.299> still<00:02:43.510> get<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.750> do<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.959> same<00:02:44.139> thing

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
like I still get to do the same thing

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.410 
like I still get to do the same thing
and<00:02:44.500> work<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.829> same<00:02:45.010> way<00:02:45.069> but<00:02:45.879> they<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.329> know

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and work the same way but they you know

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.330 
and work the same way but they you know
saying<00:02:46.720> work<00:02:47.139> even<00:02:47.379> harder<00:02:47.409> for<00:02:47.829> me<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.159> I

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
saying work even harder for me and I

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.800 
saying work even harder for me and I

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
Hollywood so it really wasn't something

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
rap because the game definitely did a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.559 
rap because the game definitely did a
good<00:03:41.769> job<00:03:41.829> of<00:03:42.040> proving<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.669> lyrical<00:03:43.060> side<00:03:43.239> but

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
side to the mainstream side and not let

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.539 
side to the mainstream side and not let
a<00:04:09.340> hook<00:04:09.699> or<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.900> beat<00:04:11.259> take<00:04:11.590> over<00:04:11.919> the<00:04:12.129> verses

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
a hook or the beat take over the verses

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.099 
a hook or the beat take over the verses
more<00:04:12.790> because<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.359> just<00:04:13.389> it<00:04:13.720> doesn't<00:04:13.900> make

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
more because that just it doesn't make

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.839 
more because that just it doesn't make
any<00:04:14.290> sense<00:04:14.470> when<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:15.040> hook<00:04:15.189> is<00:04:15.340> repetitive

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
any sense when the hook is repetitive

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.060 
any sense when the hook is repetitive
and<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.780> can<00:04:16.930> get<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.500> all<00:04:17.650> right<00:04:17.829> but

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
and you can get it and all right but

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.949 
and you can get it and all right but
who's<00:04:18.459> why<00:04:18.940> are<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.120> not<00:04:19.329> listening<00:04:19.539> to<00:04:19.870> the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
who's why are you not listening to the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.259 
who's why are you not listening to the
verses<00:04:20.289> because<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:20.769> just<00:04:20.919> like

so<00:04:21.509> much<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.959> bothers<00:04:22.379> me<00:04:22.410> whenever<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:22.919> hear

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
so much it bothers me whenever I hear

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.610 
so much it bothers me whenever I hear
records<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.759> people<00:04:24.479> say<00:04:24.690> anybody<00:04:25.199> could

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:27.569 
have got on that and did it because

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:28.939 
have got on that and did it because
we're<00:04:27.720> hooking<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.050> beat<00:04:28.259> and<00:04:28.470> it's<00:04:28.710> like

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
that takes away from the wreck and it

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.629 
that takes away from the wreck and it
just<00:04:31.319> takes<00:04:31.500> away<00:04:31.650> from<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.860> artist<00:04:32.250> too<00:04:32.460> and
