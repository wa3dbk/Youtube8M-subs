 growth games today's release 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.119
 dedicated to total sadness and despondency I 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.219
 I chose a very different game for review 

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.609
 why did it happen that they all 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.419
 thanks to me depression made 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.499
 grow bangs smear black 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:32.430
 lipstick 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.250
 nevertheless today in the issue of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.190
 game Nevsky gigabit thoroughbred 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.440
 attacks that time of this phrase works 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.100
 Stalin's individual personalities taught experience to and 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.440
 schizoid fedotov whose zhirinovsky 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.730
 ordered to shoot in 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.540
 the hallway 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.650
 and the last rule aleshin from operas 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.260
 Released in 2009 and on the figure of 2010 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.180
 title 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.100
 I remind you that the transfer is 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.550
 exclusively entertaining 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.960
 character and not intended 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 offend anyone 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.290
 so nasty bit type I honestly with 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.310
 I hardly understand that this type of bit 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.650
 more precisely 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.520
 I have 1 100 womenâ€™s cabin association 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.670
 classic 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.409
 and why is he Nevsky for me too 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.550
 no ideas 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.110
 what does petersburg have to do with it 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.680
 or perhaps a great commander 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.930
 hard to say look caught 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.170
 points 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.580
 my boy 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.980
 will smith maybe i remember she played in 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.300
 movie bad boys 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.109
 mummy 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:35.970
 I would give a penalty 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.990
 there are dead I was still there 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.220
 what happens during the billing period 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.830
 no of course i know the answer to this question i 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.010
 he himself has repeatedly participated genital 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.210
 perversions 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.000
 but what the hell 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.860
 why it should be on objects 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.310
 ridicule in a computer game 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.050
 mock years at all 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.910
 why is it done what's the joke I'm honest i 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.010
 I can not understand perfectly 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.280
 I imagine that there is such a genre that 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.990
 one of its constituents was wrong 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.170
 is a woman swinging huge 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.919
 human like robot 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.110
 network issue 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.330
 makes us play for some carte 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.649
 pot-bellied pervert 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:15.969
 contract slippers however for tanning 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.199
 back your words about what he is 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.199
 returns such points can walk 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.149
 only 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.449
 In the deputyâ€™s receptionist I think you even 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:24.519
 what looks like 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.659
 Well, well, let's see what of yourself 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.409
 represents the gameplay after so much 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.159
 enchanting screensaver 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.540
 white shawls look what i don't 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.849
 I look at them polygons did not regret 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.349
 Dostoevsky crime 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.309
 punishment 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.249
 around every form 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.969
 interesting allusion 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.629
 Does it seem to want to create us? 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.449
 immediately show that they are cool guys 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:46.729
 which there are no compromises which 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.519
 long ago will show the world the middle finger 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.410
 because 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.220
 for example from mentioning Nevsky 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.460
 name but everyone knows that Alexander Nevsky 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.539
 such as canonized saints 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.129
 and what did the CDs of reforms 100 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.949
 composer dostoevsky have come 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.119
 next to porn and members 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.969
 also quite difficult to understand 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:06.779
 but of course I was joking about 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.829
 composers banana caspia itself 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.169
 No shit yourself and so what did free 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:12.909
 cashbox 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.839
 it's pretty funny because i like it 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.569
 time was mcdonalds point and then 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.609
 I was fired for regular fights with 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.989
 by visitors the fact is that I beat 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.359
 everyone who came there with lifeguards and 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.229
 I got 1200 firefighters out of fire 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:29.319
 look in this game you can kill attendants 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.439
 she smoothly 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.799
 I have never been a moral colonel but 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.059
 seeing such chemistry is pretty painful 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.329
 first of all the graphics that are here of course 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.419
 completely cyrish level in general 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.430
 create and baku killing group but I 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.539
 I think it should be something like 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.669
 food you go to the subway and then suddenly 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.879
 grandma comes up and says yielded 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.999
 she has a son and she has a huge court 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.659
 Such a picture of 100 furnaces I have many times already 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.639
 our people talked about this not me 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.419
 ceases this resents it was not 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.649
 ceases to be very helpful finally I 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:04.279
 I understood the fact that it means a crime book 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:05.619
 punishment 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:09.889
 on there became now I understood from me even her 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.629
 price but I'm not funny 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.859
 because playing this is the most interesting 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.709
 and when our developers will understand 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.650
 what 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.079
 advanced melee combat system 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.650
 the beginning of it sucks shooters 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.889
 look fluff roo judging by the effect as 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.009
 this water and energy 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.620
 the drinks 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.919
 who so adore schoolchildren 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.659
 baku on the principle then grandmas live well 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.340
 all this hand-to-hand battle is important 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.710
 bullshit and on the hero right away should be 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.130
 weapons or combat should be ok 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.960
 because I donâ€™t get there 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.009
 hijacking is impossible here is the second attack on 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.119
 long and does not kill the first time 

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:52.019
 even with china choose when you get up and 

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:53.999
 threw klyuvert faster but still 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.509
 spend a few strokes move away from 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.819
 rival impossible all this is very him 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.349
 done that hard and rebuilt 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.610
 play ap 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.159
 more bullying is that besides 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.300
 kulaks platt facto 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.509
 general melee weapons 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.940
 quite a lot of hide and seek has come to us not 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.340
 I need to 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.259
 abandon his novel arkadyevich 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.440
 leave for bread to resell it what 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.800
 someday idiot december 5th brick 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.520
 why am I so crucified about it 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.530
 hand-to-hand fight because of another silence 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.830
 The pressure of the patriot was the same 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.710
 in the hall were quite complex and 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.740
 boring 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.000
 even in the roof is much more interesting 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.300
 run
