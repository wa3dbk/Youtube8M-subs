00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.230
 ah 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.830
 and the kids that are here are you 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.690
 I bring a new guide you have chosen a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.910
 new weapon all were from hk price 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.130
 we choose your particular merger and it's the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.770
 vp 45 a weapon that is an authentic 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.270
 You will understand why and how 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.100
 we will always start knowing the weapon 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.870
 but since he's German, calm guys 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.690
 I bring you the Germans and the beer 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.370
 I know you were missing them 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.250
 as you all know hk is the manufacturer and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.190
 the designer of mp 45 and that is that in 1990 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.660
 hk looks for a successor of mp 5m 5k 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.830
 goal of designing a submachine gun that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.449
 had a caliber greater than the rest 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.860
 that there was in the market and from there it came out 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.510
 the vp with all its variants 945 141 9 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.890
 these three variants have different 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.650
 caliber being the greater the increase 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.809
 45 since it uses the 45 acp caliber that is 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.210
 the same of the m19 11 then there would be a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.589
 ep 40 and the smaller caliber would be an ep 9 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.000
 which is a 9 millimeters like other 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.739
 Anyone who has been more 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.659
 Attentive to the guides you will know that the more 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.549
 caliber greater recoil then the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.110
 only way to make more controllable 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.909
 this type of weapons would lower the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 cadence and that what I did in an angel 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.720
 they were cars the vp 45 has a cadence 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.280
 of 600 bullets per minute one of the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.120
 lower cadences in their rifles but 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.560
 Clear 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.170
 with the great power that the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.030
 caliber 45 and java this I call the spear 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.620
 melons because the 45 caliber is very 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.080
 big here you have a photo that 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.550
 compare with the 40 caliber of which already 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.410
 I spoke and with a 9 millimeter there is a 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.480
 very big difference and that is that this is 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.040
 Unlike detail in his 45 mp 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.450
 caliber has such a large caliber that 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.980
 has a very powerful recoil a 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.270
 pretty low cadence but a very bad damage 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.750
 high and this is going to be noticed in the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.430
 battlefield 3 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.810
 good people this time you can not complain 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.430
 in the history class it has been quite 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.920
 short so come on we started with 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.630
 the numbers the cadence of 945 is 600 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.430
 bullets per minute the lowest rate 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.050
 but his rifles and one of the lowest 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.000
 of the game so here we already have a 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.190
 Handicap a handicap that is balanced 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.080
 with its great damage that is 34% to quarters 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.240
 distances and 12.5 when we get to the 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.619
 40 meters that is between 0 and 25 meters 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.869
 this weapon is lethal since it only needs 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.430
 three or four bullets to kill and although 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.600
 have a low rate because those three or 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.120
 four bullets will come out very fast 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.950
 others will need between 5 and 6 and the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.780
 submachine as 6 or 7 so be 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.550
 realize that this short range weapon is 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.690
 lethal its recharge speed is very 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.940
 good with a that of a bullet in the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.560
 bedroom that is 185 seconds a 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.570
 pretty short interval to recharge 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.130
 but when the weapon is empty it takes 2.7 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.959
 seconds and this is a problem because 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.760
 He only has 26 bullets and he also does not have 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.200
 extended charger then we have to 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.640
 be very careful to manage the 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.470
 ammunition because even though it has 600 bullets 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.270
 per minute we spend many times that 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.530
 we will stay at zero and take 2.7 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.450
 seconds to recharge which leaves us 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.040
 quite some time in balls last 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.570
 we analyze your precision data we see 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.100
 which is a very precise weapon but with a 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.510
 vertical kick very strong in addition 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.489
 has a first bullet multiplier 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.480
 of two like 75 is to say the first bullet 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.159
 will have a setback of almost 3 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.209
 the normal kick so have this 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.480
 in mind the first bullet there is that 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.010
 control it a lot 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.450
 but let's stop with concepts 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.830
 theoretical and let's go to practice 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.510
 when we try it we realize 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.860
 that being very precise with her is not 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.790
 can fail many rods since only 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.440
 has six hundred bullets per minute 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.060
 then we have a very short lapse of 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.680
 time to hit all the bullets 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.330
 also if we move a lot the look 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.799
 we will miss many bullets, not because 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.269
 be half on top of the guy but because 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.470
 do not square we have the bullet output with 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.299
 the moment we have the look 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.830
 so do not get nervous point 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.569
 little by little because it happens to me a lot 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.099
 that to be able to move me a lot 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.959
 look and miss a lot of bullets with weapons 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.790
 of little cadence so have this in 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.890
 also counts the range of this weapon of 0 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.709
 25 meters as I told you there is lethal 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.510
 with its 35% damage per bullet is a 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.129
 brutal to use this weapon those distances 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.379
 then we have to raze to get closer 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.910
 much the target and killed from close 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.440
 you shoot long distance though 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.910
 it also works pretty well in these 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.379
 cases but where you have to pay more 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.730
 attention is in the management of ammunition 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.109
 although it has a very low rate 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.640
 many times we will run out of bullets 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.989
 then you have to know when to press 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.269
 or when we have to hide for 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.040
 recharge I would recommend that before 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.720
 use this weapon if you are 'novices' you try 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.099
 the 2000 app since it has more or less the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.540
 same numbers and it works more or less 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.459
 same with a cadence they hurt a 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.840
 little bit high but you do not have the problem 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.400
 of the ammunition management you can go 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.790
 raseando like crazy because you have 40 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.890
 bullets 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.420
 the loader extended then first 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.280
 practice with the 2000 pepa 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.349
 you can pass to a man 45 who has 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.760
 more damage and for me it is much better weapons 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.349
 if you want if you're a newbie and do not give 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.579
 elephant action starts with pp 2000 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.719
 because you will miss many bullets but 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.549
 you also have many bullets in the 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.709
 charger and if you're a very precise uncle 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.970
 take it mp 45 because count a bullet and 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.400
 average in the head is enough to 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.989
 kill anyone as to the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.190
 Accessories I recommend 3 to start 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.259
 the muffler at short distances 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.419
 when you are going to be I tell you between 0 and 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.039
 15 meters or even 20 meters you can 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.539
 use the muffler since it is going to 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.310
 allow flanking very easy and do 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.810
 authentic butchers this weapon makes 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.580
 a lot of damage we need few bullets to 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.050
 kill and with the silencer it will be 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.880
 very easy to kill them all 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.320
 apart from this you have to bring also 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.789
 the laser looks always the look to be 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.620
 you are always going to make me carry and 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.180
 you will ask why and it is because both 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.500
 accessories that I recommend you are in 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.000
 suppressor silencers put a 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.289
 little bit in hip precision and 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.240
 short distances this is going to fuck 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.919
 enough so we need the look 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.210
 laser to balance this loss that 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.639
 gives us both the flash suppressor 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.930
 like the muffler on maps where there is a 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.009
 medium distance we have to go with his 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.630
 fire dam a sidewalk that the 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.099
 silenced here is a lot of ramps already 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.020
 this weapon has a pretty short range 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.669
 so I already tell you half-average maps 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.240
 short you can use the suppressor of 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.009
 flash for 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.630
 less vertical recoil and so have a 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.610
 a little bit more precision and power 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.710
 shoot at a little longer ranges 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.180
 I already told you that this weapon is very short 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.349
 so if we go with silencers only 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.419
 we can use it in meters or even 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.860
 rooms so on other maps we will have 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.330
 to use it with its flash dam in 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.009
 As for the sights, you can use sights of 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.479
 short range the metal sight but not 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.840
 pass on the side from now on 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.840
 nor of coña 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.890
 as for the style that we will have to 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.540
 use to get the most out of gun juices 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.520
 it is very clear we have to devastate 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.440
 bitches I tell you that where it's lethal is 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.150
 between 0 and 25 meters then we have to 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.670
 run to find those people to that 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.650
 distance of 0 25 meters so already 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.210
 You know how to run a lot of damage 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.530
 will allow us to kill with very few 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.600
 bullets but its cadence will force us 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.610
 to be very precise so if you're a 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.050
 Real to be quite precise I recommend you 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.700
 that you use this weapon does not help us 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.280
 this weapon to get behind a 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.870
 coverage or cover a position for that 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.550
 better an assault rifle better a 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.900
 light machine gun many weapons 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.760
 they are better than this to be behind 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.740
 of a coverage although at the beginning 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.360
 it seems that with that big damage can 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.040
 serve for long distances but it 's 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.290
 that the 40 meters and that damage is 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.970
 turns 12.5 into very small damage and 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.010
 with 600 bullets per minute is very difficult 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.020
 kill someone at 12% we have to give 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.610
 seven bullets when we take to give him 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.160
 seven bullets to an uncle over 40 meters 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.110
 like a submachine gun quite a lot so 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.430
 you already know how to run very much with this weapon 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.130
 I do not want to see the unemployed I do not want to see 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.200
 to a guy with a co x 4 with 945 already 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.030
 I have seen this weapon is for running 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.050
 a lot to jump like crazy and to 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.050
 have a lot of fun 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.650
 and good kids as conclusion to whom 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.090
 I recommend this weapon because I tell you 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.560
 to people that are very accurate though 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.210
 you can go running you have to be very 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.919
 accurate if you're a novice not things this 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.830
 weapon is going to be much easier to use 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.389
 a mp7 unam and 5k but that is that 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.639
 so low cadence that has forces you to 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.690
 be very precise and also has very few 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.730
 bullets which forces you to think 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.380
 continuously when I charge when 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.940
 new where can I get if you find 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.690
 Three guys is very fucked up 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.560
 alive 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.120
 you have to have a minimum of 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.470
 experience to be able to get him played this 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.760
 weapon since you have to know how to franchise 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.650
 that to be very precise you have to know 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.450
 managing bullets is not a simple weapon 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.800
 to use although many people are capable of 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.660
 kill with this weapon or any number 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.130
 who carries it can kill you once but 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.200
 he can not make good games since he 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.330
 it costs a lot to kill two followed kill 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.950
 to three say it costs a lot to know when to 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.660
 recharge then although there's a lot 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.040
 novice with this weapon the truth is that no 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.660
 they take out all the game that should be 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.310
 to draw so if you're a rookie 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.080
 start at 2020 pp by taking him 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.630
 precision to 600 bullets weapons by 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.460
 650 minute and if you're an uncle that hits 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.620
 all in your head you know the number 45 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.900
 is your gun a melon with this gossip 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.400
 is the host is a bullet and a half 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.020
 in the head is enough to burst 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.820
 to anyone I hope you liked it 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.139
 this melon spear guide is the 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.909
 next will be the m3 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.499
 and the next one that we will analyze at the end 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:45.150
 we will analyze all the weapons so 

00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:47.999
 stop asking for weapons that are outside 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.949
 the list if you did not know what weapon was playing 

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:51.389

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:54.960
 next and if you're watching this from
