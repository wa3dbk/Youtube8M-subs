00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.760 
wonder he will attack with the ball and
basically<00:02:31.340> forcing<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.879> predictable

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:50.940 

shall<00:02:39.490> I<00:02:39.520> use<00:02:39.730> my<00:02:39.910> operated<00:02:40.390> on

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
units in the world three millions is

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.940 
units in the world three millions is
already<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.450> lot<00:03:04.690> while<00:03:05.379> I'm<00:03:05.500> pushing<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:05.860> little

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
already a lot while I'm pushing a little

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.620 
already a lot while I'm pushing a little
bit<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.250> damage<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.910> I'm<00:03:07.000> forcing<00:03:07.450> him

bit the damage you and I'm forcing him

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.540 
bit the damage you and I'm forcing him
to<00:03:07.660> kill<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.500> usually<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.069> save<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.400> for

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
to kill it usually the save it for

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.080 
to kill it usually the save it for
tribes<00:03:09.849> in<00:03:10.750> ball<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.580> that's<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.790> way<00:03:13.030> too

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
tribes in ball and that's the way too

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.210 
tribes in ball and that's the way too
much<00:03:13.330> damage<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.930> would<00:03:14.080> get<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:15.099> I'm

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
much damage you would get so I'm

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.920 
much damage you would get so I'm
basically<00:03:15.430> forcing<00:03:16.030> him<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.209> camera<00:03:16.569> comes<00:03:16.810> on

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
basically forcing him to camera comes on

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.410 
basically forcing him to camera comes on
to<00:03:17.080> them<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.500> hope<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:18.670> does<00:03:18.790> not<00:03:18.819> pass<00:03:19.120> on<00:03:19.239> this

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
to them I hope it does not pass on this

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.490 
to them I hope it does not pass on this
year<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:22.060> basically<00:03:22.569> now<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.720> know<00:03:22.870> he<00:03:23.200> doesn't

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.470 

so<00:03:26.500> even<00:03:26.739> if<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.920> point<00:03:27.430> out<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.790> hymen<00:03:28.150> ever

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
so even if you point out the hymen ever

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:39.259 
so even if you point out the hymen ever
bought<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.049> can<00:03:30.010> trade<00:03:30.310> with<00:03:30.340> half<00:03:30.819> of<00:03:30.970> it

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.479 

let's<00:03:40.269> take<00:03:40.720> fructose<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.230> first<00:03:41.650> just<00:03:42.370> have

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
let's take fructose the first just have

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:55.460 
let's take fructose the first just have
to<00:03:42.610> sacrifice

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.290 

so<00:03:56.470> now<00:03:56.590> i<00:03:56.620> can<00:03:56.740> even<00:03:57.010> kill<00:03:57.459> off<00:03:57.550> I<00:03:58.000> mean

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
so now i can even kill off I mean

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.570 
so now i can even kill off I mean
effectively<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:59.170> would<00:03:59.620> have<00:03:59.740> also<00:03:59.890> set<00:04:00.160> up<00:04:00.340> for

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
effectively I would have also set up for

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.320 
effectively I would have also set up for
the<00:04:00.640> hymen<00:04:01.000> no<00:04:03.090> most<00:04:04.090> likely<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.600> freezing<00:04:05.110> trip

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
the hymen no most likely a freezing trip

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:24.820 
the hymen no most likely a freezing trip
so<00:04:07.330> I'll<00:04:07.480> just<00:04:07.510> play<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.900> tongue

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:33.469 

sales<00:04:25.830> what<00:04:26.430> are<00:04:26.639> I<00:04:31.699> can<00:04:32.699> sign<00:04:32.880> up<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.120> town<00:04:33.300> is

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
sales what are I can sign up the town is

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.420 
sales what are I can sign up the town is

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
that some problem I can get my Argus

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.610 
that some problem I can get my Argus
back<00:04:35.699> if<00:04:36.540> it<00:04:36.690> doesn't<00:04:36.840> come<00:04:37.050> come<00:04:37.260> on<00:04:37.380> it

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
think it's around seventy-five percent

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.390 
think it's around seventy-five percent
chance<00:06:19.570> that<00:06:19.750> it's<00:06:19.990> a<00:06:20.080> freezing<00:06:20.470> trap<00:06:20.620> haha

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
chance that it's a freezing trap haha

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.840 
chance that it's a freezing trap haha
job<00:06:23.040> yeah<00:06:24.040> I<00:06:24.250> think<00:06:24.430> only<00:06:24.730> 25<00:06:26.310> good<00:06:27.310> play<00:06:27.580> at

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850

job yeah I think only 25 good play at
second<00:06:28.360> exposition<00:06:30.600> so<00:06:31.600> I<00:06:32.050> don't<00:06:32.350> even<00:06:32.470> know

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
second exposition so I don't even know

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.100 
second exposition so I don't even know
if<00:06:32.650> you<00:06:32.770> play<00:06:32.950> small<00:06:33.160> tribes<00:06:36.780> this<00:06:37.780> actually<00:06:37.960> a

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
if you play small tribes this actually a

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.870 
if you play small tribes this actually a
chance<00:06:38.380> i<00:06:38.650> would<00:06:38.770> say<00:06:38.950> like<00:06:39.130> fifty<00:06:39.610> percent

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
chance i would say like fifty percent

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.550 
chance i would say like fifty percent
that<00:06:40.030> he<00:06:40.180> actually<00:06:40.390> doesn't<00:06:40.690> have<00:06:40.930> more<00:06:41.230> traps

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
that he actually doesn't have more traps

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.110 
that he actually doesn't have more traps
but<00:06:42.040> you<00:06:42.160> could<00:06:42.310> have<00:06:42.460> like<00:06:42.640> a<00:06:42.670> snake<00:06:42.910> or

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
but you could have like a snake or

but you could have like a snake or
something

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:01.660 

because<00:06:56.530> I'm<00:06:57.530> pushing<00:06:57.890> for<00:06:58.040> damage

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.550 

half<00:07:02.060> of<00:07:02.270> it<00:07:02.450> like<00:07:02.630> he<00:07:02.750> can<00:07:02.900> use<00:07:03.080> a<00:07:03.110> second<00:07:03.470> one

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
half of it like he can use a second one

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.560 
half of it like he can use a second one
too<00:07:03.680> smart<00:07:03.950> to<00:07:04.160> kill<00:07:04.310> upon<00:07:04.520> all<00:07:04.670> move<00:07:05.060> I<00:07:05.330> would
