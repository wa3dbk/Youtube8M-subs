00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.129 

I'm<00:00:12.330> off<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.719> ladder

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
I'm off the ladder

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.260 
I'm off the ladder
oh<00:00:19.039> he's<00:00:20.039> there<00:00:20.220> okay<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> need<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.970> use<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
oh he's there okay I need to use the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.330 
oh he's there okay I need to use the
coin<00:00:21.510> though<00:00:21.689> before<00:00:21.840> he<00:00:21.960> gets<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.260> me<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.740> don't

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
coin though before he gets to me I don't

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.769 
coin though before he gets to me I don't
know<00:00:23.430> if<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.609> taxed<00:00:23.939> my<00:00:24.119> gear<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:24.539> then

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
know if it's taxed my gear but then

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.609 
know if it's taxed my gear but then
theory<00:00:25.019> should<00:00:25.260> improve<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.680> operate<00:00:27.619> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
theory should improve it to operate the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.749 
theory should improve it to operate the
causative<00:00:29.070> risk<00:00:29.310> that's<00:00:29.609> not<00:00:29.760> good

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
causative risk that's not good

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.430 
causative risk that's not good
they<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.450> club<00:00:33.960> braking

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
they can do this with up a club braking

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.780 
they can do this with up a club braking
I'd<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> bit<00:00:34.829> irritating<00:00:37.579> vital<00:00:38.579> mode<00:00:38.700> I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
I'd be a bit irritating vital mode I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.440 
I'd be a bit irritating vital mode I
finally<00:00:39.149> get<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
finally get it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.850

warrior<00:00:57.600> arm<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:58.020> extremely<00:00:58.770> rare<00:00:59.010> he<00:00:59.879> only

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
warrior arm it's extremely rare he only

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
warrior arm it's extremely rare he only
spawns<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.070> spot<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
spawns right there in that one spot and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.650 
spawns right there in that one spot and
he's<00:01:02.520> got<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> ten<00:01:03.030> percent<00:01:03.329> chance<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
he's got like a ten percent chance to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.710 
he's got like a ten percent chance to
spawn<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> 10%<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.580> less<00:01:05.640> chance<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
spawn I think a 10% or less chance to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.350 
spawn I think a 10% or less chance to
drop<00:01:06.930> whatever<00:01:07.260> he<00:01:07.350> has<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.010> really

drop whatever he has so it's really

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
drop whatever he has so it's really
irritating<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> farm<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.400> in

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
irritating the farm you have to be in

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
irritating the farm you have to be in
the<00:01:11.610> belfry<00:01:12.090> covenant<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.750> belfry<00:01:13.229> or

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the belfry covenant or belfry or

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
the belfry covenant or belfry or
whatever<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
whatever it is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.500

and

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.820 
and
yeah<00:01:16.720> so<00:01:17.440> once<00:01:18.340> he<00:01:18.550> drops<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:19.650> specific<00:01:20.650> piece

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
yeah so once he drops a specific piece

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.530 
yeah so once he drops a specific piece
he<00:01:20.980> won't<00:01:21.160> drop<00:01:21.400> it<00:01:21.460> again<00:01:21.850> as<00:01:22.090> far<00:01:22.300> as<00:01:22.360> I'm

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
he won't drop it again as far as I'm

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.080 
he won't drop it again as far as I'm
aware<00:01:22.660> so<00:01:23.320> on<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:24.100> third<00:01:24.370> piece<00:01:24.610> I<00:01:24.730> finally

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
aware so on the third piece I finally

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.700 
aware so on the third piece I finally
got<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.480> so<00:01:25.630> just<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.900> clip<00:01:26.080> all<00:01:26.230> this<00:01:26.410> stuff

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
got it so just a clip all this stuff

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.640 
got it so just a clip all this stuff
right<00:01:27.490> now<00:01:27.670> it's<00:01:27.850> not<00:01:28.200> upgraded<00:01:29.200> at<00:01:29.350> all<00:01:29.470> so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
right now it's not upgraded at all so

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.040 
right now it's not upgraded at all so
it's<00:01:29.800> not<00:01:30.010> as<00:01:30.190> good<00:01:30.340> as<00:01:30.520> my<00:01:30.910> normal<00:01:31.570> gear<00:01:31.930> but

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
it's not as good as my normal gear but

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.690 
it's not as good as my normal gear but
I'll<00:01:32.140> probably<00:01:32.230> upgrade<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.800> soon<00:01:33.040> and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
I'll probably upgrade it soon and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.010 
I'll probably upgrade it soon and
actually<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.030> can<00:01:34.060> build<00:01:34.330> out<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:34.570> it<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:34.870> let's

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
actually I can build out of it so let's

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.540 
actually I can build out of it so let's

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
what my guide looks like in his new gear

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.990 
what my guide looks like in his new gear
look<00:01:46.870> forward<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.380> upgrading<00:01:48.010> it<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.340> finally

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
look forward to upgrading it and finally

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.780 
look forward to upgrading it and finally
not<00:01:49.330> having<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:50.020> farm<00:01:50.650> that<00:01:50.890> guy<00:01:51.130> anymore<00:01:51.610> it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
not having to farm that guy anymore it

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.430 
not having to farm that guy anymore it
was<00:01:52.120> allegedly<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.570> rarest<00:01:52.990> armor<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.410> the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
was allegedly the rarest armor in the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.680 
was allegedly the rarest armor in the
game<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:54.520> yeah<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.600> mad<00:01:55.810> warrior<00:01:56.229> gear

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
game so yeah the mad warrior gear

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.330 
game so yeah the mad warrior gear
apparently<00:01:58.690> having<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.620> delicates<00:02:00.070> during

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
apparently having the delicates during

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.850 
apparently having the delicates during
equipped<00:02:00.640> increases<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:02.290> chances<00:02:02.650> of<00:02:02.710> that

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
equipped increases the chances of that

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.020 
equipped increases the chances of that
guy<00:02:03.040> spawning<00:02:03.370> because<00:02:03.640> he's<00:02:03.760> sort<00:02:03.910> of<00:02:03.940> like

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
guy spawning because he's sort of like

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.120 
guy spawning because he's sort of like
an<00:02:04.180> invade<00:02:04.600> mob<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.229> guess<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.620> don't<00:02:05.740> know<00:02:05.830> it

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
an invade mob I guess I don't know it

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.440 
an invade mob I guess I don't know it
certainly<00:02:06.430> seemed<00:02:06.760> like<00:02:06.970> he<00:02:07.090> was<00:02:07.210> spawning

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
certainly seemed like he was spawning

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.020 
certainly seemed like he was spawning
more<00:02:07.720> when<00:02:07.930> I<00:02:07.960> compared<00:02:08.410> them<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.979> was<00:02:09.729> doing<00:02:09.940> it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
more when I compared them I was doing it

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.130 
more when I compared them I was doing it
at<00:02:10.119> first<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.390> didn't<00:02:10.570> have<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:10.929> thing

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
at first I didn't have this thing

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.140 
at first I didn't have this thing
equipped<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:14.580> went<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.670> bought<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
equipped and then went and bought it and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.850 
equipped and then went and bought it and
he<00:02:16.240> seems<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.600> spawn<00:02:16.840> more<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.380> seems<00:02:17.709> like

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
he seems to spawn more so it seems like

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.290 
he seems to spawn more so it seems like
it<00:02:18.130> works<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.580> don't<00:02:18.820> have<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.090> math

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
it works but I don't have the math

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.000 
it works but I don't have the math
behind<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.900> because<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:20.500> farther<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
behind it because it is farther to the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.280 
behind it because it is farther to the
track<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.640> even<00:02:21.820> then<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.300> know<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:23.080> not

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
track and even then it you know it's not

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.290 
track and even then it you know it's not
conclusive<00:02:23.590> proof<00:02:24.190> if<00:02:24.370> he<00:02:24.459> spawns<00:02:24.730> more<00:02:24.880> after

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
conclusive proof if he spawns more after

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.510 
conclusive proof if he spawns more after
but<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.530> know<00:02:27.620> there<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.860> have<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.220> mad

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
but you know there you have it the mad

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.830 
but you know there you have it the mad
