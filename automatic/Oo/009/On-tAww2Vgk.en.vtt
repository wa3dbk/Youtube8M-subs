00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
walking on the stretch of road you can

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.550 
walking on the stretch of road you can
walk<00:01:26.890> down<00:01:27.100> there<00:01:27.369> but<00:01:28.210> it's<00:01:28.360> like<00:01:28.600> it's<00:01:29.350> not

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
walk down there but it's like it's not

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
this over here is not the best but like

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.160 
this over here is not the best but like
