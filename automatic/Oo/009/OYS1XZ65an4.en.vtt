and<00:02:35.310> people<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:39.599> can<00:02:40.170> we<00:02:40.349> do<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
and people so can we do it

and people so can we do it
you<00:02:41.310> know<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:44.689> very<00:02:45.689> often<00:02:45.989> suggest<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.519> my

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
you know I very often suggest to my

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.990 
you know I very often suggest to my
students<00:02:48.359> as<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:50.959> practice<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:53.370> find<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.790> in

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
students as a practice you find it in

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.160 
students as a practice you find it in
every<00:02:54.359> DBC<00:02:55.049> piece<00:02:55.290> at<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.430> end<00:02:56.609> of<00:02:56.819> his<00:02:57.170> pagode

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
every DBC piece at the end of his pagode

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.170 
every DBC piece at the end of his pagode
you<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.310> this<00:03:00.290> layered<00:03:01.290> dynamic<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.950> one

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
you have this layered dynamic and one

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.289 
you have this layered dynamic and one
very<00:03:06.180> important<00:03:06.810> thing<00:03:07.819> for<00:03:08.819> us<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.299> establish

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
very important thing for us to establish

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.879 
very important thing for us to establish
where<00:03:12.299> is<00:03:12.419> our<00:03:12.569> piano<00:03:13.760> versus<00:03:15.889> pianissimo

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
where is our piano versus pianissimo

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.720 
where is our piano versus pianissimo
versus<00:03:17.879> mess<00:03:18.150> matzah<00:03:18.810> piano<00:03:19.159> versus<00:03:20.159> met

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
versus mess matzah piano versus met

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.050 
versus mess matzah piano versus met
support<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.349> on<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:23.099> will<00:03:23.340> be<00:03:23.519> different

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
support and so on it will be different

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.030 
support and so on it will be different
on<00:03:24.239> every<00:03:24.870> piano<00:03:25.169> and<00:03:25.469> in<00:03:26.189> every<00:03:26.700> acoustical

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
on every piano and in every acoustical

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.300 
on every piano and in every acoustical
situation<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:30.379> it<00:03:31.379> is<00:03:31.590> necessary<00:03:32.159> now

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
situation but it is necessary now

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.569 
situation but it is necessary now
sometimes<00:03:32.849> I<00:03:33.030> ask<00:03:33.419> my<00:03:34.290> students<00:03:35.219> to<00:03:35.310> do<00:03:35.549> a

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
sometimes I ask my students to do a

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.599 
sometimes I ask my students to do a
simple<00:03:35.939> exercise<00:03:37.819> for<00:03:38.819> instance<00:03:39.479> just<00:03:40.290> can

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
simple exercise for instance just can

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:49.250 
simple exercise for instance just can
any<00:03:41.609> motive<00:03:42.209> say

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:58.240 

good<00:03:49.830> piano<00:03:53.810> pianissimo<00:03:56.750> sounds<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.870> same

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
good piano pianissimo sounds the same

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:14.570 
good piano pianissimo sounds the same
okay<00:03:59.250> yeah<00:03:59.640> no<00:04:01.640> good<00:04:02.640> metaphor<00:04:09.769> metaphor

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.000 

Jenny<00:04:15.580> sue<00:04:18.180> yeah<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.260> got<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.590> idea<00:04:20.680> right

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
Jenny sue yeah so you got the idea right

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.780 
Jenny sue yeah so you got the idea right
I<00:04:21.489> think<00:04:21.880> we<00:04:22.780> need<00:04:23.080> we<00:04:23.710> need<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.040> have<00:04:24.370> this

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
I think we need we need to have this

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.710 
I think we need we need to have this
kind<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:26.520> stratification<00:04:27.520> of<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:28.120> dynamic<00:04:28.540> so

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
kind of stratification of the dynamic so

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.310 
kind of stratification of the dynamic so
let<00:04:29.170> us<00:04:29.200> have<00:04:29.650> what<00:04:30.340> is<00:04:30.520> written<00:04:30.700> both<00:04:31.120> in<00:04:31.810> time

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
let us have what is written both in time

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:57.840 
let us have what is written both in time
and<00:04:32.590> in<00:04:33.250> dynamics

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.840 

yes<00:04:58.850> it's<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.420> very<00:04:59.750> difficult<00:05:00.080> place<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.800> have<00:05:01.670> a

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
yes it's a very difficult place I have a

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.780 
yes it's a very difficult place I have a
little<00:05:02.620> technical<00:05:03.620> suggestion<00:05:04.310> which<00:05:04.460> may

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
little technical suggestion which may

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:13.300 
little technical suggestion which may
make<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.450> little<00:05:05.900> easier<00:05:06.200> look<00:05:06.710> here<00:05:12.310> kind

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
make it a little easier look here kind

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.060 
make it a little easier look here kind
of<00:05:15.190> stay<00:05:16.190> on<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:17.060> e<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.810> will<00:05:18.290> support<00:05:18.950> your

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
of stay on this e it will support your

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:53.260 
of stay on this e it will support your
hand<00:05:19.460> for<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:19.670> next<00:05:19.820> note<00:05:32.350> yes<00:05:34.510> it<00:05:35.510> works<00:05:35.780> okay

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.330
