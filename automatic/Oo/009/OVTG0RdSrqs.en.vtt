00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
I've been monkeying with this other

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.680 
I've been monkeying with this other
thing<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.670> connected<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.940 

lots<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.840> times<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:51.170> think<00:00:52.170> how<00:00:52.559> come<00:00:52.800> they

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
lots of times I think how come they

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.729 
lots of times I think how come they
never<00:00:53.100> built<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> Kickstarter<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:55.320> these<00:00:55.469> mini

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
never built a Kickstarter for these mini

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.150 
never built a Kickstarter for these mini
bikes<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.309> go-karts<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> stuff<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.980> come

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
bikes and go-karts and stuff so I come

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.319 
bikes and go-karts and stuff so I come
out<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.460> more<00:00:59.700> I<00:00:59.730> bet<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.239> I've

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
out this more I bet that's what I've

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.069 
out this more I bet that's what I've
been<00:01:00.360> tinkering<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:05.780> came<00:01:06.780> out<00:01:06.930> today

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
been tinkering with and I came out today

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.810 
been tinkering with and I came out today
and<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.439> threw<00:01:07.770> together<00:01:07.829> this<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.399> frame

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and I threw together this little frame

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.969 
and I threw together this little frame
to<00:01:09.119> hold<00:01:09.240> everything<00:01:09.600> together<00:01:09.900> because<00:01:10.740> I

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to hold everything together because I

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.399 
to hold everything together because I
didn't<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.310> any<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> demonstrate<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.630> so

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
didn't have any way to demonstrate it so

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
didn't have any way to demonstrate it so
I<00:01:13.470> made<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> little<00:01:14.040> frame<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.549> finished<00:01:15.180> up

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
I made this little frame I finished up

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.050 
I made this little frame I finished up
some<00:01:15.570> work<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.159> device<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.880> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
some work on this device and this is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.359 
some work on this device and this is
going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> 'virgin<00:01:19.700> temp<00:01:20.780> ya<00:01:22.220> see<00:01:23.220> if

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
going to be the 'virgin temp ya see if

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.880 
going to be the 'virgin temp ya see if
it<00:01:23.460> actually<00:01:23.490> works<00:01:24.530> alright<00:01:25.530> guys<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it actually works alright guys this is

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:52.470 
it actually works alright guys this is
what<00:01:26.130> I've<00:01:26.220> been<00:01:26.250> working<00:01:26.670> on

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:05.470 

we<00:01:53.480> think<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:53.750> that<00:02:02.860> chain<00:02:03.860> driven<00:02:04.480> pulley

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
we think of that chain driven pulley

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.050 
we think of that chain driven pulley
accessory

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
accessory

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.420 
accessory
Kickstarter<00:02:08.200> he<00:02:09.200> uses<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.710> return<00:02:10.010> spring

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
Kickstarter he uses the return spring

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.170 
Kickstarter he uses the return spring
and<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:11.980> coil<00:02:12.980> return<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:15.440> pull<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.740> back<00:02:15.890> up

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and the coil return to pull it back up

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.050 
and the coil return to pull it back up
and<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:19.210> actually<00:02:20.210> over<00:02:20.720> built<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:22.060> have

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
and I actually over built it I have

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.660 
and I actually over built it I have
extra<00:02:24.020> pulleys<00:02:24.410> over<00:02:24.680> here<00:02:24.830> are<00:02:25.010> gears<00:02:25.310> over

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
extra pulleys over here are gears over

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.610 
extra pulleys over here are gears over
here<00:02:27.790> which<00:02:28.790> gives<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.750> much<00:02:29.990> more<00:02:30.020> massive

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
here which gives it a much more massive

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.120 
here which gives it a much more massive
turning<00:02:31.190> right<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.620> would<00:02:33.740> turn<00:02:33.950> this

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
turning right but it would turn this

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.850 
turning right but it would turn this
pulley<00:02:34.430> over<00:02:34.790> eight<00:02:35.180> times<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.740> only

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
pulley over eight times and it only

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.740 
pulley over eight times and it only
needs<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.250> go<00:02:37.460> over<00:02:37.490> twice<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:41.030> anyway

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.110

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
getting the parts together and put that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.340 
getting the parts together and put that
together<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:55.600> there<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.900> didn't

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350
