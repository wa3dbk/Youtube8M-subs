you also get a selection of beats which
are<00:00:33.320> MIDI<00:00:33.860> patterns<00:00:34.280> that<00:00:34.400> you<00:00:34.520> can<00:00:34.550> drag<00:00:35.060> and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
are MIDI patterns that you can drag and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.660 
are MIDI patterns that you can drag and
drop<00:00:35.510> into<00:00:35.780> your<00:00:35.810> project<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:36.620> we'll<00:00:37.460> do<00:00:37.640> just

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
drop into your project so we'll do just

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.590 
drop into your project so we'll do just
that<00:00:38.180> if<00:00:38.540> I<00:00:38.810> select<00:00:39.290> a<00:00:40.000> nice<00:00:41.000> straight<00:00:41.390> beat

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
that if I select a nice straight beat

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:52.240 
that if I select a nice straight beat
there<00:00:43.329> hit<00:00:44.329> play<00:00:44.829> that's<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:45.980> plan<00:00:51.070> we<00:00:52.070> want

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
there hit play that's the plan we want

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.790 
there hit play that's the plan we want
to<00:00:52.489> extend<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:53.120> we<00:00:53.629> just<00:00:53.870> highlight<00:00:54.649> over

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
to extend that we just highlight over

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.950 
to extend that we just highlight over
the<00:00:54.920> edge<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.280> drag<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.329> out<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.719> heart's

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
the edge a drag it out to a heart's

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.889 
the edge a drag it out to a heart's
content<00:00:57.820> we<00:00:58.820> can<00:00:58.969> also<00:00:59.090> obviously<00:00:59.269> mix<00:00:59.719> and

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
content we can also obviously mix and

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.750 
content we can also obviously mix and
match<00:01:00.019> our<00:01:00.230> patterns<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:00.890> perhaps<00:01:01.519> want<00:01:01.699> to

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
match our patterns so perhaps want to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.360 
match our patterns so perhaps want to
add<00:01:01.879> a<00:01:02.320> sixteenth<00:01:03.320> hi-hat<00:01:03.769> pattern<00:01:04.100> in<00:01:04.190> there

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
add a sixteenth hi-hat pattern in there

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:18.880 
add a sixteenth hi-hat pattern in there
so<00:01:04.610> we'll<00:01:04.790> just<00:01:04.970> take<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:05.480> onto<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.780> end<00:01:16.990> if<00:01:17.990> we

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
so we'll just take it onto the end if we

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.630 
so we'll just take it onto the end if we
wanted<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.640> change<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.060> tempo<00:01:21.310> we<00:01:22.310> can<00:01:22.490> do

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
wanted to change the tempo we can do

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.749 
wanted to change the tempo we can do
that<00:01:22.759> once<00:01:22.970> we've<00:01:23.150> dragged<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.930> loops<00:01:24.140> in

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
that once we've dragged the loops in

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.490 
that once we've dragged the loops in
just<00:01:25.759> change<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.030> tempo<00:01:26.390> there<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.689> 120<00:01:27.320> beats

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
just change the tempo there to 120 beats

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.399 
just change the tempo there to 120 beats
a<00:01:27.650> minute<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:27.970> quite<00:01:28.970> sync<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.570> up<00:01:29.630> but<00:01:30.140> we

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
a minute and quite sync that up but we

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:42.969 
a minute and quite sync that up but we
can<00:01:30.530> just<00:01:30.710> drag<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:41.320> everything<00:01:42.320> is<00:01:42.470> resync

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
can just drag that everything is resync

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.510 
can just drag that everything is resync
t'<00:01:43.070> as<00:01:43.310> long<00:01:43.729> as<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.390> select<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.369> sync<00:01:46.369> with

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
t' as long as you select the sync with

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:09.720 

bit<00:03:01.430> harsh<00:03:01.670> but<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:01.970> get<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.209> idea<00:03:08.530> and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
bit harsh but you get the idea and

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.420 
bit harsh but you get the idea and
that's<00:03:10.730> basically<00:03:11.739> addictive<00:03:12.739> drums<00:03:12.980> loading

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
that's basically addictive drums loading

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.539 
that's basically addictive drums loading
what<00:03:13.519> you<00:03:13.580> can<00:03:13.700> do<00:03:13.850> with<00:03:14.000> even<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.390> demo<00:03:14.690> and

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
what you can do with even the demo and

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.910 
what you can do with even the demo and
but<00:03:16.549> that's<00:03:16.730> for<00:03:16.970> another<00:03:17.000> day<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:18.799> other

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
but that's for another day and the other

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.620 
but that's for another day and the other
thing<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.100> was<00:03:19.190> going<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.430> show<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:19.820> was<00:03:21.160> using

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
thing I was going to show you was using

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.900 
thing I was going to show you was using
audio<00:03:23.630> loops<00:03:23.900> in<00:03:24.380> Reaper<00:03:24.799> so<00:03:25.100> we<00:03:25.549> get<00:03:25.760> rid<00:03:25.880> of

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
audio loops in Reaper so we get rid of

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.890 
audio loops in Reaper so we get rid of
those<00:03:27.010> obscure<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.160> back<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.549> 100<00:03:29.209> get<00:03:29.780> rid

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
those obscure that back to 100 get rid

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:38.580 
those obscure that back to 100 get rid
of<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.080> looping<00:03:30.590> section<00:03:35.290> turn<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.410> loop

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.210 

I've<00:03:39.590> got<00:03:39.770> in<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.190> media<00:03:40.879> Explorer<00:03:41.300> here<00:03:41.540> some

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
I've got in the media Explorer here some

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.970 
I've got in the media Explorer here some
betta<00:03:43.220> monkey<00:03:43.610> loops<00:03:44.200> which<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.830> can

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
betta monkey loops which you can

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.170 
betta monkey loops which you can
basically<00:03:46.160> use<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:46.580> the<00:03:46.640> same<00:03:46.790> way<00:03:47.000> as<00:03:47.060> the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
basically use in the same way as the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.259 
basically use in the same way as the
MIDI<00:03:47.360> loops<00:03:47.629> except<00:03:47.959> their<00:03:48.080> audio<00:03:52.269> just

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
MIDI loops except their audio just

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.309 
MIDI loops except their audio just
audition<00:03:53.720> one<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.930> those<00:03:55.690> that's<00:03:56.690> fine<00:03:57.019> and

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
audition one of those that's fine and

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.940 
audition one of those that's fine and
then<00:03:57.470> drag<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:57.890> into<00:03:58.069> our<00:03:58.370> project<00:03:58.940> and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
then drag that into our project and

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.800 
then drag that into our project and
there<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.040> shows<00:04:01.220> up<00:04:01.400> not<00:04:01.700> as<00:04:01.880> individual<00:04:02.599> hits

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
there it shows up not as individual hits

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.729 
there it shows up not as individual hits
but<00:04:03.140> as<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.980> audio<00:04:04.690> track<00:04:06.459> waveform<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:09.650> we

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
but as the audio track waveform so we

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:21.699 
but as the audio track waveform so we
can<00:04:09.890> play<00:04:10.069> that<00:04:20.139> sounds<00:04:21.139> pretty<00:04:21.350> good<00:04:21.500> now<00:04:21.650> the

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
can play that sounds pretty good now the

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.290 
can play that sounds pretty good now the
one<00:04:21.979> thing<00:04:22.130> got<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.400> be<00:04:22.490> sure<00:04:22.729> off<00:04:22.910> if<00:04:23.120> you're

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
one thing got to be sure off if you're

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.129 
one thing got to be sure off if you're
going<00:04:23.389> to<00:04:23.479> do<00:04:23.570> this<00:04:23.750> in<00:04:23.990> Reaper<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.979> you

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
going to do this in Reaper is that you

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.390 
going to do this in Reaper is that you
make<00:04:27.139> sure<00:04:27.169> your<00:04:27.500> project<00:04:27.710> settings<00:04:28.070> are

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
make sure your project settings are

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.950 
make sure your project settings are
right<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.820> your<00:04:28.910> project<00:04:29.330> settings<00:04:29.660> need<00:04:29.900> to

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
right and your project settings need to

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.760 
right and your project settings need to
say<00:04:30.790> that<00:04:31.790> your<00:04:31.940> time<00:04:32.180> base<00:04:32.450> is<00:04:32.750> not<00:04:33.110> time<00:04:33.410> it

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
say that your time base is not time it

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.500 
say that your time base is not time it
is<00:04:34.070> beats<00:04:35.620> then<00:04:36.850> if<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:38.000> want<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.180> change<00:04:38.389> the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
is beats then if you want to change the

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.040 
is beats then if you want to change the
tempo<00:04:43.300> automatically<00:04:44.300> syncs<00:04:44.630> that<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.930> the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
tempo automatically syncs that to the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:57.219 
tempo automatically syncs that to the
current<00:04:45.620> tempo<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.970> can<00:04:56.090> also<00:04:56.210> cut<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.020> paste

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
current tempo you can also cut and paste

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.350 
current tempo you can also cut and paste
any<00:04:57.560> part<00:04:57.889> of<00:04:57.979> the<00:04:58.039> sleep<00:04:58.280> or<00:04:58.550> all<00:04:58.729> of<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:59.030> we

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
any part of the sleep or all of it we

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.040 
any part of the sleep or all of it we
can<00:04:59.510> drag<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.840> out<00:05:00.020> same<00:05:00.770> as<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:00.950> MIDI<00:05:01.100> loops

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
can drag it out same as the MIDI loops

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.770 
can drag it out same as the MIDI loops
to<00:05:03.050> extend<00:05:03.410> it<00:05:03.560> or<00:05:04.430> we<00:05:04.550> can<00:05:04.850> highlight<00:05:05.389> a<00:05:05.450> part

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
to extend it or we can highlight a part

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.159 
to extend it or we can highlight a part
of<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.080> we'll<00:05:06.260> hire<00:05:06.440> this<00:05:06.590> fill<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.870> we<00:05:08.870> will

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
of it we'll hire this fill and we will

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.020 
of it we'll hire this fill and we will
copy<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:10.280> loop<00:05:11.770> now<00:05:12.770> we'll<00:05:12.950> copy<00:05:13.160> selected<00:05:13.700> area

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
copy a loop now we'll copy selected area

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:21.490 
copy a loop now we'll copy selected area
of<00:05:14.240> selected<00:05:14.630> items<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:18.490> then<00:05:19.490> we<00:05:19.760> will<00:05:20.500> paste

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
of selected items and then we will paste

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.650 
of selected items and then we will paste
that<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:22.490> we<00:05:22.610> should<00:05:22.789> then<00:05:22.910> have<00:05:22.940> two<00:05:23.210> fills<00:05:23.479> at

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
that so we should then have two fills at

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:32.750 
that so we should then have two fills at
the<00:05:23.750> end<00:05:23.840> of<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:24.080> beat

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
okay you also add I'm different loops in

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.450 
okay you also add I'm different loops in
that's<00:05:40.150> no<00:05:40.330> problem<00:05:43.710> move<00:05:44.710> seamlessly<00:05:45.040> from

that's no problem move seamlessly from

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:56.760 
that's no problem move seamlessly from
one<00:05:45.550> to<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:45.790> other<00:05:55.320> pretty<00:05:56.320> cool

one to the other pretty cool
okay<00:05:57.580> that's<00:05:57.820> basic<00:05:58.270> addictive<00:05:58.660> drums<00:05:58.900> and

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
okay that's basic addictive drums and

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.660 
okay that's basic addictive drums and
audio<00:05:59.800> loops<00:06:00.360> in<00:06:01.360> Reaper<00:06:02.160> how<00:06:03.160> you<00:06:03.220> found<00:06:03.490> it

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
audio loops in Reaper how you found it

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.960 
audio loops in Reaper how you found it
useful<00:06:03.880> bye<00:06:04.720> for<00:06:04.930> now
