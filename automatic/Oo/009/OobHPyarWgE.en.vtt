with poles players like poles basically

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.979 
with poles players like poles basically
worth<00:00:29.500> about<00:00:29.849> 10,000<00:00:30.849> so<00:00:31.480> it's<00:00:31.660> simple<00:00:31.960> math

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
worth about 10,000 so it's simple math

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.979 
worth about 10,000 so it's simple math
with<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.439> 8x<00:00:32.829> five<00:00:33.040> percent<00:00:33.370> of<00:00:33.460> 10,500<00:00:34.000> so

because<00:01:01.300> 500<00:01:02.020> coin<00:01:03.010> difference<00:01:03.490> that's<00:01:03.700> going

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
because 500 coin difference that's going

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.510 
because 500 coin difference that's going
to<00:01:03.940> be<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.059> profit<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:05.280> that's<00:01:06.280> all<00:01:06.490> that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
to be a profit and that's all that

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.160 
to be a profit and that's all that
matters<00:01:06.970> in<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.240> end<00:01:07.270> because<00:01:07.600> either<00:01:07.810> one

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
matters in the end because either one

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.920 
matters in the end because either one
you<00:01:08.380> want<00:01:08.860> that<00:01:09.040> God<00:01:09.280> Squad<00:01:09.610> or<00:01:10.060> two<00:01:10.420> you're

anyway<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:34.270> was<00:01:34.509> on<00:01:34.689> stream<00:01:35.020> imagine<00:01:35.469> if<00:01:35.560> I

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
anyway this was on stream imagine if I

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.559

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
was off the stream I honestly believe I

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.020 
was off the stream I honestly believe I
would<00:01:37.719> have<00:01:37.810> made<00:01:37.960> at<00:01:38.079> least<00:01:38.109> 120<00:01:39.039> to<00:01:39.159> 130<00:01:39.639> k

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
would have made at least 120 to 130 k

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.649 
would have made at least 120 to 130 k
profit<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.920> I<00:01:41.950> mean<00:01:42.340> but<00:01:43.240> if<00:01:43.359> you<00:01:43.389> don't<00:01:43.569> learn
