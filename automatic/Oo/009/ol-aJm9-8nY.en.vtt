00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
professional concealer brush just

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280 
professional concealer brush just
because<00:02:51.579> this<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.939> small<00:02:52.359> and<00:02:52.659> it's<00:02:52.840> only<00:02:53.019> one

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
because this is small and it's only one

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.899 
because this is small and it's only one
dollar<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:53.829> it's<00:02:53.980> not<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.459> brush<00:02:54.669> that<00:02:54.819> I

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
dollar and so it's not a brush that I

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.970 
dollar and so it's not a brush that I
really<00:02:55.150> care<00:02:55.180> about<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.689> much<00:02:56.169> and<00:02:56.469> this<00:02:56.859> is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
really care about that much and this is

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.559 
really care about that much and this is
absolutely<00:02:57.340> great<00:02:57.579> for<00:02:57.909> applying<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.299> and

absolutely great for applying this and

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.240 
absolutely great for applying this and
so<00:02:59.199> what<00:02:59.889> is<00:03:00.069> as<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:01.180> cream<00:03:01.599> makeup<00:03:02.290> first<00:03:02.739> do<00:03:03.099> my
