um<00:00:49.950> pretty<00:00:50.700> much<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> same<00:00:51.059> thing<00:00:51.270> with

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
um pretty much the same thing with

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
um pretty much the same thing with
English<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:51.930> ideally<00:00:52.379> would<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
English you know ideally would like to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.080 
English you know ideally would like to
have<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.940> everything<00:00:54.590> but<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.100> with

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
have one of everything but you know with

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.450 
have one of everything but you know with
Japanese<00:00:57.480> cards<00:00:57.750> especially<00:00:57.840> that's<00:00:58.469> most

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
Japanese cards especially that's most

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.189 
Japanese cards especially that's most
likely<00:00:59.609> not<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.600> happen<00:01:00.719> even<00:01:01.109> with

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
likely not going to happen even with

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.420 
likely not going to happen even with
English<00:01:01.530> cards<00:01:01.859> since<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:04.220> what's<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> word

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
English cards since not what's the word

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.390 
English cards since not what's the word
reasonable<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:07.229> try<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.130> all<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
reasonable to try that with all the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.649 
reasonable to try that with all the
promos<00:01:08.909> set<00:01:09.600> cards<00:01:09.990> are<00:01:10.140> definitely<00:01:10.740> doable

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
promos set cards are definitely doable

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
promos set cards are definitely doable
just<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> promos<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> lot<00:01:13.890> harder<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.520> do

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
just the promos are a lot harder to do

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.929 
just the promos are a lot harder to do
and<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.330> looks<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.610> into

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and it looks like so how do I get into

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.340 
and it looks like so how do I get into
this<00:01:18.060> thing<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> looks<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.869> we've<00:01:19.049> where

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.420 
aren't bad for Sharon see to Scylla for
dce<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:24.240> rest<00:04:24.539> are<00:04:24.750> water<00:04:24.990> um<00:04:25.289> wow<00:04:26.130> so

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
dce and the rest are water um wow so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.379 
dce and the rest are water um wow so
you're<00:04:26.580> only<00:04:26.820> poke

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
you're only poke

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.939 
you're only poke
mom<00:04:27.539> is<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:30.090> kiram<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:31.349> I<00:04:31.379> guess<00:04:31.710> that's

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
mom is the the kiram so I guess that's

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.600 
mom is the the kiram so I guess that's
that<00:04:32.249> half<00:04:32.819> dick<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.479> then<00:04:34.219> maybe<00:04:35.219> this<00:04:35.460> isn't

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
that half dick and then maybe this isn't

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.040 
that half dick and then maybe this isn't
like<00:04:35.849> a<00:04:35.879> trainer<00:04:36.180> kit<00:04:36.449> maybe<00:04:36.629> this<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:36.930> more

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
like a trainer kit maybe this is more

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.719 
like a trainer kit maybe this is more
like<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.289> theme<00:04:37.499> debt<00:04:37.740> because<00:04:38.009> combining

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
like a theme debt because combining

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.379 
like a theme debt because combining
these<00:04:38.849> would<00:04:39.060> make<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.240> lot<00:04:39.689> more<00:04:39.749> sense<00:04:41.389> so

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
these would make a lot more sense so

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.830 
these would make a lot more sense so
there's<00:04:42.599> your<00:04:42.749> beautiful<00:04:43.409> Blastoise<00:04:47.840> master

looks<00:04:50.939> like<00:04:51.029> um<00:04:51.360> I<00:04:51.629> mean<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.020> guess<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.289> could

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
looks like um I mean I guess you could

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.749 
looks like um I mean I guess you could
technically<00:04:52.710> play<00:04:53.009> these<00:04:53.159> separate<00:04:53.580> but

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
technically play these separate but

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.239 
technically play these separate but
wouldn't<00:04:54.029> be<00:04:54.090> nearly<00:04:54.449> as<00:04:54.599> much<00:04:54.719> fun<00:04:55.249> there's

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:56.249

competitiveness<00:06:01.979> I<00:06:02.909> guess<00:06:03.060> is<00:06:03.240> how<00:06:03.719> i<00:06:03.960> should

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
competitiveness I guess is how i should

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.300 
competitiveness I guess is how i should
say<00:06:04.409> it<00:06:05.120> but<00:06:06.259> certainly<00:06:07.259> not<00:06:07.710> bad<00:06:08.009> a<00:06:08.039> lot

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
say it but certainly not bad a lot

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.649 
say it but certainly not bad a lot

Japanese decks and
like<00:06:40.620> I<00:06:40.710> said<00:06:40.770> keeping<00:06:41.310> one<00:06:41.550> of<00:06:41.820> everything

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
like I said keeping one of everything

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.680 
like I said keeping one of everything
for<00:06:42.630> my<00:06:42.840> collection<00:06:43.260> but<00:06:44.160> then<00:06:44.370> these<00:06:45.240> are<00:06:45.300> all

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
for my collection but then these are all

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.440 
for my collection but then these are all
the<00:06:45.900> duplicates<00:06:47.030> really<00:06:48.030> probably<00:06:48.210> the<00:06:48.360> only

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.450 
the duplicates really probably the only

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.390 
the duplicates really probably the only
thing<00:06:48.720> is<00:06:48.900> is<00:06:49.140> that<00:06:49.290> Blastoise<00:06:49.890> right<00:06:50.160> there

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
thing is is that Blastoise right there

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
thing is is that Blastoise right there
and<00:06:51.470> the<00:06:52.470> non<00:06:53.130> hollow<00:06:53.430> Karamy<00:06:54.000> x<00:06:54.150> which<00:06:54.330> i

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.420 
and the non hollow Karamy x which i

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.730 
and the non hollow Karamy x which i
think<00:06:54.600> something<00:06:54.810> is<00:06:54.990> really<00:06:55.200> awesome<00:06:55.380> that

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
think something is really awesome that

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.190 
think something is really awesome that
are<00:06:56.130> probably<00:06:56.490> the<00:06:56.820> ones<00:06:57.030> that<00:06:57.750> most<00:06:57.900> people

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200 
are probably the ones that most people

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.290 
are probably the ones that most people
