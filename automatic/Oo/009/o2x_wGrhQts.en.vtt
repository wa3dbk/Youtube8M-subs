00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
the ground opponents so I figured well

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.849 
the ground opponents so I figured well
at<00:03:13.790> least<00:03:13.940> now<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.480> have<00:03:14.750> my<00:03:14.780> air<00:03:15.380> army<00:03:15.739> all

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
at least now that I have my air army all

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.349 
at least now that I have my air army all
trained<00:03:16.130> up<00:03:16.250> how<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.730> can<00:03:16.880> go<00:03:16.970> ahead<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.150> try

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
trained up how you can go ahead and try

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.050 
trained up how you can go ahead and try
to<00:03:17.480> attack<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.859> noticed<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.549> his<00:03:19.760> dark

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
to attack it so I noticed that his dark

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.509 
to attack it so I noticed that his dark
elixir<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:21.200> lot<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.410> his<00:03:21.620> elixir<00:03:22.069> storages

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
elixir and a lot of his elixir storages

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.449 
elixir and a lot of his elixir storages
which<00:03:22.940> he<00:03:23.090> has<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.329> most<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.750> our<00:03:23.959> on<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:25.010> left

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
which he has the most of our on the left

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.129 
which he has the most of our on the left
side<00:03:25.609> of<00:03:25.669> the<00:03:25.849> base<00:03:26.000> or<00:03:26.209> concentrated<00:03:26.900> on<00:03:27.019> the

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
side of the base or concentrated on the

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.890 
side of the base or concentrated on the
left<00:03:27.319> side<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.680> base<00:03:27.859> now<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:28.940> could<00:03:29.540> try<00:03:29.840> to

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
left side of the base now I could try to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.050 
left side of the base now I could try to
attack<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.530> go<00:03:30.769> for<00:03:30.980> gold<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:31.730> mainly

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
attack and go for gold but mainly

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.970 
attack and go for gold but mainly
because<00:03:32.389> he<00:03:32.900> has<00:03:33.019> those<00:03:33.200> four<00:03:33.500> elixir

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
because he has those four elixir

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.460 
because he has those four elixir
storages<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:34.669> know<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.299> if<00:03:35.389> I<00:03:35.510> get<00:03:35.660> one<00:03:35.959> elixir

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630

400,000 elixir comes out to that much so

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.449 
400,000 elixir comes out to that much so
and<00:03:48.200> then<00:03:48.319> I<00:03:48.349> want<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.709> get<00:03:48.859> that<00:03:49.010> dark<00:03:49.280> elixir

to the middle side of the base get that
town<00:04:05.090> hall<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.450> then<00:04:05.780> also<00:04:05.900> try<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.230> make<00:04:06.379> me

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
if I could but for the most part we did

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.750

200,000<00:04:13.760> elixir<00:04:14.210> is<00:04:14.330> still<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.630> good<00:04:14.960> amount

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
200,000 elixir is still a good amount

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.319 
200,000 elixir is still a good amount
anyway<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:15.740> drop<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.549> heroes<00:04:16.850> from<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.030> top

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329

anyway so drop the heroes from the top
the<00:04:18.310> now<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.370> two<00:04:19.940> heroes<00:04:20.180> are<00:04:20.299> taking<00:04:20.600> out

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
the now the two heroes are taking out

the now the two heroes are taking out
that<00:04:20.720> barbarian<00:04:21.230> king<00:04:21.470> that<00:04:21.890> goes<00:04:22.070> down<00:04:22.340> as

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
that barbarian king that goes down as

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.510 
that barbarian king that goes down as
well<00:04:23.180> as<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.810> gold<00:04:24.500> storages<00:04:24.980> and<00:04:25.010> all<00:04:25.310> that

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.850 
well as the gold storages and all that
other<00:04:25.640> stuff<00:04:25.760> so<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:26.960> barbarian<00:04:27.500> king<00:04:27.740> is

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
other stuff so that barbarian king is

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.460 
other stuff so that barbarian king is

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
really really tanky by the way and so is

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.230
