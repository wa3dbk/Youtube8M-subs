this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.259> important<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.009> keep<00:01:41.040> feeding

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
this is so important that I keep feeding

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.310 
this is so important that I keep feeding
back<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> players<00:01:42.509> realistically

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
back to the players realistically

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.950 
back to the players realistically
because<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.329> them<00:01:45.509> let<00:01:45.930> them

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
because if you just get them let them

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.170 
because if you just get them let them
get<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.829> cope<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.579> disorder<00:01:48.030> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
get to cope with the disorder of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.630 
get to cope with the disorder of
emotions<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> result<00:01:49.259> rather<00:01:50.040> than<00:01:50.399> listen

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
emotions of a result rather than listen

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.850 
emotions of a result rather than listen
lads<00:01:50.970> ok<00:01:51.360> let's<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> result<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> one<00:01:52.619> side

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
lads ok let's put the result to one side

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.289 
lads ok let's put the result to one side
these<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> goal<00:01:53.579> should<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.000> done<00:01:54.149> this

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
these are the goal should have done this

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.179 
these are the goal should have done this
that<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:55.110> let's<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.829> look<00:01:56.040> at<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that but let's have a look at the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.130 
that but let's have a look at the
positives<00:01:56.670> about<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.479> performers<00:01:57.899> let's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
positives about the performers let's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.569 
positives about the performers let's
have<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> look<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.979> things<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.369> we

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
have a look about the things that we

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.760 
have a look about the things that we
really<00:01:59.790> set<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.320> which<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.619> did

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
really set out to do in which we did

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.469 
really set out to do in which we did
really<00:02:01.979> well<00:02:02.130> let's<00:02:02.579> take<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.090> into<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
really well let's take that into the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.330 
really well let's take that into the
next<00:02:03.810> game<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:04.920> that's<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> most

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
next game because that's the most

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.310 
next game because that's the most
important<00:02:05.820> thing<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.240> important<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.200> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
important thing it's important that you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.469 
important thing it's important that you
take<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> positives<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:08.910> things<00:02:09.209> into

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
take the positives the right things into

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
take the positives the right things into
the<00:02:09.569> next<00:02:09.840> game<00:02:10.020> for<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> next<00:02:10.950> performance

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the next game for the next performance

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.680 
the next game for the next performance
which<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> different<00:02:12.569> team<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.319> case

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
which is a different team in this case

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.410 
which is a different team in this case
obviously<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.410> league<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.800> Fonzie<00:02:15.160> and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
is still so so taxed you can leapfrog

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.100 
is still so so taxed you can leapfrog
any<00:02:32.410> or<00:02:32.680> any<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.640> teams<00:02:33.820> around<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.990> is

to<00:02:39.250> three<00:02:39.520> places<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.540> know<00:02:40.660> initially<00:02:41.470> you

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
to three places you know initially you

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.340 
to three places you know initially you
cannot<00:02:42.400> just<00:02:42.880> take<00:02:43.150> anything<00:02:44.050> for<00:02:44.320> granted

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
cannot just take anything for granted

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.170 
cannot just take anything for granted
and<00:02:44.800> wait<00:02:44.980> because<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.520> lose<00:02:45.640> one<00:02:45.940> or<00:02:45.970> two

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
and wait because you lose one or two

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.880 
and wait because you lose one or two
games<00:02:46.450> after<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.930> up<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.320> you<00:02:47.440> tumble<00:02:47.800> back

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
games after that up and you tumble back

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.970 
games after that up and you tumble back
down<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.850> every<00:02:49.780> game<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.320> need<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.620> take<00:02:50.800> it

down so every game you need to take it

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.670 
down so every game you need to take it
as<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.130> comes<00:02:51.250> very<00:02:51.970> hard<00:02:52.300> points22<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.500> get

something's<00:03:44.050> going<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.380> give<00:03:44.560> if<00:03:45.190> it's<00:03:45.610> not
