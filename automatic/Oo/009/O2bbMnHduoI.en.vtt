00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.830
 but that they are very well and good today 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.820
 I've been bringing a tutorial on how 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.880
 download the minecraft 1.7 points that is 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.059
 the new one that has come out and well this 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.460
 tutorial has asked me enough people for 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.920
 private trials of youtube and good 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.710
 first to download the evans to me 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.860
 web page that is me raÃºl next to jim 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:33.390
 the dotcom here go to the section of 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.390
 downloads for pc and here they are going down 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.520
 and as you can see here it says it will be removed 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.030
 the minecraft 1.7 update 2 points 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:50.020
 free and what would be 11 to expire 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:52.840
 we click on the image of an entire 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.170
 and it will take us to an atlas page of 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 atlas 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.430
 here we wait 5 seconds then 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.120
 why anyone 29 and give jump 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.120
 cubists 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.960
 here it will be loading what is the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.960
 mega page 400 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.310
 367 gigabytes so you do not think much 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.030
 we simply accept the terms 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.420
 of mega services and we give download or 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.250
 download 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.770
 and it is already 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.570
 we are very fast 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.570
 and I will leave you what this file is 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.009
 we will be leaving us this 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.360
 this hard point of minecraft simply 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:58.050
 we open it, tell us to put on a 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.540
 username and we will put what we want 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.500
 and its slogans of downloading to good I do not 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.530
 I speak it because you try to open it 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.260
 of recording the first time but I was 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.890
 It is very difficult since I 'm right now 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.890
 recording 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.500
 the thing is not very fast but good this 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.250
 it is the most serious 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.250
 pirate
