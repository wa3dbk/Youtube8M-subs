10.1 into the game we started looking

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.300

essentially<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.330> work<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.140> australia<00:01:49.619> and

essentially we work in australia and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.580 
essentially we work in australia and
often<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.209> very<00:01:51.420> hard<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> collaborate<00:01:52.049> with

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
often is very hard to collaborate with

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
often is very hard to collaborate with
engineers<00:01:53.099> in<00:01:53.310> europe<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.789> north<00:01:54.330> america

because<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.679> time<00:01:56.220> difference<00:01:56.250> because

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
because of the time difference because

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
of the distance and i was quite

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.730 
of the distance and i was quite
impressed<00:01:59.069> when<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.599> day<00:02:00.750> md<00:02:01.020> engineers<00:02:01.500> came

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
impressed when one day md engineers came

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
impressed when one day md engineers came
to<00:02:02.310> brisbane<00:02:02.640> australia<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.209> spent<00:02:03.569> the

to brisbane australia and spent the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.600 
to brisbane australia and spent the

whole week without with us working

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.910 
whole week without with us working
through<00:02:05.849> the<00:02:06.000> issues<00:02:06.289> finding<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.500> best<00:02:07.679> way

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
through the issues finding the best way

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
through the issues finding the best way
to<00:02:08.700> incorporate<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.269> technology<00:02:09.810> into<00:02:10.019> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
to incorporate the technology into the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.880 
to incorporate the technology into the
engine<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:11.760> relationship<00:02:12.060> went<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.140> we

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
engine and that relationship went on we

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.870 
engine and that relationship went on we
collaborated<00:02:14.640> remotely<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:16.340> for<00:02:17.340> quite<00:02:17.640> some

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
collaborated remotely for for quite some

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.650 
collaborated remotely for for quite some
time<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.870> really<00:02:19.670> polished<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.850> 10.1

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
time and we really polished it 10.1

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.170 
time and we really polished it 10.1
implementation<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.980> think<00:02:23.250> delivered<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
implementation and I think delivered the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.170 
implementation and I think delivered the
