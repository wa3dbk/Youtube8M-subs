00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.660
 kaiserslautern welcome the ex coach 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.210
 franco foda and party boss strengthened and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.050
 da franco foda is of course first 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.700
 calculating colleague was today 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.550
 absolutely deserved defeat 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.230
 we were not from the beginning to the game 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 we actually set out to do 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.039
 and they had the 1 0 and the shelves 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.530
 were seven dogs follow appear 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.110
 Let us present ourselves once 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.090
 have clear for a second half long with a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.649
 man less we have also 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.150
 all those who have just played 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.230
 further compact 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.340
 half defended after winning the ball 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.390
 quickly switched 23 clubs still to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.150
 many mistakes committed 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.370
 help them last time and again possible 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.260
 also a springer contracts but at the 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.960
 today we have too little 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.180
 simply invest many basic virtues 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.540
 left at home and therefore also in 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.590
 this height deserves to be lost 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.900
 Stefan over the wheel a bit 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.220
 This week's press conference is turning back 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.980
 I also have the set and benny prettier 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.870
 with an outstanding performance the 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.210
 Forget the small town in cottbus 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.520
 want to give them almost prophetic 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.760
 knowledge ago 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.340
 amazing how you feel about outstanding 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.590
 I do not know achievement so I believe 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.810
 simply franco foda has already said 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.970
 have that red card of course us 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.260
 have played the cards and that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.280
 then a little easier on us 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.310
 been and sometimes played well 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.860
 In any case, these are games 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.110
 really in the second league a lot 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.620
 very tight then beats but the quad 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.320
 core cpus and what are we losing against ? 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.910
 cottbus because winning was going 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.950
 these games are decided in detail 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.290
 and then a red card is the edges 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.080
 Of course, then do a lot for it 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.960
 that the games win and technical 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.510
 are well versed 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.490
 in possession ball possession and therefore 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.020
 have evolved and it was around 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.030
 to work out opportunities 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.010
 that should now also known 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.680
 be and have done that 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.680
 that was good nothing more
