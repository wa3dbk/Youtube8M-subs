00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.559
 not long ago a brave mouse 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.889
 but naughty discovered a world that I 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.330
 I had created for forgotten books 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.190
 Disney brings us the second installment of the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.869
 picnic saga and a game that in this 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.849
 occasion brings us with the title of 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.830
 return of two heroes and of which here you 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.699
 we bring your analysis for your version of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.699
 Xbox 360 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.920
 earthquakes 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.900
 normal story of the game is situated 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.550
 in the pÃ¡ramo a place to which they are going to stop 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.680
 the cartoons that have been 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.770
 forgotten and which is now ravaged 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.540
 for a series of mysterious earthquakes 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 although everything suggests that the doctor 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.440
 crazy who we defeated in the first 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.000
 Delivery is once again behind all 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.010
 this one claims to have changed 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.830
 offering even the bear rabbit to 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.600
 make peace and work as a team 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.670
 but neither his girlfriend hydrangea nor his friend 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.470
 Consequently his intentions so 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.510
 will call back the only hero that 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.550
 can help you is the mickey mouse who 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.770
 will try once again to save this world 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.840
 making use of the magic brush or a weapon 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.850
 with which we can spray paint for 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.610
 create objects before us or launch 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.990
 solvents to make them disappear 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.990
 modifying if any of our the doctor 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.510
 and energy help us 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.659
 enter the mechanics of the gameplay 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.310
 of the title is again that of a game 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.319
 of platforms where there are also 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.240
 place for solving puzzles and 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.270
 many elements of adventure since 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.319
 its development is quite open 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.090
 It also presents a heavy load 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.100
 narrative and the possibility of carrying 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.450
 out both main missions and 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.759
 other secondary optional 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.469
 meeting with a crowd 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.270
 of secret characters with whom 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.219
 talk and stores to buy 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.180
 objects being always the player who 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.190
 mark the rhythm of the adventure 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.680
 you would not be here and if the pÃ¡ramo is not 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.990
 I was in happy we actually came to 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.940
 fix the projectors you know that they 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.740
 it has happened although no doubt the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.210
 most important feature of this 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.039
 delivery is the fact that football 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.020
 is now specially designed to be 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.450
 played in a cooperative mode together with a 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.220
 friend from the same console a player 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.959
 will take the role of mickey while 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.670
 the other will control oswald though 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.560
 inexplicably , the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.600
 option to play this through 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.730
 internet if in case of gambling in 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.200
 lonely will be in the cell itself that 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.200
 direct the second character 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.420
 however, the latter option is not the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.160
 most recommended and that our two 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.050
 protagonists possess skills 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.100
 different knowing also some 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.200
 tasks to be performed 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.000
 mandatorily 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.720
 come in bonn being even possible that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.380
 one character revives the other dies 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.150
 unfortunately the intelligence 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.650
 artificial console will not be on 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.510
 height of the circumstances in the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.260
 most times what can be 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.260
 something frustrating 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.020
 a little fabric we could save the 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.020
 bill 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.040
 I 'm coming 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.560
 in addition another detail that only 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.239
 affects this version of xbox 360 is that 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.159
 unlike what seen windows of 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.930
 thanks to his command we could aim the 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.250
 magic brush directly towards the 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.829
 screen in the microsoft console 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.900
 we must use the right stick moving 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.720
 a point of view to something that results a 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.340
 both uncomfortable and less fun in what 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.560
 Regarding the playstation version 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.630
 3 , this is corrected itself and thanks to 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.230
 optional use of playstation move 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.230
 but do not worry 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.780
 on the other hand in relation to the 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.820
 technical the juice shows off a finish 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.890
 artistic perfectly embodying the 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.420
 disney style being to mention that 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.130
 the cinematic scenes that 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.810
 interspersed throughout the game are 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.270
 authentic sequences of drawings 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.680
 animated created for the occasion 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.390
 keeping these faithful to the aesthetic 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.480
 classic of mickey mouse drawings 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.140
 to your face he gave curry some bombs 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.910
 of solvent but they take too much 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.840
 I naturally told goofy how 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.840
 update the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.510
 plus 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.880
 although it's fair to say that visually the 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.860
 game is below what would be 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.319
 wait for a console like the beatbox 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.090
 360 playstation3 resulting quite 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.889
 obvious that it is a game 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.720
 originally developed for the 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.180
 wii platform that has subsequently 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.650
 been versioned someone who add about 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.050
 load times that although not very 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.490
 long and they happen continuously since 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.050
 the areas in which the 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.430
 mapping of the game are usually 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.430
 pretty small 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.539
 hopefully the sound section is fulfilled 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.639
 to an unbeatable level finding us 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.590
 this time with the novelty of the use of voices 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.169
 in the dialogues having grasped all 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.030
 them dubbed in Spanish this will encompass 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.919
 also to the songs of the game since 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.509
 they are also interpreted in 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.860
 our language as it happens in the 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.860
 own disney movies 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:32.510
 I was a very bad divo but I'm no longer 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:36.020
 so that the crazy doctor so crazy 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.060
 now this in summary of picnic and the 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.950
 return of two heroes is a good title 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.050
 of adventures and platforms resulting 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.630
 Very fun is played accompanied by 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.160
 a friend also curiously for his 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.930
 complexity in the development of the 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.910
 adventure is geared to all kinds of 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.980
 public and not only towards the most 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.170
 small ones in the house as some might 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.000
 think about the fact that the mechanics of 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.440
 game is somewhat slow at times and 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.120
 especially the lack of a way 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.980
 cooperative online make you 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.210
 lose some points when giving 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.210
 our final assessment
