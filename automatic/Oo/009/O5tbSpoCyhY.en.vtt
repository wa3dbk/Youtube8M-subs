00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
others to deal with I think we have a

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.930 
others to deal with I think we have a
slightly<00:03:11.319> different<00:03:11.560> idea<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:14.519> what<00:03:15.519> what<00:03:15.819> we

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
slightly different idea of what what we

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
difficult parts about it but apart from

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.809 
difficult parts about it but apart from

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.390 

personally<00:04:40.990> what<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:41.320> was<00:04:41.620> gonna<00:04:41.800> do<00:04:41.980> from<00:04:42.220> here

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
personally what I was gonna do from here

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.220 
personally what I was gonna do from here
on<00:04:42.460> is<00:04:42.760> I'm<00:04:42.970> gonna<00:04:43.120> start<00:04:43.420> you<00:04:43.750> know<00:04:43.870> doing<00:04:43.900> a

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
on is I'm gonna start you know doing a

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.160 
on is I'm gonna start you know doing a
single<00:04:44.410> course<00:04:44.770> on<00:04:45.670> math<00:04:46.300> soon<00:04:46.780> because<00:04:47.080> I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
single course on math soon because I

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.320 
single course on math soon because I
didn't<00:04:47.580> didn't<00:04:48.580> show<00:04:48.700> up<00:04:48.850> for<00:04:48.970> my<00:04:49.090> math<00:04:49.300> exam

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
didn't didn't show up for my math exam

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.140 
didn't didn't show up for my math exam
for<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:50.560> guess<00:04:51.220> it<00:04:51.370> would<00:04:51.490> be<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.910> college

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
for I guess it would be a college

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.300 
for I guess it would be a college
equivalent<00:04:52.840> so<00:04:53.350> I'm<00:04:53.500> gonna<00:04:53.620> get<00:04:53.860> that<00:04:54.040> first

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
equivalent so I'm gonna get that first

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.640 
equivalent so I'm gonna get that first
and<00:04:56.100> yeah<00:04:57.210> probably<00:04:58.210> start<00:04:58.720> University<00:04:58.900> if<00:04:59.530> I

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
and yeah probably start University if I

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.520 
and yeah probably start University if I
can<00:04:59.830> get<00:04:59.980> in<00:05:00.160> which<00:05:00.790> I<00:05:01.180> really<00:05:01.900> want<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.290> and

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530
