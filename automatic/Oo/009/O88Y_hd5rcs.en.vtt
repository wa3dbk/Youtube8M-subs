00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.530
 two 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.059
 ingested as I followed your week is 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.160
 a comment here below and today is 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.830
 Thursday of kraft and I want to teach them to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.690
 make a good pop-up card 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.400
 peculiarity that when opening it has a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.560
 small twist 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.140
 and you will not believe how easy it is to 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.630
 do 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.910
 I am using it to generate a 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.009
 card for a birthday that's why 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.140
 I put a cake on top but you can 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.910
 change it for a photo or some text what 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.829
 what you like most depends on your 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.870
 creativity and the materials that we are going to 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.120
 use are super easy to get 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.100
 and if you are new around here do not forget 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.379
 to subscribe to a new video all 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.920
 the games and now if we are going to see how 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:52.309
 it is done we will use a cardboard of 30 x 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.670
 15 centimeters two circular cards 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.460
 with a diameter of 6 centimeters for 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.180
 this opens the compass to 3 centimeters and 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.519
 then trace your circle glue and what 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.039
 that you are going to use to decorate 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.450
 we will take the circles and one of them what 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.450
 we will fold in half 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.260
 now we will take the other and equal 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.260
 we will fold it in half 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.780
 then we will fold again in half and 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.420
 we will mark only the bottom 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.880
 to have a reference 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.140
 and we will take the lower edge towards the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.140
 center in this way 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.230
 then we will do the same with the end 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.230
 contrary 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.650
 we will do everything 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.950
 and we will push from the center towards 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.530
 in to reverse the folds should 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.460
 remain something like this now will repeat sixth with 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.460
 the opposite end 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.290
 now we will take a small band of 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.180
 cardboard and we will put rubber and what 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.430
 we will see on the first side of the part 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.319
 inside of the last figure that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.569
 we double 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.219
 and we'll take the second circle and 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.550
 we will stick this earth in the part 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:32.310
 interior on the second side 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.240
 in this way so far you owe 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.240
 something like this 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.510
 now we will turn around 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.490
 and we will do the same we will stick in the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.490
 first side of the inside 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.879
 and likewise in the upper part 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.060
 wait until it dries well and then 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.069
 you will see that it can be opened and that 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.840
 the circle on top rotate 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.239
 now in the upper circle we will stick 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.750
 the cake or the photograph or the message or 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.660
 whatever you want me to go on the card 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.540
 now we will take the card of 30 x 15 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.540
 centimeters and we'll fold it in half 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.060
 we will return to take the figure we made 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.690
 above and we will put rubber in these 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.690
 triangles 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.780
 then we will hit it right to the center of 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.569
 the whole card 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.220
 and you will open very carefully to see that 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.770
 everything is correct 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.040
 then you will close again and you will let 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.040
 I know that 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.330
 and now you just need to decorate I'm 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.519
 using a couple of cuts and a little 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.720
 of decorative ribbon and of course I'm 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.720
 writing a couple of things 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.470
 and as you saw it is super easy to do and 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.780
 you can give it a lot of uses and just 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.489
 it depends on your creativity and if you make 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.200
 this craft do not forget to send 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.510
 the photos to the social networks that you 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.459
