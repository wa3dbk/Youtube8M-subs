00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you can see the difference you get a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
you can see the difference you get a
much<00:01:25.920> wider<00:01:26.189> field<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.700> view<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.720> you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
much wider field of view now here you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.050 
much wider field of view now here you
can<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.170> before<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.650> afters<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.369> test

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
can see the before and afters with test

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.050 
can see the before and afters with test
footage<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> test<00:01:30.990> pictures<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
footage and test pictures of with and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.109 
footage and test pictures of with and
without<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> lens<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.220> makes<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.460> artistic

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
without the lens and makes it artistic

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.819 
without the lens and makes it artistic
it<00:01:36.240> makes<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.689> entire<00:01:37.049> picture<00:01:37.290> I'm

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it makes the entire picture I'm

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.280 
it makes the entire picture I'm
different<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.909> has<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> different<00:01:39.750> perspective

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
different it has a different perspective

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.080 
different it has a different perspective
on<00:01:40.680> point<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.979> view<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.549> entire<00:01:41.610> picture

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
on point of view of the entire picture

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
on point of view of the entire picture
so<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.659> could<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.560> advantage<00:01:43.710> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
so you could really take advantage of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.700
