cleaner or something I don't know but
obviously<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.950> we've<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.280> heard<00:00:50.460> by<00:00:50.670> now

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
obviously I think we've all heard by now

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420 
obviously I think we've all heard by now
that<00:00:50.879> Beauty<00:00:51.449> Blender<00:00:51.840> has<00:00:52.379> these<00:00:52.620> small<00:00:53.190> ones

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430

that<00:00:53.640> kind<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:55.010> but<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.430> think

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that kind of look like this but I think

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.209 
that kind of look like this but I think
you<00:00:56.879> might<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.270> two<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.989> 20<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.680> even<00:00:58.980> then

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you might get two for 20 but even then

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.180 
you might get two for 20 but even then
I'm<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.199> serious<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.920> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
I'm like it's it's not that serious so I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.250 
I'm like it's it's not that serious so I
decided<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> try<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> Claire's<00:01:03.719> ones<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
decided to try out the Claire's ones to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.890 
decided to try out the Claire's ones to
do<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> first<00:01:04.949> impression<00:01:05.850> again<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> what

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
do a first impression again this is what

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.850 
do a first impression again this is what
they<00:01:07.020> look<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:08.310> one<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.820> damp<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
they look like this one is damp and and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.030 
they look like this one is damp and and
no<00:01:11.130> means<00:01:11.369> did<00:01:11.939> did<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> grow<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
no means did did it grow so this is the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.630 
no means did did it grow so this is the
damp<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.830> non<00:01:17.040> damp<00:01:17.400> one

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
damp one and this is the non damp one

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.730 
damp one and this is the non damp one
and<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> same<00:01:20.520> size<00:01:20.820> no<00:01:21.740> difference

and they are the same size no difference

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
and they are the same size no difference
in<00:01:22.890> sizing<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.400> I'm<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.939> use<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> damp<00:01:24.689> one

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
in sizing so I'm going to use a damp one

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.080 
in sizing so I'm going to use a damp one
and<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:26.460> my<00:01:27.650> concealer<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:29.340> can't<00:01:29.729> believe<00:01:29.909> that

sure<00:04:49.010> it's<00:04:49.130> blended<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:49.850> you<00:04:49.940> don't<00:04:50.120> have<00:04:50.270> all

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
sure it's blended so you don't have all

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.450 
sure it's blended so you don't have all
be<00:04:50.630> just<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.170> white<00:04:51.530> line<00:04:51.800> going<00:04:52.040> across<00:04:52.190> your

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
be just a white line going across your

face<00:04:52.640> I<00:04:54.070> guess<00:04:55.070> I<00:04:55.190> don't<00:04:55.460> find<00:04:56.030> this<00:04:56.300> worth<00:04:56.840> it

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
face I guess I don't find this worth it

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.310 
face I guess I don't find this worth it
I<00:04:57.670> honestly<00:04:58.670> would<00:04:58.970> still<00:04:59.300> say<00:04:59.660> buy<00:04:59.960> this

fits perfectly I feel like it blends it
out<00:05:19.700> so<00:05:20.000> much<00:05:20.120> faster<00:05:20.630> um<00:05:21.610> then<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:24.680> thing<00:05:24.950> so

that<00:05:25.910> is<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.270> final<00:05:26.690> thoughts<00:05:26.990> on<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.320> mini

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
that is the final thoughts on the mini

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.469 
that is the final thoughts on the mini
blending<00:05:29.690> sponge<00:05:30.080> from<00:05:30.860> Claire's<00:05:31.580> I<00:05:31.940> think<00:05:32.390> I

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
blending sponge from Claire's I think I

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:33.110 
blending sponge from Claire's I think I
mean<00:05:32.690> of

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
mean of

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.080 
mean of
it<00:05:33.900> did<00:05:34.169> its<00:05:34.350> job<00:05:34.440> okay<00:05:35.040> I'm<00:05:35.220> not<00:05:35.400> gonna<00:05:35.550> lie<00:05:35.790> it

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
it did its job okay I'm not gonna lie it

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.570 
it did its job okay I'm not gonna lie it
did<00:05:36.360> its<00:05:36.600> job<00:05:36.660> it<00:05:37.080> it<00:05:37.919> blended<00:05:38.340> out<00:05:38.430> my

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
did its job it it blended out my

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.000 
did its job it it blended out my
concealer<00:05:38.760> great<00:05:39.330> I<00:05:39.510> just<00:05:39.540> feel<00:05:39.930> like<00:05:40.169> you<00:05:40.830> can

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
concealer great I just feel like you can

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.840 
concealer great I just feel like you can
receive<00:05:41.540> the<00:05:42.540> same<00:05:42.960> results<00:05:43.710> as<00:05:43.979> if<00:05:44.550> you<00:05:44.669> use

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
receive the same results as if you use

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.170 
receive the same results as if you use
your<00:05:45.180> regular<00:05:45.590> Beauty<00:05:46.590> Blender<00:05:47.010> I<00:05:47.310> guess<00:05:47.699> for

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
your regular Beauty Blender I guess for

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.540 
your regular Beauty Blender I guess for
the<00:05:48.360> price<00:05:48.600> it<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.050> cheaper<00:05:49.650> you<00:05:49.830> do<00:05:50.070> get<00:05:50.250> three

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
the price it is cheaper you do get three

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.090 
the price it is cheaper you do get three
of<00:05:50.760> these<00:05:50.940> and<00:05:51.840> it<00:05:52.110> does<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.380> same<00:05:52.590> job<00:05:52.650> it

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
of these and it does the same job it

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.370 
of these and it does the same job it
blends<00:05:53.340> out<00:05:53.490> your<00:05:53.639> concealer<00:05:54.150> just<00:05:54.600> fine<00:05:54.960> me

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
blends out your concealer just fine me

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.469 
blends out your concealer just fine me
personally<00:05:55.770> I<00:05:56.100> find<00:05:56.520> more<00:05:56.790> value<00:05:57.060> in<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.300> time

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
personally I find more value in the time

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.590 
personally I find more value in the time
I<00:05:57.660> save<00:05:57.900> and<00:05:58.169> just<00:05:58.229> having<00:05:59.190> to<00:05:59.310> dab<00:05:59.610> and<00:06:00.060> dab

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
I save and just having to dab and dab

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.860 
I save and just having to dab and dab
and<00:06:00.990> dab<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:01.740> uh<00:06:02.160> forever<00:06:02.729> for<00:06:03.540> something

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
and dab and uh forever for something

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.990 
and dab and uh forever for something
that's<00:06:04.050> really<00:06:04.410> dense<00:06:04.800> and<00:06:05.070> hard<00:06:05.430> you<00:06:05.610> really

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
that's really dense and hard you really

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.939 
that's really dense and hard you really
aren't<00:06:06.210> just<00:06:06.419> dabbing<00:06:06.900> yourself<00:06:07.500> in<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.710> face

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
aren't just dabbing yourself in the face

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.210 
aren't just dabbing yourself in the face
um<00:06:08.190> so<00:06:09.060> for<00:06:09.240> that<00:06:09.449> value<00:06:10.020> I<00:06:10.260> would<00:06:10.830> just<00:06:11.010> say<00:06:11.190> go

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
um so for that value I would just say go

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.350 
um so for that value I would just say go
for<00:06:11.639> a<00:06:11.669> regular<00:06:12.240> Beauty<00:06:13.169> Blender<00:06:13.590> or<00:06:14.460> I<00:06:14.940> feel

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
for a regular Beauty Blender or I feel

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.480 
for a regular Beauty Blender or I feel
like<00:06:15.479> even<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.139> the<00:06:16.770> original<00:06:16.979> Beauty

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
like even the the original Beauty

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.219 
like even the the original Beauty
Blender<00:06:17.820> mini<00:06:18.030> ones<00:06:18.270> are<00:06:18.479> probably<00:06:18.840> gonna<00:06:19.020> be

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
Blender mini ones are probably gonna be

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:20.420 
Blender mini ones are probably gonna be
a<00:06:19.260> little<00:06:19.500> bit<00:06:19.620> better<00:06:19.740> than<00:06:20.010> this<00:06:20.130> just

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
a little bit better than this just

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.060 
a little bit better than this just
because<00:06:20.789> from<00:06:21.600> what<00:06:21.900> I've<00:06:22.110> heard<00:06:22.139> all<00:06:22.770> the

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
because from what I've heard all the

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.790 
because from what I've heard all the
dupes<00:06:23.699> are<00:06:24.060> harder<00:06:24.780> and<00:06:25.020> more<00:06:25.169> denser<00:06:25.620> than

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
dupes are harder and more denser than

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.830 
dupes are harder and more denser than
the<00:06:25.860> originals<00:06:26.400> so<00:06:26.580> I'm<00:06:26.910> going<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.270> assume

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
the originals so I'm going to assume

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.870 
the originals so I'm going to assume
that<00:06:27.900> these<00:06:28.380> are<00:06:28.590> harder<00:06:28.919> and<00:06:28.949> denser<00:06:29.490> than

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
that these are harder and denser than

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.210 
that these are harder and denser than
the<00:06:29.940> original<00:06:30.810> mini<00:06:30.960> ones<00:06:31.169> as<00:06:31.380> well<00:06:31.620> so<00:06:32.070> that's

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
the original mini ones as well so that's

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.980 
the original mini ones as well so that's
my<00:06:32.610> personal<00:06:33.060> opinion

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
my personal opinion

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.250 
my personal opinion
