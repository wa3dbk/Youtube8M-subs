00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
if you're a bit smaller there is a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.179 
if you're a bit smaller there is a
monofilament<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> that's<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.470> family<00:01:25.950> it's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
monofilament so that's my family it's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.300 
monofilament so that's my family it's
rule<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.420> put<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:28.020> feet<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> pockets

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
rule you put your feet in the pockets

rule you put your feet in the pockets
and<00:01:29.520> there<00:01:29.909> were<00:01:30.060> these<00:01:30.180> stretchy<00:01:30.540> once<00:01:30.810> again

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and there were these stretchy once again

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.069 
and there were these stretchy once again
so<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> bet<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.640> good<00:01:32.790> except<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.390> two<00:01:33.780> all

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
so so I bet it's good except for two all

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.390 
so so I bet it's good except for two all
foot<00:01:34.530> sizes<00:01:36.380> actually<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.860> llama<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
foot sizes actually this llama thing is

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.320 
foot sizes actually this llama thing is
really<00:01:38.549> comfortable<00:01:39.030> way<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.689> calm

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
really comfortable way more calm

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.310 
really comfortable way more calm
my<00:01:40.690> Magic's<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.290> little<00:01:41.500> deep<00:01:42.540> I'm<00:01:43.540> not<00:01:43.840> sure<00:01:44.080> if

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
my Magic's a little deep I'm not sure if

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.880 
my Magic's a little deep I'm not sure if
you<00:01:44.530> can<00:01:44.770> take<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.250> mark<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.670> outdoor<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:50.680> you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
you can take the mark in outdoor as you

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.400 
you can take the mark in outdoor as you
can<00:01:51.070> see<00:01:51.280> there's<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.700> really<00:01:52.600> pretty<00:01:52.870> strong

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
can see there's a really pretty strong

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.880 
can see there's a really pretty strong
sign<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:54.250> ends<00:01:54.790> up<00:01:54.880> right<00:01:55.330> here<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.380> there

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
sign it ends up right here and there

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.840 
sign it ends up right here and there
there's<00:01:57.190> like<00:01:57.600> blue<00:01:58.600> light<00:01:59.500> blue<00:01:59.860> lines<00:02:00.370> I

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
there's like blue light blue lines I

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.140 
there's like blue light blue lines I
guess<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.990> has<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.230> really<00:02:02.920> pretty<00:02:03.100> fluke<00:02:03.790> shape

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
guess it has a really pretty fluke shape

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.220 
guess it has a really pretty fluke shape
too<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.490> then<00:02:06.670> water<00:02:06.910> it<00:02:07.120> bends<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.510> lot<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.170> you

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
too and then water it bends a lot so you

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.730 
too and then water it bends a lot so you
can<00:02:08.530> see<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.800> difference<00:02:09.220> between<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:11.410> front

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
can see the difference between the front

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.250 
can see the difference between the front
with<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:11.950> light<00:02:12.190> blue<00:02:12.430> medium<00:02:12.850> blue<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:14.080> at

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
with the light blue medium blue and at

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.790 
with the light blue medium blue and at
the<00:02:14.410> back<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:15.580> really<00:02:15.910> dark<00:02:16.660> really<00:02:17.380> pretty

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
the back is really dark really pretty

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.990 
the back is really dark really pretty
blue<00:02:19.320> there<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> seam<00:02:21.010> but<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.370> really<00:02:21.580> not

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
blue there is a seam but it's really not

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.840 
blue there is a seam but it's really not
very<00:02:22.060> noticeable<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.470> me<00:02:23.710> repeat<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.640> it's

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
very noticeable it's a me repeat so it's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.170 
very noticeable it's a me repeat so it's
um<00:02:25.260> made<00:02:26.260> from<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.740> same<00:02:27.010> fabric<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:28.060> to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
um made from the same fabric like to

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.380 
um made from the same fabric like to
make<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.500> swimsuit<00:02:29.500> slip<00:02:30.130> really<00:02:30.940> strong<00:02:31.240> it's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
make a swimsuit slip really strong it's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.660 
make a swimsuit slip really strong it's
perfect<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:32.080> go<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> water<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:33.220> may<00:02:33.460> be<00:02:33.520> a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
perfect to go in the water it may be a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.210 
perfect to go in the water it may be a
little<00:02:33.820> less<00:02:34.090> realistic<00:02:34.510> than<00:02:34.990> other<00:02:35.680> fabric

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
little less realistic than other fabric

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.580 
little less realistic than other fabric
so<00:02:36.400> I'm<00:02:36.520> cynical<00:02:36.850> but<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:37.810> definitely<00:02:38.050> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
so I'm cynical but it's definitely the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.900 
so I'm cynical but it's definitely the
best<00:02:38.800> thing<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.310> make<00:02:39.490> and<00:02:39.700> wanna<00:02:39.850> try

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
best thing you can make and wanna try

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.280 
best thing you can make and wanna try
personally<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.180> think<00:02:43.270> this<00:02:43.600> town<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.870> great

personally I think this town is great
for<00:02:44.500> beginners<00:02:44.670> because<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:46.120> really

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450

for beginners because it's really
comfortable<00:02:46.900> it's<00:02:47.380> one<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.800> cheapest

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
comfortable it's one of the cheapest

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.949 
comfortable it's one of the cheapest
stands<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.760> could<00:02:48.940> find<00:02:49.209> on<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.360> Internet

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
stands I could find on the Internet

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.100 
stands I could find on the Internet
and<00:02:50.200> it's<00:02:50.920> not<00:02:51.489> that<00:02:51.610> hard<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.940> swim<00:02:52.209> in<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
and it's not that hard to swim in it the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.720 
and it's not that hard to swim in it the
mountain<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.650> really<00:02:53.830> light<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.160> comfortable

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
mountain is really light and comfortable

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.540 
mountain is really light and comfortable
of<00:02:55.060> course<00:02:55.959> it's<00:02:56.200> not<00:02:56.410> as<00:02:56.620> realistic<00:02:56.950> looking

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
of course it's not as realistic looking

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.120 
of course it's not as realistic looking
at<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.880> silicon<00:02:58.360> tail<00:02:58.630> but<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.230> think<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.890> if

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
at the silicon tail but I think that if

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.460 
at the silicon tail but I think that if
you<00:03:00.459> want<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.730> start<00:03:01.030> meeting<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.110> see<00:03:02.290> if<00:03:02.350> you

you want to start meeting and see if you

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.800 
you want to start meeting and see if you
