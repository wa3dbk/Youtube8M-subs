00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.559
 I am Russell Doctrove, the chef of the Fish &amp; Meat restaurant in Central. 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:30.250
 Today I will demonstrate a simple dish here. 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.862
 Slow-cooked Italian roast pork with fennel, clams and pesto 

00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:40.392
 The first thing we have to do is burn off the remaining hair on the surface of the pigskin. 

00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:44.860
 You can burn the hair with a musket 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.326
 When we do it, we usually use this tool to insert holes in the pigskin. 

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:55.663
 After being placed in the oven, the outer skin will foam and become crispy. 

00:01:01.877 --> 00:01:06.737
 The next step is to cut the cortex 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.721
 So we can get rid of the excess fat 

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:18.322
 We only need to leave half a centimeter thick pigskin. 

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:22.236
 Take a very sharp knife 

00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:26.228
 Repeat this action 

00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:33.520
 Now cut the whole skin layer. 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.657
 Will be used next 

00:01:35.657 --> 00:01:39.153
 Now I have to deal with the remaining piglets. 

00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:45.262
 Check to see if there is anything too much fat 

00:01:45.262 --> 00:01:53.619
 We won't cut all the fat, because it keeps the meat moist and does not kill completely when it is cooked. 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.596
 Usually here is the pork ribs, there will be some cartilage in the middle. 

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:02.117
 Now we carefully cut them away too. 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.493
 The next step is to season the roast pork and roll it up. 

00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:13.926
 The first thing we want to do is salt. 

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:19.448
 Don't be afraid to put more salt, then you can get the whole piece of meat to be seasoned. 

00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:24.993
 Next is a little cayenne pepper to add some spicy to the pork. 

00:02:24.993 --> 00:02:27.620
 Sprinkle with fennel seeds 

00:02:29.897 --> 00:02:33.106
 Then rosemary and thyme 

00:02:35.276 --> 00:02:38.334
 There are garlic slices 

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:43.641
 And lemon peel, usually a pork chop I will use the whole lemon 

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:53.823
 The last layer is Panyu, and it’s not too tight. 

00:02:54.652 --> 00:02:59.291
 Try to get as tight as possible 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.349
 It’s okay to drop a little marinade. 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:15.519
 Now bring the pigskin back 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.916
 Spread it like a quilt 

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:21.047
 The next step is to start to set up piglets. 

00:03:21.047 --> 00:03:32.349
 Starting from the top, try to tie as tight as possible. 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.495
 Tighten below and tie it again 

00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:38.993
 Use all your strength to tighten 

00:03:38.993 --> 00:03:40.176
 Tied the knot 

00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:46.061
 If you tie in the same direction, you will eventually squeeze out all the marinade. 

00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:49.816
 So I will tie it from two directions 

00:03:49.816 --> 00:03:52.657
 Basically just repeat this step 

00:03:52.657 --> 00:03:57.375
 Until you are sure that the piglets are firmly tied 

00:03:57.375 --> 00:04:00.207
 Now we are ready 

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:03.793
 The last step is to apply olive oil and sea salt. 

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:06.541
 Put in the oven for about four to five hours 

00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:12.211
 Take a big plate, which is filled with three quarters of water. 

00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:15.388
 This can play the role of steaming 

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:17.747
 Ensure that the temperature is stable during cooking 

00:04:17.747 --> 00:04:21.012
 Then put the shelf on it 

00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:24.648
 Put the pork chop directly on it. 

00:04:24.648 --> 00:04:27.094
 After two hours 

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:28.954
 We will turn the pork chop 

00:04:28.954 --> 00:04:32.187
 Make sure the other side is also baked to the same crispy 

00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:33.259
 Put in front of the furnace 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:40.501
 Add a little more olive oil and sea salt 

00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:44.633
 Helps the skin to be baked until crispy 

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:50.979
 Now carefully put it in the oven 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.828
 Usually we will put the saucer together with two sauces. 

00:04:53.828 --> 00:04:59.022
 They are homemade Gremolata and sweet apple jam. 

00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:07.124
 Finally, pour the homemade pork juice 

00:05:08.092 --> 00:05:11.672
 This is the Italian roast pig with fennel, clams and pesto
