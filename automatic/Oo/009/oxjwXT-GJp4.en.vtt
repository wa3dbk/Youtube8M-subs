00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
on the right side of it for a 40 moment

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.500

if<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.160> cool<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.829> extruder<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.510> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
if that cool of the extruder of the

if that cool of the extruder of the
filament<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> extruder<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.520> I'm

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
filament going to the extruder so I'm

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.430 
filament going to the extruder so I'm
not<00:00:42.000> exactly<00:00:42.329> sure<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.110> called<00:00:43.350> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
not exactly sure what that's called I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.310 
not exactly sure what that's called I
think<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:44.030> Bowden<00:00:45.030> extruder<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.050> I'm

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
think it's a Bowden extruder but if I'm

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.410 
think it's a Bowden extruder but if I'm
wrong<00:00:46.530> I'm<00:00:46.800> wrong<00:00:47.070> please<00:00:47.460> correct<00:00:47.969> me<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
wrong I'm wrong please correct me in the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.420
