elephants<00:00:21.810> elephants<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.770> adapted<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
elephants elephants have adapted to the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.999 
elephants elephants have adapted to the
environment<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:24.180> many<00:00:24.359> ways<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:25.410> example<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
environment in many ways for example the

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.620 
environment in many ways for example the
elephant's<00:00:26.460> trunk<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> there<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.360> it<00:00:27.509> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
elephant's trunk and there was it to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.689 
elephant's trunk and there was it to
suck<00:00:27.840> up<00:00:28.020> water<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.500> spray<00:00:29.009> it<00:00:29.130> back<00:00:29.279> into<00:00:29.460> its

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
suck up water and spray it back into its

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.939 
suck up water and spray it back into its
mouth<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.570> also<00:00:30.750> allows<00:00:31.140> them<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> reach<00:00:31.680> over

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
mouth it also allows them to reach over

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.000 
mouth it also allows them to reach over
the<00:00:32.129> trees<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:33.000> get<00:00:33.150> lazy<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.379> trunk<00:00:34.650> also

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the trees to get lazy the trunk also

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.250 
the trees to get lazy the trunk also
lets<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.550> Alpha<00:00:36.120> pick<00:00:36.330> up<00:00:36.449> various<00:00:36.780> objects

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
lets the Alpha pick up various objects

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.160 
lets the Alpha pick up various objects
their<00:00:38.190> ears<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.730> also<00:00:38.940> another<00:00:39.300> adaptation

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
their ears are also another adaptation

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.530 
their ears are also another adaptation
in<00:00:40.500> very<00:00:40.860> hot<00:00:41.100> climate<00:00:41.280> conditions<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
in very hot climate conditions the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.140 
in very hot climate conditions the
elephant<00:00:43.019> can<00:00:43.140> use<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.470> is<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> fan<00:00:44.370> also

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
elephant can use it is as a fan also

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.810 
elephant can use it is as a fan also
that<00:00:45.989> large<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.589> to<00:00:46.800> help<00:00:47.040> them<00:00:47.190> detect<00:00:47.519> and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
that large is to help them detect and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:57.780 
that large is to help them detect and
hear<00:00:48.059> predators

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.010 

penguins<00:00:58.790> have<00:00:59.030> webbed<00:00:59.360> feet

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
penguins have webbed feet

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.410 
penguins have webbed feet
to<00:01:00.350> help<00:01:00.590> them<00:01:00.770> swim<00:01:00.950> better<00:01:01.160> underwater<00:01:01.730> they

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
to help them swim better underwater they

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.360 
to help them swim better underwater they
also<00:01:02.630> have<00:01:02.960> streamlined<00:01:03.320> bodies<00:01:03.920> which

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
also have streamlined bodies which

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.040 
also have streamlined bodies which
allows<00:01:04.640> them<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.850> feed<00:01:05.180> efficiently<00:01:05.750> on<00:01:05.870> their

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
allows them to feed efficiently on their

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.310 
allows them to feed efficiently on their
prey<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.890> reduces<00:01:07.220> drag<00:01:07.580> in<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:07.820> water

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
prey and that reduces drag in the water

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.020 
prey and that reduces drag in the water
because<00:01:09.320> they<00:01:09.470> cannot<00:01:09.680> fly<00:01:09.890> their<00:01:10.610> wings<00:01:10.880> are

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
because they cannot fly their wings are

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.820 
because they cannot fly their wings are
shaped<00:01:11.090> like<00:01:11.450> butchers<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.230> they're<00:01:12.500> willing

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
shaped like butchers and they're willing

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.950 
shaped like butchers and they're willing
to<00:01:12.860> swim<00:01:13.190> in<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.430> ocean<00:01:13.460> up<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.450> speed<00:01:14.690> about
