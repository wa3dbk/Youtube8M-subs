00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 everyone can have at home a 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.359
 Gourmet hotpot even on a small balcony 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.730
 for this one we will take some 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.780
 tomatoes peppers carnations of india 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.820
 and basil 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.370
 they all need the same soil a 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.440
 fertile and rich soil just about the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.210
 same needs in watering it will be necessary 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.220
 watch especially on days when there 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 will have a big heat will not hesitate 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.090
 to water every day in addition to these 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.730
 plants are complementary to each other 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.820
 the tomato will promote the growth of the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.570
 basil basil re loix deny some 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.279
 undesirable 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.770
 just like the eye and india who is going 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.880
 to keep away harmful insects 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.880
 we will start the plantation 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.660
 I like to touch the earth but 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.050
 you can use a shovel if you 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.050
 feel like it 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.760
 so the tomato foot it is he who 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.659
 will be the highest we will put it at 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.180
 bottom of the planter 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.000
 it's already full of berries we're going 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.830
 put the basilisk on his foot and a 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.500
 little trick I told you she 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.450
 needed all the sun 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.580
 watch out basil does not like to have the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.649
 sun on the head in the afternoon so we 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.890
 will install it in the shade of the foot of 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.890
 tomato 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.189
 as you see on the tomatoes and 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.539
 peppers there are tutors it's 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.429
 very important to keep them because they 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.020
 will grow in height you 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.780
 can replace with other cutter in 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.000
 bamboo metal as you like I 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.500
 left room for the carnations the 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.929
 carnations will have a repellent effect 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.520
 about unwanted insects and that's 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.060
 valid also of course in the open ground 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.060
 in your kitchen garden 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.330
 these plants are rather chilly so 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.850
 wait for you and that the ice saints 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.890
 have gone to plant them and then to 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.369
 protect them in case of not very weather 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.959
 clement 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.640
 in the evening you will put a bell 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.209
 transparent top that makes you the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.670
 real in the morning we will position it well 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.349
 in the sun on the terrace to take a 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.119
 role plus it's going to allow to elevate 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.310
 the pot is to allow the water well 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.680
 flow 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.800
 of course we water abundantly and never 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.269
 on foliage especially tomatoes 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.340
 you will harvest the basil leaves 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.170
 as and by pinching them with 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.360
 the fingers and starting with that of the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.550
 top it will also remove 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.560
 regularly basil flowers do not 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.040
 did not let bloom otherwise it will be less 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.450
 good and he will lose his leaves 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.670
 you can achieve this skin you are 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.739
 of course well with tomatoes at wholesale 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.690
 fruits or big peppers there are 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.950
 mini peppers and all that of course can 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.620
 be done as in the ground at 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.970
 vegetable garden harvesting and salads 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.970
 it's for you in a short time
