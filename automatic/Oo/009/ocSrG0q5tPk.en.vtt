00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.460
 second round in the scrimmage now 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.960
 to change featherweight category 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.610
 for the heavyweights 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.500
 on one side the English cake that besides 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.870
 flour with more gluten goes up in the ring 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.179
 with corn starch and dried fruit if I 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 I have one would do a little gluten 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.470
 I can not keep the fruits 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.109
 percent of the people are fair is explained 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.260
 not only on the right side do we have the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.180
 mike tyson tasty heavier as 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 greasy and in my opinion the most 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.170
 of them take brown sugar and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.630
 normal sugar melted butter 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.630
 enough for me she packs several 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 half-bitter chocolate popcorn too 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.180
 detained the heavier flour in rose 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.180
 it's good 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.720
 it is famous beach many calories but 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.120
 they very heavy paper tastier good 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.550
 chocolate chocolate cool now let's 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.230
 recapitulate these six cake recipes 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.900
 of all that is kind does not have ones with 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.660
 yeast other without a leads oil other 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.340
 butter recipe with water without water 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.100
 but beyond the flour yesterday one thing 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.350
 so there all the goals we made 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.180
 the teacher explains that it is not 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.760
 coincidence that not everyone knows that 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.190
 water and oil do not mix right then 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.470
 the people have fat and have some liquid 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.330
 there the egg enters each leader we will see if 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.590
 in practice let's go there we have it here 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.690
 Water 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.380
 I'll put dye just to stay more 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.380
 visible 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.600
 let's put a little oil can 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.010
 able to put a little clear 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 egg 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.670
 in one of them 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.939
 now let's try to improve it's good to see if 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.530
 we can do a thrill to 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:56.130
 mix only they mix more work 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.579
 soon they start to fight again 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.369
 however here with the clear one we only 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.119
 sees a hero spine only with protein 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.479
 of egg white she can already do 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.400
 this aggregation action is what comes to 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.040
 all the ingredients of the pasta say so 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.040
 we're together so it's a chicken
