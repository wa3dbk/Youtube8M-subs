stations they go through different

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.819 
stations they go through different
patches<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.940> sounds<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:49.440> gonna<00:00:49.620> show<00:00:49.770> you

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
patches of sounds but I'm gonna show you

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.979 
patches of sounds but I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> use<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.090> effective<00:00:51.600> way

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
how to use it in a more effective way

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
how to use it in a more effective way
now<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.920> always<00:00:53.190> know<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.140> only<00:00:55.140> use<00:00:55.770> sonar

now as you always know I only use sonar

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.910 
now as you always know I only use sonar
people<00:00:57.149> sonar<00:00:57.870> that's<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.500> at

to be courtside or correlated with
channel<00:02:40.980> number<00:02:41.220> one<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.840> say<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
channel number one but say in the the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.280 
channel number one but say in the the
track<00:02:44.820> pane<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.120> want<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.570> put<00:02:45.750> another<00:02:45.960> sound

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
track pane I want to put another sound

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.500 
track pane I want to put another sound
in<00:02:46.500> there<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.790> might<00:02:47.970> not<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.300> able<00:02:48.450> to
