to fill your portafilter to the right

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.610 
to fill your portafilter to the right
level<00:00:46.539> actually<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:47.809> want<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.079> get<00:00:48.289> a<00:00:48.320> little

bit more the right press and then

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.520 
bit more the right press and then
usually<00:00:54.800> what<00:00:54.949> I<00:00:54.980> do<00:00:55.069> is<00:00:55.219> hit<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:56.260> single<00:00:57.260> shot

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
usually what I do is hit the single shot

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.090 
usually what I do is hit the single shot
button<00:00:58.039> to<00:00:58.370> run<00:00:58.609> one<00:00:58.999> shot<00:00:59.839> of<00:01:00.140> hot<00:01:00.379> water<00:01:00.679> in

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
button to run one shot of hot water in

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.310 
button to run one shot of hot water in
the<00:01:02.030> way<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:02.210> can<00:01:02.469> check<00:01:03.469> your<00:01:04.659> fill<00:01:05.659> level<00:01:06.110> is

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
the way you can check your fill level is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.020 
the way you can check your fill level is
they<00:01:06.680> give<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:07.400> this<00:01:07.580> little<00:01:08.830> razor<00:01:10.030> that

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
they give you this little razor that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.720 
they give you this little razor that
checks<00:01:11.480> if<00:01:11.870> you<00:01:11.990> can<00:01:12.170> see<00:01:12.440> that<00:01:12.680> that's<00:01:13.430> the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
checks if you can see that that's the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.450 
checks if you can see that that's the
proper<00:01:14.090> fill<00:01:14.690> level<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.470> that's<00:01:16.130> where<00:01:16.370> you

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
proper fill level so that's where you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.980 
proper fill level so that's where you
want<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:16.790> dial<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.750> grind<00:01:18.080> amount<00:01:18.560> in<00:01:18.800> and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
want to dial the grind amount in and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.860 
want to dial the grind amount in and
that<00:01:20.990> varies<00:01:21.440> with<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.910> grind<00:01:22.910> setting<00:01:23.540> and

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
that varies with the grind setting and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.350 
that varies with the grind setting and
the<00:01:24.110> kind<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.190> coffee<00:01:25.430> you<00:01:25.670> run<00:01:25.910> that's<00:01:26.180> going

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
the kind of coffee you run that's going

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.230 
the kind of coffee you run that's going
to<00:01:26.420> vary<00:01:27.010> so<00:01:28.010> then<00:01:28.310> all<00:01:28.550> you<00:01:28.700> do<00:01:28.960> dump<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.200> out

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
to vary so then all you do dump that out

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.140 
to vary so then all you do dump that out
put<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.270> in<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.080> this<00:01:33.410> is<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.730> I'll<00:01:34.730> run<00:01:35.120> a

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
put that in and this is a I'll run a

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.000 
put that in and this is a I'll run a
double<00:01:35.420> shot

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
double shot

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.240 
double shot
the<00:01:37.540> tamper<00:01:38.540> goes<00:01:38.720> back<00:01:39.080> up<00:01:39.290> there<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:43.130> I

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
the tamper goes back up there and I

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.850 
the tamper goes back up there and I
usually<00:01:43.610> put<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:43.970> in<00:01:44.120> my<00:01:44.240> cup<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.680> warm<00:01:45.680> it<00:01:45.800> up

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
usually put that in my cup to warm it up

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.140 
usually put that in my cup to warm it up
a<00:01:46.040> little<00:01:46.130> bit<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.170> see<00:01:48.380> now<00:01:48.620> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
a little bit and you can see now the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.390 
a little bit and you can see now the
brewing<00:01:50.150> is<00:01:50.480> brewing<00:01:51.050> pressure<00:01:51.410> is<00:01:51.800> kind<00:01:52.310> of

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
brewing is brewing pressure is kind of

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.900 
brewing is brewing pressure is kind of
right<00:01:52.660> you<00:01:53.660> want<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.900> be<00:01:54.050> within<00:01:54.320> here<00:01:54.980> to<00:01:55.250> over

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
right you want to be within here to over

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.680 
right you want to be within here to over
there<00:01:56.120> in<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.600> group<00:01:56.840> as<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.230> dark<00:01:57.890> range<00:01:58.690> there

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
there in the group as a dark range there

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.980 
there in the group as a dark range there
so<00:02:00.550> if<00:02:01.550> that's<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.480> little<00:02:02.690> bit<00:02:03.310> low<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:05.720> can

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
so if that's a little bit low you can

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.430 
so if that's a little bit low you can
make<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.410> grind<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.950> little<00:02:07.220> finer<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:08.750> I'm

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
make the grind a little finer and I'm

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.290 
make the grind a little finer and I'm
kind<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.399> right<00:02:10.640> at<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.090> top<00:02:11.450> edge<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.470> I

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
kind of right at the top edge of that I

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.180 
kind of right at the top edge of that I
notice<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.480> when<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.440> start<00:02:15.710> getting<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.160> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
notice it when you start getting to the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.370 
notice it when you start getting to the
higher<00:02:16.340> edge<00:02:17.090> it'll<00:02:17.420> start<00:02:17.780> dropping

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
higher edge it'll start dropping

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.650 
higher edge it'll start dropping
pressure<00:02:18.860> like<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.360> that's<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.480> good<00:02:22.660> pretty

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
pressure like that that's a good pretty

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.810 
pressure like that that's a good pretty
good<00:02:23.840> pressure<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.190> can<00:02:25.370> see<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
good pressure but you can see the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.880 
good pressure but you can see the
Machine<00:02:26.180> heated<00:02:26.630> up<00:02:26.780> really<00:02:27.170> quick<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.680> like

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
Machine heated up really quick I like

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.940 
Machine heated up really quick I like
that<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:29.540> uses<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.700> thermal<00:02:31.700> block<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.680> just

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
that it uses a thermal block so it just

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.340 
that it uses a thermal block so it just
heats<00:02:34.220> up<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.640> block<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.150> metal<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.810> then<00:02:35.900> pumps

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
heats up a block of metal and then pumps

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.180 
heats up a block of metal and then pumps
the<00:02:36.470> water<00:02:36.500> through<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.370> we're<00:02:38.090> done<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:40.070> can

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
the water through and we're done you can

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.270 
the water through and we're done you can
see<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.490> get<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.730> pretty<00:02:40.910> good<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:42.830> can<00:02:43.040> see

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
see you get it pretty good you can see

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.320 
see you get it pretty good you can see
the<00:02:43.780> crema<00:02:44.780> in<00:02:44.989> there<00:02:45.230> it's<00:02:45.380> pretty<00:02:45.620> good

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
the crema in there it's pretty good

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.570 
the crema in there it's pretty good
pretty<00:02:47.330> good<00:02:47.420> shot<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.200> espresso<00:02:48.620> I'd<00:02:49.280> like<00:02:49.459> to

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
I think I got it off of Amazon for

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.160 
I think I got it off of Amazon for
around<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:58.310> little<00:03:58.670> under<00:03:58.909> five<00:03:59.390> hundred<00:03:59.750> it

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
around a little under five hundred it

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.830 
around a little under five hundred it
was<00:04:00.379> 480<00:04:01.069> something<00:04:01.790> like<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.420> can<00:04:02.569> shop

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
was 480 something like that you can shop

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.390 
was 480 something like that you can shop
around<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.500> prices<00:04:04.040> vary<00:04:05.829> but<00:04:06.829> yeah<00:04:07.010> I've<00:04:07.190> had

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
around the prices vary but yeah I've had

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.330 
around the prices vary but yeah I've had
it<00:04:07.610> since<00:04:07.879> March<00:04:08.540> this<00:04:08.900> is<00:04:09.110> now<00:04:09.319> November<00:04:09.650> so

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
it since March this is now November so

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.759 
it since March this is now November so

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769

that's I think eight months I'd probably
use<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.310> three<00:04:13.549> or<00:04:13.610> four<00:04:13.700> times<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:14.690> day<00:04:14.720> about
