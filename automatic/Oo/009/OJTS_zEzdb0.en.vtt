actually one day before the event and
that<00:00:17.490> starts<00:00:17.880> tomorrow<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.660> am<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.039> gondola

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
that starts tomorrow I am on the gondola

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.279 
that starts tomorrow I am on the gondola
going<00:00:21.600> up<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.980> hill<00:00:23.269> this<00:00:24.269> gondola<00:00:24.570> takes<00:00:25.019> off

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
going up the hill this gondola takes off

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.019 
going up the hill this gondola takes off
from<00:00:26.029> about<00:00:27.140> well<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.460> services<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> very<00:00:29.760> top

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
from about well it services the very top

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.120 
from about well it services the very top
of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> mountain<00:00:32.059> and<00:00:33.290> I<00:00:34.290> think<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
of the mountain and I think this is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.040 
of the mountain and I think this is
right<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.850> window<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
right at the window right here the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.380 
right at the window right here the
primary<00:00:37.710> run<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.460> see<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> lot<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.969> photos

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
primary run that we see a lot of photos

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.959 
primary run that we see a lot of photos
from<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.780> event<00:00:39.989> at<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.420> this<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> map<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
from this event at so this is a map of

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.630 
from this event at so this is a map of
sold<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.739> what's<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:47.010> open<00:00:47.460> while

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
sold in here what's really open while

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.610 
sold in here what's really open while
we're<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.719> upper<00:00:49.050> portion<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we're here is the upper portion of the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.069 
we're here is the upper portion of the
mount<00:00:50.629> we<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.780> riding<00:00:52.340> primarily<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:54.079> while

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
mount we are riding primarily on while

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.650 
mount we are riding primarily on while
we're<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.829> gondola<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.120> right

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
we're on this gondola right here right

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.380 
we're on this gondola right here right
now<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:59.460> interesting<00:00:59.879> thing<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.090> this

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
now and the interesting thing about this

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.470 
now and the interesting thing about this
gondola<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:02.100> looks<00:01:02.340> relatively<00:01:02.910> small

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
gondola is this looks relatively small

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.719 
gondola is this looks relatively small
in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.719> map<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.979> amount<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.339> terrain

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
in the map but the amount of terrain

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.480 
in the map but the amount of terrain
that<00:01:05.760> gondola<00:01:06.450> serves<00:01:07.369> is<00:01:08.369> probably<00:01:09.119> more

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
that gondola serves is probably more

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.109 
that gondola serves is probably more
serviceable<00:01:11.490> acreage<00:01:12.119> than<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> rapaho<00:01:13.409> basin

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
serviceable acreage than a rapaho basin

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.940 
serviceable acreage than a rapaho basin
just<00:01:15.119> between<00:01:16.009> about<00:01:17.009> four<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:17.490> five<00:01:17.610> runs<00:01:18.950> its

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
just between about four or five runs its

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.240 
just between about four or five runs its
massive<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.970> here
