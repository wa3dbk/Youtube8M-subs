00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.130 
the six flags I'm a word that there's
probably<00:03:24.880> some<00:03:25.060> guys<00:03:25.239> making<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.690> way<00:03:25.900> over

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
probably some guys making the way over

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.350 
probably some guys making the way over
here<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:26.920> get<00:03:27.130> in<00:03:27.250> position<00:03:27.700> looking<00:03:28.120> around

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
here so I get in position looking around

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.509 
here so I get in position looking around
and<00:03:28.720> it's<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.590> importance<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.489> good

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
and it's just the importance of a good

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.370 
and it's just the importance of a good
start<00:03:31.000> if<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.450> can<00:03:31.660> get<00:03:31.810> your<00:03:31.959> men<00:03:32.230> in

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
start if you can get your men in

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.229 
start if you can get your men in
position<00:03:32.410> if<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:32.980> can<00:03:33.130> take<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.430> flags<00:03:33.760> that

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
position if you can take the flags that

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.840 
position if you can take the flags that
they<00:03:34.810> originally<00:03:35.709> capture<00:03:36.130> because<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:36.700> like

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
they originally capture because I like

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.810 
they originally capture because I like
Lenny<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.510> came<00:03:38.010> these<00:03:39.010> guys<00:03:39.190> just<00:03:39.430> run

Lenny that I came these guys just run
for<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.360> flags<00:03:40.630> they<00:03:41.230> all<00:03:41.380> go<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.650> first

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
for the flags they all go to the first

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.440 
for the flags they all go to the first
flag<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.430> they<00:03:42.489> all<00:03:42.640> move<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:43.000> from<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.209> first

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
flag and they all move on from the first

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.240 
flag and they all move on from the first
like<00:03:43.690> if<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.930> can<00:03:44.110> get<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.500> chopper<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:45.100> their

we're on 680 or 6 million seven six
hundred<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.180> seven<00:03:58.510> tickets<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.109> they're<00:03:59.350> on

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
hundred and seven tickets and they're on

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.759 
hundred and seven tickets and they're on
21<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.310> rapidly<00:04:00.910> dropping<00:04:01.480> that<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.440> because

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
21 and rapidly dropping that is because

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.500 
21 and rapidly dropping that is because
as<00:04:02.920> you<00:04:03.010> can<00:04:03.160> see<00:04:03.370> we<00:04:03.549> have<00:04:03.579> continued<00:04:04.329> to

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
as you can see we have continued to

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.930 
as you can see we have continued to
maintain<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:05.230> dominance<00:04:05.799> of<00:04:05.950> five<00:04:06.579> out<00:04:06.880> of

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
maintain that dominance of five out of

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.259 
maintain that dominance of five out of
the<00:04:07.150> six<00:04:07.480> flags<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.350> believe<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.190> in<00:04:09.700> making

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
the six flags I believe that in making

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.330 
the six flags I believe that in making
that<00:04:10.299> good<00:04:10.690> start<00:04:11.079> at<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.440> very<00:04:11.470> start<00:04:11.799> of

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
that good start at the very start of

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.250 
that good start at the very start of
this<00:04:12.609> level<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.570> gave<00:04:13.810> us<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.019> advantage

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
this level that gave us the advantage

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.469 
this level that gave us the advantage
and<00:04:14.769> that<00:04:14.829> gave<00:04:15.100> us<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.280> chance<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.940> push<00:04:16.180> on

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
and that gave us the chance to push on

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.229 
and that gave us the chance to push on
and<00:04:16.799> continue<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:18.130> dominate<00:04:18.310> on<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.000> map

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
and continue to dominate on the map

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.210 
and continue to dominate on the map
without<00:04:19.810> taking<00:04:20.350> those<00:04:20.410> flags<00:04:20.769> in<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.010> first

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
without taking those flags in the first

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.800 
without taking those flags in the first
place<00:04:21.430> guys<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:22.000> don't<00:04:22.300> think<00:04:22.510> we<00:04:22.630> would<00:04:22.750> have

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
place guys I don't think we would have

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.710 
place guys I don't think we would have
got<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.229> score<00:04:23.560> as<00:04:23.770> easily<00:04:24.280> as<00:04:24.610> we<00:04:24.970> did<00:04:25.240> and

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
got the score as easily as we did and

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.270 
got the score as easily as we did and
that<00:04:25.930> people<00:04:26.169> is<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> importance<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.159> a<00:04:27.250> good

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
that people is the importance of a good
