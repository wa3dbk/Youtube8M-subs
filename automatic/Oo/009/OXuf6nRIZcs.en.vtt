00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
show you guys I have this plow on here

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.040 
show you guys I have this plow on here
guys<00:01:51.580> so<00:01:51.640> I'm<00:01:52.180> going<00:01:52.330> to<00:01:52.360> go<00:01:52.450> ahead<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.870> lower

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
guys so I'm going to go ahead and lower

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.230 
guys so I'm going to go ahead and lower
this<00:01:53.260> plow<00:01:53.470> into<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.800> ground<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.250> now<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:54.760> am

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
this plow into the ground and now I am

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.780 
this plow into the ground and now I am
in<00:01:55.420> I<00:01:55.690> have<00:01:56.260> no<00:01:56.560> drive<00:01:56.890> controls<00:01:57.340> our<00:01:57.549> guys

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
in I have no drive controls our guys

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.420 
in I have no drive controls our guys
this<00:01:58.000> is<00:01:58.180> all<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:59.080> just<00:01:59.920> regular

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
this is all the just regular

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.760 
this is all the just regular
two-wheel-drive<00:02:01.030> tractor<00:02:01.600> without<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.590> rear

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
two-wheel-drive tractor without the rear

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.410 
two-wheel-drive tractor without the rear
differentials<00:02:03.340> lock<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.760> what's<00:02:04.240> going<00:02:04.390> to

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
differentials lock and what's going to

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.820 
differentials lock and what's going to
happen<00:02:04.720> here<00:02:04.840> guys<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.049> when<00:02:05.320> I<00:02:05.350> press<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.710> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
happen here guys is when I press on the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.199 
happen here guys is when I press on the
gas<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:07.720> I'm<00:02:08.649> going<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.890> get<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.819> tire

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
gas is it I'm going to get the tire

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.990 
gas is it I'm going to get the tire
spinning<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:11.350> tire<00:02:11.590> spinning<00:02:12.010> as<00:02:12.250> we<00:02:12.850> are

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
spinning one tire spinning as we are

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.710 
spinning one tire spinning as we are
actually<00:02:13.209> on

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
actually on

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.950 
actually on
able<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.190> break<00:02:15.190> free<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.820> if<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.690> put<00:02:16.870> in

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
able to break free and if I put in

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.510 
able to break free and if I put in
enough<00:02:17.200> gas<00:02:17.380> i<00:02:17.590> can<00:02:17.740> get<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> second<00:02:18.250> tire<00:02:18.400> to

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
enough gas i can get the second tire to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.290 
enough gas i can get the second tire to
spin<00:02:18.730> but<00:02:19.570> still<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:20.830> did<00:02:20.860> not<00:02:21.010> have<00:02:21.340> enough

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
spin but still we did not have enough

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.110 
spin but still we did not have enough
gas<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.810> pull<00:02:22.990> this<00:02:23.170> plow<00:02:23.830> through<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.880> ground

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
gas to pull this plow through the ground

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.400 
gas to pull this plow through the ground
here<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.470> um<00:02:27.630> what<00:02:28.630> we<00:02:28.780> could<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.200> we<00:02:29.230> could

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
here so um what we could do is we could

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.850 
here so um what we could do is we could
try<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.800> lock<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.280> front<00:02:30.460> differential<00:02:30.940> and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
try to lock the front differential and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.680 
try to lock the front differential and
with<00:02:32.860> this<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.280> i<00:02:33.340> do<00:02:33.640> not<00:02:33.940> think<00:02:34.090> we're<00:02:34.450> stood

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
with this so i do not think we're stood

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.790 
with this so i do not think we're stood
we're<00:02:34.870> still<00:02:35.020> not<00:02:35.140> going<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.320> be<00:02:35.440> able<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.680> move

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
we're still not going to be able to move

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.000 
we're still not going to be able to move
but<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.060> can<00:02:37.360> see<00:02:37.620> open<00:02:38.620> oh<00:02:38.680> that's<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
but now you can see open oh that's the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.660 
but now you can see open oh that's the
wrong<00:02:39.160> one<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:40.300> now<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.350> can<00:02:41.650> see<00:02:41.890> that<00:02:42.130> above

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
wrong one and now you can see that above

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.040 
wrong one and now you can see that above
the<00:02:42.820> number<00:02:43.060> eight<00:02:43.210> in<00:02:43.360> my<00:02:43.480> fuel<00:02:43.750> there<00:02:44.020> a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
the number eight in my fuel there a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.050 
the number eight in my fuel there a
little<00:02:44.890> tractor<00:02:45.160> icons<00:02:45.610> let<00:02:45.850> up<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.030> little

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
little tractor icons let up a little

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.390 
little tractor icons let up a little
wheels<00:02:46.360> icons<00:02:46.840> lit<00:02:47.050> up<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.350> now<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.340> is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
wheels icons lit up and now it is

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.770 
wheels icons lit up and now it is
telling<00:02:48.670> me<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.150> front<00:02:49.360> differential

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
telling me that the front differential

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.970 
telling me that the front differential
is<00:02:50.020> locked<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:50.410> there's<00:02:50.590> not<00:02:50.800> actually

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
is locked but there's not actually

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.470 
is locked but there's not actually
enough<00:02:51.370> horsepower<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.910> get<00:02:52.060> these<00:02:52.209> front

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
enough horsepower to get these front

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.940 
enough horsepower to get these front
wheels<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.840> spin<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.350> actually<00:02:53.500> see<00:02:53.680> them

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
wheels to spin you can actually see them

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.240 
wheels to spin you can actually see them
trying<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.340> move<00:02:54.610> but<00:02:55.390> they're<00:02:55.540> not<00:02:55.690> spitting

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
trying to move but they're not spitting

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.590 
trying to move but they're not spitting
okay<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.820> then<00:02:58.330> um<00:02:59.070> shift<00:03:00.090> six<00:03:01.090> then<00:03:01.330> will

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
okay so and then um shift six then will

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.660 
okay so and then um shift six then will
be<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.750> rear<00:03:02.020> differential<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.520> can

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
be the rear differential and you can

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.130 
be the rear differential and you can
actually<00:03:03.850> see<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.450> with<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.660> little<00:03:04.840> bit<00:03:05.110> of

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
actually see that with a little bit of

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.140 
actually see that with a little bit of
gas<00:03:05.410> their<00:03:05.740> bowls<00:03:06.040> fitting<00:03:06.520> right<00:03:06.760> out<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
gas their bowls fitting right out the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.210 
gas their bowls fitting right out the
back<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:08.140> um<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.930> mean<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.470> differential<00:03:12.100> is

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
back so um so I mean the differential is

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.040 
back so um so I mean the differential is
locked<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.120> wheels<00:03:13.360> are<00:03:13.570> together<00:03:13.720> in

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
locked and the wheels are together in

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.160 
locked and the wheels are together in
the<00:03:14.140> same<00:03:14.350> we<00:03:15.100> still<00:03:15.400> just<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.820> not<00:03:16.000> have<00:03:16.300> we

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
the same we still just do not have we

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.560 
the same we still just do not have we
still<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:17.560> do<00:03:17.709> not<00:03:17.860> have<00:03:18.070> enough<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:19.330> pull

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
still just do not have enough to pull

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.590 
still just do not have enough to pull
this<00:03:19.750> thing<00:03:20.050> so<00:03:21.010> what<00:03:21.880> we<00:03:21.970> could<00:03:22.150> do<00:03:22.269> here<00:03:22.300> now

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
this thing so what we could do here now

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.620 
this thing so what we could do here now
is<00:03:22.780> we<00:03:23.739> could<00:03:23.890> turn<00:03:23.980> on<00:03:24.130> four-wheel<00:03:24.519> drive<00:03:24.820> now

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
is we could turn on four-wheel drive now

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.290 
is we could turn on four-wheel drive now
with<00:03:26.560> four-wheel<00:03:26.920> drive<00:03:27.220> on<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.820> still<00:03:28.090> have

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
with four-wheel drive on you still have

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.060 
with four-wheel drive on you still have
only<00:03:28.540> two<00:03:28.900> axles<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.380> are<00:03:29.530> turning<00:03:29.830> one<00:03:29.980> on

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
only two axles that are turning one on

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.259 
only two axles that are turning one on
the<00:03:30.160> front<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.430> one<00:03:30.580> on<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.730> back<00:03:30.910> but<00:03:31.120> it's

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
the front and one on the back but it's

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.550 
the front and one on the back but it's
going<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.480> break<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:31.810> plow<00:03:32.019> free<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.470> we're

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
going to break this plow free and we're

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.930 
going to break this plow free and we're
going<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.709> be<00:03:32.830> able<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:33.040> move<00:03:33.130> with<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.370> with

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
going to be able to move with it with

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.630 
going to be able to move with it with
four-wheel<00:03:34.269> drive<00:03:34.480> arm<00:03:34.660> that<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.340> shift<00:03:36.340> for

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
four-wheel drive arm that is a shift for

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.000 
four-wheel drive arm that is a shift for
guys<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.120> get<00:03:37.239> four<00:03:37.450> wheel<00:03:37.600> drive<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.290> see<00:03:38.860> we

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
guys to get four wheel drive and see we

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.740 
guys to get four wheel drive and see we
are<00:03:39.160> moving<00:03:39.340> but<00:03:39.670> we<00:03:39.820> are<00:03:39.940> spinning<00:03:40.360> some<00:03:40.630> of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
are moving but we are spinning some of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.229 
are moving but we are spinning some of
the<00:03:40.810> tires<00:03:41.050> so<00:03:41.350> we<00:03:41.830> could<00:03:41.980> also<00:03:42.100> lock<00:03:43.000> the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
the tires so we could also lock the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.560 
the tires so we could also lock the
front<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.049> rear<00:03:44.260> differentials<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.570> then

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
front and rear differentials and then

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.449 
front and rear differentials and then
all<00:03:46.900> four<00:03:47.170> tires<00:03:47.470> will<00:03:47.739> be<00:03:47.769> an<00:03:47.920> action<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.310> all

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
all four tires will be an action in all

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.550 
all four tires will be an action in all
four<00:03:48.700> tires<00:03:48.910> will<00:03:49.120> be<00:03:49.150> spinning<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.780> we<00:03:50.380> can

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
four tires will be spinning and we can

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.580 
four tires will be spinning and we can
actually<00:03:50.739> move<00:03:51.580> this<00:03:52.030> plow<00:03:52.360> across<00:03:53.320> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
actually move this plow across the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.289 
actually move this plow across the
across<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.489> dirt<00:03:54.640> here<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:54.940> not<00:03:55.060> going<00:03:55.209> to

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
across the dirt here it's not going to

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.800 
across the dirt here it's not going to
stop<00:03:55.360> us<00:03:55.690> from<00:03:55.920> from<00:03:56.920> going<00:03:57.280> all<00:03:57.459> sideways<00:03:58.330> and

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
stop us from from going all sideways and

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.270 
stop us from from going all sideways and
stuff<00:03:59.019> because<00:03:59.170> this<00:03:59.440> tractor<00:03:59.799> is<00:03:59.860> definitely

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
stuff because this tractor is definitely

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.630 
stuff because this tractor is definitely
too<00:04:00.489> small<00:04:00.670> for<00:04:01.120> what<00:04:01.150> we're<00:04:01.420> doing<00:04:01.890> but<00:04:02.890> it

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
too small for what we're doing but it

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.259 
too small for what we're doing but it
will<00:04:03.880> make<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.209> so<00:04:04.360> that<00:04:04.480> we<00:04:04.600> can<00:04:04.750> pull<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.110> um

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
will make it so that we can pull it um

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.479 
will make it so that we can pull it um
and<00:04:07.269> before<00:04:07.660> um<00:04:07.989> just<00:04:08.860> beat<00:04:09.070> a<00:04:09.100> two-wheel

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
and before um just beat a two-wheel

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.400 
and before um just beat a two-wheel
drive<00:04:09.760> we<00:04:09.940> couldn't<00:04:10.209> do<00:04:10.330> that<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.750> so<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.200> can

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
drive we couldn't do that and so you can

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.990 
drive we couldn't do that and so you can
see<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.709> three<00:04:11.920> icons<00:04:12.340> over<00:04:12.700> there<00:04:12.820> on<00:04:12.940> the

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
see the three icons over there on the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.289 
see the three icons over there on the
right<00:04:13.090> um<00:04:14.280> shift<00:04:15.280> for<00:04:15.610> being<00:04:15.940> four-wheel

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
right um shift for being four-wheel

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.880 
right um shift for being four-wheel
drive<00:04:16.540> them<00:04:16.720> turning<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.049> off<00:04:17.140> right<00:04:17.410> off<00:04:17.560> and

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
drive them turning it off right off and

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.759 
drive them turning it off right off and
on<00:04:17.950> right<00:04:18.130> now<00:04:18.160> shift<00:04:18.549> five<00:04:18.820> being<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.930> front

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
on right now shift five being the front

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.339 
on right now shift five being the front
differentials<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.750> shifts<00:04:22.750> six<00:04:22.930> being<00:04:23.229> the

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
differentials and shifts six being the

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.400 
differentials and shifts six being the
rear<00:04:23.500> differentials<00:04:24.099> guys<00:04:24.280> okay<00:04:25.120> so

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
rear differentials guys okay so

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.840 
rear differentials guys okay so
go<00:04:26.590> ahead<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:26.980> remove<00:04:27.280> them<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:28.800> um<00:04:29.850> raise

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
go ahead and remove them and um raise

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.580 
go ahead and remove them and um raise
the<00:04:31.060> plow<00:04:31.240> here<00:04:31.510> guys<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:31.930> then<00:04:32.020> there's<00:04:32.200> one

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
the plow here guys and then there's one

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.440 
the plow here guys and then there's one
more<00:04:32.860> or<00:04:33.610> there's<00:04:33.790> two<00:04:33.910> more<00:04:34.060> things<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.420> want

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
more or there's two more things I want

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.940 
more or there's two more things I want
to<00:04:34.630> show<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:34.810> about<00:04:35.110> this<00:04:35.260> mod<00:04:35.530> guys<00:04:35.830> um<00:04:37.950> okay

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
to show you about this mod guys um okay

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.360 
to show you about this mod guys um okay
so<00:04:39.090> there<00:04:40.090> is<00:04:40.420> a<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:41.350> way<00:04:41.470> tractors<00:04:41.980> work<00:04:42.190> is

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
so there is a the way tractors work is

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.800 
so there is a the way tractors work is
there's<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.640> throttle<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.240> controls<00:04:43.630> the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
there's a throttle that controls the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.120 
there's a throttle that controls the
overall<00:04:44.260> speed<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:45.090> um<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.920> then<00:04:47.920> there<00:04:48.100> is

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
overall speed and um and then there is

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.130 
overall speed and um and then there is
like<00:04:48.460> usually<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.910> hydrostatic<00:04:49.330> or<00:04:49.780> some<00:04:49.930> kind

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
like usually a hydrostatic or some kind

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.780 
like usually a hydrostatic or some kind
of<00:04:50.170> gear<00:04:50.380> drive<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.710> controls<00:04:51.070> afford<00:04:51.400> moment

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
of gear drive the controls afford moment

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:59.190 
of gear drive the controls afford moment
now<00:04:52.540> with<00:04:55.320> what<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.440> left<00:04:56.650> arrow<00:04:56.920> arm<00:04:58.200> right

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
now with what the left arrow arm right

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.370 
now with what the left arrow arm right
are<00:05:00.040> with<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.720> holding<00:05:03.300> shift<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:05.110> right

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
are with a holding shift and the right

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.440 
are with a holding shift and the right
and<00:05:05.620> left<00:05:05.650> arrow<00:05:06.100> will<00:05:06.850> move<00:05:07.030> these<00:05:07.180> little

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
and left arrow will move these little

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.670 
and left arrow will move these little
gear<00:05:07.660> cogs<00:05:07.930> right<00:05:08.200> underneath<00:05:08.440> my

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
gear cogs right underneath my

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.710 
gear cogs right underneath my
speedometer<00:05:09.010> up<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.520> down<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:10.030> now<00:05:10.570> what

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
speedometer up and down and now what

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.430 
speedometer up and down and now what
that<00:05:10.930> does<00:05:11.200> is<00:05:11.230> it<00:05:11.590> actually<00:05:11.620> arm<00:05:13.080> this<00:05:14.080> here

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
that does is it actually arm this here

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.050 
that does is it actually arm this here
actually<00:05:14.710> removes<00:05:15.280> some<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.730> forward

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
actually removes some of the forward

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.450 
actually removes some of the forward
torque<00:05:16.390> that<00:05:17.350> we're<00:05:17.530> going<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.860> have<00:05:18.070> so<00:05:18.340> that

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
torque that we're going to have so that

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.180 
torque that we're going to have so that
you<00:05:18.520> will<00:05:18.700> not<00:05:18.760> spin<00:05:19.210> your<00:05:19.330> tires<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:19.890> so<00:05:20.890> like

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
you will not spin your tires and so like

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.860 
you will not spin your tires and so like
let's<00:05:21.430> put<00:05:21.640> this<00:05:21.760> back<00:05:22.000> down<00:05:22.240> in<00:05:22.450> there<00:05:22.660> and

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
let's put this back down in there and

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.150 
let's put this back down in there and
see<00:05:25.500> we've<00:05:26.500> got<00:05:26.530> full<00:05:26.920> gas<00:05:27.190> here<00:05:27.460> now<00:05:28.050> and

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
see we've got full gas here now and

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.050 
see we've got full gas here now and
we're<00:05:30.160> still<00:05:30.340> getting<00:05:30.430> pretty<00:05:30.700> good<00:05:30.850> torque

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
we're still getting pretty good torque

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.270 
we're still getting pretty good torque
off<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.270> back<00:05:31.510> end<00:05:31.720> of<00:05:31.840> this<00:05:31.900> tractor<00:05:32.320> here<00:05:32.530> so

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
off the back end of this tractor here so

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.080 
off the back end of this tractor here so
let's<00:05:33.430> go<00:05:33.580> ahead<00:05:33.610> and<00:05:33.850> keep<00:05:34.210> lowering<00:05:34.720> that

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
let's go ahead and keep lowering that

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.840 
let's go ahead and keep lowering that
with<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.210> gas<00:05:37.420> on<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:37.900> see<00:05:38.610> I'll<00:05:39.610> see<00:05:39.820> that

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
with the gas on and see I'll see that

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.580 
with the gas on and see I'll see that
that<00:05:40.270> right<00:05:40.510> tired<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:40.930> I'll<00:05:40.990> see<00:05:41.110> I<00:05:41.140> got<00:05:41.380> full

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
that right tired and I'll see I got full

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.380 
that right tired and I'll see I got full
gas<00:05:41.860> on<00:05:42.130> but<00:05:42.280> that<00:05:42.310> right<00:05:42.580> tires<00:05:42.790> decided<00:05:43.300> it

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
gas on but that right tires decided it

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.110 
gas on but that right tires decided it
cannot<00:05:43.600> move<00:05:43.810> now<00:05:44.050> because<00:05:44.910> we're<00:05:45.910> lowering

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
cannot move now because we're lowering

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.490 
cannot move now because we're lowering
the<00:05:46.480> amount<00:05:46.510> of<00:05:46.870> torque<00:05:47.080> that<00:05:47.230> we're<00:05:47.380> giving

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
the amount of torque that we're giving

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.430 
the amount of torque that we're giving
to<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> back<00:05:47.980> wheels<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:49.210> then<00:05:50.050> that<00:05:50.230> now

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
to the back wheels and then that now

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.740 
to the back wheels and then that now
that<00:05:51.310> front<00:05:51.640> wheel<00:05:51.790> is<00:05:51.970> just<00:05:52.000> barely<00:05:52.360> wanting

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
that front wheel is just barely wanting

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.560 
that front wheel is just barely wanting
to<00:05:52.840> turn<00:05:53.400> let's<00:05:54.400> see<00:05:54.550> now<00:05:54.730> we<00:05:55.180> can<00:05:55.330> go<00:05:55.419> ahead

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
to turn let's see now we can go ahead

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.050 
to turn let's see now we can go ahead
and<00:05:55.720> raise<00:05:56.020> that<00:05:56.290> torque<00:05:56.590> back<00:05:56.770> up<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.190> we<00:05:57.910> can

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
and raise that torque back up and we can

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.970 
and raise that torque back up and we can
watch<00:05:58.210> that<00:05:58.270> that<00:05:59.020> right<00:05:59.260> wheel<00:05:59.440> decide<00:05:59.830> that

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
watch that that right wheel decide that

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.409 
watch that that right wheel decide that
it<00:06:00.070> wants<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:00.370> start<00:06:00.610> turning<00:06:00.760> here<00:06:01.060> once<00:06:01.300> it

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
it wants to start turning here once it

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.520 
it wants to start turning here once it
applied<00:06:02.080> enough<00:06:02.410> torque<00:06:02.770> to<00:06:03.010> the<00:06:03.640> wheel<00:06:04.530> this

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
applied enough torque to the wheel this

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.320 
applied enough torque to the wheel this
goes<00:06:05.740> up<00:06:05.919> really<00:06:06.190> slowly<00:06:06.460> here<00:06:06.790> guys<00:06:06.970> on<00:06:07.210> this

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
goes up really slowly here guys on this

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:17.300 
goes up really slowly here guys on this
up<00:06:07.600> on<00:06:08.100> this<00:06:11.190> multiplayer<00:06:12.190> server<00:06:12.520> here<00:06:12.760> guys

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.590 

maybe<00:06:18.310> I'll<00:06:18.460> have<00:06:18.610> to<00:06:18.700> reapply<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.180> gas<00:06:19.420> to

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
maybe I'll have to reapply the gas to

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.500 
maybe I'll have to reapply the gas to
get<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.810> end<00:06:19.900> of<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.050> wheel<00:06:20.200> to<00:06:20.350> spin<00:06:20.530> um<00:06:21.510> yes

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
get the end of the wheel to spin um yes

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.030 
get the end of the wheel to spin um yes
I<00:06:22.690> will<00:06:24.120> okay<00:06:25.120> there<00:06:25.330> we<00:06:25.510> go<00:06:25.830> maybe<00:06:26.830> it's<00:06:26.980> just

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
I will okay there we go maybe it's just

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.820 
I will okay there we go maybe it's just
a<00:06:27.220> bad<00:06:27.460> spot<00:06:27.760> but<00:06:28.510> dia<00:06:28.690> this<00:06:28.960> wheel<00:06:29.170> this<00:06:29.440> left

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
a bad spot but dia this wheel this left

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.200 
a bad spot but dia this wheel this left
wheel<00:06:29.980> is<00:06:30.100> definitely<00:06:30.460> spinning<00:06:30.760> faster<00:06:31.120> guys

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
wheel is definitely spinning faster guys

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.240 
wheel is definitely spinning faster guys
okay<00:06:31.540> and<00:06:31.720> so<00:06:32.200> then<00:06:32.380> the<00:06:32.470> other<00:06:32.680> control<00:06:33.100> we're

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
okay and so then the other control we're

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.800 
okay and so then the other control we're
going<00:06:33.370> to<00:06:33.430> learn<00:06:33.520> about<00:06:33.580> here<00:06:34.030> in<00:06:34.210> this<00:06:34.360> drive

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
going to learn about here in this drive

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.070 
going to learn about here in this drive
control<00:06:35.200> is<00:06:35.380> the<00:06:35.610> throttle<00:06:36.610> um<00:06:36.780> in<00:06:37.780> the<00:06:37.840> amount

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
control is the throttle um in the amount

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.600 
control is the throttle um in the amount
of<00:06:38.230> throttle<00:06:38.590> you're<00:06:38.770> able<00:06:39.040> to<00:06:39.190> give<00:06:39.400> it's

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
of throttle you're able to give it's

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.010 
of throttle you're able to give it's
kind<00:06:39.790> of<00:06:39.820> like<00:06:39.910> a<00:06:39.970> throttle<00:06:40.390> stop<00:06:40.630> and<00:06:40.870> that

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
kind of like a throttle stop and that

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.780 
kind of like a throttle stop and that
will<00:06:41.200> be<00:06:41.350> holding<00:06:41.980> down<00:06:42.190> the<00:06:42.370> shift<00:06:42.430> button

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
will be holding down the shift button

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.700 
will be holding down the shift button
and<00:06:43.030> pressing<00:06:43.210> the<00:06:43.420> up<00:06:43.570> and<00:06:43.750> down<00:06:44.020> arrows<00:06:44.500> and

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
and pressing the up and down arrows and

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.500 
and pressing the up and down arrows and
you<00:06:45.160> can<00:06:45.310> actually<00:06:45.460> see<00:06:45.670> the<00:06:45.910> throttle<00:06:46.270> going

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
you can actually see the throttle going

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.060 
you can actually see the throttle going
down<00:06:46.690> there<00:06:46.900> it's<00:06:47.080> like<00:06:47.200> a<00:06:47.230> throttle<00:06:47.710> limiter

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
down there it's like a throttle limiter

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.450 
down there it's like a throttle limiter
um<00:06:48.280> and<00:06:49.260> so<00:06:50.260> we'll<00:06:50.500> just<00:06:50.530> limit<00:06:50.980> it<00:06:51.040> to<00:06:51.100> fifty

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
um and so we'll just limit it to fifty

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.300 
um and so we'll just limit it to fifty
percent<00:06:51.790> throttle<00:06:52.270> and<00:06:52.920> this<00:06:53.920> is<00:06:54.100> good<00:06:54.280> for

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
percent throttle and this is good for

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.550 
percent throttle and this is good for
driving<00:06:54.880> around<00:06:55.150> guys<00:06:55.480> and<00:06:55.510> wanting<00:06:55.990> to<00:06:56.020> keep

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
driving around guys and wanting to keep

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.220 
driving around guys and wanting to keep
a<00:06:56.830> good<00:06:57.430> speeds<00:06:57.850> and<00:06:58.210> stuff<00:06:58.420> like<00:06:58.570> that<00:06:58.630> so<00:07:01.230> now

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.230 
a good speeds and stuff like that so now

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.720 
a good speeds and stuff like that so now
we're<00:07:02.440> actually<00:07:02.560> only<00:07:02.920> applying<00:07:03.310> fifty

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
we're actually only applying fifty

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:10.830 
we're actually only applying fifty
percent<00:07:04.060> throttle<00:07:04.480> of<00:07:04.540> your<00:07:04.660> guys<00:07:09.600> we<00:07:10.600> got<00:07:10.750> up

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
percent throttle of your guys we got up

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.800 
percent throttle of your guys we got up
to<00:07:10.960> about<00:07:10.990> a<00:07:11.170> quarter<00:07:11.410> throttle<00:07:11.830> try<00:07:12.100> again

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
to about a quarter throttle try again

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.690 
to about a quarter throttle try again
and<00:07:13.810> see<00:07:14.080> now<00:07:14.260> I<00:07:14.590> can't<00:07:15.070> even<00:07:15.160> heart<00:07:15.430> what<00:07:15.610> the

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
and see now I can't even heart what the

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.910 
and see now I can't even heart what the
gaps<00:07:15.910> are<00:07:16.090> completely<00:07:16.570> applied<00:07:16.840> I<00:07:17.230> can<00:07:17.770> hardly

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:17.920 
gaps are completely applied I can hardly

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.490 
gaps are completely applied I can hardly
even<00:07:18.190> get<00:07:18.490> the<00:07:18.670> tire<00:07:19.210> to<00:07:19.360> spin<00:07:19.540> now<00:07:19.780> because

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
even get the tire to spin now because

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.870 
even get the tire to spin now because
there's<00:07:20.680> so<00:07:20.890> little<00:07:20.920> throttle<00:07:21.400> here<00:07:21.700> let's

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:21.880 
there's so little throttle here let's

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.710 
there's so little throttle here let's
let's<00:07:22.120> raise<00:07:22.330> this<00:07:22.510> up<00:07:22.720> and<00:07:24.120> see<00:07:25.120> how<00:07:25.240> fast<00:07:25.510> I

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 
let's raise this up and see how fast I

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.050 
let's raise this up and see how fast I
can<00:07:25.780> actually<00:07:26.170> run<00:07:26.410> with<00:07:27.190> the<00:07:27.340> throttle<00:07:27.610> Lant

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.060 
can actually run with the throttle Lant

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.230 
can actually run with the throttle Lant
twenty-three<00:07:28.540> percent

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.140 

I'm<00:07:34.810> only<00:07:34.990> able<00:07:35.229> to<00:07:35.440> run<00:07:35.650> about<00:07:35.919> five<00:07:36.520> six

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150 
I'm only able to run about five six

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.850 
I'm only able to run about five six
kilometers<00:07:37.750> an<00:07:37.870> hour<00:07:37.960> with<00:07:38.289> the<00:07:38.319> throttle<00:07:38.590> at

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:38.860 
kilometers an hour with the throttle at

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.950
