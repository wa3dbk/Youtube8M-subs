 price of cross-laroche so a test 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.629
 for quality horses with particular 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.379
 a few strangers I know you have 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.149
 alright aliens 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.289
 we are probably going to Romanian in your 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.879
 selection you have enough milk placed 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.829
 high then quite I placed in 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.410
 head of my selection on the 16th two o'clock 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.390
 before the 13th of June caster sq the 18th 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.989
 pearl berthod the 17th peer group 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.809
 do not say tip-top of dorval forgiveness on the 12th 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.909
 at the verlan station the 5 northern titanium and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.409
 the 2 admiral of inverne ok then 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.850
 about your favorite we'll have it 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.880
 included abroad 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.650
 the cese an ode to judo are already two 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.119
 success in vincennes 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.320
 we could almost say three successes 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.460
 could almost say he's undefeated 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.729
 because dana once and started to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.680
 fault 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.630
 yes the horse had won race yes 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 the first two times against his side 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.650
 He came to his debut on the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.960
 ashy he won pleasantly both 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.700
 times dominik locqueneux did not hide 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.619
 that his horse was clearly behind schedule 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.360
 gains and who would realize a right of 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.500
 two meetings with this horse there the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.299
 last time he had won race 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.159
 it's unfortunately blamed on 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.630
 100 meters from the pole this effect so there 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.520
 indeed he should stay 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.340
 he was defeated only by himself at 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.049
 final the commitment is very favorable 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.250
 he no longer has to prove himself on the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.170
 distance the long distance 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.399
 dominik teasing good moment in this 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.920
 moment we are going through a period of form 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.240
 pretty fantastic earth the horse is 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.750
 always late gains it changes 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.009
 not there then on the 2850 meters of the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.240
 great track we can take it again 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.500
 his chances are the essential basis 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.119
 if last time more there was 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.310
 a lot of fog parcel what 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.509
 should not be the case this Thursday wanted 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.720
 to oppose another stranger 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.069
 the number 13 joker storck sq I'm going to the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.590
 say like I say a game by their 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.989
 offered a victory four accessits in 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.430
 eight attempts at vincennes he has 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.800
 especially won the other strong prize 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.190
 on this course also difficult to 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.720
 dismiss 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.400
 yes indeed 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.810
 this horse at the last time so in 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.090
 the briare price that should have been 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.680
 logically won by u2 oil at this 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.700
 horse finished third we had 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.110
 the impression that there had been a small 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.060
 soft coup whose rise after delay 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.950
 come well finish in the straight line 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.360
 it is a horse we had already seen 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.160
 last winter but obviously he 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.750
 was not at his best form 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.170
 there was the horse that is very well 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.460
 right now it is very regular there 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.550
 is confirmed on the ash like you 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.780
 said it the 5 of 8 the by the 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.410
 long-term journey should not 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.990
 not disturb him 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.240
 on the other hand he does not have to win for 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.730
 cover a future commitment agreement 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.110
 so valadier is entitled to be two on the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.540
 thought he will be so the horse is 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.470
 unsheathed anterior and a little bit 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.090
 best daf cats 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.040
 but here is an opposition to my favorite 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.130
 okay in third position the number 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.080
 18 mother of pearl umberto so his record 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.640
 various is simple two wins three 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.590
 accessits in five attempts this is 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.150
 100% so beware it's not his record 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.650
 the winter meeting of vincennes since 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.280
 the horse basically ran in 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.040
 program by cons recent second of 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.390
 price of paper vincennes to paper 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.769
 it's a superb commitment and I 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.780
 believe it must be 800 euros 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.370
 the elimination of the commitment is ideal 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.780
 the horse is in top form 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.040
 didier de vernet did not hide that he 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.190
 had never had his horse as well 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.200
 since for a very long time it's a 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.340
 little stroke I think the plot he 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.340
 has two accessits in two attempts 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.450
 for me the place on the pod on the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.670
 podium in addition it will be déferré of 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.260
 four feet and I think the horses 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.019
 of the second echelon are really 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.720
 superior to the choice of secrecy and one can 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.950
 rely on his three horses for for 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.150
 fight to compare any first 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.040
 phases there it's really a pure paper 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.500
 how to say I'm here it's a bit of a 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.129
 epoch in 4th position number 17 tobrouk 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.200
 of recent father 2nd in the province we but 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.120
 the horse also has titles havas yields 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.379
 so I should be wary maybe more for 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.970
 a place that for the win yes but 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.340
 here is afterwards also a small flat the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.079
 horse will evolve so we know 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.620
 it's a little better déferré déferré 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.350
 four feet 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.250
 on the other hand he wants his amount made 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.889
 call to stone yves verva 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.600
 for the occasion he once led 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.130
 was second with him that day 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.130
 by the way it was at vincennes he was 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.150
 second of the horse's secret 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.810
 such benefit of a commitment 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.430
 favorable 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.380
 me the only downside is what do they do 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.370
 that's why I wanted to 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.410
 here is a little lower 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.509
 Here it is otherwise dave agreement 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.099
 cats hard could figure in both three 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.720
 first of the pronoun okay whatever he 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.880
 in one we will keep in fifth 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.220
 position by whose number 10 titoff 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.449
 dorval who has just reconnected with the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.310
 success it was on the racecourse of 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.500
 cabourg then it's a pure right-handed 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.449
 there we are in vincennes it's more mixed 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.070
 on the left now there is mathieu 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.630
 Abrivard reinforcement even when we will 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.159
 be wary yes we'll be wary because 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.229
 so the horse is well placed him in 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.449
 head so that's really it's really 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.099
 the favorable engagement 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.030
 his novel the creps you want them 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.190
 run monday in toulouse 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.599
 but matthieu abrivard did the forcing 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.250
 for them to run this test there 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.419
 so in my opinion must be seen as a sign 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.130
 is that they really believe the horse 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.199
 well and they think competitive could 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.310
 finally succeed on the ash because 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.729
 on the ash of vincennes but it's 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.630
 not terrible 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.330
 the success rate is not 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.260
 exceptional but given the shape of the horse 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.730
 favorable commitment to the first pole 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.770
 his trainer thinks he can 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.970
 trot a small break-in what 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.630
 should be enough to keep a place 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.860
 in this event 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.510
 well listen and we will see if matthieu 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.610
 abrivard agrees with you since 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.650
 you to enjoliver was to meet him 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.100
 it's the moment of the minute terrain on 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.570
 listen mathieu you come from you 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.850
 literally walk with the guy 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.490
 thormann to cabourg yeah that's right the 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.050
 horse was ready to be at the top 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.890
 always in cabourg the commitment and 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.870
 integration decree 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.600
 we have been at the forefront 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.460
 and then we had a good time 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.660
 summer in front of the horse was fine but 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.130
 to finish he repelled the attacks 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.770
 easily can he do it as well 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.360
 on the big track at the big track of 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.970
 vincennes on all 2008 so completely 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.890
 different from the capital profile after the 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.990
 horse for him to be in great shape 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.720
 so it's already a big advantage the lot 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.310
 and the lot is good now on this 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.510
 he did better if we can go back 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.740
 to the front positions in races of 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.120
 old horses like that it's a big 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.940
 advantage because what we all know 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.500
 that we have to run hidden so we go 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.120
 try to take a little bit of 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.790
 train to our account and then try to
