hi everybody it's Tazz with handheld
Hollywood<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.139> recently<00:00:10.679> directed<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.219> project

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
Hollywood I recently directed a project

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.549 
Hollywood I recently directed a project
that<00:00:11.730> had<00:00:11.940> some<00:00:12.090> real<00:00:12.389> issues<00:00:12.780> with<00:00:13.200> rolling

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
that had some real issues with rolling

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.709 
that had some real issues with rolling
shutter<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> used<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.059> product<00:00:15.269> called

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
shutter so I used a product called

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.240 
shutter so I used a product called
rolling<00:00:16.139> shutter<00:00:16.379> from<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> foundry<00:00:17.070> out<00:00:17.160> of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
rolling shutter from the foundry out of

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
rolling shutter from the foundry out of
the<00:00:17.310> UK<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.670> correct<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> problem<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.779> as

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
the UK to correct the problem and as

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.450 
the UK to correct the problem and as
long<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> software<00:00:20.070> handy<00:00:20.430> I

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
long as I have the software handy I

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
long as I have the software handy I
thought<00:00:20.730> I'd<00:00:20.850> try<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.300> some<00:00:21.539> iphone

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
thought I'd try it on some iphone

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.170 
thought I'd try it on some iphone
footage<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.410> well<00:00:22.560> since<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.980> iphone<00:00:23.100> has<00:00:23.550> has

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
footage as well since the iphone has has

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.089 
footage as well since the iphone has has
a<00:00:24.240> CMOS<00:00:24.810> sensor<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.320> has<00:00:25.410> big<00:00:25.680> rolling

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
a CMOS sensor and has big rolling

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.640 
a CMOS sensor and has big rolling
shutter<00:00:26.670> problems<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.199> some<00:00:28.349> sample

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
shutter problems so this is some sample

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.870 
shutter problems so this is some sample
footage<00:00:28.769> i<00:00:29.039> shot<00:00:29.070> down<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.609> end<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.789> my

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
footage i shot down at the end of my

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.669 
footage i shot down at the end of my
block<00:00:30.119> i<00:00:30.390> chose<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.960> building<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
block i chose this building because it

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.959 
block i chose this building because it
has<00:00:31.800> lots<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.099> vertical<00:00:32.250> lines<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.910> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
has lots of vertical lines and is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.760 
has lots of vertical lines and is
against<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> nice<00:00:33.600> clear<00:00:33.930> skies<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.620> can

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
against a nice clear skies you can

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
against a nice clear skies you can
really<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.640> rolling<00:00:35.910> shutter<00:00:36.120> problem<00:00:36.510> i

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
really see the rolling shutter problem i

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
really see the rolling shutter problem i
panned<00:00:37.469> my<00:00:37.530> iphone<00:00:37.950> back<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> forth<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.700> five

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
panned my iphone back and forth of five

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.369 
panned my iphone back and forth of five
different<00:00:39.239> speeds<00:00:39.480> starting<00:00:39.930> very<00:00:40.020> slowly

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
different speeds starting very slowly

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.500 
different speeds starting very slowly
and<00:00:40.559> get<00:00:41.160> increasing<00:00:41.579> leaf<00:00:41.730> Astor's<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.360> can

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and get increasing leaf Astor's you can

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.510 
and get increasing leaf Astor's you can
see<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.930> as<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.739> increase<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.129> speed<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
see that as you increase the speed of a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520 
see that as you increase the speed of a
pan<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:44.820> movement<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.510> front<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.780> lens<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
pan or movement in front of lens the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.139 
pan or movement in front of lens the
rolling<00:00:46.800> shutter<00:00:47.010> problem<00:00:47.309> becomes<00:00:47.579> that

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
rolling shutter problem becomes that

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.360 
rolling shutter problem becomes that
much<00:00:48.210> more<00:00:48.360> exaggerated<00:00:49.100> now<00:00:50.100> here's<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
much more exaggerated now here's the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.160 
much more exaggerated now here's the
same<00:00:50.550> footage<00:00:50.910> put<00:00:51.300> through<00:00:51.570> after<00:00:51.780> effects

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
same footage put through after effects

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
same footage put through after effects
and<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.219> applied<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> rolling<00:00:53.940> shutter

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and and I applied the rolling shutter

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.560 
and and I applied the rolling shutter
effect<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:55.370> once<00:00:56.370> again<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.760> problem

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
effect and once again the problem

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.639 
effect and once again the problem
doesn't<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.870> become<00:00:58.020> noticeable<00:00:58.500> until

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
doesn't really become noticeable until

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.889 
doesn't really become noticeable until
you<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:58.980> faster<00:00:59.489> speeds<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.660> as<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you get faster speeds here but as you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.450 
you get faster speeds here but as you
can<00:01:01.020> tell<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.379> building<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.920> fact<00:01:02.100> staying

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
can tell the building is in fact staying

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.950 
can tell the building is in fact staying
vertical<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> lines<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> most

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
vertical all the lines are for the most

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
vertical all the lines are for the most
part<00:01:04.170> staying<00:01:04.589> vertical<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:06.060> rolling

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
part staying vertical and the rolling

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210 
part staying vertical and the rolling
shutter<00:01:06.600> effect<00:01:06.689> has<00:01:07.200> been<00:01:07.560> mostly

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
shutter effect has been mostly

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.940 
shutter effect has been mostly
eliminated<00:01:09.000> however<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.229> will<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.710> bad

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
eliminated however you will get bad

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.920 
eliminated however you will get bad
artifacting<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:12.030> camera<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.390> subject<00:01:12.810> or

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
artifacting if your camera or subject or

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.240 
artifacting if your camera or subject or
moving<00:01:13.110> too<00:01:13.260> quickly<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.920> you'll<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
moving too quickly like you'll see the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.410 
moving too quickly like you'll see the
left<00:01:14.490> side<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> frame<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> here's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
left side of the frame here so here's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.640 
left side of the frame here so here's
the<00:01:18.479> same<00:01:18.630> footage<00:01:18.869> running<00:01:19.080> side<00:01:19.259> by<00:01:19.290> side

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the same footage running side by side

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.170 
the same footage running side by side
the<00:01:19.950> original<00:01:20.250> footage<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.759> left<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the original footage is on the left and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.300 
the original footage is on the left and
the<00:01:21.380> footage<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.470> processed<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.040> rolling

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the footage I processed with rolling

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.300 
the footage I processed with rolling
shutter<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> right<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:25.220> once<00:01:26.220> again

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
shutter is on the right and once again

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.440 
shutter is on the right and once again
you<00:01:26.460> can't<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> effect<00:01:27.270> until

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you can't really see the effect until

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.179 
you can't really see the effect until
the<00:01:27.659> camera<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.200> your<00:01:28.229> subject<00:01:28.770> starts<00:01:28.979> moving

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the camera or your subject starts moving

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.880 
the camera or your subject starts moving
quicker<00:01:29.960> but<00:01:30.960> by<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.590> should<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.799> able

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
quicker but by here you should be able

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.289 
quicker but by here you should be able
to<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> pretty<00:01:32.400> dramatic<00:01:32.520> difference<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
to see a pretty dramatic difference the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.460 
to see a pretty dramatic difference the
building<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> left<00:01:33.869> looks<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.320> it's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
building on the left looks like it's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.380 
building on the left looks like it's
made<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> jello<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.970> building<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
made of jello and the building on the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.960 
made of jello and the building on the
right<00:01:36.530> looks<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.829> fine<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.700> again<00:01:38.909> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
right looks just fine and again you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.740 
right looks just fine and again you
might<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.180> able<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.360> notice<00:01:39.570> there's

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
might be able to notice there's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960 
might be able to notice there's
artifacting<00:01:40.460> beginning<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.700> speed

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
artifacting beginning with this speed

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.770 
artifacting beginning with this speed
here<00:01:43.909> here's<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.000> still<00:01:45.210> frame<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.689> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
here here's a still frame just so you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.569 
here here's a still frame just so you
can<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:46.049> how<00:01:46.079> bad<00:01:46.409> rolling<00:01:46.770> shutter<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.250> can

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
can see how bad rolling shutter can can

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.219 
can see how bad rolling shutter can can
get<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> left<00:01:48.299> hand<00:01:48.450> side<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> how<00:01:49.140> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
get on the left hand side and how you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.389 
get on the left hand side and how you
can<00:01:49.320> pretty<00:01:49.560> much<00:01:49.649> fix<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> right<00:01:50.280> hand

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
can pretty much fix it on the right hand

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.880 
can pretty much fix it on the right hand
side<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.140> artifacting<00:01:52.740> when

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
side but you do have artifacting when

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.310 
side but you do have artifacting when
the<00:01:52.979> camera<00:01:53.220> moves<00:01:53.369> too<00:01:53.520> quickly<00:01:53.549> here's<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
sample on the left hand side of the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.139 
sample on the left hand side of the
frame<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.610> some<00:01:56.759> pretty<00:01:56.939> bad
