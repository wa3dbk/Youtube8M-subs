wrench because I want to do try and pick
some<00:00:16.170> tubular<00:00:16.560> locks<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:18.289> I<00:00:19.820> decided<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.420> got

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
some tubular locks so I decided I got

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.560 
some tubular locks so I decided I got
this<00:00:22.220> kryptonite<00:00:23.220> lock<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:24.029> cut<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
this kryptonite lock I just cut the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.089 
this kryptonite lock I just cut the
plastic<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.350> because<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.680> tension

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
plastic off of it because my tension

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
plastic off of it because my tension
wrench<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.599> sitting<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> top

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
wrench was like just sitting on the top

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.779 
wrench was like just sitting on the top
of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.529> lock<00:00:28.710> because<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.099> plastic<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.640> too

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of the lock because the plastic was too

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.639 
of the lock because the plastic was too
thick<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.230> um<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:32.369> works<00:00:32.520> pretty<00:00:32.759> good<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.649> so

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
thick so um it works pretty good and so

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.389 
thick so um it works pretty good and so
I'll<00:00:34.950> try<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:36.950> see<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.219> keep

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
I'll try it out here see if I can keep

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.510 
I'll try it out here see if I can keep
it<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.610> camera<00:00:38.820> oops<00:00:42.860> do<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it in camera oops do it like this I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.569 
it in camera oops do it like this I
guess<00:00:49.640> no<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> sets<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> pretty<00:00:52.579> uniform

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
guess no it sets in a pretty uniform

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.330 
guess no it sets in a pretty uniform
order<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.340> set<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:58.340> that<00:00:59.340> one<00:01:01.340> something

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
order so set that one that one something

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
order so set that one that one something
that<00:01:02.460> skips<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.940> one<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that skips that one and that one and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.840 
that skips that one and that one and
goes<00:01:05.189> over<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.479> no<00:01:07.460> where<00:01:08.460> does<00:01:08.610> it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
goes over here I think no where does it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.090 
goes over here I think no where does it
leave<00:01:09.270> off<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:12.229> no<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> didn't<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.920> first

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
leave off at no I didn't get that first

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:26.999 
leave off at no I didn't get that first
one<00:01:14.280> set<00:01:14.570> try<00:01:15.570> again<00:01:19.100> set<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:23.150> that<00:01:24.150> one

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:36.470 

that<00:01:28.009> one<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:30.259> one

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.660 

then<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> goes<00:01:37.230> over<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.490> get

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
then it goes over here and then you get

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.900 
then it goes over here and then you get
that<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:40.640> that<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:43.160> then<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.400> last<00:01:44.610> one

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
that one that one then the last one

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.970 
that one that one then the last one
which<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> down<00:01:45.330> then<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.960> little<00:01:46.410> cracked<00:01:46.740> end

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
which is down then a little cracked end

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.570 
which is down then a little cracked end
they<00:01:48.560> all<00:01:49.560> right<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.940> it<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.060> picked

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.370 

now<00:01:54.120> it's<00:01:54.330> partly<00:01:54.630> picked<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.080> I'll<00:01:55.170> go

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
now it's partly picked so I'll go

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.620 
now it's partly picked so I'll go

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.840 

alright<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:19.010> there<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.460> one

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
just stop it uses dual ball bearing

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.800 
just stop it uses dual ball bearing
which<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.820> really<00:02:24.330> nice

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
which is really nice

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.960 
which is really nice
and<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.770> got<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> big<00:02:26.250> dole<00:02:26.460> shackle<00:02:26.940> that

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
and it's got a big dole shackle that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.800 
and it's got a big dole shackle that
just<00:02:27.270> pops<00:02:27.720> right<00:02:27.870> out<00:02:29.060> as<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.330> see<00:02:30.660> in

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
just pops right out as you can see in

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.610 
just pops right out as you can see in
there<00:02:30.990> maybe<00:02:32.120> you've<00:02:33.120> got<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.960> ball<00:02:34.410> bearing

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
there maybe you've got a ball bearing

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.960 
there maybe you've got a ball bearing
there<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:35.370> when<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.580> switch<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.940> around

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
there and then when you switch it around

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.800 
there and then when you switch it around
it<00:02:36.300> flops<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.410> ball<00:02:37.590> bearings<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.600> got

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it flops the ball bearings so you got

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.940 
it flops the ball bearings so you got
the<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:41.870> when<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.960> tip<00:02:43.200> when<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.440> took<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.830> out

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the and when you tip when I took it out

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.310 
the and when you tip when I took it out
as<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.210> see<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:45.600> there's<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.930> complete

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
as you can see there there's a complete

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.900 
as you can see there there's a complete
hole<00:02:46.560> right<00:02:46.800> through<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.130> center<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.460> it

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
hole right through the center of it

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.000 
hole right through the center of it
I<00:02:47.940> don't<00:02:48.840> know<00:02:48.900> why<00:02:49.110> they<00:02:49.320> did<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.740> there

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
I don't know why they did that but there

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.810 
I don't know why they did that but there
was<00:02:50.100> rivets<00:02:50.550> holding<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:52.490> yeah<00:02:53.490> as<00:02:53.730> you

was rivets holding it on and yeah as you

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.400 
was rivets holding it on and yeah as you
can<00:02:53.850> see<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.240> picked<00:02:54.450> now<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.900> don't<00:02:55.140> even

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
can see it's picked now I don't even

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
know where the key is for it so that's I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.310 
know where the key is for it so that's I
just

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
just
