00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.670
 the cochayuyo is an alga and save 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.390
 oxygen inside did not sit down when cut 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.570
 sliced 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.060
 this thing is like a kind of sponge 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.910
 because safe with him when I put it 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.640
 in resin those little bubbles have 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.520
 like catching the resin and in a bit 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.329
 then they give golden glitter super 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.460
 beautiful 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.739
 I always seek to take elements that are 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.170
 a little undervalued because I think that 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.090
 have as an important identity I 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.280
 like to provoke 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.920
 reactions of people who have 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.570
 this feeling that looks at the things that 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.580
 someone can take to do something are 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.140
 things that nobody has looked at here and that's what 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.640
 what happens to us always be we are always 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.140
 full of things that nobody has looked at and 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.140
 nobody has taken them into account 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500
 ah 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.820
 Y 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.380
 to create the different lines and 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.810
 general took two different scales one 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.850
 is a reference of some place like 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.630
 memory of different trips around the country 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.400
 and on the other hand there are the elements that 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.830
 these landscapes make up elements that 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.930
 they have two qualities that are 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.510
 local but another one is also that you have 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.700
 the ability to change the scale 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.140
 to see it up close not all the things I 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.120
 serve they have to be something that when 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.120
 one looks closely, another thing appears 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.970
 that's where the landscapes appear 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.769
 Sometimes the failed attempt but suddenly 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.890
 there arose one that begins as it will turn out 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.840
 result and I start to draw and it 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.650
 development and ends up putting together as a 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.650
 different line 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.040
 with one side I'm interested that people 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.110
 identify know that it is something from here 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.060
 you are building this trust what 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.349
 which is what one is the one that has always 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.819
 thought that it is little that who 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.099
 belongs as to the lower classes 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.459
 most popular is not worthy to be 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.000
 sophisticated nor worthy of being something called 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.000
 deluxe 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:42.210
 they have some sense of humor for 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.310
 things that they take that are curious too 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.590
 interesting that they are jewels that have 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.450
 stories then that like that one 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.870
 can open a conversation from 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.870
 one piece 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.790
 and I think what the pieces are that 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:03.049
 we create portable point that are pretty 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.450
 dream and that they are a landscape of something that does not 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.129
 he knows how he gave somewhere he does not know 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.040
 where but how are they too 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.760
 educational students something that out there 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.760
 they have it stored in some memory 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.760
 with you 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.280
 ah 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.440
 ah
