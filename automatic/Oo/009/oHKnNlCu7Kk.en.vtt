books<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> figured<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.399> know<00:00:35.790> I'd<00:00:36.120> push

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
books so I figured you know I'd push

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.810 
books so I figured you know I'd push
myself<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:37.020> guess<00:00:37.230> that's<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> point<00:00:37.980> Oh<00:00:38.340> for

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
myself I guess that's the point Oh for

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.170 
myself I guess that's the point Oh for
readathon<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> I've<00:00:40.350> also<00:00:40.559> got<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.980> meeting<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
readathon and I've also got a meeting in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.069 
readathon and I've also got a meeting in
a<00:00:42.840> couple<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.079> days<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:44.030> three<00:00:45.030> hours<00:00:45.059> away<00:00:45.450> so

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
a couple of days for three hours away so

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.380 
a couple of days for three hours away so
in<00:00:46.469> theory<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.070> six<00:00:47.399> hours<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.969> reading<00:00:48.120> I

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
in theory that six hours of reading I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.380 
in theory that six hours of reading I
could<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.620> day<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.789> just

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
could get in in that one day so I just

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.500 
could get in in that one day so I just
figured<00:00:51.949> screw<00:00:52.949> I'll<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.370> take<00:00:53.640> part<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
figured screw I'll just take part and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.660 
figured screw I'll just take part and
see<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:54.899> happens<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.770> I've<00:00:55.980> made<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.430> brave

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
see what happens so I've made the brave

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.319 
see what happens so I've made the brave
and<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.960> stupid<00:00:58.410> decision<00:00:58.949> Oh<00:00:59.300> Therese<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and or stupid decision Oh Therese and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.049

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
will try and read all of these during

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.520 
will try and read all of these during
this<00:01:05.909> week<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:07.020> already<00:01:07.320> started

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
this week I have already started

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.630 
this week I have already started
obviously<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.280> started<00:01:08.549> this

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
obviously because it started this

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.960 
obviously because it started this
morning<00:01:08.700> um<00:01:09.470> but<00:01:10.470> yes<00:01:10.860> three<00:01:11.250> books<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.909> week

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
morning um but yes three books this week

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.899 
morning um but yes three books this week
is<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.570> theory<00:01:12.869> they're<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.740> round<00:01:14.430> battle

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
is my theory they're all round battle

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.810 
is my theory they're all round battle
just<00:01:15.090> under<00:01:15.330> 200<00:01:15.479> pages<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.439> I'm<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.790> know

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
just under 200 pages so I'm not you know

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.109 
just under 200 pages so I'm not you know
just<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.110> bit<00:01:19.229> mad<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> um<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.610> could

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
just going a bit mad with it um it could

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.450 
just going a bit mad with it um it could
be<00:01:21.330> done<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.750> think<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.140> need<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.320> read<00:01:22.590> roughly

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
be done I think I need to read roughly

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
be done I think I need to read roughly
120<00:01:24.090> pages<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.420> day<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:25.140> doesn't<00:01:25.439> sound<00:01:25.619> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
120 pages a day which doesn't sound that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.450 
120 pages a day which doesn't sound that
much<00:01:26.220> um<00:01:26.720> but<00:01:27.720> other<00:01:28.530> than<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:29.220> day

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
much um but other than that one day

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.300 
much um but other than that one day
where<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:29.909> traveling<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.290> um<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.189> I

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
where I'm traveling a lot um you know I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.740 
where I'm traveling a lot um you know I
work<00:01:32.549> full<00:01:32.790> time<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.630> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
work full time so it's going to be in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.069 
work full time so it's going to be in
evenings<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.909> think<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.150> achievable<00:01:36.299> but

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
evenings I think it's achievable but

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.140 
evenings I think it's achievable but
it's<00:01:37.259> probably<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:38.130> about<00:01:38.340> pushing<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.909> for

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it's probably just about pushing it for

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.990 
it's probably just about pushing it for
me<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> said<00:01:40.350> that's<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> point<00:01:41.369> so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
me and like I said that's the point so

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.219 
me and like I said that's the point so
the<00:01:42.090> three<00:01:42.270> books<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.540> excited<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.079> read<00:01:43.200> this

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the three books are excited to read this
