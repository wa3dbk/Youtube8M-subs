providers<00:00:52.120> actually<00:00:52.840> also<00:00:53.020> long<00:00:53.380> because

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
providers actually also long because

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.210 
providers actually also long because
they<00:00:53.800> use<00:00:53.980> Rogers<00:00:54.430> Network<00:00:55.080> so<00:00:56.080> what<00:00:56.320> we<00:00:56.470> would

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
they use Rogers Network so what we would

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.440 
they use Rogers Network so what we would
have<00:00:57.310> to<00:00:57.460> do<00:00:57.550> is<00:00:57.670> we<00:00:57.760> need<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.000> get<00:00:58.090> an<00:00:58.180> unlocked

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
have to do is we need to get an unlocked

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.420 
have to do is we need to get an unlocked
for<00:00:58.660> both<00:00:58.840> of<00:00:59.140> them<00:00:59.260> so<00:00:59.470> let's<00:01:00.100> say<00:01:00.190> you<00:01:00.310> did

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
for both of them so let's say you did

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.010 
for both of them so let's say you did
this<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.640> regular<00:01:00.910> way<00:01:01.240> that<00:01:01.480> we<00:01:01.570> do<00:01:01.660> Rogers

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
this a regular way that we do Rogers

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.109 
this a regular way that we do Rogers
phones<00:01:02.230> or<00:01:02.410> regularly<00:01:02.920> do<00:01:03.070> Fido<00:01:03.310> phones

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
phones or regularly do Fido phones

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.050 
phones or regularly do Fido phones
you'll<00:01:04.540> get<00:01:04.689> one<00:01:05.049> unlock<00:01:05.409> for<00:01:05.979> that<00:01:06.159> but<00:01:06.880> this

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
you'll get one unlock for that but this

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.310 
you'll get one unlock for that but this
one<00:01:07.210> is<00:01:07.360> still<00:01:07.509> long<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:07.960> that's<00:01:08.140> why<00:01:08.259> it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
one is still long so that's why it

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.620 
one is still long so that's why it
doesn't<00:01:08.500> work<00:01:08.740> so<00:01:09.490> what<00:01:09.640> we<00:01:09.759> do<00:01:09.939> is<00:01:10.179> with<00:01:10.450> our

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
doesn't work so what we do is with our

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.660 
doesn't work so what we do is with our
process<00:01:11.140> we<00:01:11.259> actually<00:01:11.770> do<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.009> unlocking<00:01:12.520> on

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
process we actually do the unlocking on

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.880 
process we actually do the unlocking on
both<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:13.210> them<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:13.929> we<00:01:14.049> can<00:01:14.170> unlock<00:01:14.469> your

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
both of them so we can unlock your

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.830 
both of them so we can unlock your
network<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.579> your<00:01:15.909> service<00:01:16.240> provider<00:01:16.570> as

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
network and your service provider as

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.080 
network and your service provider as
well<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:18.280> way<00:01:18.429> you<00:01:18.490> are<00:01:18.700> able<00:01:18.759> to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
well so that way you are able to

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.969 
well so that way you are able to
actually<00:01:19.359> use<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.929> phyto<00:01:20.140> phone<00:01:20.409> on<00:01:20.619> other

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
actually use the phyto phone on other

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:31.289 
actually use the phyto phone on other
networks

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.749 

all<00:01:32.049> right<00:01:32.170> let's<00:01:32.469> first<00:01:32.979> find<00:01:33.159> your<00:01:33.399> IMEI

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.160 
all right let's first find your IMEI
number<00:01:34.119> because<00:01:34.359> that's<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.659> information

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
number because that's the information

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.499 
number because that's the information
that<00:01:35.289> we<00:01:35.409> need<00:01:35.679> at<00:01:35.920> global<00:01:36.310> unlock<00:01:36.579> comm<00:01:37.179> in
