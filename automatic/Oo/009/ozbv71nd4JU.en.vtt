00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 my friends so in the summer so me here 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:09.150
 math byte photos in 10 then there 10 10 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.160
 multiply by 10 36 to but it seems there 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 reading that about mother yes yes yes I agree 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.179
 pavel i it happens when you try 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.740
 comment read message yet 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.449
 count the coefficients watch this 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 read the training team chat 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.619
 in general there is a situation that is clear 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.180
 make good money yes yes let's go look 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.510
 why because I was right then I 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.280
 look at look at lan 36000 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:39.690
 and what we have after tap 694 1390 from 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.670
 corsa about hi fashion called this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.219
 first line of course drawing through 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.489
 Pershing and two t1 in the bottom line 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.440
 plus two 13 90 that is such a serious 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.320
 pressure maybe even grip base 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.410
 Well, two tanks from working through the top in 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.870
 style yes there is generally more serious 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.270
 exit for the beacon is not running on the first line 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.489
 out of pocket up but will it be possible 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.090
 come out against the mine above is a question 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.100
 witch and seeing see they see on virt 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 on the first line of promotion of all technology 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.170
 Of course, he does not survive this way out 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.939
 seizure base hi last season where 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.250
 the game against navi me is such a tactic 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.619
 command succeeded if 1 sho hit 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.930
 barbar it to the second mark 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.130
 virtus and flies to virginity clog 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.580
 but do not even shoot on the go 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 third from Moscow 4 2 he missed there 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.040
 they hide and here and meet the guys and 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 then punch and gave well but now 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.290
 the course stopped and the team moment 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.380
 gets the opportunity to weigh this time 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.570
 hang down take a position lined up a 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 that's what happened here is what not 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.299
 it was seen they saw but somehow 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.290
 target wild 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.990
 it happened that no one got in 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.000
 some story dragon stand 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.590
 stretched guys because of its z0 or not 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.969
 just came here in a corner together there 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.860
 two devyanostika worth it now Lesha 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.119
 we show them here is the gap vershinka 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.680
 center happens and that's what I'm talking about 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.719
 saying that might get team 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.080
 opportunity to act and alone act 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.790
 they take pershing 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.650
 they make an advantage over the trunks 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.170
 the coors team starts capturing the base they 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:15.580
 blocked the ability to be a base with 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.830
 the top of the accounting most seizure goes 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.220
 the seizure is necessary to shake up a course 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.420
 control positions for shooting down while all 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.370
 the files are there 2:11 and the blind is trying 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.860
 somewhere about the good of the dark behind the house zik 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.110
 gone stop capture really is about 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.210
 there goes the whole team falls out 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.890
 hurry let me fly there because 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.740
 us to a low can business base only 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.860
 Connor team his gift cap shoot 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.959
 will not glue will be shot down knocked down 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.450
 capture the base well instead of 1 it takes seconds 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.490
 won a couple more seconds you are nice 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.020
 not bad 9 second capture bases take 3 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.000
 we need to kill 90 pawns see good 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.010
 cons all capture failed now 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.050
 We look that there will be fights legendary 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.770
 trying to throw it all the time 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.510
 who tries to knock down the base 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.070
 some attempts are possible at all 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.110
 some complete chaos here if someone 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.170
 was able to finish off Moscow and basically a round 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.269
 probably would pick up course blocked 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.680
 You know, the ram went and just montel 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.870
 and in front of him so that he could not shoot 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.940
 and by some miracle the second estrus minus 0 and 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.739
 Well, apparently the guy opened and who does not 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.160
 trying to tighten the time the screw from breaking 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.130
 burning Mike need to push need to stew 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.810
 it is impossible to burn here to mine does not burn out 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.790
 well put out as a result of this course 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.830
 two tanks and cloths for 1390 which makes 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.980
 a bowl of physics t-shirts can be collected in for a ride 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.810
 he has 5 and here look to the lighthouse more precisely 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.660
 tannin do not sleep throws as far as 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.080
 but reloading comes to the rescue 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:49.780
 drum and t1 goes to the hangar to vanshot 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:52.840
 643 st that and f when all the time light 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.750
 plus so you got 31 and plus 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.260
 this all fx d now reload by 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.280
 him shoot he runs away team might 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.550
 until 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.069
 can regroup there is a chance there is 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.110
 all chances if in csd now somewhere 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.840
 from the bushes work out some kind of lasso 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.450
 miraculously gain not spendor to ziko disk 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.890
 their lemurs are 1 160 nines and a knife 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.829
 who can twist around enemies 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.169
 around the stone around nobody to fatal 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.480
 go somewhere and she tries her cop 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.330
 tower still slow like that, see that 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.490
 by the way rises on the center 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.650
 blocks for the light in to ride no one gets 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.620
 low goes on 1 vertical here goes 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.030
 is dictated by the clock and bread highlight VKS yes and 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.550
 he will have problems of bread 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.740
 light bulbs now saw in to and 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.110
 the viewer is already in the csd well and here is a trap for 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.320
 drive all the same what goes on fire 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.470
 the frontier in every one is trying to escape 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.530
 overclocked 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.180
 already maximum speed runs away like 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.240
 will leave now see the planet of light and 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.070
 minute door and sees him no no m he 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.470
 saw a light bulb lol caught that yes he 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.970
 right under the nose drove but 60 years to not 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.520
 so cool on the light of course as 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.140
 devyanostyak and 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.320
 and now u will come low spicy 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.650
 fsd goes low and if here it is 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.210
 everything will work out and maybe it will work out 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.070
 have some low on x-ray just 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.500
 he became very slyly working captain 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.310
 nothing capture base. seizure became 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.090
 neskwi 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.250
 You saw it is not. and there is a big wash 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.650
 . okay until the client is behind him then on the center 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.020
 goes do not forget about him well and here now 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.060
 again the light from the light will be here already 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.160
 and lolchto rode no chance no very 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.100
 clearly running mine fall surrounding 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.620
 moment for 8 sides up and mura bread 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.250
 should already see and there is no more there 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.410
 a pebble will pass and 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.060
 sits I know lies step is not visible and here 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.400
 light after a shot three shots this 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.590
 already before the marker hangs on it we look 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.120
 capture is necessary to knock down the base 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.720
 need to squeeze out of the treasury need at all 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.520
 win everything is not bad but if there is very 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.110
 very annoying it highlights going away 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.479
 is hiding now 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.390
 60 nine and he low rises and in 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.610
 In general, everything must be done but how 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.750
 works and in ksd then what a cool he and 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.280
 second time 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:19.030
 my miss three shells remains in csd 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:21.340
 you need to pick up a good nine 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.100
 OK, good, how to pick it up 69 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.260
 merged 69 charged much earlier and 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.810
 one shell remains in psd 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.930
 it still mayn’t win a date even 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.760
 if he takes 60 nines to him now 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.500
 still need to have time to move in order 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.840
 to bum bum with nothing 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.440
 maximum ram and no time for ram 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.480
 enough is 21 good next 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.280
 attempt in the performance of the course team but 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.990
 somewhere here again not fully 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.210
 polished round is somewhere possible 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.520
 the guys will look haze us too hard 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.000
 specifically say who is bad there 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.000
 played
