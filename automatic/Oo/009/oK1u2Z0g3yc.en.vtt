00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
all we needed is an auxiliary cable to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.479 
all we needed is an auxiliary cable to
the<00:02:10.110> headphone<00:02:10.410> port<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> top<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> mix

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
the headphone port to the top of the mix

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.949 
the headphone port to the top of the mix
amp<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.239> then<00:02:12.330> your<00:02:12.450> headphones<00:02:12.810> connected

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
amp and then your headphones connected

as normal

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.180 
as normal
now<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.090> last<00:02:16.480> step<00:02:16.629> is<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.319> wire<00:02:17.890> coming

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
now the last step is the wire coming

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.500 
now the last step is the wire coming
from<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.400> top<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.790> mixing<00:02:19.090> up<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.299> power

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
from the top of the mixing up the power

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.390 
from the top of the mixing up the power
cable<00:02:19.930> you're<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:20.769> going<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.950> connect<00:02:21.250> that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
cable you're just going to connect that

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.070 
cable you're just going to connect that
USB<00:02:21.760> right<00:02:22.750> into<00:02:22.959> here<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.510> USB<00:02:25.900> cable

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
USB right into here so the USB cable

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.449 
USB right into here so the USB cable
that<00:02:26.409> you<00:02:26.440> would<00:02:26.620> normally<00:02:26.709> be<00:02:27.040> connecting

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
that you would normally be connecting

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.240 
that you would normally be connecting
elsewhere<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:28.030> get<00:02:28.120> your<00:02:28.299> live<00:02:28.480> sound<00:02:29.250> you're

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
and then you're mixing up should power

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.569 
and then you're mixing up should power
