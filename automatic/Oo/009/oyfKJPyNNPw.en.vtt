00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
ground layer which is all of our

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.309 
ground layer which is all of our
snowdrifts<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.090> we're<00:02:53.629> going<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.780> use<00:02:53.989> our

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
snowdrifts and we're going to use our

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.530 
snowdrifts and we're going to use our
paper<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:55.310> we<00:02:55.430> made<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.120> first<00:02:56.269> step

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
my snow drifts and then like we did with

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.890 
my snow drifts and then like we did with
our<00:03:20.900> first<00:03:21.019> layer<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.829> put<00:03:22.280> some<00:03:22.519> glue<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:23.209> the

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900

our first layer and put some glue in the
back<00:03:24.079> of<00:03:24.890> your<00:03:25.069> snowdrifts<00:03:25.849> and<00:03:26.750> attach<00:03:27.170> them

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
back of your snowdrifts and attach them

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.099 
back of your snowdrifts and attach them
to<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.769> collage<00:03:28.359> but<00:03:29.359> now<00:03:29.569> we're<00:03:29.840> going<00:03:29.989> to

I<00:03:35.299> cut<00:03:35.540> from<00:03:35.810> from<00:03:36.560> green<00:03:36.799> paper<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.579> be<00:03:37.700> trees

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
I cut from from green paper to be trees

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.830 
I cut from from green paper to be trees
and<00:03:38.540> this<00:03:38.720> rectangles<00:03:39.590> here<00:03:39.859> from<00:03:40.639> paper<00:03:41.600> that

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
and this rectangles here from paper that

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.259 
and this rectangles here from paper that
I<00:03:41.870> made<00:03:42.079> very<00:03:42.260> similar<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.980> our<00:03:43.269> snowdrifts

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
I made very similar to our snowdrifts

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.210 
I made very similar to our snowdrifts
here<00:03:44.480> using<00:03:44.810> black<00:03:45.019> and<00:03:45.049> brown<00:03:45.500> crayons<00:03:45.950> with

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
here using black and brown crayons with

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.490 
here using black and brown crayons with
water<00:03:46.400> colors<00:03:46.819> we<00:03:47.450> have<00:03:47.540> circles<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.350> be

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
water colors we have circles to be

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.610 
water colors we have circles to be
snowmen<00:03:49.160> or<00:03:49.190> snowballs<00:03:50.180> pieces<00:03:51.079> of<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.350> fence

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
snowmen or snowballs pieces of a fence

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.979 
snowmen or snowballs pieces of a fence
if<00:03:52.130> we<00:03:52.280> want<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.760> then<00:03:52.880> some<00:03:53.120> more<00:03:53.150> scraps<00:03:53.660> of

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
if we want and then some more scraps of

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.140 
if we want and then some more scraps of
our<00:03:54.139> snowdrift<00:03:54.709> paper<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.519> put<00:03:55.609> on<00:03:55.760> top<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.090> the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
our snowdrift paper to put on top of the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.190 
our snowdrift paper to put on top of the
buildings<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:57.010> let's<00:03:58.010> add<00:03:58.220> our<00:03:58.250> trees<00:03:59.120> here<00:03:59.750> to

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
buildings so let's add our trees here to

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.330 
buildings so let's add our trees here to
the<00:04:00.319> front<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.709> our<00:04:00.859> collage<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:03.040> make<00:04:04.040> sure<00:04:04.250> you

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340

the front of our collage I make sure you
add<00:04:04.459> a<00:04:04.489> little<00:04:04.790> stump<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.269> each<00:04:05.420> one<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.079> this

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
add a little stump to each one and this

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.740 
add a little stump to each one and this
is<00:04:07.160> really<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.700> know<00:04:07.849> this<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.329> a<00:04:08.389> lot<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.599> fun
