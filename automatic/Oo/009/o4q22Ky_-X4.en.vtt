second half of the series were
introduced<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.600> bit<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.290> darker

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.810 
underworld of the music industry which
wasn't<00:03:37.470> bad<00:03:37.740> but<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.070> feel<00:03:38.340> it's<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.790> bit

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
wasn't bad but I feel it's a bit

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.730 
wasn't bad but I feel it's a bit
unnecessary<00:03:39.270> especially<00:03:40.230> when<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.500> could

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
unnecessary especially when you could

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.190 
unnecessary especially when you could
have<00:03:40.770> had<00:03:41.100> honest<00:03:41.910> flawed<00:03:42.420> advancement<00:03:43.080> and

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
have had honest flawed advancement and

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.830 
have had honest flawed advancement and
also<00:03:43.770> character<00:03:44.220> development<00:03:44.550> instead<00:03:45.150> with

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
also character development instead with

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.780 
also character development instead with
the<00:03:45.870> ending<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:46.650> series<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.220> was<00:03:47.400> actually

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
the ending of this series I was actually

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.880 
the ending of this series I was actually
a<00:03:47.820> bit<00:03:48.090> disappointed<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.140> wanted<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.500> see<00:03:49.650> more

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
a bit disappointed I wanted to see more

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.979 
a bit disappointed I wanted to see more
but<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.280> did<00:03:50.520> end<00:03:50.820> in<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.150> heartwarming<00:03:51.450> way

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
but it did end in a heartwarming way

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.620 
but it did end in a heartwarming way
needless<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.890> say<00:03:53.070> Beck<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.150> meant<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.510> be

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
needless to say Beck is meant to be

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
enjoyed

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.770 
enjoyed
as<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.440> journey<00:03:56.010> not<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:56.640> as<00:03:56.820> an<00:03:57.000> inexperience

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
as a journey not just as an inexperience

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.080 
as a journey not just as an inexperience
but<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.320> doesn't<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.040> end<00:03:59.070> here<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.940> can

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
but it doesn't have to end here you can

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.090 
but it doesn't have to end here you can
actually<00:04:00.300> read<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.780> manga<00:04:00.989> which<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.500> hear<00:04:01.920> is

a<00:04:02.130> lot<00:04:02.370> better<00:04:02.640> as<00:04:03.300> for<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.660> presentation

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
a lot better as for the presentation

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.160 
a lot better as for the presentation
here<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.980> art<00:04:05.280> style<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:06.030> just<00:04:06.390> average<00:04:06.600> it's

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
here the art style is just average it's

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.050 
here the art style is just average it's
nothing<00:04:07.560> special<00:04:07.830> but<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.520> does<00:04:08.730> everything

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
nothing special but it does everything

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.180 
nothing special but it does everything
that<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.420> needs<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.780> do<00:04:10.050> now<00:04:10.560> on<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:11.070> the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
that it needs to do now on to the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.280 
that it needs to do now on to the
biggest<00:04:11.430> issue<00:04:11.790> which<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.540> audio<00:04:12.989> this<00:04:13.230> is

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
biggest issue which is the audio this is

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.800 
biggest issue which is the audio this is
a<00:04:13.410> series<00:04:13.830> which<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.190> based<00:04:14.400> mostly<00:04:15.360> around

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
a series which is based mostly around

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.789 
a series which is based mostly around
music<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:17.130> voice<00:04:17.549> acting<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.359> actually<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.230> very

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
music so voice acting is actually a very

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.430 
music so voice acting is actually a very
important<00:04:20.370> part<00:04:20.640> I<00:04:20.940> have<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.660> say<00:04:22.020> that<00:04:22.289> the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
important part I have to say that the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.770 
important part I have to say that the
songs<00:04:22.710> sung<00:04:23.070> both<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.580> English<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.060> in

songs sung both in English and in

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.960 
songs sung both in English and in
Japanese<00:04:25.020> were<00:04:25.710> both<00:04:26.160> beautiful

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
Japanese were both beautiful

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.850 
Japanese were both beautiful
and<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.450> have<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.780> commend<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.170> voice<00:04:28.380> actors

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
and I have to commend the voice actors

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.890 
and I have to commend the voice actors
for<00:04:29.070> doing<00:04:29.310> such<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.640> great<00:04:29.880> job<00:04:30.000> in<00:04:30.420> both

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
for doing such a great job in both

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.130 
for doing such a great job in both
acting<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.860> singing<00:04:32.640> when<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.600> first<00:04:33.960> heard

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
acting and singing when I first heard

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.870 
acting and singing when I first heard
that<00:04:34.230> Gregg<00:04:34.590> ears<00:04:34.800> would<00:04:35.040> be<00:04:35.160> Co<00:04:35.310> Yuki's<00:04:35.670> voice

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
that Gregg ears would be Co Yuki's voice

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.760 
that Gregg ears would be Co Yuki's voice
actor<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.510> then<00:04:36.840> he<00:04:36.960> would<00:04:37.110> be<00:04:37.260> singing<00:04:37.650> I

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
actor and then he would be singing I

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.280 
actor and then he would be singing I
cringe<00:04:38.400> but<00:04:38.700> after<00:04:39.120> hearing<00:04:39.330> him<00:04:39.600> sing<00:04:39.810> he

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
cringe but after hearing him sing he

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.700 
cringe but after hearing him sing he
actually<00:04:40.890> did<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.190> great<00:04:41.700> job<00:04:42.080> while<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.290> music

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
actually did a great job while the music

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.920 
actually did a great job while the music
was<00:04:43.890> handled<00:04:44.370> three<00:04:44.670> in<00:04:44.850> both<00:04:44.880> languages<00:04:45.570> the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
was handled three in both languages the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.010 
was handled three in both languages the
voice<00:04:46.230> acting<00:04:46.770> itself<00:04:47.250> was<00:04:47.730> flawed<00:04:48.060> in<00:04:48.330> most

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
voice acting itself was flawed in most

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.500 
voice acting itself was flawed in most
series<00:04:49.470> you<00:04:49.650> can<00:04:49.830> choose<00:04:50.100> sub<00:04:50.760> or<00:04:50.970> jump<00:04:51.210> in<00:04:51.330> one

series you can choose sub or jump in one

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.750 
series you can choose sub or jump in one
will<00:04:51.750> be<00:04:51.840> better<00:04:52.020> or<00:04:52.350> both<00:04:52.950> will<00:04:53.160> be<00:04:53.280> good<00:04:53.460> but

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
will be better or both will be good but

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.870 
will be better or both will be good but
with<00:04:53.970> Beck<00:04:54.300> both<00:04:54.900> are<00:04:55.170> flawed<00:04:55.530> in<00:04:55.890> fact<00:04:56.700> there

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
with Beck both are flawed in fact there

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.610 
with Beck both are flawed in fact there
are<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:57.000> few<00:04:57.180> characters<00:04:57.390> that<00:04:57.690> are<00:04:58.080> bilingual

are a few characters that are bilingual

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.050 
are a few characters that are bilingual
and<00:04:59.010> they<00:04:59.100> will<00:04:59.220> actually<00:04:59.580> change<00:04:59.820> from

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
and they will actually change from

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.300 
and they will actually change from
speaking<00:05:00.330> English<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:01.020> Japanese<00:05:01.260> at<00:05:01.680> many

speaking English to Japanese at many
different<00:05:02.700> occasions<00:05:03.000> because<00:05:03.930> some<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.260> them

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
different occasions because some of them

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.170 
different occasions because some of them
were<00:05:04.710> actually<00:05:04.950> raised<00:05:05.490> in<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.060> United

speak<00:05:09.540> English<00:05:10.020> horribly<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:10.950> it's<00:05:11.070> actually

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
speak English horribly and it's actually

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.270 
speak English horribly and it's actually
painful<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.600> listen<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.230> I<00:05:13.470> really<00:05:14.010> wished

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
painful to listen to I really wished

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.410 
painful to listen to I really wished
they<00:05:14.490> would<00:05:14.610> have<00:05:14.760> gotten<00:05:14.940> some<00:05:15.180> better

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
they would have gotten some better

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.090 
they would have gotten some better
Japanese<00:05:16.110> voice<00:05:16.350> actors<00:05:16.800> for<00:05:16.980> these

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
characters because some of these

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.200

characters English is their primary

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.960 
characters English is their primary
language<00:05:21.810> so<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.710> really<00:05:23.370> shouldn't<00:05:23.700> have<00:05:23.790> to

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
English but if you watch BEC with

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.620 
English but if you watch BEC with
English<00:05:29.340> dub<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.760> feel<00:05:29.970> that<00:05:30.180> all<00:05:30.420> the

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
English dub I feel that all the

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.420 
English dub I feel that all the
characters<00:05:30.810> were<00:05:31.050> cast<00:05:31.470> with<00:05:31.770> great<00:05:32.190> voice

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
characters were cast with great voice

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.810 
characters were cast with great voice
actors<00:05:32.910> but<00:05:33.180> what<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:33.840> lose<00:05:34.020> out<00:05:34.200> on<00:05:34.260> is

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
didn't really notice that because I

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.450 
didn't really notice that because I
watched<00:06:15.570> half<00:06:15.900> of<00:06:16.110> this<00:06:16.260> in<00:06:16.440> dub<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.250> first

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
happened uh because that was the part

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.510 
happened uh because that was the part
with<00:06:19.080> most<00:06:19.560> of<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.919> character<00:06:20.340> progression

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
with most of the character progression

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.090 
with most of the character progression
that<00:06:21.450> was<00:06:21.660> the<00:06:21.780> biggest<00:06:22.080> like<00:06:22.350> slice<00:06:22.620> of<00:06:22.890> life

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
that was the biggest like slice of life

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.890 
that was the biggest like slice of life
part<00:06:23.400> but<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.730> second<00:06:24.060> half<00:06:24.210> I<00:06:24.419> watched<00:06:24.690> that

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
part but the second half I watched that

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.170 
part but the second half I watched that
and<00:06:25.110> sub<00:06:25.350> to<00:06:25.890> get<00:06:26.070> the<00:06:26.250> true<00:06:26.460> experience<00:06:26.850> I

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
and sub to get the true experience I

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.580 
and sub to get the true experience I
tried<00:06:27.419> to<00:06:27.510> go<00:06:27.630> back<00:06:27.780> and<00:06:27.930> watch<00:06:28.080> a<00:06:28.260> few<00:06:28.410> of<00:06:28.500> the

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
tried to go back and watch a few of the

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.920 
tried to go back and watch a few of the
episodes<00:06:28.980> of<00:06:29.130> dub<00:06:29.340> to<00:06:29.550> catch<00:06:29.910> that<00:06:30.180> part<00:06:30.419> but<00:06:30.690> I

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
episodes of dub to catch that part but I

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.860 
episodes of dub to catch that part but I
kind<00:06:31.620> of<00:06:31.740> missed<00:06:31.980> out<00:06:32.160> on<00:06:32.190> aside<00:06:33.120> from<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.540> few

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
kind of missed out on aside from the few

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.930 
kind of missed out on aside from the few
inaccuracies<00:06:34.200> that<00:06:34.680> dub<00:06:35.130> I<00:06:35.370> feel<00:06:35.580> that<00:06:35.789> the

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
inaccuracies that dub I feel that the

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.570 
inaccuracies that dub I feel that the
biggest<00:06:36.180> problem<00:06:36.630> is<00:06:37.020> with<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.860> context

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
biggest problem is with the context

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.220 
biggest problem is with the context
because<00:06:38.910> you<00:06:39.090> don't<00:06:39.390> know<00:06:39.600> when

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
because you don't know when

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.230 
because you don't know when
someone<00:06:40.560> is<00:06:40.680> speaking<00:06:40.860> English<00:06:41.490> or<00:06:41.730> Japanese

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
someone is speaking English or Japanese

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.870 
someone is speaking English or Japanese
and<00:06:42.780> this<00:06:43.290> is<00:06:43.440> a<00:06:43.470> problem<00:06:43.950> because<00:06:44.070> Co<00:06:44.490> Yuki

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
and this is a problem because Co Yuki

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.360 
and this is a problem because Co Yuki
doesn't<00:06:45.810> understand<00:06:46.320> English<00:06:46.800> so<00:06:47.040> when

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
doesn't understand English so when

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.920 
doesn't understand English so when
people<00:06:47.670> speak<00:06:47.850> English<00:06:48.060> to<00:06:48.420> him<00:06:48.660> he<00:06:48.840> won't

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
people speak English to him he won't

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.170 
people speak English to him he won't
understand<00:06:49.530> that<00:06:49.710> fuss<00:06:50.010> it's<00:06:50.430> just<00:06:50.730> left<00:06:50.970> out

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
understand that fuss it's just left out

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.930 
understand that fuss it's just left out
of<00:06:51.300> context<00:06:51.930> in<00:06:52.050> the<00:06:52.260> dub<00:06:52.500> so<00:06:53.220> unfortunately

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
of context in the dub so unfortunately

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.450 
of context in the dub so unfortunately
both<00:06:54.150> the<00:06:54.360> sub<00:06:54.600> and<00:06:54.810> the<00:06:54.870> dub<00:06:55.200> are<00:06:55.470> both<00:06:55.800> flawed

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
both the sub and the dub are both flawed

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.640 
both the sub and the dub are both flawed
and<00:06:56.760> you're<00:06:57.030> stuck<00:06:57.510> with<00:06:57.720> that<00:06:57.990> unless<00:06:58.440> you

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
and you're stuck with that unless you

Beck<00:07:08.430> is<00:07:08.610> a<00:07:08.640> series<00:07:09.030> that<00:07:09.060> I<00:07:09.240> think<00:07:09.540> deserves<00:07:09.960> a

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
Beck is a series that I think deserves a

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.400 
Beck is a series that I think deserves a
remaster<00:07:11.280> and<00:07:11.520> a<00:07:11.700> redub<00:07:12.120> but<00:07:12.690> because<00:07:13.110> of<00:07:13.260> its

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
remaster and a redub but because of its

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.590 
remaster and a redub but because of its
rush<00:07:13.770> second<00:07:14.220> half<00:07:14.430> I<00:07:14.670> feel<00:07:14.910> that<00:07:15.150> they<00:07:15.570> should

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 
rush second half I feel that they should

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.720 
rush second half I feel that they should
just<00:07:15.960> go<00:07:16.080> ahead<00:07:16.110> and<00:07:16.590> remake<00:07:16.980> it<00:07:17.190> changing<00:07:17.700> the

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:17.730 
just go ahead and remake it changing the

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.120 
just go ahead and remake it changing the
second<00:07:18.180> half<00:07:18.270> or<00:07:18.480> just<00:07:18.750> making<00:07:19.140> it<00:07:19.440> a<00:07:19.650> longer

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130 
second half or just making it a longer

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.250 
second half or just making it a longer
series<00:07:20.430> so<00:07:20.700> they<00:07:20.970> can<00:07:21.150> add<00:07:21.330> more<00:07:21.360> to<00:07:21.840> the

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.260 
series so they can add more to the

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.840 
series so they can add more to the
second<00:07:22.590> half<00:07:22.740> but<00:07:22.950> because<00:07:23.220> I<00:07:23.250> really<00:07:23.670> doubt

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 
second half but because I really doubt

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.060 
second half but because I really doubt
that<00:07:24.090> what<00:07:24.240> happened<00:07:24.600> I<00:07:24.720> think<00:07:25.470> they<00:07:25.830> should

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070 
that what happened I think they should

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.160 
that what happened I think they should
just<00:07:26.100> read<00:07:26.460> of<00:07:26.640> it<00:07:26.820> so<00:07:27.360> if<00:07:27.510> you've<00:07:27.720> seen<00:07:27.750> Beck
