00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
substantial amounts of metals and I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.200 
substantial amounts of metals and I
agree<00:00:40.829> wholeheartedly<00:00:41.010> there's<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.700> there's<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
agree wholeheartedly there's a there's a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.360 
agree wholeheartedly there's a there's a
lot<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> danger<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.370> leveraging

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
lot of danger I think in leveraging

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.090 
lot of danger I think in leveraging
metals<00:00:44.850> purchases<00:00:45.360> especially<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.980> have

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
metals purchases especially if you have

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
metals purchases especially if you have
other<00:00:47.309> debts<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.149> life<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.690> you're<00:00:48.899> not

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
other debts in your life that you're not

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.779 
other debts in your life that you're not
making<00:00:49.230> installment<00:00:50.070> payments<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
making installment payments on and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.330 
making installment payments on and
things<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.469> my<00:00:52.469> rationale<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.280> that

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
things like that my rationale for that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.279 
things like that my rationale for that
is<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.570> know<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.930> tomorrow<00:00:55.230> brings

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
is you don't know what tomorrow brings

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.979 
is you don't know what tomorrow brings
in<00:00:55.710> your<00:00:55.800> life<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.399> know<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:57.480> are<00:00:57.570> people<00:00:57.899> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
in your life you know there are people I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
in your life you know there are people I
think<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.469> probably<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.760> deals<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.359> metals

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
think that probably see deals on metals

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
think that probably see deals on metals
and<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.739> buy<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and think that they can buy a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280 
and think that they can buy a
substantial<00:01:02.910> amount<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.660> turn<00:01:04.170> around

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
substantial amount and then turn around

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.010 
substantial amount and then turn around
flip<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> profit<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.630> able<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> pay

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
flip it make a profit and be able to pay

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.510 
flip it make a profit and be able to pay
off<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> metals<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.740> pocket<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.430> difference

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
off the metals and pocket the difference

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.149 
off the metals and pocket the difference
and<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.659> theory<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.229> great<00:01:10.530> assuming<00:01:11.010> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and in theory that's great assuming you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.370 
and in theory that's great assuming you
you<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.270> ability<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you know I have the ability to do so and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.710 
you know I have the ability to do so and
conditions<00:01:14.090> tomorrow<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.299> same<00:01:15.570> as

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
leverage metals purchases find that they

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.109 
leverage metals purchases find that they
have<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.560> liquidate<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.130> fast<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.610> usually

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
have to liquidate it fast and usually

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.719 
have to liquidate it fast and usually
not<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> profit<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:34.770> intended<00:01:35.579> or

not for the profit that they intended or

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.100 
not for the profit that they intended or
at<00:01:35.790> least<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.150> could<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.750> danger<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
at least that could that's the danger I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.230 
at least that could that's the danger I
guess<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.829> using<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.490> lot<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.700> credit<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> be

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
guess of of using a lot of credit to be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.630 
guess of of using a lot of credit to be
able<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.590> bit<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> advice<00:01:41.430> is

I might excuse me I'm on eBay trying to
locate<00:03:26.780> what<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:27.470> think<00:03:27.800> of<00:03:27.950> is<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.670> great<00:03:29.180> deal

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
locate what I think of is a great deal

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.120 
locate what I think of is a great deal
something<00:03:29.870> I'm<00:03:29.959> already<00:03:30.110> looking<00:03:30.410> for<00:03:30.800> but<00:03:31.010> it

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
something I'm already looking for but it

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.710 
something I'm already looking for but it
can't<00:03:31.400> be<00:03:31.580> from<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.880> boolean<00:03:32.240> category

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
can't be from the boolean category

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.449 
can't be from the boolean category
because<00:03:32.959> eBay<00:03:33.320> bucks<00:03:33.620> don't<00:03:33.800> work<00:03:34.130> for

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
because eBay bucks don't work for

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.490 
because eBay bucks don't work for
boolean<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.209> it's<00:03:35.750> got<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.959> be<00:03:36.020> something<00:03:36.230> from

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
boolean so it's got to be something from

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.990 
boolean so it's got to be something from
and<00:03:36.830> I've<00:03:36.920> been<00:03:37.070> looking<00:03:37.340> at<00:03:37.430> her<00:03:37.490> coins<00:03:37.790> and

that<00:03:40.430> doesn't<00:03:40.760> have<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.000> do<00:03:41.090> with<00:03:41.120> bullion<00:03:41.570> so

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
that doesn't have to do with bullion so

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.900 
that doesn't have to do with bullion so
