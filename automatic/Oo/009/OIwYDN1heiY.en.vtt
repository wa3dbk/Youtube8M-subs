here's<00:00:05.470> an<00:00:05.920> installation<00:00:06.520> on<00:00:06.729> the<00:00:06.970> diamond

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
here's an installation on the diamond

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.039 
here's an installation on the diamond
grade<00:00:07.980> product<00:00:08.980> this<00:00:09.820> is<00:00:09.879> just<00:00:10.330> a<00:00:10.510> simple

tailgate<00:00:11.799> what<00:00:12.670> we<00:00:12.789> did<00:00:13.029> is<00:00:13.180> we<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:14.320> the

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
tailgate what we did is we at the

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.629 
tailgate what we did is we at the
graphic<00:00:14.799> shop<00:00:14.980> just<00:00:15.129> like<00:00:15.309> we<00:00:15.430> do<00:00:15.549> with

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
graphic shop just like we do with

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.420 
graphic shop just like we do with
everything<00:00:15.969> we<00:00:16.630> cut<00:00:16.990> it<00:00:17.170> for<00:00:17.619> the<00:00:17.680> either<00:00:18.160> the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
everything we cut it for the either the

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.659 
everything we cut it for the either the
size<00:00:18.670> or<00:00:19.090> the<00:00:19.710> specs<00:00:20.710> that<00:00:20.859> our<00:00:21.189> customer

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
size or the specs that our customer

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.579 
size or the specs that our customer
requests<00:00:22.060> again<00:00:22.900> it's<00:00:23.080> just<00:00:23.230> to<00:00:23.320> make<00:00:23.439> the

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589 
requests again it's just to make the

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.339 
requests again it's just to make the
installation<00:00:24.130> a<00:00:24.369> little<00:00:24.429> bit<00:00:24.609> easier<00:00:24.699> than

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
installation a little bit easier than

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.349 
installation a little bit easier than
sending<00:00:26.349> out<00:00:26.619> a<00:00:26.679> full<00:00:27.279> sheet<00:00:27.609> and<00:00:27.880> then<00:00:28.089> trying

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
sending out a full sheet and then trying

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.599 
sending out a full sheet and then trying
to<00:00:28.480> work<00:00:28.779> around<00:00:28.929> these<00:00:29.259> big<00:00:29.499> four<00:00:29.800> logos<00:00:30.249> and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
to work around these big four logos and

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.350 
to work around these big four logos and
and<00:00:30.820> tailgate<00:00:31.570> handles<00:00:32.529> and<00:00:32.710> what<00:00:32.829> not<00:00:33.360> Adam

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
and tailgate handles and what not Adam

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.210 
and tailgate handles and what not Adam
is<00:00:34.480> not<00:00:34.630> pre<00:00:34.930> masking<00:00:35.320> this<00:00:35.470> is<00:00:35.650> because<00:00:35.980> it<00:00:36.100> is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
is not pre masking this is because it is

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.650 
is not pre masking this is because it is
diamond<00:00:36.640> grade<00:00:36.850> so<00:00:37.000> it's<00:00:37.120> a<00:00:37.180> very<00:00:38.340> thick

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
diamond grade so it's a very thick

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.960 
diamond grade so it's a very thick
material<00:00:40.660> and<00:00:41.340> then<00:00:42.340> what<00:00:42.460> he's<00:00:42.550> doing<00:00:42.850> is

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
material and then what he's doing is

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.670 
material and then what he's doing is
just<00:00:43.000> like<00:00:43.330> he's<00:00:43.450> done<00:00:43.660> everything<00:00:43.960> hinge<00:00:44.650> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
just like he's done everything hinge it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.370 
just like he's done everything hinge it
line<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.710> up<00:00:48.120> he<00:00:49.120> did<00:00:49.270> not<00:00:49.420> tack<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.080> vinyl

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
line it up he did not tack the vinyl

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.870 
line it up he did not tack the vinyl
this<00:00:50.500> time<00:00:50.740> because<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.220> diamond<00:00:51.520> grate<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.850> a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
this time because the diamond grate is a

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.530 
this time because the diamond grate is a
more<00:00:52.300> aggressive<00:00:53.170> adhesive<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.790> in<00:00:55.150> this<00:00:55.330> case

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
more aggressive adhesive so in this case

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.080 
more aggressive adhesive so in this case
what<00:00:55.750> he<00:00:55.840> did<00:00:55.990> is<00:00:56.170> he<00:00:56.200> kind<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.680> is<00:00:57.280> hinges<00:00:57.940> of

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
what he did is he kind of is hinges of

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.700 
what he did is he kind of is hinges of
smaller<00:00:58.360> hinge<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.080> that<00:00:59.110> he<00:00:59.320> doesn't<00:00:59.590> have

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
smaller hinge so that he doesn't have

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.220 
smaller hinge so that he doesn't have
too<00:01:00.220> much<00:01:00.310> material<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.820> work<00:01:01.000> with<00:01:01.240> almost<00:01:01.510> a

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
too much material to work with almost a

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.140 
too much material to work with almost a
foot<00:01:02.530> foot<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:02.830> a<00:01:02.950> half<00:01:03.070> even<00:01:03.280> two<00:01:03.700> feet<00:01:03.970> is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
foot foot and a half even two feet is

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.200 
foot foot and a half even two feet is
going<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.360> be<00:01:04.449> plenty<00:01:04.689> and<00:01:05.019> then<00:01:06.060> again<00:01:07.060> it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
going to be plenty and then again it

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.929 
going to be plenty and then again it
just<00:01:07.240> makes<00:01:07.420> for<00:01:07.719> easier<00:01:08.079> application<00:01:08.939> limits

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
just makes for easier application limits

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.190 
just makes for easier application limits
the<00:01:10.060> amount<00:01:10.119> of<00:01:10.270> bubbles<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:10.899> can<00:01:11.049> get

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
the amount of bubbles that you can get

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.599 
the amount of bubbles that you can get
into<00:01:11.439> it<00:01:11.469> and<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:11.770> can<00:01:11.920> see<00:01:12.070> how<00:01:12.130> thick<00:01:12.460> and

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:12.609 
into it and you can see how thick and

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:15.450 
into it and you can see how thick and
brittle<00:01:12.939> that<00:01:13.090> material<00:01:13.570> is<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:15.130> again<00:01:15.340> he's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
brittle that material is but again he's

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.849 
brittle that material is but again he's
just<00:01:15.640> kind<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.880> lining<00:01:16.659> it<00:01:16.749> up<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.049> then

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
just kind of lining it up and then

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.940 
just kind of lining it up and then
working<00:01:18.159> out<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.549> air<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:20.590> go<00:01:20.740> back<00:01:20.920> and

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
working out the air and then go back and

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.399 
working out the air and then go back and
seal<00:01:21.310> kind<00:01:21.609> of<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.729> edges<00:01:22.119> always<00:01:23.049> working

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
seal kind of the edges always working

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.969 
seal kind of the edges always working
from<00:01:23.499> the<00:01:23.649> inside<00:01:23.679> out<00:01:24.429> so<00:01:25.469> make<00:01:26.469> sure<00:01:26.770> all<00:01:26.859> the

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
from the inside out so make sure all the

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.109 
from the inside out so make sure all the
air<00:01:27.189> gets<00:01:27.609> released<00:01:29.609> he's<00:01:30.609> done<00:01:30.880> some

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
air gets released he's done some

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.029 
air gets released he's done some
pre-existing<00:01:31.810> cut<00:01:32.079> marks<00:01:32.409> for<00:01:32.770> like<00:01:32.889> the

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
pre-existing cut marks for like the

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.910 
pre-existing cut marks for like the
taillight<00:01:33.549> or<00:01:33.819> to<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:34.840> tailgate<00:01:35.200> handle<00:01:35.469> and

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
taillight or to the tailgate handle and

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.219 
taillight or to the tailgate handle and
that<00:01:36.100> four<00:01:36.369> logo<00:01:36.819> this<00:01:37.600> will<00:01:37.810> help<00:01:37.960> for<00:01:38.109> the

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
that four logo this will help for the

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.870 
that four logo this will help for the
easier<00:01:38.560> application<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.399> he<00:01:39.490> because<00:01:39.789> you

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
easier application so he because you

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.980 
easier application so he because you
cannot<00:01:40.240> go<00:01:40.420> back<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.659> cut<00:01:41.609> on<00:01:42.609> the<00:01:43.539> vehicle

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
cannot go back and cut on the vehicle

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.199 
cannot go back and cut on the vehicle
and<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:45.039> do<00:01:45.189> not<00:01:45.340> want<00:01:45.579> for<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.850> diamond

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
and you do not want for the diamond

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.120 
and you do not want for the diamond
grade<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.780> do<00:01:46.899> not<00:01:47.020> want<00:01:47.289> it<00:01:47.439> to<00:01:47.619> leave<00:01:47.829> the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
grade you do not want it to leave the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.789 
grade you do not want it to leave the
material<00:01:48.399> open<00:01:49.119> if<00:01:49.329> you<00:01:49.810> do<00:01:50.319> not<00:01:50.439> seal<00:01:50.770> the

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
material open if you do not seal the

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.349 
material open if you do not seal the
edges<00:01:51.069> for<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.429> diamond<00:01:51.700> great<00:01:51.850> because<00:01:52.240> of

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
edges for the diamond great because of

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.989 
edges for the diamond great because of
that<00:01:52.450> honeycomb<00:01:52.929> effect<00:01:53.319> it<00:01:54.249> will<00:01:54.579> allow

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
that honeycomb effect it will allow

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:59.190 
that honeycomb effect it will allow
water<00:01:55.420> air<00:01:55.929> dirt<00:01:56.740> anything<00:01:57.579> to<00:01:57.899> get<00:01:58.899> trapped

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
water air dirt anything to get trapped

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.510 
water air dirt anything to get trapped
inside<00:01:59.409> of<00:01:59.770> it<00:02:01.529> and<00:02:02.529> because<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.249> was<00:02:03.369> already

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
inside of it and because it was already

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.459 
inside of it and because it was already
pre-cut<00:02:04.029> you<00:02:04.240> can<00:02:04.359> see<00:02:04.539> how<00:02:04.630> easy<00:02:04.929> that<00:02:05.049> little

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
pre-cut you can see how easy that little

pre-cut you can see how easy that little
application<00:02:06.189> was<00:02:06.549> instead<00:02:06.999> of<00:02:07.119> trying<00:02:07.359> to<00:02:07.420> go

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
application was instead of trying to go

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.080 
application was instead of trying to go
back<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:07.990> cut<00:02:08.200> around<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.709> or<00:02:08.860> do<00:02:08.979> anything

back and cut around it or do anything

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300 
back and cut around it or do anything
afterwards

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
afterwards

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.050 
afterwards
it<00:02:12.310> just<00:02:12.640> helps<00:02:12.939> for<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> lot<00:02:13.299> of<00:02:13.390> these<00:02:13.480> contour

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
it just helps for a lot of these contour

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.130 
it just helps for a lot of these contour
angles<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.269> these<00:02:16.360> body<00:02:16.629> lines

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140

Ford Explorer can have some issues just

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.130 
Ford Explorer can have some issues just
because<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.760> all<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.030> contours<00:02:22.569> to<00:02:22.870> make

squeegee it's not the gray color we
actually<00:02:44.049> put<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.799> a<00:02:44.829> little<00:02:45.189> sleeve<00:02:45.670> over

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
actually put like a little sleeve over

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.750 
actually put like a little sleeve over
the<00:02:46.209> top<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.769> if<00:02:47.890> anything's<00:02:48.280> not<00:02:48.459> pre

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
the top of it so if anything's not pre

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.420 
the top of it so if anything's not pre
masked<00:02:49.000> we<00:02:49.269> do<00:02:49.450> cover<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.200> squeegees<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:51.280> not

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
masked we do cover the squeegees to not

masked we do cover the squeegees to not
leave<00:02:51.670> marks<00:02:52.120> or<00:02:52.269> blemishes<00:02:52.599> on<00:02:52.840> there<00:02:53.079> it

leave marks or blemishes on there it

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.890 
leave marks or blemishes on there it
just<00:02:54.099> makes<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.700> application<00:02:55.629> go<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> little

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
just makes the application go a little

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.289 
just makes the application go a little
bit<00:02:56.079> smoother<00:02:56.590> protects<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.340> vinyl<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.209> you

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
bit smoother protects the vinyl so you

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.509 
bit smoother protects the vinyl so you
can<00:02:58.510> either<00:02:58.750> pre<00:02:59.109> mask<00:02:59.349> this<00:02:59.560> or<00:02:59.799> you<00:03:00.310> can<00:03:00.489> use

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
can either pre mask this or you can use

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.649 
can either pre mask this or you can use
like<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.819> felt<00:03:01.150> squeegee<00:03:02.099> sleeve<00:03:03.099> and<00:03:03.430> that

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
like a felt squeegee sleeve and that

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.530 
like a felt squeegee sleeve and that
also<00:03:04.659> can<00:03:04.959> help<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.230> application<00:03:06.540> because

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
also can help the application because

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.300 
also can help the application because
you<00:03:07.629> can<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:07.870> there's<00:03:08.049> no<00:03:08.139> scuff<00:03:08.470> marks<00:03:08.799> on<00:03:08.980> it

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
you can see there's no scuff marks on it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.059 
you can see there's no scuff marks on it
at<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.730> very<00:03:09.939> end<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:11.230> now<00:03:11.769> he's<00:03:11.919> just

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
at the very end and now he's just

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.619 
at the very end and now he's just
peeling<00:03:12.250> off<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.489> tape<00:03:15.329> to<00:03:16.329> show<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
peeling off the tape to show you the

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.690 
peeling off the tape to show you the
final<00:03:16.810> product<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:20.500> as<00:03:21.129> you<00:03:21.219> can<00:03:21.310> see<00:03:21.370> that

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
final product and as you can see that

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.280 
final product and as you can see that
little<00:03:21.849> honeycomb<00:03:22.180> effect<00:03:22.719> that<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.109> the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
little honeycomb effect that is the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.489 
little honeycomb effect that is the
diamond<00:03:23.709> grade<00:03:23.889> material
