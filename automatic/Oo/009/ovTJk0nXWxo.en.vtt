Salman's<00:00:53.550> done<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.539> right

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
Salman's done that I really like right

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.779 
Salman's done that I really like right
off<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> hop<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.920> they've<00:00:56.100> actually<00:00:56.280> tried<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
off the hop is they've actually tried to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.639 
off the hop is they've actually tried to
do<00:00:56.969> something<00:00:57.239> different<00:00:57.420> which<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.289> cool

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
do something different which is cool

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.040 
do something different which is cool
they're<00:00:59.100> using<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> copper<00:01:00.030> micro<00:01:00.600> fin<00:01:00.809> design

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
they're using a copper micro fin design

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.139 
they're using a copper micro fin design
for<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> CPU<00:01:01.980> block<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:02.969> got<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
for the CPU block here so it's got a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.030 
for the CPU block here so it's got a
nice<00:01:03.390> copper<00:01:03.780> base<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
nice copper base on it like that and you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.700 
nice copper base on it like that and you
can<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.119> does<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:07.170> little<00:01:07.409> bit<00:01:07.619> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
can see it does have a little bit of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.530 
can see it does have a little bit of
sort<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.189> Sutekh<00:01:08.549> looking<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
sort of a Sutekh looking this to the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.020 
sort of a Sutekh looking this to the
shape<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.320> uses<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> puck<00:01:11.220> sort

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
shape of it so it uses like a puck sort

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.870 
shape of it so it uses like a puck sort
of<00:01:12.150> design<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> pump<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.680> CCU<00:01:14.640> block

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of design for the pump and CCU block

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.609 
of design for the pump and CCU block
which<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> combo<00:01:15.659> unit<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.290> uses

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
which are a combo unit and then it uses

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.070 
which are a combo unit and then it uses
retention<00:01:17.250> ring<00:01:17.970> hold<00:01:18.299> down<00:01:18.479> base<00:01:18.750> things

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
retention ring hold down base things

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.390 
retention ring hold down base things
like<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.680> they're<00:01:19.860> mounted<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.220> little

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
like this but they're mounted a little

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.620 
like this but they're mounted a little
bit<00:01:20.520> differently<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.540> on

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
bit differently so they actually go on

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780 
bit differently so they actually go on
the<00:01:21.750> bottom<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.350> screw<00:01:22.950> into<00:01:23.100> place<00:01:23.460> and

the bottom here screw into place and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.249 
the bottom here screw into place and
then<00:01:23.939> mount<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.479> motherboard<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.900> that

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
then mount to your motherboard like that

quarter inch tubing and they're using
that<00:01:48.030> nice<00:01:48.890> super<00:01:49.890> flexible<00:01:50.689> non<00:01:51.689> evaporative

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that nice super flexible non evaporative

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.109 
that nice super flexible non evaporative
stuff<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> don't<00:01:53.520> know<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> guys<00:01:53.850> know

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
stuff so I don't know if you guys know

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.450 
stuff so I don't know if you guys know
this<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.360> most<00:01:54.869> tubing<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.560> somewhat<00:01:56.100> porous

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
this but most tubing is somewhat porous

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.889 
this but most tubing is somewhat porous
which<00:01:56.820> means<00:01:57.060> some<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> fluid<00:01:57.780> will

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
which means some of the fluid will

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.100 
which means some of the fluid will
evaporate<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.759> stuff<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.689> very

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
evaporate and this stuff is is not very

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.249 
evaporate and this stuff is is not very
porous<00:02:01.439> at<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:02.250> next<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.570> are<00:02:03.719> using

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
porous at all next up is they are using

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.749 
porous at all next up is they are using
a<00:02:04.530> nano<00:02:05.479> fluid<00:02:06.479> nano<00:02:06.930> particle<00:02:07.799> fluid<00:02:08.429> inside

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
a nano fluid nano particle fluid inside

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
a nano fluid nano particle fluid inside
so<00:02:09.030> instead<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.660> using<00:02:09.780> water<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.619> some

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
so instead of just using water with some

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.740 
so instead of just using water with some
glycol<00:02:11.340> which<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:12.000> what<00:02:12.180> we're<00:02:12.330> typically

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
glycol which is what we're typically

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.550 
glycol which is what we're typically
used<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.170> see

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
used to see

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320 
used to see
in<00:02:13.860> these<00:02:14.069> because<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.520> its<00:02:14.760> anti-corrosive

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
in these because of its anti-corrosive

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.000 
in these because of its anti-corrosive
properties<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.290> its<00:02:16.380> anti-freeze

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
properties and its anti-freeze

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.410 
properties and its anti-freeze
properties<00:02:17.550> which<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.730> great<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.150> shipping

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
properties which is great for shipping

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.089 
properties which is great for shipping
all<00:02:18.540> over<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> world<00:02:19.050> they're<00:02:19.650> using<00:02:20.010> a

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
all over the world they're using a

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.100 
all over the world they're using a
completely<00:02:20.700> different<00:02:20.849> approach<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.750> may

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
completely different approach that may

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.360 
completely different approach that may
actually<00:02:22.410> contribute<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.220> better

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
actually contribute to better

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.430 
actually contribute to better
performance<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.510> want<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.930> finish<00:02:25.080> up<00:02:25.319> with

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
performance so I want to finish up with

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.080 
performance so I want to finish up with
the<00:02:25.560> block<00:02:25.770> here<00:02:26.069> where<00:02:26.250> they've<00:02:26.430> got<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> nice

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the block here where they've got a nice

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.860 
the block here where they've got a nice
shiny<00:02:27.900> Zalman<00:02:28.590> logo<00:02:28.980> as<00:02:29.220> well<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.849> blue<00:02:30.660> LED

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
shiny Zalman logo as well as a blue LED

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.259 
shiny Zalman logo as well as a blue LED
element<00:02:31.709> here<00:02:31.950> around<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.489> they've<00:02:32.940> got<00:02:33.239> a

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
element here around it they've got a

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.300 
element here around it they've got a
three<00:02:33.810> pin<00:02:34.080> right<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.890> that's<00:02:35.069> going<00:02:35.250> to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
three pin right here so that's going to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.949 
three pin right here so that's going to
power<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.730> pump<00:02:35.940> as<00:02:36.120> well<00:02:36.150> as<00:02:36.450> monitor<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
power the pump as well as monitor the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.420 
power the pump as well as monitor the
RPM<00:02:37.470> when<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:37.800> installed<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.310> your

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
RPM when it's installed on your

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.940 
RPM when it's installed on your
motherboard<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.030> then<00:02:39.630> let's<00:02:40.230> move<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.709> to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
motherboard and then let's move up to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.130 
motherboard and then let's move up to
the<00:02:41.040> radiator<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.760> radiator<00:02:42.239> uses<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> very

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
the radiator so the radiator uses a very

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.340 
the radiator so the radiator uses a very
Zalman<00:02:43.860> looking<00:02:44.430> design<00:02:45.390> here<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.230> it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
Zalman looking design here so it

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.229 
Zalman looking design here so it
actually<00:02:46.739> looks<00:02:46.920> kind<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.220> like<00:02:47.370> their<00:02:47.610> CE<00:02:47.819> NPS

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
actually looks kind of like their CE NPS

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.009 
actually looks kind of like their CE NPS
9900<00:02:49.170> series<00:02:49.500> where<00:02:49.709> they've<00:02:49.890> got<00:02:50.130> all<00:02:51.019> sort

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
9900 series where they've got all sort

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.570 
9900 series where they've got all sort
of<00:02:52.049> what<00:02:52.230> looked<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.590> curved<00:02:53.010> heat<00:02:53.310> pipes

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
of what looked like curved heat pipes

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.550 
of what looked like curved heat pipes
but<00:02:53.940> are<00:02:54.030> actually<00:02:54.209> water<00:02:54.750> channels<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.380> this

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
but are actually water channels in this

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.580 
but are actually water channels in this
case<00:02:55.799> that<00:02:56.459> go<00:02:56.670> around<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:58.049> outside<00:02:58.200> so

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
case that go around the outside so

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.530 
case that go around the outside so
there's<00:02:58.769> actually<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.130> dual<00:02:59.489> radiator<00:03:00.060> design

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
there's actually a dual radiator design

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.870 
there's actually a dual radiator design
here<00:03:00.930> that's<00:03:01.380> kind<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.799> masked<00:03:02.370> by<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.549> fact

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
here that's kind of masked by the fact

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.490 
here that's kind of masked by the fact
that<00:03:03.000> there's<00:03:03.269> this<00:03:03.450> plastic<00:03:03.930> shroud<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.230> it

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
that there's this plastic shroud on it

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
that there's this plastic shroud on it
so<00:03:04.620> there's<00:03:04.799> an<00:03:04.890> inner<00:03:05.099> one<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.519> an<00:03:06.000> outer<00:03:06.239> one

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
so there's an inner one and an outer one

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.150 
so there's an inner one and an outer one
both<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.989> which<00:03:07.110> are<00:03:07.230> going<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.440> benefit<00:03:07.950> from

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
both of which are going to benefit from

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.210 
both of which are going to benefit from
the<00:03:08.819> airflow<00:03:09.450> from<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.810> single<00:03:10.440> 120

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
the airflow from the single 120

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.190 
the airflow from the single 120
millimeter<00:03:11.610> fan<00:03:11.940> that's<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.930> now<00:03:13.049> one

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
millimeter fan that's on it now one

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.570 
millimeter fan that's on it now one
thing<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.440> don't<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.769> about<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.430> you

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
thing I don't like about it is you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.339 
thing I don't like about it is you
typically<00:03:14.940> do<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.360> better<00:03:15.510> performance<00:03:16.200> out

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
typically do get better performance out

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.800 
typically do get better performance out
of<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.560> radiator<00:03:17.010> if<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.579> are<00:03:17.820> shrouding<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
of a radiator if you are shrouding the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.539 
of a radiator if you are shrouding the
outside<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.500> fan<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:19.709> you're<00:03:20.040> focusing

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
outside of the fan so you're focusing

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.130 
outside of the fan so you're focusing
the<00:03:20.670> airflow<00:03:21.060> through<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.540> fins

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
the airflow through the fins

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.800 
the airflow through the fins
however<00:03:22.890> Zelman<00:03:23.670> sort<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.209> figures<00:03:24.600> they've

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
gotten they've achieved good enough

performance<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.180> fashion<00:03:27.660> if<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.019> do

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
performance in this fashion if you do

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.840 
performance in this fashion if you do
want<00:03:28.620> more<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.980> traditional<00:03:29.459> fan<00:03:29.670> on<00:03:29.819> the

config<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.660> one<00:03:36.840> fan<00:03:37.049> that's<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.380> there<00:03:37.560> now

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
config the one fan that's on there now

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.979 
config the one fan that's on there now
is<00:03:37.920> powered<00:03:38.190> by<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.370> 4-pin<00:03:38.850> pwm<00:03:39.510> connector

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
is powered by a 4-pin pwm connector

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.330 
is powered by a 4-pin pwm connector
right<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.650> comes<00:03:40.829> out<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.190> back

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
right there that comes out of the back

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.099 
right there that comes out of the back
here<00:03:41.579> oh<00:03:41.700> another<00:03:42.180> thing<00:03:42.420> guys<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.780> should<00:03:42.989> be

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
here oh another thing guys it should be

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.539 
here oh another thing guys it should be
noted<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.590> other<00:03:43.859> fan<00:03:44.130> will<00:03:44.280> have<00:03:44.400> the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
noted that that other fan will have the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.250 
noted that that other fan will have the
same<00:03:44.730> drawbacks<00:03:45.239> where<00:03:45.480> it'll<00:03:45.630> be<00:03:45.750> able<00:03:45.870> to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
same drawbacks where it'll be able to

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.530 
same drawbacks where it'll be able to
pull<00:03:46.859> air<00:03:47.130> through<00:03:47.160> gaps<00:03:47.790> here<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.269> it's<00:03:48.389> not

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
pull air through gaps here so it's not

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.599 
pull air through gaps here so it's not
actually<00:03:49.290> forcing<00:03:49.769> all<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:50.010> air<00:03:50.130> through<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
actually forcing all the air through the

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.300 
actually forcing all the air through the
fins<00:03:51.079> so<00:03:52.079> just<00:03:52.319> just<00:03:52.560> like<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.889> one<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:53.160> the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
fins so just just like the one on the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.720 
fins so just just like the one on the
front

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
front

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.789 
front
however<00:03:54.269> for<00:03:54.720> something<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.139> this<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.650> can

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
however for something like this it can

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.590 
however for something like this it can
have<00:03:55.980> sort<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.310> all<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.609> cool-looking<00:03:57.299> design

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600
