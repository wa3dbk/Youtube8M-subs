whatever and another good solution of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.170 
whatever and another good solution of
course<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:50.489> them<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.820> counterbalance

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.319 
different size in the same package okay
so<00:01:52.889> when<00:01:53.099> you<00:01:53.189> buy<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> package<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.849> have<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so when you buy a package you have to

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.870 
so when you buy a package you have to
option<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.989> colors<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.649> two<00:01:56.099> option<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.609> size

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
option of colors and two option of size

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.849 
option of colors and two option of size
okay<00:01:57.389> and<00:01:57.569> I<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.840> also<00:01:57.989> that<00:01:58.319> this<00:01:58.529> one<00:01:58.709> has

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
okay and I see also that this one has

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.039 
okay and I see also that this one has
like<00:01:59.039> looks<00:01:59.849> like<00:01:59.999> glitter<00:02:00.239> in<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.539> yes<00:02:00.779> yes

like looks like glitter in it yes yes
what<00:02:01.349> was<00:02:01.499> the<00:02:01.529> thinking<00:02:01.770> behind<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.159> well

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
what was the thinking behind that well

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.179 
what was the thinking behind that well
especially<00:02:03.239> for<00:02:03.829> waters<00:02:04.829> where<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.099> are

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
especially for waters where we are

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.349 
especially for waters where we are
fishing<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.609> we<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.819> fishing<00:02:05.969> today

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
fishing like we are fishing today

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.029 
fishing like we are fishing today
yeah<00:02:06.659> pretty<00:02:06.989> clear<00:02:07.289> crystal<00:02:07.649> clear<00:02:07.679> water

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
yeah pretty clear crystal clear water

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.279 
yeah pretty clear crystal clear water
yeah<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:09.209> know<00:02:09.329> some<00:02:09.539> kind<00:02:09.689> of<00:02:09.810> fishes<00:02:10.110> they

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
yeah you know some kind of fishes they

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.090 
yeah you know some kind of fishes they
are<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
are can be a

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.180 
are can be a
tricky<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.340> catch<00:02:12.490> them<00:02:12.700> yeah<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.740> we<00:02:14.740> we<00:02:15.100> have

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
tricky to catch them yeah and we we have

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.770 
tricky to catch them yeah and we we have
used<00:02:15.370> them<00:02:15.520> quite<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.910> few<00:02:16.120> time<00:02:16.300> already<00:02:16.540> now

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
used them quite a few time already now

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.080 
used them quite a few time already now
and<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.890> makes<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.280> difference<00:02:18.310> sometime<00:02:18.820> just

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
and it makes a difference sometime just

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.120 
and it makes a difference sometime just
to<00:02:19.390> save<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.600> bit<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.960> fleshie<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.800> your<00:02:20.950> bait

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
to save a bit of fleshie to your bait

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.500 
to save a bit of fleshie to your bait
something<00:02:22.000> different<00:02:23.880> stuff<00:02:24.880> face<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.300> mean

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510

brush this one as well will be

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.970 
brush this one as well will be
triggering<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> visuals<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.980> another
