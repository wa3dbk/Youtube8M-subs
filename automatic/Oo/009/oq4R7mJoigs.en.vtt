digital stills camera that you can see
in<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> front<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.210> screen<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:58.609> move<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
in the front of screen I move the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
in the front of screen I move the
character<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.480> bit<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.870> take<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> photo

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
character a little bit we take a photo

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.049 
character a little bit we take a photo
move<00:01:01.859> over<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.980> little<00:01:02.100> bit<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.430> take<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> photo

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
move over a little bit more take a photo

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.549 
move over a little bit more take a photo
and<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> appearance<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and that's how we get the appearance of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.340 
and that's how we get the appearance of
motion<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.090> decide<00:01:06.390> beforehand<00:01:06.930> exactly

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
motion so we decide beforehand exactly

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.020 
motion so we decide beforehand exactly
what<00:01:07.530> movement<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> happen<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.909> who

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
what movement is going to happen and who

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
what movement is going to happen and who
moves<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.510> when<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
moves what when and that's all this to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.050 
moves what when and that's all this to
down<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.100> those<00:01:11.220> lip-sync<00:01:11.670> sheets<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
down on those lip-sync sheets that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.359 
down on those lip-sync sheets that
Janine<00:01:12.330> has<00:01:12.560> until<00:01:13.560> she<00:01:13.710> keeps<00:01:13.920> an<00:01:14.040> eye<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
Janine has until she keeps an eye on the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.039 
Janine has until she keeps an eye on the
timing<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.150> moved<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> characters<00:01:15.960> I've

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
timing as I moved the characters I've

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
timing as I moved the characters I've
got<00:01:16.140> three<00:01:16.320> characters<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> animate<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.430> so

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
got three characters to animate here so

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.010 
got three characters to animate here so
it's<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.170> complicated<00:01:19.710> shot<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> can

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it's a complicated shot and as you can

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.920 
it's a complicated shot and as you can
see<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.350> been<00:01:22.500> an<00:01:22.619> hour<00:01:22.740> already<00:01:23.689> it<00:01:24.689> takes<00:01:24.869> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
see it's been an hour already it takes a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.359 
see it's been an hour already it takes a
long<00:01:25.080> time<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.650> kind<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> animation

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
long time to do this kind of animation

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.140 
long time to do this kind of animation
but<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> results<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.659> quite<00:01:28.350> good

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
but I think the results are quite good

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.249 
but I think the results are quite good
we're<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> review<00:01:30.600> something<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:31.229> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
we're going to review something now I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.530 
we're going to review something now I
check<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.130> go<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.520> front<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> me<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
check it as we go in front of me that in

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.149 
check it as we go in front of me that in
the<00:01:33.630> middle<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> screen<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> monitor<00:01:34.680> where

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the middle of screen is a monitor where

going to review it and pop it into our
final<00:01:54.759> cut<00:01:54.939> pro<00:01:55.000> timeline<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.710> then<00:01:57.009> have<00:01:57.130> a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
final cut pro timeline and then have a

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.480 
final cut pro timeline and then have a
look<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.409> it's<00:02:02.530> quite<00:02:02.680> short<00:02:02.979> here's<00:02:03.250> how<00:02:03.399> it

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
look so it's quite short here's how it

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.789 
look so it's quite short here's how it
appears<00:02:03.759> with<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.030> dialogue<00:02:04.470> Dorian<00:02:05.470> you're

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
appears with the dialogue Dorian you're

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.280 
appears with the dialogue Dorian you're
on<00:02:06.009> clean<00:02:06.310> up<00:02:06.520> nah<00:02:07.210> man<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.750> for<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:10.959> couple<00:02:11.230> of

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
on clean up nah man so for a couple of

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.750 
on clean up nah man so for a couple of
seconds<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.769> takes<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.130> long<00:02:12.280> time<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.550> put

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
seconds it takes a long time to put

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.460 
seconds it takes a long time to put
together<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.390> think<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.810> done<00:02:14.019> it<00:02:14.260> looks

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
together but I think it done it looks

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.500 
together but I think it done it looks
great<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.519> that's<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.940> little<00:02:16.120> behind<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
great so that's a little behind the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.769 
great so that's a little behind the
scenes<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.930> tedium<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.470> vegan
