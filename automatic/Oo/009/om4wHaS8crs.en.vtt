00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
that's wonderful okay last year I use

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.099 
that's wonderful okay last year I use
the<00:04:02.030> top<00:04:02.209> thread<00:04:02.450> here<00:04:02.629> in<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.810> provincial

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
the top thread here in the provincial

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.380 
the top thread here in the provincial
program<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:04.280> certainly<00:04:04.730> seems<00:04:05.000> like<00:04:05.180> he's

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
program it certainly seems like he's

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.180 
program it certainly seems like he's
even<00:04:05.689> graduated<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.379> little<00:04:06.590> bit<00:04:06.709> better<00:04:06.859> to

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
even graduated a little bit better to

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.680 
even graduated a little bit better to
race<00:04:07.340> in<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.519> Grand<00:04:07.670> Circuit<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.510> guess

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
race in the Grand Circuit and I guess

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.360 
race in the Grand Circuit and I guess
next<00:04:09.620> on<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.799> list<00:04:09.890> is<00:04:10.010> got<00:04:10.159> to<00:04:10.220> be<00:04:10.280> the

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
next on the list is got to be the

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.640 
next on the list is got to be the
Hamiltonian<00:04:10.940> well<00:04:11.450> I'm<00:04:11.750> talked<00:04:12.079> to<00:04:12.200> Marc<00:04:12.409> yet

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
Hamiltonian well I'm talked to Marc yet

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.789 
Hamiltonian well I'm talked to Marc yet
but<00:04:13.010> he's<00:04:13.639> eligible<00:04:14.269> and<00:04:14.510> I<00:04:14.659> think<00:04:14.930> we<00:04:15.079> just

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
but he's eligible and I think we just

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.590 
but he's eligible and I think we just
had<00:04:16.010> 30<00:04:16.250> second<00:04:16.639> chat<00:04:16.820> with<00:04:16.970> Marc<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.389> think

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
had 30 second chat with Marc and I think

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.599 
had 30 second chat with Marc and I think
we're<00:04:17.750> going<00:04:17.900> okay<00:04:18.470> you're<00:04:19.250> part<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.519> the
