00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.400
 the name is jesus castillo and this is bodybuilding without nonsense 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.470
 on this occasion 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.110
 I want to share with you 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.110
 the three lies of bodybuilding training 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.849
 lie number one 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.389
 the nutritional supplements and will help you gain muscle 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.170
 assuming that by regulation 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.300
 nutrition lifestyle 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.550
 and sleep habits 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.339
 are operating at the optimum point of the spectrum 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.589
 introduce supplements for a 10% difference 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.650
 in the best case 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.530
 and I'm being generous 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.040
 I would generally say 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.190
 that make between 1 to 2% difference 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.870
 because they only work in synergy when your nutrition training 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.170
 and lifestyle are connected 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 and in the case of May the people who take supplements 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 This is not the case 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.350
 will you have 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.320
 more success taking your physical condition to the next level 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.530
 mastering the training techniques 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.439
 recovery techniques 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.509
 and nutrition habits that you'll find in the bodybuilding book without 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:11.640
 silly stuff 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.690
 choose any bodybuilding magazine you have out there 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.700
 and I promise you that the only thing that those supplement ads will give you was 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.930
 a more lightweight wallet 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.720
 powders are nothing but crushed foods that are loaded with 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.240
 artificial flavors 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.340
 condoms 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.340
 and a lot of chemicals 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.620
 liquids are certainly convenient and can help you 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.990
 achieve your calorie intake goals but do not fool yourself by believing 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 that you will have the same anabolic defect 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.900
 who has the food 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.650
 do not let any supplement advertisement convince you otherwise 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.950
 put artificial chemicals in your body 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.290
 it gets worse before sugar is sweeteners 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.690
 and condoms basically 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.369
 convert 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:14.380
 your insides in a 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.309
 toxic dump 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:17.339
 also 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.229
 did you know 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.510
 toxic waste 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.510
 loves to stick to your fat reserve 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.339
 doing something harder to eliminate body fat 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.879
 can you imagine how difficult it will be to develop massive muscle in a 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.819
 toxic environment 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.589
 what goes in has to come out 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.399
 get trash and garbage 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:43.510
 will come out 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.819
 in the form of energy decrease 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.859
 slow recovery 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.509
 lack of appetite 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.909
 poor dreams and a poor attitude 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.069
 which are elements 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.069
 critical for muscle development 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.999
 lie number 2 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.849
 you have to train 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.430
 between phases of low intensity 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.430
 and high intensity phases 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:16.919
 the fact is that your muscles can only be 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.080
 they will be able to get bigger 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.589
 and stronger 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:27.109
 as a result of applying the most fundamental principles of bodybuilding 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:31.569
 is voice to two in this book of bodybuilding without nonsense 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.299
 with progressive overload 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.709
 the low intensity training against says the most fundamental of the 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.600
 training principles 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 required to develop muscle 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.540
 about progressive loading means that gradually 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.069
 and consistent 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.299
 it increases 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.919
 the demand on the system 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.949
 skeletal muscle 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.510
 so that continuous openleaks profits 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.089
 in muscle size 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.670
 the strength the resistance 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.539
 and the flexibility 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.319
 in simple words 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.439
 must subject your muscles to stress 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.309
 unaccustomed 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.309
 when a muscle has subdued although the degree of stress 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:21.479
 and unaccustomed effort 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.120
 To the point of view of an injury, the muscle adapts to stress 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.069
 added 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.020
 getting bigger 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.610
 a simple principle by definition however the term has been abused 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.500
 taking out of context 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.710
 and executing the very poorly 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.100
 Remember that your muscles will only be larger than enough basins 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.830
 to do it 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.909
 what will your muscles be like 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.269
 if they reduce the overload to make a phase of great intensity 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.809
 you can not develop new muscles because there is no overload 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.540
 when you enter lightweight you are wasting your time 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.580
 and the resources of your body 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.379
 that could be used to restore 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.669
 and recover your body which 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.099
 it would accelerate your recovery 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.150
 and the opportunity to overload again 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.470
 The intensity 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.469
 is one of the three main variables of training 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.509
 that less times forgotten 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:22.960
 intensity 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.189
 duration 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.539
 and frequency 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.279
 this means that if the intensity of 6 x world life 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.430
 for a certain period of time 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.249
 Strength and muscle gains yield 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:35.930
 c deteriorates 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.569
 very quickly 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.819
 decrease the frequency that and the duration 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.379
 Massa more often has a positive response 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.839
 has a less negative impact on your muscle gains 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.020
 comparing it with the disastrous consequences of decreasing 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.259
 you intensity 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.719
 if you are going to rest 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.310
 if you are going to train hard 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.400
 trained hard 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.650
 lie number 3 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.860
 if you're not getting bigger 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.860
 by genetic duck 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:17.599
 what a pity that the advice of your parents choose wisely 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.629
 this one out of your power 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.139
 in the end, having bad genetics is an excuse for the lazy 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:27.050
 it's an easy way out 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.960
 and it's a very convincing very convenient way to sneak away 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.050
 especially when there is not someone out there who proves that it's true 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.409
 how safe can we be 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.990
 when the time 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.479
 who complains about adding genetics 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.219
 between the calves from time to time 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:48.219
 he remembers and with garbage 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:51.869
 when nobody sees it 

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:56.949
 maybe he was born with 50% less muscle fiber than the rest of us without 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:57.960
 embargo 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.379
 most likely 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:03.139
 is that you have not learned the basic principles of muscle growth 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.139
 clearly the genetic problem 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.509
 most of the time 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:11.990
 the problem is everything 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.120
 most of the time the problem is you 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.369
 but nevertheless 

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:20.800
 if truly this genetically damned 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.680
 forever 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.180
 you'll have to work a little harder 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.349
 so that you keep up 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:27.729
 However 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:32.220
 I think you'll be quite surprised with the results you'll get 

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:35.270
 with this program 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.270
 I like epi clarify very well 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:40.949
 skinny guy 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:42.939
 there is no excuse I repeat it 

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:44.699
 there is no excuse 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.159
 to throw in the towel to give up 

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:48.999
 if you are wishful 

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:51.999
 if you have those who little friend of the muscles 

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:55.680
 training more intelligently 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.949
 you can opera most of the obstacles 

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:01.949
 and disguise your limitations 

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:06.460
 know more about these principles of training 

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.369
 and how to develop muscle mass and
