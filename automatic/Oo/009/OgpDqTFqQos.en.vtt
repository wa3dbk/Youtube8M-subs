00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
3 or if you think about it as quick

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.890 
3 or if you think about it as quick
quick<00:00:26.939> slow

right<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.710> she's<00:00:29.010> following<00:00:29.369> whatever

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
right and she's following whatever

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.810 
right and she's following whatever
choice<00:00:30.599> I'm<00:00:30.900> making<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.189> transition

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
choice I'm making so we can transition

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.840 
choice I'm making so we can transition
between<00:00:32.969> them<00:00:33.300> ok<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:35.130> played<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> song

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
between them ok then we played a song

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.060 
between them ok then we played a song
with<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> break<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.380> break<00:00:37.620> really

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
with a break in it and the break really

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.500 
with a break in it and the break really
changed<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> music's<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.030> said<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.360> could

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
changed the music's we said we could

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.740 
changed the music's we said we could
just<00:00:39.690> hold<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.590> place<00:00:40.860> right<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.210> leads<00:00:42.540> are

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
just hold in place right the leads are

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.869 
just hold in place right the leads are
engaging<00:00:43.230> accord<00:00:43.860> may<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.160> toning<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
engaging accord may be toning up the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.119 
engaging accord may be toning up the
connection<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.450> bit<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.899> she<00:00:45.960> knows<00:00:46.230> 2<00:00:46.590> 1

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
connection a little bit so she knows 2 1

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.240 
connection a little bit so she knows 2 1
from<00:00:47.340> movement<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.239> stop<00:00:48.780> right<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.129> in

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
from movement to stop right and then in

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.639 
from movement to stop right and then in
the<00:00:50.399> break<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.969> follow<00:00:51.270> could<00:00:51.660> maybe<00:00:51.930> do

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the break the follow could maybe do

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.670 
the break the follow could maybe do
something<00:00:52.949> hip<00:00:53.340> accent<00:00:53.820> foot<00:00:54.390> accent<00:00:54.930> maybe<00:00:55.530> a

something hip accent foot accent maybe a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.229

little mini a shoulder shimmy whatever

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
little mini a shoulder shimmy whatever
it<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:58.170> he's<00:00:58.530> creating<00:00:59.010> space

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it is right because he's creating space

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.830 
it is right because he's creating space
it's<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> really<00:00:59.910> nice<00:01:00.059> place<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> follow

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840

to<00:01:01.050> talk<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:01.920> when<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> beat<00:01:02.340> comes

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
to talk and then when the beat comes

to talk and then when the beat comes
back<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.750> move<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.610> ok<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.210> else

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
we do in the first part we talked a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.130 
we do in the first part we talked a
little<00:01:08.760> bit<00:01:09.000> about<00:01:10.220> about<00:01:11.220> style<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.080> sort<00:01:13.080> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
little bit about about style and sort of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.320 
little bit about about style and sort of
changing<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.619> shape<00:01:13.860> right<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.150> could

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
changing your shape right so we could

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.929 
changing your shape right so we could
use<00:01:15.540> our<00:01:15.780> upper<00:01:16.140> body<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.950> create<00:01:17.130> shapes<00:01:17.580> or

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
use our upper body to create shapes or

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.850 
use our upper body to create shapes or
we<00:01:18.900> could<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.500> hip<00:01:19.920> hits<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.710> could

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
we could do hip hits right and we could

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.890 
we could do hip hits right and we could
stay<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.580> foot<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.119> notice<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
stay on one foot or notice that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260 
stay on one foot or notice that
sometimes<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.710> actually<00:01:25.860> shift<00:01:26.460> weight<00:01:26.700> all

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
sometimes we actually shift weight all

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.780 
sometimes we actually shift weight all
right<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:27.780> version<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.320> down<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.960 
pushing off the floor or anything that
was<00:01:55.330> mostly<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.680> first<00:01:56.950> part<00:01:57.220> okay

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
was mostly the first part okay

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.170 
was mostly the first part okay
part<00:01:58.420> two<00:01:58.690> we<00:01:59.140> started<00:01:59.470> with<00:01:59.850> cross<00:02:00.850> through

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
part two we started with cross through

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.130 
part two we started with cross through
steps<00:02:01.510> so<00:02:02.260> we're<00:02:02.440> just<00:02:02.470> opening<00:02:02.830> up<00:02:03.430> right<00:02:04.140> we

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
steps so we're just opening up right we

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.400 
steps so we're just opening up right we
said<00:02:05.350> oh<00:02:05.500> we<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:05.950> open<00:02:06.310> up<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.850> other<00:02:06.880> side<00:02:07.420> or

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
said oh we can open up the other side or

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.680 
said oh we can open up the other side or
we<00:02:08.560> could<00:02:08.709> go<00:02:08.800> back<00:02:09.209> reversing<00:02:10.209> what<00:02:10.390> we<00:02:10.479> did

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
we could go back reversing what we did

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.280 
we could go back reversing what we did
stepping<00:02:11.560> behind<00:02:12.000> or<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.450> lead<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.870> change

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
stepping behind or the lead to change

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.680 
stepping behind or the lead to change
the<00:02:15.130> connection<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.820> she<00:02:15.880> could<00:02:16.270> cross<00:02:16.480> in

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
the connection and she could cross in

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.330 
the connection and she could cross in
front<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.560> he<00:02:17.709> could<00:02:17.890> cross<00:02:18.070> behind

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
front and he could cross behind

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.060 
front and he could cross behind
depending<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.209> whether<00:02:20.050> I'm<00:02:20.320> allowing<00:02:20.709> her<00:02:21.040> to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
depending on whether I'm allowing her to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.880 
depending on whether I'm allowing her to
open<00:02:21.510> right<00:02:22.510> we're<00:02:22.780> keeping<00:02:23.140> her<00:02:23.320> in<00:02:23.530> place

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
open right we're keeping her in place

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.680 
open right we're keeping her in place
the<00:02:24.220> sheets<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.700> same<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.060> my<00:02:25.150> connection

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the sheets the same in my connection

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.490 
the sheets the same in my connection
okay<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.130> play<00:02:27.280> with<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.870> also<00:02:29.080> did

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
okay you can play with that we also did

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.949 
okay you can play with that we also did
multiple<00:02:30.340> cross<00:02:30.670> through<00:02:30.970> steps<00:02:31.239> where<00:02:31.870> you

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
multiple cross through steps where you

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.750 
multiple cross through steps where you
went<00:02:32.110> here<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:32.739> did<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.890> little<00:02:33.070> pressure

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
went here and we did a little pressure

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.030 
went here and we did a little pressure
in<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> palm<00:02:34.360> right<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.470> follows<00:02:35.830> we're

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
in the palm right so follows we're

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.180 
in the palm right so follows we're
defining<00:02:36.370> their<00:02:36.760> space<00:02:37.470> multiple<00:02:38.470> steps<00:02:38.860> and

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
defining their space multiple steps and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.310 
defining their space multiple steps and
then<00:02:39.700> we<00:02:39.820> did<00:02:39.970> turns<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.870> we<00:02:40.989> did<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.170> little

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
then we did turns so we did a little

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.289 
then we did turns so we did a little
step<00:02:41.650> cross<00:02:42.220> step<00:02:43.590> inside<00:02:44.590> turn<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.700> then<00:02:46.180> we

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
step cross step inside turn and then we

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.570 
step cross step inside turn and then we
slowly<00:02:46.780> caught<00:02:47.320> our<00:02:47.500> partner<00:02:47.890> right<00:02:48.250> there's

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
slowly caught our partner right there's

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.620 
slowly caught our partner right there's
no<00:02:48.730> rush<00:02:49.060> we're<00:02:50.049> here<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:51.220> gently<00:02:51.940> come<00:02:52.450> back

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
no rush we're here and gently come back

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.259 
no rush we're here and gently come back
together<00:02:52.840> or<00:02:53.590> sometimes<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.700> follows<00:02:55.120> at

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
together or sometimes for the follows at

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.630 
together or sometimes for the follows at
least<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.570> know<00:02:55.600> about<00:02:55.810> catch<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:57.010> back<00:02:57.220> and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
least to know about catch the back and

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.190 
least to know about catch the back and
then<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.000> bring<00:02:58.150> your<00:02:58.330> elbow<00:02:58.630> up<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.900> over

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
right third option stay and open so she

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.880 
right third option stay and open so she
turns<00:03:03.940> she<00:03:04.780> staying<00:03:05.019> open<00:03:05.170> they<00:03:05.440> could<00:03:05.590> be<00:03:05.709> one

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
turns she staying open they could be one

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.990 
turns she staying open they could be one
hand<00:03:06.220> two<00:03:06.580> hands<00:03:06.850> or<00:03:07.150> grooving<00:03:07.989> here<00:03:08.200> right

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
hand two hands or grooving here right

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.400 
hand two hands or grooving here right
everything<00:03:10.000> we<00:03:10.150> did<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.600> close<00:03:10.900> we<00:03:11.200> could<00:03:11.290> do

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
everything we did in close we could do

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.800 
everything we did in close we could do
it<00:03:11.500> open<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:12.489> we<00:03:13.030> did<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.330> little<00:03:13.480> weight

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
it open so we did the little weight

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.800 
it open so we did the little weight
shifts<00:03:14.350> maybe<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.830> one<00:03:15.010> two<00:03:15.220> threes<00:03:15.489> right<00:03:16.030> we

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
shifts maybe the one two threes right we

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.530 
shifts maybe the one two threes right we
could<00:03:16.959> stay<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.260> one<00:03:17.560> place<00:03:17.799> we<00:03:18.790> could<00:03:18.910> push<00:03:19.209> in

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
could stay in one place we could push in

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.080 
could stay in one place we could push in
drag<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.230> all<00:03:21.100> those<00:03:21.280> are<00:03:21.459> really<00:03:21.489> defining

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
drag and all those are really defining

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.789 
drag and all those are really defining
your<00:03:22.360> space<00:03:22.600> again<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.260> you've<00:03:23.380> got<00:03:23.500> your<00:03:23.650> bar

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
your space again so you've got your bar

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.190 
your space again so you've got your bar
be<00:03:23.950> arms<00:03:24.250> right<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.910> leads<00:03:25.450> might<00:03:25.720> be<00:03:25.870> adding

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
be arms right and leads might be adding

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.720 
be arms right and leads might be adding
a<00:03:26.260> little<00:03:26.440> pressure<00:03:26.799> in<00:03:26.980> she's<00:03:27.400> not<00:03:27.580> letting

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
a little pressure in she's not letting

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.600 
a little pressure in she's not letting
it<00:03:27.940> collapse<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.320> really<00:03:29.560> helps<00:03:30.010> we're

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
it collapse and that really helps we're

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.460 
it collapse and that really helps we're
doing<00:03:30.790> all<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.060> cross<00:03:31.299> through<00:03:31.540> stuff<00:03:31.900> in

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
doing all the cross through stuff in

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.190 
doing all the cross through stuff in
open<00:03:32.890> we<00:03:33.549> do<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.790> turn<00:03:34.030> either<00:03:34.390> direction

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
open we do the turn either direction

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.060 
open we do the turn either direction
we<00:03:36.130> do<00:03:36.310> free<00:03:36.370> spin<00:03:36.820> for<00:03:37.690> both<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.049> you<00:03:38.170> or<00:03:38.829> with

can<00:04:38.590> change<00:04:39.030> how<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.060> step<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.720> done<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.110> I

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
can change how the step is done and I

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.840 
can change how the step is done and I
could<00:04:41.350> choose<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.590> match<00:04:41.949> her<00:04:42.220> or<00:04:42.400> not

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
could choose to match her or not

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.840 
could choose to match her or not
same<00:04:43.389> thing<00:04:43.660> we<00:04:44.260> can<00:04:44.410> do<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.620> grind<00:04:44.919> right<00:04:45.550> I

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
same thing we can do the grind right I

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.420 
same thing we can do the grind right I
could<00:04:46.419> start<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.810> she<00:04:46.990> could<00:04:47.169> start<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.620> and

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
could start it she could start it and

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.580 
could start it she could start it and
some<00:04:48.730> of<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:48.970> might<00:04:49.120> be<00:04:49.270> visual<00:04:49.660> following<00:04:50.199> or

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
some of it might be visual following or

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.990 
some of it might be visual following or
we<00:04:50.800> talked<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.160> little<00:04:51.310> bit<00:04:51.520> about<00:04:51.639> how<00:04:51.940> to

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
we talked a little bit about how to

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.270 
we talked a little bit about how to
communicate<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.050> then<00:04:53.530> we've<00:04:53.680> got<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.980> in

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
communicate it and then we've got it in

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.030 
communicate it and then we've got it in
closed<00:04:54.850> position<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.960> lead<00:04:56.230> generally

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
closed position the lead generally

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.100 
closed position the lead generally
initiates<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.639> here<00:04:57.880> because<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.389> really

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
initiates it here because it really

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.680 
initiates it here because it really
changes<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.650> connection<00:05:00.280> quite<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.580> bit<00:05:00.850> right

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
changes the connection quite a bit right

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.930 
changes the connection quite a bit right
and<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.410> mean<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.680> same<00:05:02.860> thing<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.610> grind

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
and I mean the same thing the grind

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.970 
and I mean the same thing the grind
doesn't<00:05:04.600> change<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:05.020> connection<00:05:05.410> as<00:05:05.620> much

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
doesn't change the connection as much

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.450 
doesn't change the connection as much
but<00:05:06.760> she<00:05:06.910> can<00:05:07.060> addition

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
but she can addition

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.749 
but she can addition
that<00:05:07.669> real<00:05:07.850> easily<00:05:08.650> huh<00:05:09.650> think<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.490> is<00:05:10.580> it

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
that real easily huh think that is it

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.690 
that real easily huh think that is it
Thanks
