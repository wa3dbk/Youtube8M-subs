00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello to all the presentation of the knife 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.349
 sentinel victorinox and the knife 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.429
 waan-j 50 hours and so two 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.790
 knives that are close to my heart 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.680
 Swiss knife and only difference 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.640
 is that small difference at least at 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:30.000
 wind level of the player and the blow of 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:35.630
 swiss victorinox that I present so 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.630
 this is good material very good quality 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:46.710
 avengers goes to the site 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:51.239
 fifty-one very pretty you want 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.750
 you can see how great are 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:00.780
 super nice we do not see too much I 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.199
 pose but that's the difference at the level 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.199
 lan 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.280
 so here is the Swiss Army knife that is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.660
 sure yours right so the sentinel 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.350
 a 20cm blade and band player 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.110
 is on the left 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.250
 the 51 he makes a blade of 12 cm so we 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.680
 greatly sees the difference at the level 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:38.460
 sleeve level 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:43.759
 and there, of course, we see a good 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:50.039
 difference so August to sentinels 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.720
 super nice little little difference that 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.270
 does a lot actually it's at the level 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.300
 closing so on the avenger 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.410
 we click here we lock 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.170
 unlocked we close her little 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.720
 difference 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.700
 necessarily on the sentinel quickly stainless steel 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.380
 there is no closing here manual so 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.489
 necessarily for left-handers it's very 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.540
 well for right-handers it's not 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.530
 terrible so for lefties me I 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.799
 know that I can not so 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.700
 personally opening very hard on 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:32.400
 will say at the quality level we see that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.610
 victorinox makes the difference 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.760
 because here we see a good 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.130
 quality van dorst a good quality 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.690
 also but I find that a little good ago 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.650
 a little bit of 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.410
 it sways a bit normal because at 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.940
 level of the closure of the kia a 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.739
 push I do not know but so here 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.870
 I just wanted to introduce you to these 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.400
 two small knives super nice so 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.799
 so that's the difference between the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.620
 sentinel and the ranger 51 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.040
 this is it thank you I thank you 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.040
