North America I believe is definitely
covered<00:00:40.290> by<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> looking<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> front

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
covered by that so looking at the front

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260 
covered by that so looking at the front

we<00:01:13.439> also<00:01:13.560> recommend<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.760> minimum<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.540> one

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
we also recommend a minimum of one

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.320 
we also recommend a minimum of one
gigabyte<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.350> system<00:01:16.770> memory<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.310> these<00:01:18.090> days

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
gigabyte of system memory and these days

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.690 
gigabyte of system memory and these days
that's<00:01:18.570> pretty<00:01:18.810> much<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.340> will<00:01:20.340> make

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
that's pretty much they will make

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.240 
that's pretty much they will make
requirement<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:22.409> let's<00:01:22.619> take<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> look<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.130> me

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
requirement so let's take a look at me

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.130 
requirement so let's take a look at me
back<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.670> box<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:24.810> else<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
back of the box and see what else you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.880 
back of the box and see what else you
have<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> bunch<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.250> key<00:01:29.579> features

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
have so we have a bunch of key features

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.749 
have so we have a bunch of key features
aim<00:01:31.890> these<00:01:32.189> HD<00:01:32.460> 3d<00:01:33.450> technology<00:01:34.490> there<00:01:35.490> i

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
say up to six displays but I believe

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.139 
say up to six displays but I believe
this<00:01:41.520> card<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:43.070> able<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> supply<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.520> displays

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.770 
this card is able to supply for displays
but<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.860> need<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> double<00:01:47.280> check<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.780> it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
but we need to double check on that it

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.340 
camera on the tripod and I'll be back in
a<00:02:27.170> second<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:29.090> as<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.360> take<00:02:29.600> out<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.870> video<00:02:30.110> cut

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
a second so as I take out the video cut

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.870 
a second so as I take out the video cut
I'm<00:02:30.560> going<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.890> tell<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.160> guys<00:02:31.280> aspects<00:02:31.700> of

I'm going to tell you guys aspects of

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.550 
I'm going to tell you guys aspects of
the<00:02:32.000> tide<00:02:32.209> because<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.690> completely<00:02:33.080> forgot<00:02:33.500> to

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
the tide because I completely forgot to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.080 
the tide because I completely forgot to
tell<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.890> guys<00:02:33.950> actually<00:02:34.550> in<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.730> beginning

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
tell you guys actually in the beginning

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.480 
tell you guys actually in the beginning
of<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.270> video<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.350> felt<00:02:36.680> sad<00:02:36.860> for<00:02:36.920> that

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
of the video so I felt sad for that

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.180 
of the video so I felt sad for that
so<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.120> colors<00:02:38.480> clocked<00:02:38.810> at<00:02:38.990> 900<00:02:39.590> megahertz

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
so the colors clocked at 900 megahertz

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.820 
so the colors clocked at 900 megahertz
and<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.580> memory<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.180> clocked<00:02:41.480> at<00:02:41.830> 5600

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
and the memory is clocked at 5600

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.090 
and the memory is clocked at 5600
megahertz<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:44.030> compared<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.140> normal

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
megahertz so compared to the normal

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.949 
megahertz so compared to the normal
version<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:47.030> XFX<00:02:47.630> HD<00:02:48.140> 6970

version of the XFX HD 6970

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.410 
version of the XFX HD 6970
that's<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.320> 20<00:02:51.800> megahertz<00:02:52.100> increase<00:02:52.730> on<00:02:53.000> the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
that's a 20 megahertz increase on the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.710 
that's a 20 megahertz increase on the
color<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.739> 100<00:02:55.550> megahertz<00:02:55.790> overclocked<00:02:56.510> on

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
color and a 100 megahertz overclocked on

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.890 
color and a 100 megahertz overclocked on
the<00:02:57.160> memory<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.330> first<00:02:59.540> thing<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.690> we

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
and all the install guide so comes in an

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.070 
and all the install guide so comes in an
anti-static<00:04:46.640> bag<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:47.270> we'll<00:04:47.510> just<00:04:47.690> pull<00:04:47.990> it

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
anti-static bag and we'll just pull it

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.610 
anti-static bag and we'll just pull it
out<00:04:49.990> so<00:04:50.990> here<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.560> was<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.950> HD<00:04:52.640> 6970<00:04:53.390> on<00:04:54.200> the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
out so here it was the HD 6970 on the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.470 
out so here it was the HD 6970 on the
front<00:04:54.950> you<00:04:55.070> can<00:04:55.250> see<00:04:55.280> these<00:04:55.580> sticker<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.360> I

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
front you can see these sticker and I

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.930 
front you can see these sticker and I
like<00:04:56.990> it<00:04:57.200> actually<00:04:57.380> it's<00:04:57.860> not<00:04:58.040> too<00:04:58.100> busy<00:04:58.820> it's

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
like it actually it's not too busy it's

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.690 
like it actually it's not too busy it's
pretty<00:04:59.210> mutual<00:04:59.480> there's<00:05:00.410> also<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.980> protective

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
pretty mutual there's also a protective

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.720 
pretty mutual there's also a protective
covering<00:05:02.180> on<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.990> sticker<00:05:03.530> which<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.520> should

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
covering on the sticker which you should

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.790 
covering on the sticker which you should
remove<00:05:05.060> prior<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.840> installing<00:05:06.140> this<00:05:06.500> into

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
remove prior to installing this into

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.950 
remove prior to installing this into
your<00:05:06.890> system<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:08.180> let's<00:05:08.330> just<00:05:08.510> take<00:05:08.780> a<00:05:08.810> look

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
your system so let's just take a look

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.990 
your system so let's just take a look
around<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.350> card<00:05:09.590> and<00:05:09.890> look<00:05:10.670> at<00:05:10.790> the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
around the card and look at the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.600 
around the card and look at the
connectivities<00:05:11.780> first<00:05:12.110> on<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:12.980> back<00:05:13.160> we<00:05:13.370> have

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
connectivities first on the back we have

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.530 
connectivities first on the back we have
too<00:05:13.970> many<00:05:14.150> just<00:05:14.450> leaflets<00:05:14.990> one<00:05:15.950> ACMI<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:17.030> two

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
too many just leaflets one ACMI and two

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.580 
too many just leaflets one ACMI and two
dual<00:05:17.990> link<00:05:18.140> DVI<00:05:18.860> points<00:05:19.540> XFX<00:05:20.540> also<00:05:20.930> managed<00:05:21.320> to

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
dual link DVI points XFX also managed to

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.100 
dual link DVI points XFX also managed to
put<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:21.890> branding<00:05:22.730> on<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.330> ventilation

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
put the branding on the ventilation

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.260 
put the branding on the ventilation
grilles<00:05:24.410> on<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.310> back<00:05:25.520> so<00:05:25.850> that's<00:05:25.940> kind<00:05:26.210> of

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
grilles on the back so that's kind of

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.290 
grilles on the back so that's kind of
cool<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.660> see<00:05:26.840> on<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:28.190> top<00:05:28.490> of<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.730> card<00:05:29.000> in

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
cool to see on the top of the card in

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.830 
cool to see on the top of the card in
the<00:05:29.360> normal<00:05:30.110> standard<00:05:30.650> spot<00:05:30.950> you<00:05:31.430> see<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:32.030> two

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
the normal standard spot you see the two

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.370 
the normal standard spot you see the two
classifier<00:05:33.500> bridges<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:36.080> means<00:05:36.230> you

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
classifier bridges and so that means you

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.790 
classifier bridges and so that means you
can<00:05:36.620> run<00:05:36.830> more<00:05:37.550> than<00:05:37.730> two<00:05:37.940> of<00:05:37.970> these<00:05:38.480> in<00:05:39.260> your

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
can run more than two of these in your

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.659 
can run more than two of these in your
system<00:05:40.280> at<00:05:40.550> once<00:05:40.760> if<00:05:41.090> you<00:05:41.300> choose<00:05:41.600> to<00:05:42.400> on<00:05:43.400> the

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
system at once if you choose to on the

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.840 
system at once if you choose to on the
same<00:05:44.000> side<00:05:44.390> but<00:05:44.870> just<00:05:45.169> higher<00:05:46.010> up<00:05:46.340> we<00:05:46.640> have

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
same side but just higher up we have

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.450 
same side but just higher up we have
your<00:05:47.090> a<00:05:47.120> pin<00:05:47.570> and<00:05:47.780> 6-pin<00:05:48.650> connector<00:05:48.680> for<00:05:49.310> your

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
your a pin and 6-pin connector for your

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.330 
your a pin and 6-pin connector for your
power<00:05:49.700> supply<00:05:49.910> and<00:05:50.419> as<00:05:51.080> XFX<00:05:51.830> has<00:05:52.130> mentioned

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
power supply and as XFX has mentioned

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.780 
power supply and as XFX has mentioned
the<00:05:53.090> 8<00:05:53.330> pin<00:05:53.600> should<00:05:53.840> be<00:05:53.990> 150<00:05:54.560> watt<00:05:54.770> and<00:05:55.010> the<00:05:55.490> 6

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
the 8 pin should be 150 watt and the 6

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.469 
the 8 pin should be 150 watt and the 6
pins<00:05:56.060> 75<00:05:56.840> watt<00:05:57.669> so<00:05:58.669> let's<00:05:58.820> see<00:05:59.030> what<00:05:59.180> else<00:05:59.300> we

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
pins 75 watt so let's see what else we

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:00.330 
pins 75 watt so let's see what else we
have

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
have

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.030 
have
so<00:06:01.340> on<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.580> bottom<00:06:01.729> we<00:06:02.090> have<00:06:02.120> your<00:06:02.570> PCIe<00:06:03.169> 2.1

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
so on the bottom we have your PCIe 2.1

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.870 
so on the bottom we have your PCIe 2.1
bus<00:06:04.280> for<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.830> PCIe<00:06:06.830> slot<00:06:07.280> on<00:06:07.669> your

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
bus for the PCIe slot on your

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.730 
bus for the PCIe slot on your
motherboard<00:06:08.090> and<00:06:08.870> on<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.169> back<00:06:09.320> we<00:06:09.350> have<00:06:09.710> a

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
that before you remove those stickers

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.550 
that before you remove those stickers
and<00:06:38.210> let's<00:06:39.210> see<00:06:39.420> what<00:06:39.540> else<00:06:39.660> there<00:06:39.960> is<00:06:40.020> to<00:06:40.320> talk

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
and let's see what else there is to talk

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.720 
and let's see what else there is to talk
about<00:06:42.590> so<00:06:43.590> looking<00:06:43.920> at<00:06:44.010> the<00:06:44.100> Vedic<00:06:44.280> head<00:06:44.550> is

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
about so looking at the Vedic head is

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.430 
about so looking at the Vedic head is
actually<00:06:44.880> not<00:06:45.240> a<00:06:45.300> lot<00:06:45.420> of<00:06:45.570> ventilation<00:06:46.230> holes

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
actually not a lot of ventilation holes

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.430 
actually not a lot of ventilation holes
so<00:06:47.310> looking<00:06:47.760> around<00:06:47.910> there<00:06:48.510> is<00:06:48.630> a<00:06:48.660> small<00:06:49.140> area

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
so looking around there is a small area

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.940 
so looking around there is a small area
above<00:06:49.919> the<00:06:49.980> two<00:06:50.400> cross<00:06:50.669> fire<00:06:50.910> bridges<00:06:51.360> that

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
above the two cross fire bridges that

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.909 
above the two cross fire bridges that
ventilation<00:06:52.950> and<00:06:53.220> it's<00:06:53.490> very<00:06:53.760> small<00:06:54.919> moving
