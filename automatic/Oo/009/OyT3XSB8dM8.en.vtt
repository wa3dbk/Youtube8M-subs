00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.470
 doc you have chosen the photo it is a beautiful photo 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.400
 it's very interesting in a beautiful and colorful harmony and between oranje the 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
 red then the blue of the sky and water 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.900
 I did not say so well to do the laws the clinic 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.519
 from the premise that you will like to do it with oil 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.519
 we can so it's acrylic we can change but I think 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.810
 were horrified 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.169
 for departure register 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.169
 a little bit the same information 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.100
 we will you want to do it on 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 not a surrealistic offering this is no problem 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.100
 you will like to accentuate the mountain far away which is here that's true 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.660
 we could put it up a little bit higher than make it look a bit 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.940
 earlier six years no problem 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.970
 it also calms the little details that we do not know what it is 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.330
 what is certain is that it will happen so fast it is so far 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.990
 than 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.850
 it will be represented by the little touches 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.460
 at the size level of the format maybe we park this pretty 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040
 maybe a little bit of poti 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.920
 for this kind of painting to have a little more 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.150
 of importance in the north we will say the main subject which is the house 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.680
 first to finally 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.980
 an airlock by lens could lend itself 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.980
 I would say better about it 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.550
 petsmart before starting to do anything 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.090
 I would say that the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.190
 the framing is not so good 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.190
 the heavy he would really have too much in the middle of the chart 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.850
 and also the house here is not in the middle but the fact that here on the left we 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.260
 reached 40 min 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
 and also amat water that is made by these trees 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.130
 she ends up in the middle of her waist graham window 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.440
 so it might be nice to crop a little bit of afp 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.870
 push a little bit later right the siblings 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.610
 mastery if my house 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.860
 and that we could 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.620
 go down the horizons 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620
 or we could simply see box I prepared a carnage 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.600
 to make you see what it would give 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990
 that's why he's great because I'm here 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.440
 it makes the horizon but a rise in August 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.710
 and the house was one on the right side one is at the stop of shots 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.560
 the shooting of the high st-maurice road 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.649
 in the top right is the house 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.759
 you know what to do before you start whatever 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.209
 it would be 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.529
 % 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:19.709
 for the death it is sure there is not much important except that of 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.069
 of well placed our outlines the water of the mountains the relay in head the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.209
 house since 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.450
 the board did she try hammam really gives a great depth in the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.539
 board 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:31.700
 placed roughly 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.999
 I just pray with subject and I will mark where are the arms 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.239
 uche the main dam that joffrey through the leaves 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.159
 the leaves are actually just about following topics 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.180
 so once you've made the decisions 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.159
 at the caravane level 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.169
 it would be nice if we could make a layer of acrylic form on your 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.779
 chart you could go elsewhere 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:57.649
 4th a little yellow ocher when we have here to warm it already has there at the base 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:58.939
 the color of the painting 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.359
 I will do 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.419
 belfort ockrent newspaper africa 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.419
 and break that after I start barely above with the painting 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.059
 as soon as the sky for example see here younger in the low of the little clouds 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.649
 pink a little bit 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.039
 it would be interesting to go for it 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.659
 those colors 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.529
 with a little bit of 2 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.579
 it's again maybe a little bit of red a little bit of 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.339
 newspapers make orange trees in a low arms sky 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.599
 very very little dragged very weak 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.659
 who will mix with the blues but beware if it becomes too green 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.569
 to limit the newspapers 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.569
 increase to red and at that moment the green will disappear 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.419
 it could happen 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.219
 so it's 100% started to prepare your turn the wells 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.079
 yesterday the death 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.249
 whether you are drawing in charcoal or indirectly painting 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.429
 graduates 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:51.309
 the roll does not bother but you could% to send me the photo of 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:52.709
 your death 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.429
 once it's done 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.699
 perso me I will tell you if everything is correct if the compositions are well 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.589
 make 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:02.589
 it's going to be what's next at the level of 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.059
 first layer 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.749
 if you want% and also tell me if you prefer ferrals to oil or to 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.489
 acrylic 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.089
 about anything to send him an email to ask questions since 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:14.849
 the time of the USSR 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.180
 pouget harvests in the assembly I still give myself 72 hours to each 

00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:19.769
 time

 at valves 2 to intervene because I still have a session that 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.830
