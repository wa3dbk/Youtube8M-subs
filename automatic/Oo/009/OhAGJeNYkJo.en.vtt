00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I've got one I can't see where i would

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
I've got one I can't see where i would
really<00:01:45.360> need<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.990> than<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.649> I'll<00:01:47.220> just

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
really need more than that so I'll just

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.300 
really need more than that so I'll just
leave<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.130> good<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
leave that as there but it's good to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.160 
leave that as there but it's good to
have<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> prime<00:01:50.850> breach<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.299> absolutely<00:01:52.020> good

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
have a prime breach is absolutely good

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.749 
have a prime breach is absolutely good
to<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> those<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.369> not<00:01:53.549> have

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
to have one of those if you do not have

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.380 
to have one of those if you do not have
one<00:01:54.409> all<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.790> guess<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.119> means

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
one all right so I guess that means

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.209 
one all right so I guess that means
we'll<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.630> some<00:01:57.899> some<00:01:58.530> prison<00:01:58.829> module
