00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.970
 m after a long journey that had testified to seine-and-marne 2 a 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.430
 small dragonfly is placed on the heights of champagne-sur-seine this 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.649
 season 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.729
 marina gave a concert in acoustics at the salle marcel-pagnol 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.359
 r then yields vary from earthquake the simplicity of a sweet song and 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.439
 catchy 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 it is the freshness of a blooming flowers not 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.190
 but it's certainly his admirers talk about it best not so for 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.379
 cent and me what I like about dry marina and airspaces 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.910
 there is no respect to make at m any formatted aspect and the 60 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 years he published in europe she has quite a way% she is 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.460
 interpreted that is to say that he likes 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.040
 so dramatic things of the very serious subjects 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.350
 she expresses with some inner joy if canes confidence in the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.950
 life that gives me some experience 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.060
 at the initiative of the cultural department of champagne-sur-seine this concert as 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.760
 all the big organizations greenpeace wanted above all a moment for all 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.149
 thing you witness this will the price of the seats 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.749
 and the warm welcome by the French champagne is good 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.190
 surprise for us 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.190
 it's one of his 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.550
 first scene this is the first time she returns to the cinema with the 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.060
 seine-et-marnais c 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.290
 so it's all to his credit for us 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.430
 we are very happy we are a few hours before the show we already have a 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.980
 many reservations 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.970
 thing that's pretty rare that people reserve cynical 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.210
 there will be people 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.350
 but I am the first one happy 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.260
 in addition we wanted 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.540
 what people prevent people from all walks of life and the price of places is 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.780
 more skeptical 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.090
 we are 5 euros for adults and 2 euros 50 for students 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.140
 so it's not a drag to come see maria more we hear it now 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.450
 on all radios 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.110
 it's really a great happiness 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.630
 all the following factors had been gathered together as if the gods had 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.570
 excited about the event they had come numerous in this end 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.930
 sunny afternoon 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.729
 all in a family atmosphere like marina hands 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.439
 who brought his family 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.699
 to share this subprime moment 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.629
 the institute the first time I met marine in celebration 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.260
 % and it was for a local radio you do not know if it's amazing france 2 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.699
 local blue france 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.619
 and at the same time sought out new talents as to seek new 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:29.619
 talents and I had met in a cabaret to discover 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.319
 when I saw go on stage with the satellite finally 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.499
 the finish is followed by the puy-de-dome and yes I am I think it's 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.130
 I had so much cancellara made him react and take 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.010
 in front of a little tight it is a city that is not very far from 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.149
 Champagne-sur-seine 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.209
 the crate is pleased to score as many hours of people coming tonight 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.569
 and quite a lot of stupid ankara reservations for now 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.499
 finds that the album he has not yet had every chance to be defended m 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.479
 to be heard by the audience and then% 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:11.059
 juices on TV a little bit in india not much heard about 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.899
 but yesterday most of the time people do not come well and have rather 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:16.929
 positive thing to remove from my heart 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.989
 for now it's okay but I'd like to start writing a little bit 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.469
 for others to live a little 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.199
 and then 6% for me the pleasure of meetings maybe it is titles 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.249
 in the studio to campaign to meet people a bit of this job 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.179
 and a husband make me happy 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:39.920
 me 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.420
 to be continued
