00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.540 

when<00:00:00.570> we<00:00:00.690> sit<00:00:00.900> down<00:00:01.079> at<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.380> monitor<00:00:01.770> the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
when we sit down at the monitor the

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.210 
when we sit down at the monitor the
first<00:00:02.760> thing<00:00:02.970> we<00:00:03.120> wanted<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.629> decide<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.650> what

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
first thing we wanted to decide is what

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.030 
first thing we wanted to decide is what
screen<00:00:05.759> size<00:00:06.029> we're<00:00:06.359> going<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.569> use<00:00:07.040> because

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
screen size we're going to use because

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.129 
screen size we're going to use because
this<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.550> broadcast<00:00:08.790> monitor<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.929> have

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
this is a broadcast monitor we have

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.390 
this is a broadcast monitor we have
overscan<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.219> understand<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.900> for<00:00:13.400> my

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
overscan and understand so for my

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.189 
overscan and understand so for my
project<00:00:14.940> I'm<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.389> select<00:00:15.509> under<00:00:15.929> scan

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
project I'm going to select under scan

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.170 
project I'm going to select under scan
so<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.680> see<00:00:16.890> everything<00:00:17.699> all<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.060> way

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
so I can see everything all the way

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.099 
so I can see everything all the way
around<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.840> image<00:00:20.119> this<00:00:21.119> monitor<00:00:21.539> also<00:00:21.900> has<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
around the image this monitor also has a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.529 
around the image this monitor also has a
sixteen<00:00:22.710> by<00:00:22.740> nine<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.519> four<00:00:23.789> by<00:00:23.910> three<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.449> I'm

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
sixteen by nine and four by three so I'm

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.040 
sixteen by nine and four by three so I'm
going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.720> set<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.470> four<00:00:26.220> by<00:00:26.400> three<00:00:27.050> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
going to set that to four by three the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.810 
going to set that to four by three the
reason<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.470> making<00:00:28.710> these<00:00:29.010> selections<00:00:29.609> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
reason I'm making these selections is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.240 
reason I'm making these selections is
when<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> switch<00:00:30.779> back<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.109> forth<00:00:31.410> you're

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
when you switch back and forth you're

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
when you switch back and forth you're
going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> see<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> brightness<00:00:33.030> change<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.800> if

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
going to see the brightness change so if

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.680 
going to see the brightness change so if
you<00:00:35.010> calibrate<00:00:35.340> your<00:00:35.670> monitor<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.450> mode

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you calibrate your monitor in one mode

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.410 
you calibrate your monitor in one mode
and<00:00:37.230> go<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> other<00:00:38.309> mode<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.210> see

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and go to the other mode you can see

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.760 
and go to the other mode you can see
there's<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> change<00:00:40.559> in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
there's going to be a change in

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.500 
there's going to be a change in
brightness<00:00:40.950> which<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> affect<00:00:42.270> your

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
brightness which is going to affect your

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.600 
brightness which is going to affect your
perception<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:44.129> you're<00:00:44.280> trying<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
perception of what you're trying to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.750 
perception of what you're trying to
create<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.300> monitor<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.649> I've<00:00:47.399> got<00:00:47.610> this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
create on this monitor so I've got this

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.330 
create on this monitor so I've got this
set<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.210> next<00:00:48.989> thing<00:00:49.110> I'm<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.980> go

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
set now next thing I'm going to do is go

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.580 
set now next thing I'm going to do is go
to<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> controls<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.660> brightness

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
to all the controls for brightness

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.910 
to all the controls for brightness
chroma<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.489> phase<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.750> adjust<00:00:55.350> those<00:00:55.530> so

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
chroma and phase and adjust those so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.549 
chroma and phase and adjust those so
they're<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> their<00:00:56.489> center<00:00:56.940> position<00:00:57.559> you

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
they're in their center position you

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.959 
they're in their center position you
feel<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.039> little<00:01:01.100> dent<00:01:02.100> position<00:01:02.730> when

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
feel that little dent position when

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.320 
feel that little dent position when
they're<00:01:03.149> set<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.880> next<00:01:06.090> thing<00:01:06.240> I'm

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
they're set up so the next thing I'm

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.719 
they're set up so the next thing I'm
going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.040> I'm<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> adjust<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
going to do is I'm going to adjust the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.130 
going to do is I'm going to adjust the
brightness<00:01:09.000> control<00:01:09.630> I'm<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> turn

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
brightness control I'm going to turn

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.109 
brightness control I'm going to turn
that<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> series<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.760> test

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that up and we have a series of test

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.539 
that up and we have a series of test
signals<00:01:12.540> over<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> right-hand<00:01:14.010> side<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
signals over on the right-hand side of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.630 
signals over on the right-hand side of
the<00:01:14.640> frame<00:01:15.290> what<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.070> black

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the frame what we have here is black

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.660 
the frame what we have here is black
black<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.900> black<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.280> signal

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
black and black and we have a signal

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
black and black and we have a signal
that's<00:01:20.850> blacker<00:01:21.240> than<00:01:21.540> black<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.380> signal

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that's blacker than black and a signal

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
that's blacker than black and a signal
that's<00:01:23.189> lighter<00:01:23.460> than<00:01:23.610> black<00:01:23.909> I'm<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that's lighter than black I'm going to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.280 
that's lighter than black I'm going to
adjust<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> brightness<00:01:26.330> until<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:28.020> only

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
adjust the brightness until I can only

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.760 
adjust the brightness until I can only
see<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.040> lighter<00:01:29.460> than<00:01:29.759> black<00:01:29.909> signal<00:01:30.770> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
see the lighter than black signal and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.359 
see the lighter than black signal and
then<00:01:32.040> I'm<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
then I'm going to know that I have the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.730 
then I'm going to know that I have the
brightness<00:01:35.369> set<00:01:35.610> correctly<00:01:36.439> next<00:01:37.439> thing<00:01:37.590> I'm

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
brightness set correctly next thing I'm

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.920 
brightness set correctly next thing I'm
going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.310> adjust<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.950> chroma<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.250> phase<00:01:41.939> so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
going to adjust is chroma and phase so

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.410 
going to adjust is chroma and phase so
it's<00:01:43.079> pretty<00:01:43.320> hard<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.680> tell<00:01:44.299> you<00:01:45.299> know

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it's pretty hard to tell you know

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.480 
it's pretty hard to tell you know
obviously<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:47.009> too<00:01:47.340> low

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
obviously that's too low

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.450 
obviously that's too low
maybe<00:01:48.640> that's<00:01:48.939> too<00:01:49.240> high<00:01:49.479> but<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:50.590> need<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.250> way

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
maybe that's too high but I need a way

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.940 
maybe that's too high but I need a way
to<00:01:51.490> tell<00:01:51.880> how<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:53.140> set<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.710> same

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
to tell how this is set and the same

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.389 
to tell how this is set and the same
with<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.250> phase<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.939> know<00:01:55.540> is<00:01:55.720> this<00:01:55.899> bar

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
with the phase you know is this bar

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.370 
with the phase you know is this bar
magenta<00:01:57.399> or<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:58.659> know<00:01:58.750> should<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.080> be<00:01:59.200> more

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
magenta or you know should it be more

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.219 
magenta or you know should it be more
towards<00:01:59.770> blue<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.509> need<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.539> better<00:02:01.720> way<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:01.990> do

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
towards blue I need a better way to do

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.020 
towards blue I need a better way to do
that<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:02.649> on<00:02:03.220> this<00:02:03.399> monitor

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
that so on this monitor

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.980 
that so on this monitor
I<00:02:04.060> can<00:02:04.360> hit<00:02:04.830> blue<00:02:05.830> only<00:02:06.009> blue<00:02:06.670> screen<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.270> this

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
I can hit blue only blue screen and this

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.460 
I can hit blue only blue screen and this
is<00:02:08.170> going<00:02:08.319> to<00:02:08.410> show<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:10.509> these<00:02:11.050> bars

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
is going to show you that these bars

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.229 
is going to show you that these bars
here<00:02:12.040> should<00:02:12.790> be<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.209> same<00:02:13.420> intensity<00:02:15.239> now

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
here should be of the same intensity now

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.809 
here should be of the same intensity now
the<00:02:16.300> two<00:02:16.630> outside<00:02:17.140> bars<00:02:17.530> are<00:02:18.430> meant<00:02:18.730> for

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
the two outside bars are meant for

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.350 
the two outside bars are meant for
saturation<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.250> take<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.670> chroma<00:02:21.940> level

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
saturation so if I take the chroma level

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.420 
saturation so if I take the chroma level
and<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:22.569> crank<00:02:23.049> those<00:02:23.260> down<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.950> try<00:02:24.280> and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
and just crank those down and try and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.729 
and just crank those down and try and
get<00:02:24.580> these<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.239> they<00:02:25.390> match<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:28.470> then<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
get these so they match and then the

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.250 
get these so they match and then the
phase<00:02:30.100> control<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.209> center<00:02:31.630> tube

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.770 

and<00:02:35.440> if<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:35.860> adjust<00:02:36.280> those<00:02:36.489> until<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
and if I adjust those until the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.490 
and if I adjust those until the
brightness<00:02:38.230> level<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:39.040> equal<00:02:39.489> on<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> both

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
brightness level is is equal on the both

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.750 
brightness level is is equal on the both
try<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.590> get<00:02:41.680> those<00:02:41.799> as<00:02:42.010> close<00:02:42.250> as<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.549> can

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
try and get those as close as you can

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.250 
try and get those as close as you can
they<00:02:42.940> may<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.209> come<00:02:43.450> out<00:02:43.540> perfect<00:02:44.019> but<00:02:44.140> you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
they may not come out perfect but you

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.470 
they may not come out perfect but you
should<00:02:44.409> get<00:02:44.560> them<00:02:44.709> as<00:02:44.799> close<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.310> can<00:02:45.519> now

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
should get them as close as you can now

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.110 
should get them as close as you can now
