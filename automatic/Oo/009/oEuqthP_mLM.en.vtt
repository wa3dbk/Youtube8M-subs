00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
don't even notice this is it's got the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.130 
don't even notice this is it's got the
key<00:01:03.159> here<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.059> you<00:01:04.120> can<00:01:04.390> turn<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.780> thing<00:01:04.930> off

key here so you can turn the thing off

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.740 
key here so you can turn the thing off
the<00:01:05.470> normal<00:01:05.770> mode<00:01:06.159> so<00:01:06.909> it<00:01:06.940> cuts<00:01:07.270> down<00:01:07.420> half<00:01:07.720> the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
the normal mode so it cuts down half the

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.570 
the normal mode so it cuts down half the
horsepower<00:01:08.080> then<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.860> put<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.130> key<00:01:09.310> in<00:01:09.400> you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
horsepower then you put the key in you

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.570 
horsepower then you put the key in you
turn<00:01:09.760> it<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.940> full<00:01:10.120> mode<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.630> you've<00:01:11.110> got<00:01:11.290> all

turn it the full mode and you've got all

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.360 
turn it the full mode and you've got all
power<00:01:13.080> 375<00:01:14.080> horsepower<00:01:14.409> that's<00:01:14.710> right<00:01:14.920> this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
power 375 horsepower that's right this

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.590 
power 375 horsepower that's right this
one's<00:01:15.580> got<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.760> little<00:01:15.940> bit<00:01:16.120> more<00:01:16.360> that's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
one's got a little bit more that's

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.389 
one's got a little bit more that's
rewired<00:01:17.170> this<00:01:17.560> one's<00:01:17.770> pumped<00:01:18.130> up<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.369> little

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
rewired this one's pumped up a little

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.120 
rewired this one's pumped up a little
bit<00:01:18.759> probably<00:01:19.000> 400<00:01:19.659> horsepower<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.920> this

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
bit probably 400 horsepower but this
