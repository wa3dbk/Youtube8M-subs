 Yes 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.720

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.190
 Kedomo say Mokkun in synchronization and 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.190
 The other Re is I become the story of a good place to local 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.510
 And it was a little strange experience 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.240
 Local people of 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.570
 It seems that there was a building called a ghost apartment 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.570
 Because should the old days the number back is that the apartment 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:45.100
 In yet Nino of the sovereign change is that the building 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:49.079
 I seems to still take much longer if there always buy Why 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.079
 So well , between Akita and him locally 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.140
 Saying Nante 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.120
 Spot your spirits 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.360
 Barreda's young people there 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.260
 Me or something 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.280
 It is not such a spot to say 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.460
 Picture too 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.240
 It was about 198 o'clock at that time, but with my local friends 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.620
 In the men's four girls 8 people 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.270
 It seems to have decided to go to show that in red 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.070
 Well that play 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.710
 Well then 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.340
 Go you whether Tteyuu there 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.470
 Because it is a spot 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.450
 Say That's been the story went one 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.190
 I, for example, 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.780
 And So I bought a Yes 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.060
 Well then at that timing 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.850
 7 of the one who was with me 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.080
 It's a cry , it's a defect, it's a scary scary, it's such a scary scary competition I say I absolutely don't want to 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.860
 Because in Well is as a part of the fun to go to such a place Well it serves also as one 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.860
 Well then again 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.010
 This is 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.480
 I was about to enter 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.900
 It's good for that this too 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.940
 Well I guess you now I do not want to go before us contains, such as now 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.960
 It's a great cry , so the air will get a little worse 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.260
 I do not really see this 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.310
 It's Toko of unreasonable seek to far 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.310
 Let's discuss in the fourth day 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.850
 It seems that it ended with neglect 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.140
 Well, it's the next tree back home 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.390
 I was surprised to see the TV 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.560
 It was a famous ghost mansion gugu for the news program in the local area . 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.810
 If you look at something 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.650
 Around what time last night 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.569
 Man is one person without 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 It is big news 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.130
 It's like a hell that's gone 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.050
 Speaking of 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.310
 Minutes 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.310
 I think that we will go 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.670
 4 w 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.069
 At that time, what kind of person is listed Sawai 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.270
 Previous mountain 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.040
 I decided to go back 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.040
 If they were good, they came in 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.240
 What may be sealed 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.020
 Or 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.360
 Or not of their own 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.160
 I thought so 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.990
 The story I heard later 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.770
 I will have co- made later 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.770
 His Majesty's Strong 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.590
 With such a thing
