00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.199
 it is he who 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.979
 realistic it almost feels like I had to others he was waiting too much 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.979
 worryingly he says 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.859
 after this conflict 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.159
 physically we remember his two broken legs still look there this 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.839
 evening 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:50.839
 even if citigroup will be a civil party in this case 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.539
 since a few games at the top

 gently but he looked again here 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.770
 to fix them to style 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.300
 he went to look behind them 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.430
 it was not that in the evening 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.430

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.550
 costil samir nasri he had scored in front of nancy midweek 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.689
 it's his second white game of the season but maybe it's one of his 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.689
 first matches at 100% of his physical means and it's a nightmare 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.949
 volunteers and their means 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.279
