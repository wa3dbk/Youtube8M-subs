00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.870
 Hello and welcome here 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.340
 include hardware software reviews 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.590
 I greet you to this video 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.900
 today it's about the brand new and 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:24.349
 new 5er 46 70 for the lwl 50 from the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.300
 new generation of intel fitting 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.220
 product links and information 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.720
 are in the video description but me 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.700
 would say we just go ahead 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.829
 I would say we'll take care of it 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.960
 on the new packaging from linthe 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.990
 we have the right model for you 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.600
 also called also known as intel cpu 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.670
 here we have an intel ivy bridge cpu 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.010
 the optical differences are on 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.330
 to recognize each case clearly 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.650
 however, one thing remained the same 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.560
 we have the information about the 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.790
 processor and the socket 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.050
 this is also the case immediately 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.300
 we have everything here again 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.770
 designed except for the fact that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.200
 this page for example the technical 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.900
 Information is on the top 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.740
 view window cpu on the back 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.700
 We prefer the predecessor and the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.590
 description of what is in this 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.259
 Packaging is included here we have 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.609
 again exactly product names and 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.079
 on the bottom is not now synonymous 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:19.039
 really important what you still know 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.659
 should we go the albinos cpu well 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.499
 backwards because today it is like 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.799
 said about the boiler processor i5 for 46 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:30.380
 70 without k that means we have here 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.329
 a zone of freely selectable multiplier 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.560
 That's why we can not do this 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.149
 cpu is clocking 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.270
 Nevertheless, the performance of the cpu 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.039
 Generally for a normal gaming system 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.569
 We look at ourselves perfectly 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.490
 short, the packaging we have 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.459
 actually already done so go 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.929
 I click on the most important things a 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.759
 this side of the packaging we have 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.709
 then a few more reasons 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.469
 information about this processor 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.189
 as well as 4 kerner as well as four street are 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.369
 here with it 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.099
 the intel turbo boost technology 2.0 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.859
 an integrated memory controller for 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.370
 dual channel ddr3 and of course one 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.750
 three years 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.380
 she is here with this product 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.410
 included as well is the intel hd 4600 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.690
 with you on the other side 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.260
 In turn , we have even more specification 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.900
 including the processor name 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.310
 the basic clock of 3.4 ghz 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.220
 the l3 cache of 6mb and the current one 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.280
 base 11 50 m we pack the good piece 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.110
 as always with dropbox app version 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.870
 we have a cooler in this case 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.640
 with it before but we have the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.700
 instruction guide like us for example 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.790
 these cpu incorporate sincere art and 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.130
 wise, of course , the buck will 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.220
 By the way, supreme for this cdu 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.470
 follows from rain is except you have to 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.600
 example, the k model of this cd then 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.460
 you would have a separate student 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.560
 because this one is not for that 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.690
 In any case, overclocking was also intended here 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.390
 again as always the applied 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.160
 thermal grease suffering in the form of heat 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.660
 petz because once more departments 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.300
 this packaging will take care of when 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.360
 predecessor we were then the cdu the 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:21.230
 i5 46 70 offers us 3.4 ghz in the base day 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.700
 rate 3.8 ghz 4 core sophie plus four 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.800
 street are common for all 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.200
 Applications therefore play perfect 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.320
 Sufficient the tdp amounts to 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.739
 remaining at 84 and by 22 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.110
 This will become possible on a naked level 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.459
 the integrated memory controller 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.770
 allows us 32 gigabytes 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.440
 to use memory in the form of 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.480
 ddr3 of course in dual channel courage that 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.650
 means we have the possibility here 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.340
 Memory with a clocking of 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.970
 1600 or a clocking of 1333 mhz 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.330
 quite easy to install intel supplies 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.150
 her the new intel hd 4600 graphics unit 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.040
 with this is something more powerful in the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.709
 Compared to the predecessor for example the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.480
 4000 series is still not 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.570
 as powerful as the example 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.600
 fm two cpu of amd 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.920
 because we have a new cpu version here 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.530
 it is recommended here 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.350
 a mainboard with the hair 87 chips too 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.620
 use a higher quality mainboard 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.780
 with the example 87 chipset not really 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.270
 We would bring many benefits here 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.080
 as I said not have the opportunity to 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.180
 overclock 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.460
 there reaches a cheaper mainboard 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.680
 with the hair 87 boss looks perfect 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.750
 out at the new its core cpu 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.300
 generation is not possible 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.870
 for example, this new cpu on 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.610
 old eg 77 mainboard from the ivy bridge 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.160
 to block the generation 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.590
 this was by intel first time in the form of 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.340
 secured by pins that means we have 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:56.389
 this new hess wÃ¶rthsee to 1150 pins 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.910
 the predecessor had 1155 also became 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.220
 the position of these small notches 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.850
 here they vary a bit in height 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.590
 gone up 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.180
 the predecessor had something further 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.760
 down and so we can not 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.030
 this cpu quite simply on one 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.860
 old mainboard installed 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.300
 yes it should have been, thank you 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.790
 to watch me at this point 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.229
 I would only get 1 comment on an abo 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.940
 to look forward to a like of you 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.280
 the next video is about one 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.810
 people whether this cpu and yes to the 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.810
 next time author contactor
