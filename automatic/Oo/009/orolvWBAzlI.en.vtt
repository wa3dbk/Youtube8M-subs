update on my guest paper Iser process I
actually<00:00:09.719> found<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.139> process<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.740> was<00:00:10.889> really

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
actually found a process that was really

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.950 
actually found a process that was really
really<00:00:11.639> well<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.300> little<00:00:12.509> bit<00:00:12.630> different

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
really well it's a little bit different

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.110 
really well it's a little bit different
than<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.230> I've<00:00:13.320> been<00:00:13.349> doing<00:00:13.889> it's<00:00:14.820> just<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
than what I've been doing it's just a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.580 
than what I've been doing it's just a
new<00:00:15.269> discovery<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.839> came<00:00:15.929> across<00:00:16.049> while<00:00:16.560> I

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
new discovery that I came across while I

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.830 
new discovery that I came across while I
was<00:00:16.890> doing<00:00:17.039> my<00:00:17.460> current<00:00:18.270> design<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> have

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
was doing my current design that I have

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.359 
was doing my current design that I have
posted<00:00:19.260> up<00:00:19.490> um<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:21.510> awesome<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.920> did<00:00:23.189> some

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
posted up um it's awesome I I did some

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.929 
posted up um it's awesome I I did some
mileage<00:00:23.519> testing<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.939> let's

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
mileage testing on it and I got let's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.470 
mileage testing on it and I got let's
see

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
see

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.049 
see
I<00:00:27.510> went<00:00:28.289> 20<00:00:28.650> miles<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.250> about<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> cup<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.939> gas<00:00:30.740> so

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
I went 20 miles on about a cup of gas so

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.690 
I went 20 miles on about a cup of gas so
that's<00:00:33.320> what<00:00:34.320> there's<00:00:34.850> 16<00:00:35.850> cups<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> gallon

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
that's what there's 16 cups in a gallon

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.930 
that's what there's 16 cups in a gallon
so<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.910> times<00:00:39.950> times<00:00:40.950> twenty<00:00:41.280> by<00:00:41.399> sixteen

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so this times times twenty by sixteen

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.220 
so this times times twenty by sixteen
and<00:00:42.149> that's<00:00:42.270> about<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.510> many<00:00:42.870> miles<00:00:43.079> per

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and that's about how many miles per

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.450 
and that's about how many miles per
gallon<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.739> got<00:00:44.300> um<00:00:45.649> yeah<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
gallon I got um yeah that's what the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.080 
gallon I got um yeah that's what the
calculations<00:00:47.940> would<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> about<00:00:50.250> 240<00:00:50.940> miles

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
calculations would be so about 240 miles

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.840 
calculations would be so about 240 miles
per<00:00:51.660> gallon<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.739> new<00:00:52.980> method<00:00:53.699> of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
per gallon on this new method of

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.510 
per gallon on this new method of
vaporizing<00:00:54.600> gasoline<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.890> running<00:00:56.219> your<00:00:56.340> car

happy when I discovered this so

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.020 
happy when I discovered this so
vaporizing<00:01:42.450> your<00:01:43.380> your<00:01:43.979> gasoline<00:01:44.610> can

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
vaporizing your your gasoline can

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.090 
vaporizing your your gasoline can
definitely<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> long<00:01:45.960> ways<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.619> crazy

like<00:01:47.360> seriously<00:01:48.360> insane<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.320> didn't<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
like seriously insane I didn't know that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.620 
like seriously insane I didn't know that
I<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.729> getting<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.000> many<00:01:51.180> miles<00:01:51.390> per<00:01:51.509> gallon

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
I was getting that many miles per gallon

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.870 
I was getting that many miles per gallon
until<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.530> actually<00:01:52.710> did<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> math<00:01:53.159> once<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.729> got

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
until I actually did the math once I got

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.219 
until I actually did the math once I got
home<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.180> measured<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> amount<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.840> gas<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
home I measured the amount of gas that I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.109 
home I measured the amount of gas that I
used<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:59.009> blown<00:01:59.310> away<00:01:59.490> literally

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
used and I was blown away literally

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.080
