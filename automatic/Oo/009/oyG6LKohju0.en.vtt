00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
it I mean most importantly is to have

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.710 
it I mean most importantly is to have
google<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.150> all<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.330> worry<00:02:48.630> about

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720

which is defined in priorities this is

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.280 
which is defined in priorities this is
what<00:05:55.140> it's<00:05:55.260> talking<00:05:55.530> about<00:05:56.300> ok<00:05:57.300> so<00:05:57.360> down<00:05:57.720> here

is where you would actually define the

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.870 
is where you would actually define the
priorities<00:06:01.020> so<00:06:01.230> here<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.770> homepage<00:06:02.250> has<00:06:02.670> the

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
priorities so here the homepage has the

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.550 
priorities so here the homepage has the
highest<00:06:03.210> priority<00:06:03.810> and<00:06:03.990> then<00:06:04.620> your<00:06:04.890> posts<00:06:05.490> and

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
highest priority and then your posts and

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.620 
highest priority and then your posts and
static<00:06:07.560> pages<00:06:07.860> have<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:09.060> next<00:06:09.420> highest

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
static pages have the next highest

static pages have the next highest
priority<00:06:10.380> and<00:06:10.560> then<00:06:11.130> categories<00:06:11.790> archives

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
priority and then categories archives

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
then minimum holds priority ok so I

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.420 
then minimum holds priority ok so I
don't<00:06:19.350> think<00:06:19.500> I've<00:06:19.590> changed<00:06:19.620> anything<00:06:20.190> in
