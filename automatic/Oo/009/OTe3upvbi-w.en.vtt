00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to use I don't think they smear so let

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.240 
to use I don't think they smear so let
me<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.490> test<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.930> bit

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250
