00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.389 
is subject to change after this video is
released<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> let's<00:00:52.710> take<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> little<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
released so let's take a little bit of a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.459 
released so let's take a little bit of a
look<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.670> okay<00:00:53.730> her<00:00:54.570> passive<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> shield

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
look at okay her passive is a shield

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
look at okay her passive is a shield
equal<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.949> ten<00:00:56.160> percent<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> max<00:00:56.940> health

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
equal to ten percent of a max health

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
equal to ten percent of a max health
which<00:00:57.449> lasts<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.840> five<00:00:57.989> seconds<00:00:58.410> after<00:00:58.710> using

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
which lasts for five seconds after using

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
which lasts for five seconds after using
an<00:00:59.129> ability<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.730> an<00:00:59.850> enemy<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> 12

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
an ability on an enemy this has a 12

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.810 
an ability on an enemy this has a 12
second<00:01:01.620> cooldown<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.100> remembering<00:01:02.520> when<00:01:02.699> it's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
second cooldown so remembering when it's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.429 
second cooldown so remembering when it's
up<00:01:02.940> again<00:01:03.210> will<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.690> an<00:01:03.780> important<00:01:04.170> part<00:01:04.320> of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
up again will be an important part of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.340 
up again will be an important part of
playing<00:01:04.710> by<00:01:05.060> wise<00:01:06.060> q<00:01:06.450> works<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> similar<00:01:06.990> way

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
playing by wise q works in a similar way

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.679 
playing by wise q works in a similar way
to<00:01:07.500> viruses<00:01:08.100> however<00:01:08.850> rather<00:01:09.090> than<00:01:09.360> holding

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to viruses however rather than holding

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
to viruses however rather than holding
them<00:01:09.869> Q<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.260> charge<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.070> releasing

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
them Q to charge up and then releasing

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
them Q to charge up and then releasing
you<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.180> tap<00:01:12.360> q<00:01:12.630> once<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.500> it's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you just tap q once and then when it's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.020 
you just tap q once and then when it's
charged<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> dash<00:01:14.760> for

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
charged it up and you want to dash for

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.240 
charged it up and you want to dash for
it<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.630> tap<00:01:15.900> Q<00:01:16.140> again<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:17.040> also

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it you just tap Q again this also

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.219 
it you just tap Q again this also
applies<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> knock<00:01:17.939> back<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.840> used<00:01:18.869> to
