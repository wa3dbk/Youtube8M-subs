00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.210 

you<00:05:53.900> don't<00:05:54.110> have<00:05:54.380> to<00:05:54.560> pick<00:05:54.770> fights<00:05:55.070> with

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
you don't have to pick fights with

everybody that you come across but I do
at<00:05:57.590> first<00:05:58.340> it's<00:05:58.550> a<00:05:58.670> little<00:05:58.700> slow<00:05:59.380> exploring

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
at first it's a little slow exploring

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.870 
at first it's a little slow exploring
but<00:06:00.500> then<00:06:00.680> you<00:06:00.800> can<00:06:00.950> get<00:06:01.100> horses<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:01.790> other

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
but then you can get horses and other

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.630 
but then you can get horses and other
mounts<00:06:02.390> to<00:06:02.570> ride<00:06:02.780> around<00:06:03.140> much<00:06:03.440> faster<00:06:04.010> you

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
mounts to ride around much faster you

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.700 
mounts to ride around much faster you
can<00:06:04.760> also<00:06:04.940> teleport<00:06:05.390> from<00:06:05.960> one<00:06:06.200> part<00:06:06.560> of<00:06:06.590> the

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
can also teleport from one part of the

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.440 
can also teleport from one part of the
map<00:06:06.920> to<00:06:07.100> the<00:06:07.130> other<00:06:07.400> part<00:06:07.790> when<00:06:07.970> you<00:06:08.120> find

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
map to the other part when you find

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.400 
map to the other part when you find
teleporting<00:06:09.380> locations<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:11.120> map<00:06:11.360> is<00:06:11.570> huge<00:06:11.930> so

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
teleporting locations the map is huge so

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.950 
teleporting locations the map is huge so
that's<00:06:12.620> kind<00:06:12.890> of<00:06:12.980> necessary<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:14.330> events<00:06:14.810> in

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
that's kind of necessary the events in

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.660 
that's kind of necessary the events in
