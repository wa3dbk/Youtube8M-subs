00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
there and frankly that's what we've had

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.450 
there and frankly that's what we've had
to<00:04:20.510> change<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.470> rest<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.860> this<00:04:21.980> is<00:04:22.160> just

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
completely original which to me is just

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.680 
completely original which to me is just
terrific

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.080

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090
