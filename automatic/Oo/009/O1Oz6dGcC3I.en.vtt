00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
alright so now I'm going to show you

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.110 
alright so now I'm going to show you
guys<00:00:01.770> just<00:00:01.800> how<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.370> set<00:00:02.730> up<00:00:02.760> one<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.000> these

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
guys just how to set up one of these

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.710 
guys just how to set up one of these
pose<00:00:03.419> readers<00:00:03.810> Marcos<00:00:04.770> pose<00:00:05.009> readers<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:05.730> what

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
pose readers Marcos pose readers so what

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.450 
pose readers Marcos pose readers so what
we're<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.109> do<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.649> we're<00:00:07.919> just<00:00:07.950> going<00:00:08.250> to

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
we're going to do is we're just going to

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.970 
we're going to do is we're just going to
import<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.540> pose<00:00:09.719> reader<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.260> quickly<00:00:10.740> set

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
import the pose reader and quickly set

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.669 
import the pose reader and quickly set
it<00:00:11.070> up<00:00:11.190> here<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.639> just<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> first<00:00:12.620> sort<00:00:13.620> of

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
it up here so just as the first sort of

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.230 
it up here so just as the first sort of
a<00:00:13.769> thing<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.370> show<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.580> how<00:00:14.700> I've<00:00:15.030> set

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
a thing we just show you how I've set

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.750 
a thing we just show you how I've set
animated<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> scene<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.949> rotate<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
animated the scene so just rotate that

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.570 
animated the scene so just rotate that
arm<00:00:18.029> down<00:00:18.300> there<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.680> see<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.100> we've<00:00:20.310> got

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
arm down there we can see that we've got

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.000 
arm down there we can see that we've got
these<00:00:21.359> oiler<00:00:21.750> rotations<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.470> now<00:00:22.740> I've<00:00:22.949> just

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
these oiler rotations here now I've just

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.070 
these oiler rotations here now I've just
done<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> little<00:00:23.730> animation<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.990> at

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
done a little animation on it it's at

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.870 
done a little animation on it it's at
the<00:00:25.170> same<00:00:25.350> place<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.369> these<00:00:26.580> oil

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the same place so we can see these oil

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.550 
the same place so we can see these oil
rotations<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> completely<00:00:28.349> different

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
rotations with it a completely different

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.890 
rotations with it a completely different
number<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.699> click<00:00:29.970> between<00:00:30.359> those<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
number so we can click between those and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.950 
number so we can click between those and
we<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.080> verify<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.740> those<00:00:32.640> oiler<00:00:33.600> values

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
we can verify that those oiler values

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.670 
we can verify that those oiler values
are<00:00:34.200> flipping<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.250> doing<00:00:35.550> weird<00:00:36.000> things<00:00:36.680> so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
are flipping and doing weird things so

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.290 
are flipping and doing weird things so
that<00:00:37.920> will<00:00:38.070> check<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.579> our<00:00:38.730> pose<00:00:38.969> Rita

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that will check to see if our pose Rita

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.010 
that will check to see if our pose Rita
is<00:00:39.510> actually<00:00:39.960> working<00:00:40.860> correctly<00:00:41.270> now<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
is actually working correctly now the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.630 
is actually working correctly now the
first<00:00:43.260> thing<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.860> need<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.309> is

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
first thing that we really need to do is

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810 
first thing that we really need to do is
it's<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.840> import<00:00:46.230> our<00:00:46.379> pose<00:00:46.590> Rita<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.160> once

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
it's just import our pose Rita so once

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.000 
it's just import our pose Rita so once
you<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.539> go<00:00:48.660> file<00:00:48.899> import<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.649> import

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you just go file import and just import

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
you just go file import and just import
it<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.489> once<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.090> open<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.539> should

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
it in and once you open it up should

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
it in and once you open it up should
look<00:00:51.899> something<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> few

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
look something like this with just a few

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
look something like this with just a few
locators<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.750> main<00:00:54.930> ones<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> need<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> know

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
locators the main ones you need to know

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
locators the main ones you need to know
about<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.280> base<00:00:56.489> lock<00:00:56.820> we've<00:00:57.809> got<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
about is this base lock we've got the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.490 
about is this base lock we've got the
target<00:00:58.260> lock<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.219> we've<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.059> pose

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
target lock and we've got this pose

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.650 
target lock and we've got this pose
locator<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.430> pose<00:01:02.609> locator<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.480> that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
locator the pose locator is the one that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.000 
locator the pose locator is the one that
we're<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:03.899> moving<00:01:04.290> towards<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.739> target

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
we're actually moving towards the target

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.550 
we're actually moving towards the target
so<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.339> you're<00:01:05.549> imagining<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.330> Lions<00:01:06.780> it'll

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
so if you're imagining the Lions it'll

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
so if you're imagining the Lions it'll
be<00:01:07.650> between<00:01:07.799> these<00:01:08.159> two<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> would<00:01:09.030> also

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
be between these two and it would also

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.750 
be between these two and it would also
be<00:01:09.510> between<00:01:09.900> these<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.890> there's<00:01:11.280> our<00:01:11.490> sort

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
be between these two so there's our sort

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.450 
be between these two so there's our sort
of<00:01:11.790> cone<00:01:12.030> angle<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.280> we're

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
of cone angle so as you can see we're

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
of cone angle so as you can see we're
sort<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.640> moving<00:01:14.880> towards<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.990> getting

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
sort of moving towards that and getting

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
sort of moving towards that and getting
closer<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.189> value<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> could<00:01:18.180> snap

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
closer to a value you know I could snap

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.499 
closer to a value you know I could snap
that<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.850> vertices<00:01:20.850> snap<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> we'll

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that with the vertices snap and we'll

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.330 
that with the vertices snap and we'll
get<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> value<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.920> test<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
get a value of one just to test that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.149 
get a value of one just to test that
that's<00:01:23.490> working<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.570> cool<00:01:25.159> all

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
that's working so that's all cool all

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.350 
that's working so that's all cool all
right<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.060> want<00:01:27.210> at<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
right so this is the one we want at the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210 
right so this is the one we want at the
base<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> joint<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.890> actual

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
base of the joint that's the actual

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700 
base of the joint that's the actual
target<00:01:29.490> pose<00:01:30.049> position<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.320> need<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
target pose position that we need and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.830 
target pose position that we need and
this<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.400> will<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.579> moving<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> arm<00:01:33.479> as

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
this one will be moving with the arm as

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.249 
this one will be moving with the arm as
it<00:01:34.770> sort<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> rotates<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.360> let's<00:01:36.780> pick<00:01:37.020> switch

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it sort of rotates so let's pick switch

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
it sort of rotates so let's pick switch
back<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.650> our<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:38.970> gonna<00:01:39.060> move<00:01:39.240> these

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
back on our I'm just gonna move these

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.440 
back on our I'm just gonna move these
aside<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.729> switch<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.970> our<00:01:42.270> bunny<00:01:42.600> rig<00:01:43.250> yeah

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
aside and switch on our bunny rig yeah

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.649 
aside and switch on our bunny rig yeah
there<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.509> go

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
there we go

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.499 
there we go
so<00:01:46.399> all<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:47.640> need<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.329> just

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
so all we need to do is just

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.539 
so all we need to do is just
theoretically<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.680> parent<00:01:50.130> these<00:01:50.220> into

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
theoretically we just parent these into

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.460 
theoretically we just parent these into
the<00:01:50.909> rig<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.299> we're<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> parent

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the rig so we're just going to parent

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.010 
the rig so we're just going to parent
that<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.750> one

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that one so that that one so that one

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.590 
that one so that that one so that one
which<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> our<00:01:56.189> shoulder<00:01:56.520> joint<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.000> parent

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
which is our shoulder joint so parent

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.770 
which is our shoulder joint so parent
that<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:58.189> grab<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.369> guy<00:01:59.579> just<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that in grab this guy just there in the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.289 
that in grab this guy just there in the
mountains<00:02:01.170> fine

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
mountains fine

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.120 
mountains fine
so<00:02:02.899> you'll<00:02:03.110> see<00:02:03.289> that<00:02:03.320> he's<00:02:03.590> actually<00:02:03.799> gone

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
so you'll see that he's actually gone

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.850 
so you'll see that he's actually gone
and<00:02:04.430> disappeared<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:05.060> snap<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:05.899> guy<00:02:06.200> so

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
and disappeared and snap to that guy so

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.170 
and disappeared and snap to that guy so
now<00:02:07.189> we<00:02:07.250> want<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.579> snap<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:09.200> actual<00:02:10.180> opposed

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
now we want to snap the actual opposed

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.449 
now we want to snap the actual opposed
locator<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:13.700> guy<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.989> that's<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:16.340> a

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
locator to this guy so that's just a

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.800 
locator to this guy so that's just a
matter<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.670> selecting<00:02:17.000> one<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.599> then<00:02:17.690> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
matter of selecting one and then the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.930 
matter of selecting one and then the
other<00:02:17.930> hitting<00:02:18.380> P<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.800> then<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:19.459> can<00:02:19.610> zero

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
other hitting P and then we can zero

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.000 
other hitting P and then we can zero
this<00:02:20.150> out<00:02:20.330> again<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.230> will<00:02:21.410> snap<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:21.890> to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
this out again and that will snap it to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.830 
this out again and that will snap it to
the<00:02:22.040> elbow<00:02:22.250> now<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.120> get<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.599> correct

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
the elbow now to get the correct

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.530 
the elbow now to get the correct
position<00:02:24.349> for<00:02:24.380> our<00:02:24.980> target<00:02:25.550> we<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.120> select

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
position for our target we can select

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.900 
position for our target we can select
this<00:02:26.720> guy<00:02:27.160> again<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.370> parent<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
this guy again and parent it to the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.640 
this guy again and parent it to the
elbow<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:30.470> we<00:02:30.650> going<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.390> hit<00:02:32.390> zero<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.170> now

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
elbow and we going to hit zero and now

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.550 
elbow and we going to hit zero and now
I'm<00:02:33.950> going<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.400> unparent<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:35.750> I'm<00:02:36.319> just

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
I'm going to unparent that so I'm just

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.770 
I'm going to unparent that so I'm just
left<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.280> blend<00:02:37.849> shape<00:02:38.030> on<00:02:38.209> from<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.599> last

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
left the blend shape on from the last

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.509 
left the blend shape on from the last
lesson<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.410> I'm<00:02:39.920> just<00:02:40.040> going<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.220> select<00:02:40.370> that

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
lesson so I'm just going to select that

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.250 
lesson so I'm just going to select that
I'm<00:02:40.880> actually<00:02:41.030> delete<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.690> note<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:41.959> there's

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
I'm actually delete that note so there's

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.870 
I'm actually delete that note so there's
no<00:02:42.380> blend<00:02:42.620> shape<00:02:42.799> happening<00:02:43.220> yet<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.880> that's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
no blend shape happening yet and that's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.580 
no blend shape happening yet and that's
how<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.299> works<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:47.750> I've<00:02:47.840> unparent<00:02:48.290> at<00:02:48.410> that

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
how it works so I've unparent at that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.220 
how it works so I've unparent at that
now<00:02:49.220> if<00:02:49.340> we<00:02:49.459> look<00:02:49.579> at<00:02:49.700> our<00:02:49.819> outliner<00:02:50.269> we<00:02:51.079> can

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
now if we look at our outliner we can

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.839 
now if we look at our outliner we can
see<00:02:51.349> that<00:02:51.500> our<00:02:51.650> target<00:02:51.890> locator<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.519> anyone

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
see that our target locator is anyone

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.339 
see that our target locator is anyone
left<00:02:53.000> with<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.299> empty<00:02:53.660> pose<00:02:53.840> arena<00:02:54.110> group

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
left with this empty pose arena group

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.920 
left with this empty pose arena group
that<00:02:54.560> we<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:54.950> delete<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:56.569> now<00:02:56.599> other

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
that we can just delete and now other

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.240 
that we can just delete and now other
two<00:02:57.940> locators<00:03:00.040> are<00:03:01.040> here<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.959> we<00:03:02.959> can<00:03:03.220> we<00:03:04.220> can

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
two locators are here and we can we can

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.840 
two locators are here and we can we can
bring<00:03:04.790> them<00:03:04.880> up<00:03:05.000> there<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.459> can<00:03:07.579> sort<00:03:07.819> of

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
bring them up there and you can sort of

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.059 
bring them up there and you can sort of
see<00:03:08.060> how<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.630> sort<00:03:08.810> of<00:03:08.870> working<00:03:09.260> as<00:03:09.829> it

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
see how this is sort of working as it

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.920 
see how this is sort of working as it
sort<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.250> rotates<00:03:10.670> down<00:03:10.940> towards<00:03:11.389> that<00:03:11.569> target

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
sort of rotates down towards that target

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.530 
sort of rotates down towards that target
pose<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:13.010> we<00:03:13.430> can<00:03:13.579> verify<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.359> is

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
pose and we can verify that this is

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.660 
pose and we can verify that this is
going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.840> work<00:03:15.139> because<00:03:15.380> we're<00:03:16.010> gonna<00:03:16.280> check

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
going to work because we're gonna check

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.059 
going to work because we're gonna check
out<00:03:16.850> our<00:03:17.000> output<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.660> there<00:03:18.319> it's<00:03:18.470> zero<00:03:18.799> and

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
out our output and there it's zero and

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.050 
out our output and there it's zero and
as<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.370> comes<00:03:19.579> down<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.329> approaches<00:03:21.319> our<00:03:21.530> pose

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
as it comes down and approaches our pose

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.699 
as it comes down and approaches our pose
we<00:03:23.060> can<00:03:23.239> see<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:23.540> frame<00:03:23.810> ten<00:03:24.079> it<00:03:24.319> actually

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
we can see it frame ten it actually

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.009 
we can see it frame ten it actually
equals<00:03:24.950> one<00:03:25.430> which<00:03:25.639> means<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:26.209> blend<00:03:26.540> shape<00:03:26.780> can

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
equals one which means a blend shape can

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.020 
equals one which means a blend shape can
we<00:03:27.410> can<00:03:27.530> plug<00:03:27.769> that<00:03:27.920> straight<00:03:27.980> into<00:03:28.579> our<00:03:28.790> blend

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
we can plug that straight into our blend

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.460 
we can plug that straight into our blend
shape<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.480> everything<00:03:29.870> will<00:03:29.989> be<00:03:30.019> working

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
shape and everything will be working

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.640 
shape and everything will be working
fine<00:03:31.239> just<00:03:32.239> another<00:03:32.450> thing<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.840> remember<00:03:32.870> is

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
fine just another thing to remember is

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.050 
fine just another thing to remember is
just<00:03:33.950> play<00:03:34.130> around<00:03:34.250> with<00:03:34.370> your<00:03:34.489> cone<00:03:34.730> angle

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
just play around with your cone angle

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.170 
just play around with your cone angle
because<00:03:35.389> if<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.530> have<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.709> very<00:03:37.040> small<00:03:37.790> member

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
because if you have a very small member

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.300 
because if you have a very small member
so<00:03:38.389> I'm<00:03:38.540> just<00:03:38.660> gonna<00:03:38.750> make<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:38.989> 90<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:40.160> can

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
so I'm just gonna make this 90 you can

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.520 
so I'm just gonna make this 90 you can
sort<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.609> see<00:03:40.790> as<00:03:41.090> we<00:03:41.269> scrub<00:03:41.569> along<00:03:41.750> in<00:03:42.290> the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
sort of see as we scrub along in the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.229 
sort of see as we scrub along in the
frame<00:03:42.769> here<00:03:43.040> it's<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.549> output<00:03:43.970> doesn't

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
frame here it's the output doesn't

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.809 
frame here it's the output doesn't
actually<00:03:44.359> come<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:44.989> until<00:03:45.859> quite<00:03:46.160> late<00:03:46.220> in

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
actually come on until quite late in

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.819 
actually come on until quite late in
that<00:03:46.910> game<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.750> depends<00:03:48.109> on<00:03:48.170> how<00:03:48.410> you<00:03:48.470> want

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
that game so it depends on how you want

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.410 
that game so it depends on how you want
the<00:03:49.010> blend<00:03:49.220> shape<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.549> come<00:03:49.760> on<00:03:49.910> as<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.389> can

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
the blend shape to come on as you can

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.319 
the blend shape to come on as you can
muck<00:03:50.900> around<00:03:51.049> with<00:03:51.319> this<00:03:51.470> cone<00:03:52.310> angle<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:52.940> for

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
muck around with this cone angle and for

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.229 
muck around with this cone angle and for
this<00:03:53.480> example<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.170> think<00:03:54.230> 135<00:03:55.069> works<00:03:56.000> pretty

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
this example I think 135 works pretty

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.430 
this example I think 135 works pretty
well<00:03:56.359> you<00:03:56.630> can<00:03:56.750> sort<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:56.959> see<00:03:57.109> it's<00:03:57.230> pretty

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
well you can sort of see it's pretty

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.870 
well you can sort of see it's pretty
much<00:03:57.560> switching<00:03:58.130> on<00:03:58.250> as<00:03:58.340> soon<00:03:58.489> as<00:03:58.639> it<00:03:58.760> comes

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
much switching on as soon as it comes

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.319 
much switching on as soon as it comes
down<00:04:00.220> all<00:04:01.220> right<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:01.489> now<00:04:01.639> let's<00:04:01.849> set<00:04:02.060> up<00:04:02.090> the

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
down all right so now let's set up the

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.670 
down all right so now let's set up the
last<00:04:02.510> thing<00:04:02.720> we<00:04:02.780> need<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:02.989> do<00:04:03.079> is<00:04:03.169> is<00:04:03.290> parent

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
last thing we need to do is is parent

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.129 
last thing we need to do is is parent
this<00:04:03.799> to<00:04:04.010> something<00:04:04.250> properly<00:04:04.849> and<00:04:05.750> in<00:04:06.019> this

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
this to something properly and in this

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.270 
this to something properly and in this
case<00:04:06.349> we're<00:04:06.470> going<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.650> parent<00:04:06.859> it<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.069> the

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
case we're going to parent it to the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.059 
case we're going to parent it to the
actual<00:04:07.700> clavicle<00:04:08.599> so<00:04:09.200> that's<00:04:09.590> parent

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
actual clavicle so that's parent

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.000 
actual clavicle so that's parent
and<00:04:10.519> that<00:04:10.969> just<00:04:11.180> means<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.569> if<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.560> clavicle

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
and that just means that if the clavicle

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.380 
and that just means that if the clavicle
moves<00:04:13.219> everything's<00:04:13.700> going<00:04:13.909> to<00:04:13.969> move<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.269> our

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
moves everything's going to move in our

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.349 
moves everything's going to move in our
blood<00:04:14.719> shapes<00:04:14.989> not<00:04:15.140> going<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.409> spaz<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:15.829> out

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
blood shapes not going to spaz it out

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.509 
blood shapes not going to spaz it out
but<00:04:17.359> if<00:04:17.780> we<00:04:18.109> rotate<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.979> course<00:04:19.220> that

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
but if we rotate this of course that

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.570 
but if we rotate this of course that
locator<00:04:20.000> will<00:04:20.239> be<00:04:20.329> left<00:04:20.509> behind<00:04:20.919> by<00:04:21.919> itself<00:04:22.250> in

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
locator will be left behind by itself in

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.550 
locator will be left behind by itself in
order<00:04:22.940> for<00:04:23.120> those<00:04:23.270> two<00:04:23.509> to<00:04:23.780> sort<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.080> hit<00:04:24.440> each

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
order for those two to sort of hit each

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.430 
order for those two to sort of hit each
other<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.009> zero<00:04:25.460> out<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:29.419> there<00:04:29.960> we<00:04:30.020> go<00:04:30.050> that's

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
other and zero out so there we go that's

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.080 
other and zero out so there we go that's
our<00:04:30.680> pose<00:04:30.919> really<00:04:31.250> really<00:04:31.490> set<00:04:31.669> up<00:04:31.789> this<00:04:31.910> is

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
our pose really really set up this is

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.510 
our pose really really set up this is
like<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.509> this<00:04:32.990> is<00:04:33.139> like<00:04:33.289> the<00:04:33.440> most<00:04:33.860> the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
like that this is like the most the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.210 
like that this is like the most the
easiest<00:04:35.060> way<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.300> set<00:04:35.570> up<00:04:35.600> a<00:04:35.750> pose<00:04:35.930> reader

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
easiest way to set up a pose reader

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.439 
easiest way to set up a pose reader
there<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:37.280> go<00:04:37.400> it's<00:04:37.550> an<00:04:37.699> inner<00:04:38.000> ring<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.240> it's

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
there you go it's an inner ring and it's

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.710 
there you go it's an inner ring and it's
ready<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.810> go<00:04:39.759> now<00:04:40.759> what<00:04:40.970> we<00:04:41.060> have<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.210> do<00:04:41.389> is

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
ready to go now what we have to do is

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.920 
ready to go now what we have to do is
plug<00:04:42.380> in<00:04:42.650> our<00:04:42.919> blend<00:04:43.729> shapes<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.270> I'm<00:04:44.599> going<00:04:44.840> to

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
plug in our blend shapes so I'm going to

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.200 
plug in our blend shapes so I'm going to
open<00:04:45.169> up<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:46.400> blend<00:04:46.759> shape<00:04:46.940> that<00:04:47.090> I've

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
open up the blend shape that I've

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.689 
open up the blend shape that I've
previously<00:04:47.599> made<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.349> just<00:04:49.039> load<00:04:49.220> this<00:04:49.370> guy<00:04:49.550> up

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
previously made so just load this guy up

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.400 
previously made so just load this guy up
this<00:04:49.880> is<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.120> attractive<00:04:50.840> blend<00:04:51.050> shape<00:04:51.259> that

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
this is a attractive blend shape that

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.260 
this is a attractive blend shape that
I've<00:04:51.530> made<00:04:51.710> already<00:04:52.220> with<00:04:52.729> our<00:04:52.910> extract

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
I've made already with our extract

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.570 
I've made already with our extract
Delta's<00:04:53.660> plug-in<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.259> we<00:04:54.979> can<00:04:55.160> select<00:04:55.370> this

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
Delta's plug-in and we can select this

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.930 
Delta's plug-in and we can select this
guy<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.120> then<00:04:56.330> select<00:04:56.630> this<00:04:56.720> guy<00:04:57.789> and<00:04:58.789> go

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
guy and then select this guy and go

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.089 
guy and then select this guy and go
create<00:04:59.270> deformers<00:04:59.599> blend<00:04:59.990> shape<00:05:00.229> then<00:05:00.860> just

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
create deformers blend shape then just

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.310 
create deformers blend shape then just
make<00:05:01.310> sure<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:02.210> we<00:05:02.630> have<00:05:02.810> front<00:05:03.139> of<00:05:03.229> the

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
make sure that we have front of the

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.909 
make sure that we have front of the
chain<00:05:03.530> one<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.090> once<00:05:05.090> that's<00:05:05.300> been<00:05:05.630> made<00:05:06.289> we

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
chain one so once that's been made we

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.379 
chain one so once that's been made we
can<00:05:07.099> go<00:05:07.280> here<00:05:07.520> and<00:05:07.550> we<00:05:07.729> can<00:05:07.849> see<00:05:08.030> our<00:05:08.060> blend

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
can go here and we can see our blend

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.570 
can go here and we can see our blend
shape<00:05:08.630> and<00:05:08.900> we've<00:05:09.050> got<00:05:09.259> our<00:05:09.470> fix<00:05:09.830> which

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
shape and we've got our fix which

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.339 
shape and we've got our fix which
doesn't<00:05:11.120> look<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.389> great<00:05:11.630> there<00:05:11.870> but<00:05:12.110> when<00:05:12.229> we

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
doesn't look so great there but when we

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.560 
doesn't look so great there but when we
put<00:05:12.560> it<00:05:12.650> in<00:05:12.740> its<00:05:12.889> pose<00:05:13.130> we<00:05:13.970> can<00:05:14.150> see<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.449> that

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
put it in its pose we can see that that

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.270 
put it in its pose we can see that that
fixes<00:05:15.110> just<00:05:15.320> filling<00:05:15.680> out<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:15.860> shoulder

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
fixes just filling out that shoulder

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.689 
fixes just filling out that shoulder
nicely<00:05:16.789> for<00:05:17.000> us<00:05:18.099> okay<00:05:19.099> so<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.340> next<00:05:19.460> thing

nicely for us okay so the next thing

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.700 
nicely for us okay so the next thing
that<00:05:19.729> we<00:05:19.940> want<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.150> do<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.539> now<00:05:21.260> that's<00:05:21.440> in<00:05:21.620> the

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
that we want to do is now that's in the

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.830 
that we want to do is now that's in the
right<00:05:21.889> pose<00:05:22.130> is<00:05:22.520> we<00:05:22.669> want<00:05:22.849> to<00:05:22.909> connect<00:05:23.360> this<00:05:23.570> to

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
right pose is we want to connect this to

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.830 
right pose is we want to connect this to
our<00:05:24.229> output<00:05:24.680> from<00:05:25.130> that<00:05:25.190> locator<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.570> we<00:05:26.659> had

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
our output from that locator that we had

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.170 
our output from that locator that we had
a<00:05:27.080> minute<00:05:27.440> ago<00:05:27.650> so<00:05:27.889> just<00:05:28.099> hide<00:05:28.610> everything<00:05:28.880> so

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
a minute ago so just hide everything so

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.300 
a minute ago so just hide everything so
you<00:05:29.240> can<00:05:29.360> see<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.289> it<00:05:30.440> springs<00:05:30.740> up<00:05:30.949> so<00:05:31.220> we

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
you can see it and it springs up so we

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.860 
you can see it and it springs up so we
can<00:05:31.430> select<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.849> locator<00:05:32.240> we<00:05:32.389> want<00:05:32.570> which<00:05:32.720> is

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
can select the locator we want which is

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.140 
can select the locator we want which is
this<00:05:32.960> one<00:05:33.229> there's<00:05:33.979> our<00:05:34.190> output<00:05:34.610> value<00:05:34.940> that's

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
this one there's our output value that's

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.430 
this one there's our output value that's
the<00:05:35.270> one<00:05:35.389> that<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:35.599> want<00:05:35.780> to<00:05:35.840> plug<00:05:36.020> into<00:05:36.229> the

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
the one that you want to plug into the

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.439 
the one that you want to plug into the
blend<00:05:36.650> shape<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.130> let's<00:05:37.460> just<00:05:37.729> open<00:05:38.090> up<00:05:38.180> the

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
blend shape so let's just open up the

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.610 
blend shape so let's just open up the
connection<00:05:38.840> editor<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:40.750> it's<00:05:41.750> this<00:05:42.320> guy<00:05:42.560> is

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
connection editor and it's this guy is

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.830 
connection editor and it's this guy is
that<00:05:42.860> driver<00:05:43.159> so<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.669> speak<00:05:43.940> so<00:05:44.180> I'm<00:05:44.630> going<00:05:44.750> to

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
that driver so to speak so I'm going to

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.719 
that driver so to speak so I'm going to
reload<00:05:45.260> him<00:05:45.500> and<00:05:45.770> down<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:46.039> bottom<00:05:46.340> we've<00:05:46.699> got

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
reload him and down the bottom we've got

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.189 
reload him and down the bottom we've got
our<00:05:47.150> output<00:05:47.830> now<00:05:48.830> for<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:50.150> we<00:05:50.780> want<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.020> plug

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
our output now for the we want to plug

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.500 
our output now for the we want to plug
this<00:05:51.440> into<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.800> blend<00:05:52.070> shape<00:05:52.280> so<00:05:52.580> just<00:05:53.419> switch

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
this into the blend shape so just switch

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.390 
this into the blend shape so just switch
out<00:05:53.750> polygons<00:05:54.169> back<00:05:54.349> on<00:05:54.560> just<00:05:54.770> like<00:05:55.010> this<00:05:55.159> guy

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
out polygons back on just like this guy

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.129 
out polygons back on just like this guy
usually<00:05:55.760> I<00:05:55.970> like<00:05:56.180> to<00:05:56.360> select<00:05:56.539> the<00:05:56.720> blend<00:05:56.870> shape

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
usually I like to select the blend shape

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.719 
usually I like to select the blend shape
there<00:05:57.470> add<00:05:58.159> a<00:05:58.220> select<00:05:59.120> node<00:06:00.039> and<00:06:01.039> now<00:06:01.070> we<00:06:01.550> can

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
there add a select node and now we can

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.839 
there add a select node and now we can
reload<00:06:02.030> right<00:06:02.300> and<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:03.169> actual<00:06:03.770> Big<00:06:04.639> Buck

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
reload right and the actual Big Buck

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.610 
reload right and the actual Big Buck
Bunny<00:06:04.880> extracted<00:06:05.750> shape<00:06:05.990> this<00:06:06.169> one<00:06:06.349> we<00:06:06.440> want

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
Bunny extracted shape this one we want

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.219 
Bunny extracted shape this one we want
to<00:06:06.710> change<00:06:07.009> is<00:06:07.639> under<00:06:08.000> weight<00:06:08.240> so<00:06:08.900> if<00:06:09.050> you<00:06:09.139> go

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
to change is under weight so if you go

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.170 
to change is under weight so if you go
weight<00:06:09.500> and<00:06:09.979> click<00:06:10.190> on<00:06:10.340> that<00:06:10.490> and<00:06:10.880> I'm<00:06:11.150> just

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
weight and click on that and I'm just

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.240 
weight and click on that and I'm just
going<00:06:11.449> to<00:06:11.509> go<00:06:12.020> down<00:06:12.139> to<00:06:12.259> frame<00:06:12.470> 10<00:06:12.740> so<00:06:13.039> that<00:06:13.190> you

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
going to go down to frame 10 so that you

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.860 
going to go down to frame 10 so that you
can<00:06:13.370> see<00:06:13.610> it<00:06:13.729> sort<00:06:13.909> of<00:06:14.000> taking<00:06:14.300> an<00:06:14.389> effect<00:06:14.690> when

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
can see it sort of taking an effect when

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.399 
can see it sort of taking an effect when
we<00:06:14.900> click<00:06:15.199> on

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
we click on

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.799 
we click on
that<00:06:16.279> connections<00:06:16.759> now<00:06:16.969> been<00:06:17.179> made<00:06:17.419> and<00:06:17.779> you

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:17.809 
that connections now been made and you

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:20.469 
that connections now been made and you
can<00:06:18.229> see<00:06:18.589> that<00:06:19.339> switching<00:06:19.759> on<00:06:19.939> and<00:06:20.059> off<00:06:20.149> nicely

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
can see that switching on and off nicely

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.749 
can see that switching on and off nicely
watch<00:06:20.929> the<00:06:21.199> value<00:06:21.499> it's<00:06:21.619> at<00:06:21.739> zero<00:06:21.979> and<00:06:22.580> we<00:06:22.729> can

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
watch the value it's at zero and we can

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.479 
watch the value it's at zero and we can
step<00:06:23.149> through<00:06:24.189> step-through<00:06:25.189> frame<00:06:25.219> by<00:06:25.610> frame

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:27.489 
step through step-through frame by frame

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:30.040 
step through step-through frame by frame
slowly<00:06:28.489> going<00:06:29.029> down<00:06:29.149> and<00:06:29.629> you<00:06:29.689> can<00:06:29.809> sort<00:06:30.019> of

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
slowly going down and you can sort of

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.540 
slowly going down and you can sort of
see<00:06:30.169> that<00:06:30.199> blend<00:06:30.529> shapes<00:06:30.769> I<00:06:30.919> was<00:06:31.009> switching<00:06:31.429> on

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
see that blend shapes I was switching on

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.659 
see that blend shapes I was switching on
so<00:06:32.119> we<00:06:32.209> know<00:06:32.360> that<00:06:32.389> that's<00:06:32.629> working<00:06:33.110> and<00:06:33.669> just

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
so we know that that's working and just

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.089 
so we know that that's working and just
as<00:06:34.789> a<00:06:34.819> final<00:06:34.939> step<00:06:35.509> just<00:06:35.749> to<00:06:36.229> test<00:06:36.439> this<00:06:36.619> out<00:06:36.830> we

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
as a final step just to test this out we

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.909 
as a final step just to test this out we
want<00:06:37.819> to<00:06:37.879> see<00:06:38.029> if<00:06:38.360> it's<00:06:38.959> working<00:06:39.379> for<00:06:39.529> both<00:06:39.709> of

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
want to see if it's working for both of

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.219 
want to see if it's working for both of
these<00:06:40.069> angles<00:06:40.519> if<00:06:40.909> it's<00:06:41.149> the<00:06:41.360> Oilers<00:06:41.719> working

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
these angles if it's the Oilers working

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:43.540 
these angles if it's the Oilers working
we<00:06:42.379> can<00:06:42.469> see<00:06:42.619> the<00:06:42.739> blend<00:06:42.949> shape<00:06:43.129> still<00:06:43.399> on

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
we can see the blend shape still on

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.519 
we can see the blend shape still on
they're<00:06:43.729> still<00:06:44.509> on<00:06:44.629> here<00:06:44.869> so<00:06:45.169> we're<00:06:45.319> getting

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:45.529 
they're still on here so we're getting

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.009 
they're still on here so we're getting
around<00:06:45.800> our<00:06:45.949> problem<00:06:46.339> and<00:06:46.759> that's<00:06:47.509> really<00:06:47.719> how

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:48.019 
around our problem and that's really how

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:50.199 
around our problem and that's really how
to<00:06:48.079> set<00:06:48.319> up<00:06:48.409> the<00:06:48.529> pose<00:06:48.709> reader<00:06:48.979> and<00:06:49.279> to<00:06:50.029> get

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:50.209 
to set up the pose reader and to get

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.729 
to set up the pose reader and to get
your<00:06:50.300> bun<00:06:50.479> shapes<00:06:50.749> happening<00:06:51.110> on<00:06:51.199> that<00:06:51.349> it's<00:06:51.619> a

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:51.739 
your bun shapes happening on that it's a

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:54.369 
your bun shapes happening on that it's a
very<00:06:52.069> easy<00:06:52.159> rig<00:06:52.639> now<00:06:53.539> the<00:06:53.599> only<00:06:53.809> thing<00:06:54.050> that<00:06:54.079> we

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:54.379 
very easy rig now the only thing that we

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.139 
very easy rig now the only thing that we
do<00:06:54.649> need<00:06:54.919> to<00:06:55.069> be<00:06:55.219> aware<00:06:55.579> of<00:06:55.639> and<00:06:55.939> I'm<00:06:56.029> just

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:56.149 
do need to be aware of and I'm just

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.839 
do need to be aware of and I'm just
going<00:06:56.269> to<00:06:56.300> show<00:06:56.389> you<00:06:56.479> guys<00:06:56.599> this<00:06:56.779> very<00:06:57.079> quickly

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849 
going to show you guys this very quickly

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.699 
going to show you guys this very quickly
is<00:06:58.849> that<00:06:59.360> it<00:06:59.509> is<00:06:59.629> pretty<00:06:59.959> it<00:07:00.259> can<00:07:00.439> be<00:07:00.529> a<00:07:00.559> lot

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:00.709 
is that it is pretty it can be a lot

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:03.939 
is that it is pretty it can be a lot
heavier<00:07:01.069> this<00:07:01.879> system<00:07:02.329> the<00:07:02.959> pose<00:07:03.139> reader<00:07:03.439> has

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949 
heavier this system the pose reader has

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.459 
heavier this system the pose reader has
got<00:07:04.399> a<00:07:04.429> lot<00:07:04.729> of<00:07:04.819> nodes<00:07:05.019> attached<00:07:06.019> to<00:07:06.169> it<00:07:06.289> and

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:06.469 
got a lot of nodes attached to it and

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:09.850 
got a lot of nodes attached to it and
that's<00:07:06.709> just<00:07:06.979> purely<00:07:07.249> for<00:07:08.209> the<00:07:08.649> that's<00:07:09.649> just

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
that's just purely for the that's just

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.619 
that's just purely for the that's just
purely<00:07:10.099> for<00:07:10.369> the<00:07:10.459> maths<00:07:10.699> that's<00:07:11.029> required<00:07:11.419> in

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:11.629 
purely for the maths that's required in

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:14.019 
purely for the maths that's required in
order<00:07:11.749> to<00:07:11.899> extract<00:07:12.439> those<00:07:12.619> vector<00:07:13.009> angles<00:07:13.369> now

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:14.029 
order to extract those vector angles now

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:16.479 
order to extract those vector angles now
it's<00:07:14.300> it's<00:07:14.779> not<00:07:14.989> ah<00:07:15.229> not<00:07:15.860> none<00:07:16.099> of<00:07:16.129> these<00:07:16.309> nodes

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:16.489 
it's it's not ah not none of these nodes

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:18.339 
it's it's not ah not none of these nodes
are<00:07:16.759> doing<00:07:17.089> anything<00:07:17.300> particularly<00:07:17.689> fancy<00:07:18.019> so

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:18.349 
are doing anything particularly fancy so

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:20.469 
are doing anything particularly fancy so
it's<00:07:18.499> not<00:07:18.619> super<00:07:19.189> heavy<00:07:19.339> but<00:07:19.579> if<00:07:20.089> you<00:07:20.119> start

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 
it's not super heavy but if you start

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:22.329 
it's not super heavy but if you start
layering<00:07:20.689> up<00:07:20.990> you<00:07:21.110> know<00:07:21.229> 2030<00:07:21.829> nodes<00:07:22.129> and

00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:22.339 
layering up you know 2030 nodes and

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:23.829 
layering up you know 2030 nodes and
you're<00:07:22.459> seen<00:07:22.669> as<00:07:22.699> Marcus<00:07:23.360> says<00:07:23.539> it's<00:07:23.689> gonna

00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:23.839 
you're seen as Marcus says it's gonna

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:26.980 
you're seen as Marcus says it's gonna
slow<00:07:24.559> down<00:07:24.740> your<00:07:25.009> your<00:07:25.939> computer<00:07:26.240> so<00:07:26.599> just

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 
slow down your your computer so just

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.009 
slow down your your computer so just
keep<00:07:27.139> that<00:07:27.459> nice<00:07:28.459> and<00:07:28.699> light<00:07:28.909> I<00:07:29.149> only<00:07:29.479> put<00:07:29.719> in<00:07:29.809> a

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:30.019 
keep that nice and light I only put in a

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:32.079 
keep that nice and light I only put in a
few<00:07:30.319> poster<00:07:30.949> formulas<00:07:31.309> pose<00:07:31.550> readers<00:07:31.939> where

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:32.089 
few poster formulas pose readers where

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:34.089 
few poster formulas pose readers where
you<00:07:32.179> need<00:07:32.389> them<00:07:32.569> a<00:07:32.719> lot<00:07:33.319> of<00:07:33.349> them<00:07:33.559> can<00:07:33.800> really

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:34.099 
you need them a lot of them can really

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:37.359 
you need them a lot of them can really
just<00:07:34.759> go<00:07:34.939> on<00:07:35.149> the<00:07:35.269> euler<00:07:35.599> rotations<00:07:36.379> things

00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:37.369 
just go on the euler rotations things

00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:39.100 
just go on the euler rotations things
like<00:07:37.579> elbows<00:07:38.029> for<00:07:38.240> example<00:07:38.629> it<00:07:38.719> really<00:07:39.019> only

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 
like elbows for example it really only

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.249 
like elbows for example it really only
rotate<00:07:39.589> on<00:07:39.709> one<00:07:39.889> axis<00:07:40.279> so<00:07:40.999> you<00:07:41.059> only<00:07:41.419> so<00:07:42.019> it's

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:42.259 
rotate on one axis so you only so it's

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:44.079 
rotate on one axis so you only so it's
fine<00:07:42.529> so<00:07:42.740> hook<00:07:42.919> you<00:07:43.069> blend<00:07:43.279> shapes<00:07:43.519> up<00:07:43.699> just<00:07:43.939> to

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:44.089 
fine so hook you blend shapes up just to

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.290 
fine so hook you blend shapes up just to
the<00:07:44.119> old-school<00:07:45.079> Oyler<00:07:45.939> parts<00:07:46.939> you<00:07:47.179> don't

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300 
the old-school Oyler parts you don't

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.179 
the old-school Oyler parts you don't
need<00:07:47.539> to<00:07:47.629> have<00:07:47.749> these<00:07:47.929> fancy<00:07:48.199> pose<00:07:48.769> readers

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:49.189 
need to have these fancy pose readers

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:50.949 
need to have these fancy pose readers
for<00:07:49.309> every<00:07:49.639> corrective<00:07:50.119> blend<00:07:50.329> shape<00:07:50.509> on<00:07:50.749> your

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:50.959 
for every corrective blend shape on your

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:53.379 
for every corrective blend shape on your
on<00:07:51.199> your<00:07:51.529> rig<00:07:51.679> but<00:07:52.309> for<00:07:52.519> shoulders<00:07:52.939> and<00:07:53.149> and

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:53.389 
on your rig but for shoulders and and

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:55.149 
on your rig but for shoulders and and
elements<00:07:53.869> with<00:07:54.019> this<00:07:54.169> large<00:07:54.559> degrees<00:07:55.039> of

00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:55.159 
elements with this large degrees of

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:56.769 
elements with this large degrees of
freedom<00:07:55.729> and<00:07:55.879> then<00:07:56.029> it<00:07:56.179> really<00:07:56.449> comes<00:07:56.629> in

00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:56.779 
freedom and then it really comes in

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:58.839 
freedom and then it really comes in
handy<00:07:56.809> so<00:07:57.800> there<00:07:57.979> you<00:07:58.039> go<00:07:58.129> that's<00:07:58.339> the<00:07:58.550> setting

00:07:58.839 --> 00:07:58.849 
handy so there you go that's the setting

00:07:58.849 --> 00:08:01.869 
handy so there you go that's the setting
up<00:07:58.999> the<00:07:59.089> pose<00:07:59.269> arena<00:07:59.539> um<00:08:00.249> on<00:08:01.249> a<00:08:01.309> real-life

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:01.879 
up the pose arena um on a real-life

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:04.599 
up the pose arena um on a real-life
example<00:08:02.269> of<00:08:02.300> a<00:08:02.419> rig
