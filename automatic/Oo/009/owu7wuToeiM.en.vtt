00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
than someone who loses weight has a

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.180 
than someone who loses weight has a
life-changing<00:03:04.019> transformation<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:04.920> Myra

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
life-changing transformation like Myra

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.940 
life-changing transformation like Myra
and<00:03:05.549> just<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.540> add<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> little<00:03:06.959> bit<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.440> she

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
and just to add a little bit to it she

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.979 
and just to add a little bit to it she
did<00:03:08.159> it<00:03:08.340> because<00:03:08.970> she<00:03:09.000> wanted<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.569> care<00:03:09.810> for

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
did it because she wanted to care for

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.110 
did it because she wanted to care for
her<00:03:10.109> sister's<00:03:10.530> children<00:03:10.739> her<00:03:11.519> sister<00:03:11.879> is<00:03:11.940> no

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
her sister's children her sister is no

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.349 
her sister's children her sister is no
longer<00:03:12.599> around<00:03:13.470> anymore<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.430> she<00:03:15.030> wants<00:03:15.239> to

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
longer around anymore and she wants to
