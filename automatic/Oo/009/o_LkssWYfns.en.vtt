00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 I started at 5 years old to do sports 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.770
 I loved athletics I love the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.719
 rudder was not the best was 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.049
 will not know about the worst but 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.809
 fascinated at 13 years old my coach 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.020
 saw between now present three quarters it 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.789
 He was always telling me what I was 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.210
 a very good talent had long legs 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.580
 it was thin was had very good stereotype 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 to do athletics and my coach I 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.810
 he said look your projection is spectacular 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.270
 that is, we can have things that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 here because maybe never ever happened to you 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.920
 for the head that you could have the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.210
 15 years two years later I was a medal on 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.160
 world medal its american one year 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.559
 in obstacles the first obstacle that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.649
 I had to live living away from my family 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.449
 and obviously when I was a girl I was 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.220
 now bond and one gets used I have 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.590
 21 years old I am already very used to 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.149
 live alone but imagine at age 14 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.089
 he had all the responsibility to me 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.620
 I had to study had to train me 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.699
 I had to organize myself in my life 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.000
 imagining I had my parents for that 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.460
 the death of my grandfather who was 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.100
 like my dad that's why he was traveling 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.689
 and I had gone to 17 in a field 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.539
 of training in Havana in Cuba 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.759
 for me the obstacles I am not one of those 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.250
 that I stay if I had an obstacle I am 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.820
 of those warriors that I like to give 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.550
 forward 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.860
 Look, I did badly in this situation but 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.270
 I for this situation I will continue 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.360
 working harder and I'm going to work more 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.800
 hard and I am very demanding with myself and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 until I do not have the results 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.270
 I stop an emotional one with over all 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.479
 things with my family with my grandfather with 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.160
 god I think of a people that I know that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.869
 supports me and in the people that either 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.920
 I know that they also support me because I know 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.900
 that there are a lot of people that I do not 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.160
 I know that if there is support for my career 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
 sports and that is fundamental for me 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.420
 also because they are fighting for them 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.119
 as well 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.280
 my goal is to finish my career 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.600
 university that I know is what's going 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.000
 to help to project me for the day 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.520
 tomorrow being in my sports career and 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.170
 coming out in my sports career 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.599
 in the next olympic games I 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.819
 I want to be a semifinalist, my goal is 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.739
 I can be a river semifinalist but I know that 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.940
 in 2020 I'm going to want to be a finalist 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.890
 and I want to be among the other best 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.890
 of the world and I know I'm going to have it
