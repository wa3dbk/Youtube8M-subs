00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello sir show you how 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.910
 make a flower of mind to make 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.780
 jasmine you need a perfect square 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.769
 like this one here to start you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:20.369
 go take your leaf bend it in 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:25.080
 two come traps correct that's my 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:29.510
 folding you open it makes a rush of 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:38.399
 the other side well properly 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:41.730
 here we are, this is a perfect 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.250
 you open you will take the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.250
 pieces wanted to bring back to the middle 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:01:01.860
 the other very well another very good 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.480
 another one and here is what you 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.670
 go do you go take a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.970
 petal you will bring back air like 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:17.360
 that you see well at some 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:21.420
 distance correctly now here 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.580
 you do the same thing lived one side 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.800
 and watch it must be well 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.550
 perpendicular here look fast and to 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:40.020
 the naked eye and it will be a good fact the same 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:41.600
 thing with our side that is the same 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.350
 thing with another 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.470
 it's worth looking at both sides 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:52.039
 during a perpendicular d2 here and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.250
 now what are you going to do 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.750
 you get a woman like this 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.409
 look good you have a big 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.810
 success 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.489
 and that's what you did 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.739
 now is that you are going 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:08.429
 return you will start business 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:11.300
 imply like that one points his 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.300
 spikes until this spring 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:26.410
 here I am going to fold it unfold and 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:32.170
 you make the second clip done 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:35.170
 the properly jump to another that he 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.860
 is a bit difficult because the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.800
 other traps go a little light wucher 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:47.800
 that's almost perfect and it's perfect 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.390
 here you are now supporting what 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.840
 you're going to do you're going to take the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.030
 flight 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.260
 and you will do different unfoldable 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.310
 ie from 7.2 this point up here 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.060
 from this point up to here from that to the at 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.110
 that to that one to that to that one 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.910
 look closely at how I 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:14.110
 do them here I take it like that I 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:19.330
 do a web pic like that he does the 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:27.570
 same thing with another who is a 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:27.570
 other subject the correctly 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.060
 good 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.060
 here after finishing all your folds 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.000
 you go that is to say you go 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.170
 take the paper on that side 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.220
 now you see you take a 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.090
 you bend a little the middle part 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.590
 are you going to do you're going 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.330
 take the petals a period 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.739
 first you will take like this 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.220
 a push this one you already take 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.220
 another 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:10.150
 here's another one it's still a good 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:14.739
 way there look only if you in 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:25.500
 have 4 one two three and four 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:25.500
 on this side you take 4 one two 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:51.520
 2 a third 3 2 3 and you slow down the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:55.449
 4th here be careful it's good with 4 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.669
 on this side and 4 of that look 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.280
 well you now have a shape 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.340
 as that support you to finish your 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.370
 grievances you now take your 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.810
 folding that's the one you're going to put 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.880
 your finger and you 're going to press 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.360
 gently and you as you can 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.250
 observe 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.830
 it goes inside and you go a 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.010
 little feature here you will finish you 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.860
 press the accelerator folding I was going on the 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.039
 fold as you go and that's the 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.900
 fold like this here we hold the 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.599
 little corner is what you're going to do 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.050
 your tea like that in another you 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.639
 have it open like this open 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.789
 that's very simple very slowly 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.130
 and here you have and you get the 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.990
 do to make them a real goal 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.970
 you will take two inches and you 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.659
 go put them inside you 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.659
 go gently like this 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.659
 look 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.380
 again this one here and here you 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.280
 get a jasmine flower 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.210
