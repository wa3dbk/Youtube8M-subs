00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.510
 possible in this video and shortly the mp3 converter audio player from BT p500 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.189
 Introducing Optimus One 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.529
 That's why I was asked in the block to see with her husband 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.409
 usually one finds him in the mild 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.179
 under music 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.230
 suitable for this pink 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.230
 I've already put the whole on the home screen 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.179
 music 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.320
 and also a suitable offers that is easy with it is also comes but 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.040
 later 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.300
 at first would be 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.140
 to paint the pussycat 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.060
 the first time basically divided artists now all performers too 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.790
 Find 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.140
 that will be read out of the old three places 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.700
 and Merkel too beautiful 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.440
 Paul Kalkbrenner fear caps 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.880
 Duran Duran and Bob Sinclar on it 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.910
 then you can all ads nevertheless correspond 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.500
 With 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.790
 displayed kapern if you can indicate has highlighted 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.400
 Whole will of course also in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.960
 who from the 8th 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.410
 who only briefly in portrait format 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.520
 then the whole animal particles 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.380
 now I'm so on the fly but a lot is on it 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.000
 nice if I see the same as long as it is here 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.640
 a little longer with the finger hours 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.020
 since you know the weekly view 1 points 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.760
 and slowed down with its small green symbols 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.830
 marks what you hear right now 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.680
 in the menu Playlist are listed according to the playlist which exist 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.300
 are 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.510
 or recently added Â«I have not had any new ground for a while 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.240
 played 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.170
 that's why the count is not to be found 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.960
 so I'm down here on the menu button pressed then there is still a lot 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.190
 managed 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.120
 it just plays wild 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.330
 what's on it 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.400
 this is the view here if you then play around the 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.260
 quasi-water jet reproduced evening view 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.680
 uncertain is also among the colleagues 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.190
 from factories displayed there that we are in Demos right now in Paris 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.150
 Now you can even easier on the next to almost every gift 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.389
 Switch 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.940
 down here you also have percent of all titles a title 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.129
 and chancellor and should be 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.849
 then below or displayed artist Paul Kalkbrenner the case album 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.909
 his colleagues and the current title Sky and Sand 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.450
 the standards let you just need to govern so title back 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.360
 and in the beginning it has to jump off 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.360
 and percent is a representative of this title leadership 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:41.339
 and down here I break it Mix on the trigger of many hours Mixed 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.619
 pretty handy a slider 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.229
 with the light to the best position to bring no annoying pressures 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.489
 has to spray now 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.599
 This is quite handy 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.129
 provided I now in this to itself the menu button bridge 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.709
 can not return the way we tick 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.749
 can add this track its playlists so well in the field 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.979
 creating the coldest can use this summer form 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.999
 what I think is awesome bad luck that he only delete fourth Kamenz also at 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.199
 gets on my nerves 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.689
 I certainly would have band music on the murdered often on big 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:12.289
 mobile 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:16.279
 Percent zietlows and then finds quite awful and two weeks shared with man 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.009
 fear another danger of repetition 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.269
 there you have the switch must or repeat 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.029
 do not have to listen again 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.089
 as a call and use 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:27.269
 and that pushes 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.269
 Stand still and it is now the call death has made at the 4-hour race 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.449
 Mixed not so much sense 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.699
 but at least it goes from this place quickly and easily 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.030
 Biometra Switch Alpacas briefly show that is just the current playback of the 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.219
 you come from 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.309
 that's the ideal next to this one 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.419
 Has created lots of playlist and how can you 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.449
 which change a sequence of Callas if you just 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.779
 before that warns the Kos and 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.549
 dry so leads to the player itself 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.269
 Then I want to puke that you can think where you want 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.070
 there is a possibility something 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.149
 play and load presses 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:07.949
 and play the next tracks and here is a man shown 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.179
 what Carla is playing 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.929
 Of course, Sofia can be said to have some standard plans 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.059
 to love for example in defense 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:17.190
 but im taking 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.289
 Percent in the block became explicit 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.889
 asked about the standard IEEE
