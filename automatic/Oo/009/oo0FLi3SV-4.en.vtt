00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.680
 Hi, my name is Yolanda and I'm a dining 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.180
 compulsive since he started showing you 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.190
 what I eat when I'm doing the 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.560
 diet of the points are not lacking 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.690
 comments that tell me this is not 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.940
 healthy that these dietetic cookies do not 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.410
 I know what you could eat much healthier 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.420
 doing I do not know what I know 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.710
 perfectly just clarify or if 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.510
 some video because every time someone 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.539
 answer me I will make a copy paste 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.400
 because I saturate a bit the subject I'm a 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.260
 44 year old woman and I'm raising two 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.850
 children not followed that buys kinder 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.620
 good because he thinks he has a lot of milk 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.230
 valley in fact injected and craig 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.790
 basic food pretty healthy I know 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.970
 perfectly what is a food 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.739
 healthy and what is not worth then 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.989
 when you see me take a gazpacho 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.969
 brick is because I am a woman alone 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.050
 with two children I'm divorced I do not have 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.120
 to anyone who helps me with them 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.040
 He worked a lot and spent a lot of time 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.660
 to them and I can not make a gazpacho 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.399
 home for example, I have to 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.100
 take of brick and that suppose 5 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.510
 minutes or days of rest I assure you 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.320
 that it gives me exactly the same to see me 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.360
 brick 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.250
 as we have said on the page 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.170
 for me three priorities the first one is 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.640
 stop compulsively eating this 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.650
 it's not a diets page it's a page 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.790
 of food addicts my first 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.460
 priority is to control the intake 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.979
 compulsive the second lose weight and the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.240
 third eat healthy and the 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.040
 I will be applying in this order 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.410
 then I already know that many of the menus 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.000
 what are you going to see are annealed 2 or are 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.550
 packaged and could be much more 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.680
 healthy great I know perfectly and you 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.150
 I appreciate the comments very much but they are 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.830
 A bit of the topic of coca today 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.420
 cola zero is good for Crappy 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.979
 I know it's bad but if in a moment 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.960
 I have been for the sweet see me a 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.170
 zero cola glass and drunk a 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.789
 Blessed Coke cocacola is worth and if I 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.350
 I have some snacks that makes 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.210
 these cookies that are sold as 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.860
 Dietetic dietetics have nothing 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.930
 and that what I also want to comment on 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.420
 later because not even effect 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.950
 of points compensate but jolÃ­n I know 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.259
 perfectly what is healthy and not and what 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.450
 I should eat and not eat what I can 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.310
 are or not as something industrial by 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.039
 whim but because I do not have time to 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.420
 prepare it is worth so I thank you 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.800
