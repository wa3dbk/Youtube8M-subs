00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.570
 the wonders how many times it happened to you 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.540
 to wake up in the morning with my eyes 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.340
 swollen glasses and is afraid and not 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.800
 did you know what to do 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.409
 you all know it very well in these cases 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.409
 it is short I know I know it too 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:27.380
 I am always in search of the perennial 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:29.060
 perfect concealer but as I say 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.470
 always if the base 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.690
 in short it is already good and then the make up that 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.000
 we are going to apply surely will 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.560
 in short it will have a better effect and there 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.820
 will give a better result 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:47.020
 now there are so many techniques that 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.430
 most famous certainly is that of the 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.470
 teaspoons you have those present 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.960
 leave in the freezer and set aside 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.820
 really a lot of 90s but I mean it 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.870
 the technique whose principle 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.500
 indeed it is right that is in the sense 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.560
 whereas when we have the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.280
 puffy eyes the best way to 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.740
 to deflate it is to apply something 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.740
 pretty cold on the eyes for 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.659
 go up a bit to decongest e 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.999
 actually deflate the principles of 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.670
 teaspoons is not wrong however it is also 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:24.520
 true that in short it could not be found 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.310
 maybe some other method to 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.090
 safeguard safeguard 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.829
 our cutlery service is there 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.439
 maybe it can serve other purposes 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.729
 so a really simple method 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.750
 very easy I did this morning too 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.299
 because in short, I spent my small hours 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.700
 I found myself with my eyes 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.240
 particularly swollen foresees 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.130
 simply to use cotton e 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.289
 water or other liquids then 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.479
 in short, I will explain you better to do 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.090
 all this I bring you so much 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.959
 around the house with me you will understand 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.539
 because now we have a magic we find ourselves in 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.690
 bathroom to be precise, above all 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:12.819
 sink because why the first thing to 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.819
 to do is take some cotton pads 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.010
 then I will tell you how I did it 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.190
 this morning just woke up before doing 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.370
 whatever I got a diskette of 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:32.359
 cotton and with a pair of scissors are 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.640
 went to cut it in half of course not 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.440
 it is important to be precise if one comes 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.900
 a little bigger with a little smaller 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.820
 nothing is happening 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.280
 at this point now we ask for ours 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.569
 half we simply have to open 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.200
 the water 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.970
 I would put it on a gift already cold and 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.840
 I'm going to wet my discs of 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.620
 cotton with water for having enough 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.620
 a wire 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.150
 and one and two 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.670
 at this point so as to 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.810
 remove the excess I make up mine 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.180
 poor discreet that remained 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.820
 traumatized in the meantime ne 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.660
 I take this opportunity also to give another 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.860
 short squeeze of everything for 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.860
 remove excess water 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.810
 here and now we magically pass into 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.510
 cooks other scene changes 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.780
 once you arrive in the kitchen take 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.200
 then I have a saucer in which 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.830
 position 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.690
 my cotton sketches and I go 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.690
 to insert in the freezer 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.670
 if you want to keep this habit 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.010
 you can also leave every morning 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.620
 every morning you go 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.460
 directly to insert the diskettes of 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.040
 cotton 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.080
 at this point, do all you have to do 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.630
 do your things given in the bathroom and do 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.750
 the velotti shower as an example etc. 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.150
 after only twenty minutes yours 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.580
 diskettes will be ready once 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.260
 passed about 20 minutes but also 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.620
 if they are half an hour it but leave them 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.930
 basically until you did 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.640
 all your things go short a 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.590
 resume from the freezer 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.750
 your saucer and your disks 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.549
 I'll tell you if you like it 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.620
 you want to keep as a habit and the 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.290
 saucer you can also release it in the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.300
 freezer and then every morning 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.370
 you will go to replenish and take 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.130
 only then yours at that point 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.100
 you will have your disks of course 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.990
 they will be frozen 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.540
 quite stiff so first thing 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.030
 you want to sing, in short, to fade a little 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.250
 with your hands so that you 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.380
 soften and meanwhile yes 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.990
 warm up a little even because 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.480
 in short, the one under the eyes anyway 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.510
 very sensitive area and does not do well 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.070
 in short, go and put europe 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.580
 iced directly above her then 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.880
 diluted a little and then 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.870
 reposition yourself right here below 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.220
 feel in contact with the skin for 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.520
 a few minutes 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.380
 the ideal would be until the disks do not 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.660
 they become warm sanchez sky and their own 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.010
 to the touch when they heat up by now 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.280
 in short, they will have exhausted theirs 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.260
 property or in any case if you have very little 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.060
 time try shoots leave them on at least 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:30.370
 two or three minutes I understand that it is not one 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.630
 what we say very comfortable but 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.370
 actually sum also that of 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.290
 teaspoons also not on the market a lot 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.010
 comfortable but I assure you that 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:42.230
 actually there is the effect is really 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.030
 really obvious 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.620
 and then I was much simpler 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.620
 get a better result with the 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.710
 corrector I was telling myself before that 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.170
 if you want you can leave things unhappy 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.240
 your descriptions in fazer for more 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:00.640
 time for what reason I tell you this 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:03.380
 because you can also simply 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.380
 prepare your disks already one 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.230
 only once did you prepare several books 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:14.330
 net with water or with at that point 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:16.370
 you can also dye them in green tea mi 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.790
 I recommend in green tea or even in the 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.930
 chamomile will have an even more effect 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.060
 decongestant of the area and you have it 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.830
 however always ready in the freezer 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.450
 I showed you this method 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.660
 because what I used this morning 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:32.060
 to make you see that there is more money 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.880
 emergency method because in any case 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.460
 twenty minutes are already very ready then 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.590
 you don't have to leave if you don't want things 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.290
 perpetually in the freezer ready if instead 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.540
 you want because it is more comfortable and so the 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.340
 morning go directly without it 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.380
 waste time doing yours 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.050
 treatment you are very free e 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.330
 very free to do so I hope this 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.430
 method you enjoyed I hope he lived 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.140
 useful, in short, many of you 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.960
 they knew it 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.910
 But I really wanted to share it 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.460
 with you so I hope this video 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:08.030
 that I liked that the short trip 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:10.370
