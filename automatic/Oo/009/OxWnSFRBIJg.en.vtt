00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.230 
so when you're actually working on your
other<00:02:04.350> monitor<00:02:04.830> maybe<00:02:05.039> your<00:02:05.220> web<00:02:05.610> browser<00:02:05.940> or

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
other monitor maybe your web browser or

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.790 
other monitor maybe your web browser or
something<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.539> that<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.200> would<00:02:07.380> dial<00:02:07.590> back

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
something like that it would dial back

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.650 
something like that it would dial back
the<00:02:07.860> settings<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.429> your<00:02:08.459> game<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.390> eight

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the settings on your game to like eight

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.650 
the settings on your game to like eight
frames<00:02:10.259> per<00:02:10.649> second<00:02:11.070> Lee<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.940> set<00:02:12.209> here

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
frames per second Lee I have set here

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.290 
frames per second Lee I have set here
and<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.040> would<00:02:14.130> actually<00:02:14.280> allow<00:02:14.880> your

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and so that would actually allow your

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.470 
and so that would actually allow your
period<00:02:15.690> run<00:02:15.870> faster<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.950> king<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.480> merciful

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
to computers that work into it so that's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.120 
to computers that work into it so that's
kind<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.360> purpose<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.320> setting<00:02:22.650> by

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
kind of the purpose of the setting by

kind of the purpose of the setting by
default<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.209> fine<00:02:24.420> for

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
default this is going to be fine for

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.970 
default this is going to be fine for
most<00:02:24.750> people<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.410> won't<00:02:25.590> really<00:02:25.739> have<00:02:25.860> to

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
most people so you won't really have to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.590 
most people so you won't really have to
mess<00:02:26.130> with<00:02:26.280> that

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
mess with that

mess with that
another<00:02:28.410> new<00:02:28.590> feature<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.950> don't<00:02:29.160> recall

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
another new feature I don't recall

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.220 
another new feature I don't recall

and<00:02:31.710> this<00:02:32.250> only<00:02:32.430> applies<00:02:32.880> if<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.210> actually

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
and this only applies if you actually

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.270 
and this only applies if you actually
play<00:02:33.630> them<00:02:33.840> full<00:02:34.080> screen<00:02:34.380> if<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.710> plan<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.010> one

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
play them full screen if you plan to one

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.740 
play them full screen if you plan to one
of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> windowed<00:02:35.730> mode<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.540> gamma

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
of the windowed mode then the gamma

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.380 
of the windowed mode then the gamma
doesn't<00:02:37.170> apply<00:02:37.350> because<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
doesn't apply because this is going to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.450 
doesn't apply because this is going to
use<00:02:39.540> whatever<00:02:39.750> your<00:02:39.990> computer<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.680> set<00:02:40.830> at<00:02:41.010> but

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
use whatever your computer is set at but

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.370 
use whatever your computer is set at but
if<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.640> are<00:02:41.670> playing<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.090> full<00:02:42.360> screen<00:02:42.630> then

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
if you are playing in full screen then

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.500 
if you are playing in full screen then
you<00:02:43.740> can<00:02:43.860> use<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.250> Calabrian<00:02:44.850> gamma<00:02:45.090> button

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
you can use the Calabrian gamma button

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.450 
you can use the Calabrian gamma button
and<00:02:45.720> will<00:02:46.200> actually<00:02:46.500> allow<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:47.160> adjust

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
and will actually allow you to adjust

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.910 
and will actually allow you to adjust
like<00:02:47.910> how<00:02:48.090> bright<00:02:48.930> or<00:02:48.960> dark<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.470> screen<00:02:49.740> is

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
like how bright or dark the screen is

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.640 
like how bright or dark the screen is
I'm<00:02:50.460> not<00:02:50.670> sure<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.150> can<00:02:51.210> tell<00:02:51.660> but<00:02:52.020> there's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
I'm not sure if you can tell but there's

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.250 
I'm not sure if you can tell but there's
actually<00:02:52.770> this<00:02:53.160> really<00:02:53.910> really<00:02:54.090> faint<00:02:54.420> figure

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.490 

calibrating

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
calibrating

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.460 
calibrating
he<00:02:59.740> was<00:02:59.860> actually<00:03:00.070> done<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.730> Alex<00:03:01.000> head<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:02.110> I

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
he was actually done the Alex head so I

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.500 
he was actually done the Alex head so I
can't<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:03.250> really<00:03:03.550> really<00:03:03.670> faint<00:03:03.970> and

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
can't just really really faint and

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.180 
can't just really really faint and
according<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.650> that's<00:03:05.920> what<00:03:06.070> it's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
according to this that's what it's

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.330 
according to this that's what it's
supposed<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.520> be<00:03:06.700> like<00:03:06.880> so<00:03:07.530> his<00:03:08.530> slide<00:03:09.040> this

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
supposed to be like so his slide this

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.170 
supposed to be like so his slide this
and<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.700> can<00:03:09.850> brighten<00:03:10.480> or<00:03:10.660> darken

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and you can brighten or darken

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.580 
and you can brighten or darken
I<00:03:12.239> don't<00:03:12.420> want<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.629> adjust<00:03:12.719> it<00:03:13.049> so<00:03:13.079> i<00:03:13.260> can

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
I don't want to adjust it so i can

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.980 
I don't want to adjust it so i can
cancel<00:03:13.920> but<00:03:14.370> that's<00:03:15.209> what<00:03:15.329> that's<00:03:15.420> for

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
cancel but that's what that's for

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.650 
cancel but that's what that's for
these<00:03:17.590> are<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.800> same<00:03:17.950> options<00:03:18.280> we<00:03:18.340> had<00:03:18.490> before

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
these are the same options we had before

these are the same options we had before
these<00:03:19.660> have<00:03:19.810> not<00:03:19.930> changed<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.970> haven't<00:03:22.690> really

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
these have not changed I haven't really

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.690 
these have not changed I haven't really
mess<00:03:23.500> with<00:03:23.530> these<00:03:23.710> I<00:03:23.890> think<00:03:23.920> by<00:03:24.280> default

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
mess with these I think by default

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.480 
mess with these I think by default
shadows<00:03:25.210> I<00:03:25.360> just<00:03:25.540> took<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.750> medium<00:03:26.170> but

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.270 

actually<00:03:30.490> have<00:03:30.580> your<00:03:30.640> sound<00:03:30.880> options<00:03:32.280> looks

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
actually have your sound options looks

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.840 
actually have your sound options looks
like<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.460> actually<00:03:35.520> individually<00:03:36.520> control

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
like you actually individually control

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.970 
like you actually individually control
each<00:03:37.030> one<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.210> these<00:03:37.330> now<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.930> so<00:03:38.350> right<00:03:38.950> now

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
each one of these now and so right now

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.640 
each one of these now and so right now
they're<00:03:39.250> all<00:03:39.280> at<00:03:39.520> 100<00:03:39.880> which<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.150> fine<00:03:40.300> for<00:03:40.330> me

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
they're all at 100 which is fine for me

sound channels again by default it just
used<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.070> 64<00:03:45.610> I<00:03:45.640> bumped<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.150> 128<00:03:48.420> not

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
used to 64 I bumped it to 128 not

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.510 
used to 64 I bumped it to 128 not
actually<00:03:49.690> adjust<00:03:49.960> that<00:03:50.080> this<00:03:50.290> too<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.860> tend<00:03:51.460> to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
actually adjust that this too I tend to

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.610 
actually adjust that this too I tend to
turn<00:03:52.210> this<00:03:52.390> off<00:03:52.690> because<00:03:52.990> I<00:03:53.200> don't<00:03:53.380> like<00:03:53.470> the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
turn this off because I don't like the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.380 
turn this off because I don't like the
quest<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.070> love<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.430> show<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.730> my<00:03:54.880> chat<00:03:55.150> log

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
quest I love the show of my chat log

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.730 
quest I love the show of my chat log
because<00:03:57.210> it's<00:03:58.210> Pam's<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:59.050> chat<00:03:59.290> log<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.680> it

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
because it's Pam's the chat log and it

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.900 
because it's Pam's the chat log and it
makes<00:03:59.890> it<00:03:59.980> hard<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.280> differentiate<00:04:00.700> that

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
makes it hard to differentiate that

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.930 
makes it hard to differentiate that
between<00:04:01.690> actual<00:04:01.990> player<00:04:02.440> chat<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.370> it's

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
between actual player chat and so it's

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.160 
between actual player chat and so it's
clean<00:04:04.270> here<00:04:04.420> if<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.600> just<00:04:04.630> turn<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.020> off<00:04:05.110> so

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
clean here if I just turn it off so

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.080 
clean here if I just turn it off so
that's<00:04:05.680> actually<00:04:05.830> checked<00:04:06.190> by<00:04:06.310> default<00:04:06.370> but

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
that's actually checked by default but

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.960 
that's actually checked by default but
just<00:04:08.080> uncheck<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:09.670> won't<00:04:09.730> have<00:04:09.910> to

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
just uncheck it and you won't have to

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.730 
just uncheck it and you won't have to
worry<00:04:10.030> about<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.390> quest<00:04:10.870> log<00:04:11.050> being<00:04:11.350> spammed

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
worry about the quest log being spammed

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.570 
worry about the quest log being spammed
in<00:04:11.950> your<00:04:12.130> chat<00:04:12.790> box

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
in your chat box

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.000 
in your chat box
and<00:04:15.360> that's<00:04:15.720> really<00:04:15.810> that's<00:04:16.440> really<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.769> guess

and that's really that's really I guess
as<00:04:17.400> far<00:04:17.610> as<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.239> options<00:04:18.630> go<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:20.150> hasn't

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
as far as the options go and hasn't

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.820 
as far as the options go and hasn't
really<00:04:21.330> changed<00:04:21.390> much<00:04:21.900> since<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.500> previous

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830
