waxwing<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.560> built<00:00:05.279> for<00:00:05.580> subsurface<00:00:06.210> species

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
waxwing is built for subsurface species

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.020 
waxwing is built for subsurface species
we<00:00:07.560> really<00:00:07.770> wanted<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.130> design<00:00:08.730> something

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
we really wanted to design something

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.020 
we really wanted to design something
that<00:00:09.210> gave<00:00:10.170> really<00:00:10.590> erratic<00:00:10.800> action<00:00:11.340> not<00:00:12.000> just

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
that gave really erratic action not just

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.299 
that gave really erratic action not just
your<00:00:12.450> typical<00:00:12.809> lure<00:00:13.349> where<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:13.920> does<00:00:14.070> one

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
your typical lure where it just does one

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.670 
your typical lure where it just does one
thing<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.639> whole<00:00:14.670> time<00:00:15.199> the<00:00:16.199> action<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
thing the whole time the action of the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.920 
thing the whole time the action of the
wax<00:00:16.830> wing<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:18.270> know<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> side-to-side

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
wax wing is a you know a side-to-side

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.870 
wax wing is a you know a side-to-side
motion<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:19.859> depending<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.609> fast

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
motion like this depending on how fast

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.939 
motion like this depending on how fast
you<00:00:21.180> wine<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.630> basically<00:00:22.050> how<00:00:22.140> tight<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
you wine is basically how tight the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.269 
you wine is basically how tight the
wobble<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:24.510> every<00:00:25.019> third<00:00:25.380> or<00:00:25.470> fourth<00:00:25.769> kick

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
wobble is in every third or fourth kick

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.900 
wobble is in every third or fourth kick
it<00:00:26.820> actually<00:00:27.210> darts<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.740> dart<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.310> is

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it actually darts and that dart is is

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.560 
it actually darts and that dart is is
what<00:00:30.240> makes<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> fish<00:00:30.779> react<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> bait

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
what makes the fish react to the bait

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.760 
what makes the fish react to the bait
well<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> design<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> Waxwing<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
well the design of the Waxwing as you

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.700 
well the design of the Waxwing as you
see<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> has<00:00:35.280> two<00:00:35.579> actual<00:00:36.360> wings<00:00:36.710> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
see is it has two actual wings the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.430 
see is it has two actual wings the
bottom<00:00:38.010> wing<00:00:38.160> keeps<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.570> right<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.290> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
bottom wing keeps it up right so it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.920 
bottom wing keeps it up right so it's
swimming<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.910> never<00:00:42.090> falls<00:00:42.329> over

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
swimming like this it never falls over

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.400 
swimming like this it never falls over
and<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.980> top<00:00:44.280> wing<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.840> what<00:00:45.840> makes<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.200> go

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and this top wing is what makes it go

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.310 
and this top wing is what makes it go
side<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> side<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.809> catch<00:00:48.989> an<00:00:49.140> edge

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
side to side and this will catch an edge

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.690 
side to side and this will catch an edge
on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> water<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> shape<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> head

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
on the water with the shape of the head

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.250 
on the water with the shape of the head
and<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.239> gives<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.600> jerk

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
and that's what gives it that jerk

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.869 
and that's what gives it that jerk
started<00:00:55.260> off<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.590> attention<00:00:56.309> calico<00:00:56.730> bass

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
started off with attention calico bass

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the wax we're on the last one yet the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
the wax we're on the last one yet the
best<00:01:27.210> part<00:01:27.450> about<00:01:27.540> waxwing<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> ease

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
best part about waxwing is the ease

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
best part about waxwing is the ease
abuse<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.549> straight<00:01:29.790> tight<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> bait

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
abuse it's a straight tight to the bait

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
abuse it's a straight tight to the bait
and<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:31.259> you're<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:31.439> doing<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:32.100> making<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
and all you're really doing is making a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
and all you're really doing is making a
cast<00:01:32.820> put<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> reeling<00:01:34.079> gear<00:01:34.409> there's<00:01:35.070> no

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
cast put the reeling gear there's no

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.819 
cast put the reeling gear there's no
need<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.720> jerk<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> rod<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.500> give<00:01:37.650> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
need to you know jerk the rod or give it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.039 
need to you know jerk the rod or give it
any<00:01:38.070> motion<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:39.000> start<00:01:39.210> turning<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> handle

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
any motion just start turning the handle

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.639 
any motion just start turning the handle
and<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> do<00:01:41.130> its<00:01:41.280> thing<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:43.439> wax

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and it's going to do its thing the wax

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.550 
and it's going to do its thing the wax
wing<00:01:43.860> has<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> hydrodynamic<00:01:44.939> head<00:01:45.560> weighted

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
wing has a hydrodynamic head weighted

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.139 
wing has a hydrodynamic head weighted
perfectly<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.250> when<00:01:47.520> you're<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.700> any<00:01:47.820> windy

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
perfectly so when you're in any windy

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.330 
perfectly so when you're in any windy
conditions<00:01:48.750> either<00:01:49.409> casting<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> wind

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
conditions either casting with the wind

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.490 
conditions either casting with the wind
or<00:01:50.460> against<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> wind<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> dark<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
or against the wind it's like a dark you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.560 
or against the wind it's like a dark you
know<00:01:52.619> shoots<00:01:52.920> right<00:01:53.159> through<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.570> through

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
know shoots right through it through

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.999 
know shoots right through it through
construction<00:01:54.990> wire<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.590> case<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.920> get

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
construction wire just case you get
