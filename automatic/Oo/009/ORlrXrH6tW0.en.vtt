00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
as well I thought I thought about doing

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.609 
as well I thought I thought about doing
the<00:01:25.799> glock<00:01:26.009> 30<00:01:26.340> too<00:01:26.670> big<00:01:26.880> even<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.810> glock<00:01:28.380> says

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the glock 30 too big even the glock says

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.859 
the glock 30 too big even the glock says
it's<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> subcompact<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.060> i<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.540> don't

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it's a subcompact it's not i just don't

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's a subcompact it's not i just don't
see<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.729> holding<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
see it and it's like holding a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.120 
see it and it's like holding a
two-by-four<00:01:33.479> all<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
two-by-four all right I like the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.819 
two-by-four all right I like the
capacity<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.320> wouldn<00:01:37.320> t<00:01:37.380> able<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> put<00:01:37.740> away

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
capacity but I wouldn t able to put away

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.219 
capacity but I wouldn t able to put away
on<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.189> frame<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:39.420> where<00:01:39.540> people<00:01:39.689> wouldn't<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
on my frame to where people wouldn't be

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
on my frame to where people wouldn't be
looking<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.590> me<00:01:40.680> funny<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.100> thought<00:01:41.880> about<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
looking at me funny I thought about the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.020 
looking at me funny I thought about the
glock<00:01:42.570> 36<00:01:43.229> which<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> single<00:01:44.610> stack<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
glock 36 which is the single stack I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.420 
glock 36 which is the single stack I
love<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> thinness<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.740> great<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
love the thinness of it it's great the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.240 
love the thinness of it it's great the
problem<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.600> way<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.140> couldn't<00:01:49.590> find<00:01:49.860> I

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
problem was this way I couldn't find I

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.399 
problem was this way I couldn't find I
could<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.939> couldn't<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.509> myself<00:01:51.689> being<00:01:52.079> able

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
could I couldn't see myself being able

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.100 
could I couldn't see myself being able
to<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:53.250> very<00:01:53.610> effective<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.360> concealing<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to be very effective in concealing it

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.370 
to be very effective in concealing it
this<00:01:55.229> way<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.250> i<00:01:56.280> settled<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> glock<00:01:57.210> 39<00:01:57.719> i

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
this way so i settled on the glock 39 i

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.109 
this way so i settled on the glock 39 i
reload<00:01:59.219> which<00:01:59.969> helps<00:02:00.390> me<00:02:01.340> helps<00:02:02.340> insulate<00:02:02.820> me

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
reload which helps me helps insulate me

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.780

from<00:02:03.450> some<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.310> availability<00:02:05.310> challenges

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
from some of the availability challenges

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.330 
from some of the availability challenges
that<00:02:05.909> i<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> glock<00:02:06.659> 39<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.439> 45<00:02:08.069> gap

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that i have for the glock 39 in 45 gap

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.880 
that i have for the glock 39 in 45 gap
which<00:02:08.879> are<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.300> there's<00:02:09.539> no<00:02:09.660> doubt

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
which are out there there's no doubt

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.870 
which are out there there's no doubt
hopefully<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.550> 45<00:02:11.940> gap<00:02:12.209> comes<00:02:12.480> around

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
hopefully the 45 gap comes around

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.660 
hopefully the 45 gap comes around
becomes<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.330> little<00:02:13.480> more<00:02:13.570> mainstream<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:15.370> at

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
becomes a little more mainstream but at

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.610 
becomes a little more mainstream but at
least<00:02:15.880> I've<00:02:16.150> got<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.360> lot<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.690> shelves<00:02:17.140> for<00:02:17.350> and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
least I've got a lot of shelves for and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.280 
least I've got a lot of shelves for and
a<00:02:17.980> lot<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.340> brass<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.360> can<00:02:19.540> run<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.050> 30

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
a lot of brass and I can run to and 30

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.720 
a lot of brass and I can run to and 30
grains<00:02:20.530> through<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.070> fine<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.580> can

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
grains through it just fine and I can

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.420 
grains through it just fine and I can
get<00:02:21.820> those<00:02:21.910> anywhere<00:02:22.240> all<00:02:23.140> right<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.220> live

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
get those anywhere all right and I live

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.800 
get those anywhere all right and I live
with<00:02:26.190> powders<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.370> used<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:27.760> 45<00:02:28.240> back<00:02:28.690> in

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
with powders that I used for 45 back in

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.250 
with powders that I used for 45 back in
the<00:02:28.900> 45<00:02:29.200> ACP<00:02:29.650> days<00:02:29.830> when<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.610> had<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.050> anyway<00:02:32.050> so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the 45 ACP days when I had it anyway so

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.560 
the 45 ACP days when I had it anyway so
why<00:02:32.770> don't<00:02:32.950> compare<00:02:33.310> both<00:02:33.820> of<00:02:34.030> these<00:02:34.150> we're

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
why don't compare both of these we're

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.940 
why don't compare both of these we're
clear<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:39.600> wanted<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.660> compare<00:02:41.050> some<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
clear I wanted to compare some of the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.250 
clear I wanted to compare some of the

you<00:03:10.360> hold<00:03:10.570> both<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.780> them<00:03:11.050> they're<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.770> same

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
you hold both of them they're the same

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.840 
you hold both of them they're the same
all<00:03:12.550> right<00:03:12.700> 19<00:03:13.500> at<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.560> same<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> glock<00:03:15.370> 27

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
all right 19 at the same of the glock 27

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.140 
all right 19 at the same of the glock 27
as<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:17.050> know<00:03:17.200> they're<00:03:17.710> all<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.100> same<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:19.000> that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
as you know they're all the same so that

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.820 
as you know they're all the same so that
was<00:03:19.270> an<00:03:19.450> important<00:03:21.780> issue<00:03:22.780> because<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.560> wanted

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
was an important issue because I wanted

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.650 
was an important issue because I wanted
them<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.670> be<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.880> same<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.210> I<00:03:25.240> you<00:03:25.360> don't<00:03:25.570> have

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
them to be the same so I you don't have

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.040 
them to be the same so I you don't have
to<00:03:25.780> buy<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.960> thousand<00:03:26.530> different<00:03:28.050> multiple

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
to buy a thousand different multiple

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.470 
to buy a thousand different multiple
different<00:03:29.200> holsters<00:03:29.950> all<00:03:30.340> right<00:03:30.490> one<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.420> the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
different holsters all right one of the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.970 
different holsters all right one of the
things<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.260> will<00:03:32.530> point<00:03:32.740> out

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
things that I that I will point out

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.400 
things that I that I will point out
though<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.460> it<00:03:33.640> may<00:03:33.760> become<00:03:33.910> obvious<00:03:34.690> here<00:03:35.260> is

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
though and it may become obvious here is

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.820 
though and it may become obvious here is
that<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:36.220> frame<00:03:36.580> of<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.090> glock<00:03:37.780> 39<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.500> wider

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
that the frame of the glock 39 is wider

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.420 
that the frame of the glock 39 is wider
than<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.280> glock<00:03:39.490> 27<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:41.440> 26<00:03:41.950> which<00:03:42.130> are

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
than the glock 27 and the 26 which are

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
than the glock 27 and the 26 which are
probably<00:03:42.730> identical<00:03:43.300> all<00:03:43.720> right<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.590> wider

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
probably identical all right it is wider

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.610 
probably identical all right it is wider
so<00:03:46.450> i<00:03:46.480> have<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:47.110> bit<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.800> challenge<00:03:48.480> in<00:03:49.480> my<00:03:49.840> one

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
so i have a bit of a challenge in my one

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.490 
so i have a bit of a challenge in my one
of<00:03:50.650> my<00:03:50.740> holsters<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:52.780> won't<00:03:53.050> it<00:03:53.380> won't<00:03:53.440> accept

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
of my holsters it won't it won't accept

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.650 
of my holsters it won't it won't accept
things<00:03:56.500> in<00:03:56.620> that<00:03:56.740> it<00:03:57.730> won't<00:03:58.000> accept<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.480> glock

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
things in that it won't accept the glock

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.380 
things in that it won't accept the glock
39<00:03:59.020> is<00:03:59.110> just<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.350> hair<00:03:59.620> too<00:03:59.890> thick<00:04:00.160> but<00:04:00.970> that's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
39 is just a hair too thick but that's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.380 
39 is just a hair too thick but that's
just<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.690> one<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.870> my<00:04:02.020> posters<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.620> other<00:04:02.800> ones

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
just in one of my posters the other ones

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.510 
just in one of my posters the other ones
i'm<00:04:04.390> able<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.780> they're<00:04:05.650> compatible<00:04:05.950> either

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
i'm able to they're compatible either

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.240 
i'm able to they're compatible either
way<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.850> doesn't<00:04:06.880> matter<00:04:07.470> all<00:04:08.470> right<00:04:08.650> the

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
way it doesn't matter all right the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.330 
way it doesn't matter all right the
recoil<00:04:09.760> on<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.030> glock<00:04:10.240> 39<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:11.050> more<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.130> push

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
recoil on the glock 39 is more of a push

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.790 
recoil on the glock 39 is more of a push
it's<00:04:13.060> more<00:04:13.300> of<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.480> splat<00:04:13.840> splat<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.500> mean<00:04:14.650> it's

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
it's more of a splat splat I mean it's

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.449 
it's more of a splat splat I mean it's
doubt<00:04:15.040> all<00:04:15.610> right<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.739> pushes<00:04:18.010> really

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
doubt all right and it pushes really

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.230 
doubt all right and it pushes really
really<00:04:18.730> hard<00:04:18.910> but<00:04:19.390> it's<00:04:19.810> more<00:04:20.020> of<00:04:20.170> a<00:04:20.260> push<00:04:21.240> as

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
really hard but it's more of a push as

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.770 
really hard but it's more of a push as
opposed<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.750> my<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.260> glock<00:04:23.860> 27<00:04:24.400> which

Wesson is if it just jumps in your hand

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.080 
Wesson is if it just jumps in your hand
and<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.430> really<00:04:30.880> got<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.120> hold<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:31.480> to<00:04:32.170> keep<00:04:32.380> it

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
and you really got to hold on to keep it

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.490 
and you really got to hold on to keep it
keep<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.210> under<00:04:34.419> control<00:04:34.570> maybe<00:04:35.320> I'm

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
keep it under control maybe I'm

keep it under control maybe I'm
exaggerating<00:04:35.620> just<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.370> little<00:04:36.400> bit<00:04:36.730> but

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
exaggerating just a little bit but

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.820 
exaggerating just a little bit but
there's<00:04:37.690> no<00:04:37.870> doubt<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.139> it<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.530> night<00:04:38.800> and

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
there's no doubt that it is night and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.240 
there's no doubt that it is night and
day<00:04:39.010> they<00:04:40.000> both<00:04:40.270> I<00:04:40.570> don't<00:04:41.200> know<00:04:41.290> energy<00:04:42.040> wise

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
day they both I don't know energy wise

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.350 
day they both I don't know energy wise
or<00:04:43.139> what<00:04:44.139> I<00:04:44.169> feel<00:04:44.650> probably<00:04:45.250> have<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.520> same

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
or what I feel probably have the same

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.750 
or what I feel probably have the same
amount<00:04:46.630> of<00:04:46.840> recoil<00:04:47.020> roughly<00:04:47.680> it's<00:04:48.160> just<00:04:48.400> for

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
amount of recoil roughly it's just for

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.129 
amount of recoil roughly it's just for
some<00:04:48.940> reason<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.330> recoil<00:04:49.690> seems<00:04:49.960> to<00:04:50.050> be

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
some reason the recoil seems to be

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.980 
some reason the recoil seems to be
spread<00:04:50.560> out<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.980> little<00:04:51.250> over<00:04:51.790> a<00:04:51.970> more<00:04:52.660> period

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
spread out a little over a more period

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.430 
spread out a little over a more period
of<00:04:53.080> time<00:04:53.260> with<00:04:53.500> this<00:04:53.680> as<00:04:54.450> opposed<00:04:55.450> to<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.930> the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
40 all right that's one of the

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.240 
40 all right that's one of the
differences<00:04:58.750> at<00:04:59.169> all<00:04:59.290> that<00:04:59.650> I'll<00:04:59.770> say<00:04:59.950> as<00:05:00.070> well

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
differences at all that I'll say as well

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.250 
differences at all that I'll say as well
that<00:05:01.000> has<00:05:01.180> nothing<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.480> do<00:05:01.630> with<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.900> chassis

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
that has nothing to do with the chassis

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.370 
that has nothing to do with the chassis
itself<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.830> that's<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.340> round<00:05:03.580> itself<00:05:04.380> I

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
one of the things that I will point out

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.100 
one of the things that I will point out
also<00:05:34.030> is<00:05:34.650> that<00:05:35.650> this<00:05:35.919> is<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.669> 45<00:05:37.120> ACP<00:05:37.840> I<00:05:37.870> don't

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
also is that this is the 45 ACP I don't

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.020 
also is that this is the 45 ACP I don't
have<00:05:38.229> any<00:05:38.380> weapons<00:05:38.560> for<00:05:39.100> it<00:05:39.190> anymore<00:05:39.370> all

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
have any weapons for it anymore all

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.840 
have any weapons for it anymore all
right<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:41.140> I<00:05:41.229> can't<00:05:41.500> really<00:05:41.680> I've<00:05:42.610> got<00:05:42.820> a

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
right and I can't really I've got a

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.450 
right and I can't really I've got a

all<00:05:46.060> right<00:05:46.180> but<00:05:46.270> that's<00:05:46.360> a<00:05:46.539> 45<00:05:46.960> ACP<00:05:48.000> this<00:05:49.000> is

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
all right but that's a 45 ACP this is

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.600 
all right but that's a 45 ACP this is
the<00:05:49.300> 45<00:05:49.750> gap<00:05:51.150> alright<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.300> overall<00:05:52.750> length<00:05:53.020> is

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
the 45 gap alright the overall length is

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.600 
the 45 gap alright the overall length is
significantly<00:05:55.080> shorter<00:05:56.130> which<00:05:57.130> allows<00:05:57.370> it<00:05:57.580> to

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
significantly shorter which allows it to

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.960 
significantly shorter which allows it to

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.200 
depending on who's making it all right
both<00:06:20.289> got<00:06:20.530> the<00:06:20.650> same<00:06:20.710> amount<00:06:21.100> of<00:06:21.160> recoil<00:06:21.340> but

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
both got the same amount of recoil but

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.350 
both got the same amount of recoil but
more<00:06:22.510> importantly<00:06:23.580> is<00:06:24.580> the<00:06:24.640> stopping<00:06:25.210> power

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
more importantly is the stopping power

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.690 
more importantly is the stopping power
the<00:06:25.570> 45<00:06:26.020> and<00:06:26.350> the<00:06:27.070> reason<00:06:27.340> that<00:06:27.370> it's<00:06:27.550> been

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
the 45 and the reason that it's been

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.400 
the 45 and the reason that it's been
around<00:06:27.880> for<00:06:28.090> a<00:06:28.120> hundred<00:06:28.180> years<00:06:28.419> probably

around for a hundred years probably

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.680 
around for a hundred years probably
because<00:06:29.590> it's<00:06:29.740> killed<00:06:30.220> more<00:06:30.479> people<00:06:31.479> than

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
because it's killed more people than

because it's killed more people than
