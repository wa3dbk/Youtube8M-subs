I got signed um so like I said it was an

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.410

hour<00:05:10.990> delay<00:05:11.380> because<00:05:11.820> Chris<00:05:12.820> Jericho<00:05:13.150> was<00:05:13.270> not

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
hour delay because Chris Jericho was not

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.000 
hour delay because Chris Jericho was not
there<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:13.750> a<00:05:13.780> lot<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:13.990> people<00:05:14.230> get<00:05:14.350> a<00:05:14.410> patient

there so a lot of people get a patient

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.580 
there so a lot of people get a patient
um<00:05:15.160> so<00:05:16.150> when<00:05:16.510> he<00:05:16.570> did<00:05:16.780> calm<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.290> was<00:05:17.380> kind<00:05:17.500> of

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
um so when he did calm it was kind of

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.080 
um so when he did calm it was kind of
like<00:05:17.680> we<00:05:17.890> were<00:05:18.010> being<00:05:18.160> rushed<00:05:18.520> a<00:05:18.730> little<00:05:18.970> bit

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
like we were being rushed a little bit

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.340 
like we were being rushed a little bit
but<00:05:19.720> um<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.920> know<00:05:21.010> it's<00:05:21.160> probably<00:05:21.400> because<00:05:22.350> he

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
but um you know it's probably because he

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.820 
but um you know it's probably because he
has<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.530> show<00:05:24.040> and<00:05:24.370> nork<00:05:25.000> at<00:05:25.650> seven-thirty<00:05:26.650> and

has to be there early so it's

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.180

understandable<00:05:28.630> but<00:05:29.260> it's<00:05:29.440> his<00:05:29.590> fault<00:05:29.860> for

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190
