the<00:00:10.980> series<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.940> meeting<00:00:12.179> might<00:00:12.360> even<00:00:12.570> be

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the series my meeting might even be

the series my meeting might even be
twins<00:00:12.960> they<00:00:13.650> look<00:00:13.830> exactly<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.400> same<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.940> be

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
twins they look exactly the same to be

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
twins they look exactly the same to be
honest<00:00:15.269> except<00:00:15.960> she's<00:00:16.260> blue<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:16.770> kind<00:00:17.220> of

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
honest except she's blue I just kind of

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.640 
honest except she's blue I just kind of
a<00:00:17.340> different<00:00:17.609> weapon<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:19.260> terms<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
a different weapon but in terms of a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.250 
a different weapon but in terms of a
person<00:00:20.010> they<00:00:20.279> look<00:00:20.460> pretty<00:00:20.760> much<00:00:20.880> identical

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
person they look pretty much identical

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.390 
person they look pretty much identical
but<00:00:22.260> anyways<00:00:22.560> getting<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> figure<00:00:23.160> itself

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
but anyways getting to the figure itself

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.920 
but anyways getting to the figure itself
so<00:00:24.060> again<00:00:25.050> very<00:00:25.260> similar<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.010> maximum<00:00:26.369> feel

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
so again very similar to maximum feel

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.689 
so again very similar to maximum feel
except<00:00:27.930> she's<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> queen<00:00:28.650> ice<00:00:28.890> or<00:00:29.160> cold<00:00:29.519> ice

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
except she's the queen ice or cold ice

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.089 
except she's the queen ice or cold ice
what<00:00:29.910> everyone<00:00:30.210> would<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.769> good<00:00:31.769> zoom<00:00:31.949> in

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
what everyone would think good zoom in

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.319 
what everyone would think good zoom in
will<00:00:32.219> quick<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> again<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:35.610> simple<00:00:36.090> clean

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
will quick so again very simple clean

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.500 
will quick so again very simple clean
scope<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.940> yeah<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> whole

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
scope and yeah I just like the whole

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
scope and yeah I just like the whole
line<00:00:39.930> from<00:00:40.200> Kotobuki<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.219> terms<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.550> their

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
line from Kotobuki in terms of their

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.470 
line from Kotobuki in terms of their
shining<00:00:41.969> series

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
shining series

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840 
shining series
I<00:00:42.510> guess<00:00:43.500> she<00:00:43.620> also<00:00:43.739> has<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.040> similar<00:00:44.460> card

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
I guess she also has a similar card

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.350 
I guess she also has a similar card
except<00:00:45.629> hers<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.140> blue<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:47.730> accommodate<00:00:48.180> her

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
except hers is blue to accommodate her

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.330 
except hers is blue to accommodate her
whole<00:00:48.539> color<00:00:48.809> scheme<00:00:49.550> but<00:00:51.289> overall<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:53.129> scope

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
whole color scheme but overall the scope

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.900 
whole color scheme but overall the scope
is<00:00:53.489> very<00:00:53.610> clean<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> simple<00:00:55.520> as<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.699> consider

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
is very clean and simple as you consider

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.729 
is very clean and simple as you consider
she's<00:00:57.600> also<00:00:57.750> pretty<00:00:58.020> assembled<00:00:58.500> onto<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
she's also pretty assembled onto the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.830 
she's also pretty assembled onto the
base<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.370> she's<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.090> anywhere<00:01:02.840> so

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
base so she's not going anywhere so

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.060 
base so she's not going anywhere so
let's<00:01:04.110> turn<00:01:04.229> her<00:01:04.350> around<00:01:04.439> real<00:01:04.680> quick<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
let's turn her around real quick and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.020 
let's turn her around real quick and
take<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> quick<00:01:05.610> look<00:01:05.640> behind<00:01:07.790> though<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.820> do

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
take a quick look behind though I do

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
take a quick look behind though I do
think<00:01:09.439> Maxima<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.590> fills<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.950> little

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
think Maxima and fills that little

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
think Maxima and fills that little
cleaner<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.790> terms<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.090> scope<00:01:12.270> design<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
cleaner in terms of scope design the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.149 
cleaner in terms of scope design the
details<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.670> her<00:01:14.970> dress<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.680> some<00:01:16.680> parts<00:01:17.040> are

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
details on her dress and some parts are

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.580 
details on her dress and some parts are
a<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> big<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.439> deal

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a little off it's not that big of a deal

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.740 
a little off it's not that big of a deal
or<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> deal-breaker<00:01:20.960> let<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.350> could

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
or a deal-breaker let me see if I could

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.570 
or a deal-breaker let me see if I could
find<00:01:24.750> something<00:01:25.790> let's<00:01:26.790> check<00:01:27.000> over<00:01:27.090> here

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.980 

mmm<00:01:30.510> you<00:01:30.690> see<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.960> could<00:01:31.110> focus<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.470> I

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
mmm you see if I could focus here I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.200 
mmm you see if I could focus here I
don't<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:35.190> know<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.580> take<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.060> bag

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
don't know you know what I take the bag

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.000 
don't know you know what I take the bag
it's<00:01:36.420> pretty<00:01:36.630> much<00:01:36.690> simple<00:01:37.260> and<00:01:37.380> clean<00:01:37.560> just

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
it's pretty much simple and clean just

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.690 
it's pretty much simple and clean just
exactly<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.430> next<00:01:38.730> man<00:01:38.850> chill<00:01:39.950> but<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.160> do<00:01:41.310> think

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
exactly as next man chill but I do think

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.640 
exactly as next man chill but I do think
her<00:01:41.880> weapon<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> much<00:01:42.630> cooler<00:01:42.900> than<00:01:43.140> Maxum<00:01:43.380> man

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
her weapon is much cooler than Maxum man

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
her weapon is much cooler than Maxum man
feel<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:45.000> let's<00:01:45.750> take<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.900> look<00:01:46.050> at<00:01:46.110> her<00:01:46.370> staff

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
feel so let's take a look at her staff

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.810 
feel so let's take a look at her staff
very<00:01:48.030> cool<00:01:48.980> ganz<00:01:49.980> really<00:01:50.220> simple<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.610> dives

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
very cool ganz really simple just dives

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.820 
very cool ganz really simple just dives
into<00:01:50.970> her<00:01:51.120> hand<00:01:51.330> as<00:01:52.070> expected<00:01:53.070> from<00:01:53.250> Kotobuki

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
into her hand as expected from Kotobuki

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.899 
into her hand as expected from Kotobuki
and<00:01:55.830> then<00:01:56.220> it's<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> camera

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.289 

there<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.540> go<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.640> pretty<00:02:02.820> cool

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
there you go so it's pretty cool

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.319 
there you go so it's pretty cool
fits<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> whole<00:02:04.259> theme<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:06.030> kinda<00:02:06.240> has

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
fits with the whole theme and kinda has

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.540 
fits with the whole theme and kinda has
that<00:02:06.360> silver<00:02:06.990> metal<00:02:07.259> finish<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
that silver metal finish on to the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.520 
that silver metal finish on to the
handle<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.229> there<00:02:12.349> so<00:02:13.349> both

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
handle as you can see there so both

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.839 
handle as you can see there so both
figures<00:02:13.950> are<00:02:14.099> really<00:02:14.190> similar<00:02:14.489> with<00:02:14.760> each

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
figures are really similar with each

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.680 
figures are really similar with each
other<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:17.000> that's<00:02:18.000> not<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.150> bad<00:02:18.360> thing<00:02:18.390> at<00:02:18.599> all

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
other and that's not a bad thing at all

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.320
