00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.009
 stereotypes that revolves around the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.310
 swiss the three typical stereotypes 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.960

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.330
 characteristic of Switzerland to no 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.990

 now three features for 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:57.050
 to recognize a Swiss is without paying 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.320
 already one the size or his country and the 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.260
 Swiss 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:05.420

 imagine the frustration of the inhabitants of the 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.660
 liechtenstein our direct neighbor 1 we have 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.590
 tend to forget him so much that he is 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.300
 little yes it's a Swiss who says that the 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.370
 second problem we have in Switzerland to 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.000
 the problem of size is the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.420
 languages 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.190

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.459
 france germany austria and 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.950

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.420

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.980

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.480

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.949
 characteristic of our country this is the
