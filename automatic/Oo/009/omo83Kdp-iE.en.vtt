something about those games the games

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
something about those games the games
were<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.070> close<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.640> expected<00:01:00.210> two<00:01:00.330> games<00:01:00.540> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
were not close the expected two games to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.259 
were not close the expected two games to
be<00:01:00.900> a<00:01:00.930> lot<00:01:01.140> closer<00:01:01.760> we<00:01:02.760> were<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.120> prepared

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
be a lot closer we were well prepared

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.359 
be a lot closer we were well prepared
and<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.110> talked<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.559> lot<00:01:04.710> before<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> match

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and we talked a lot before the match

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.550 
and we talked a lot before the match
what<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.660> think<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.380> figured

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
what we can do and I think we figured

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.140 
what we can do and I think we figured
out<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> best<00:01:08.130> way<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> beat<00:01:08.910> them

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
out the best way how to beat them

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.870 
out the best way how to beat them
because<00:01:09.660> they<00:01:10.080> didn't<00:01:10.380> expect<00:01:10.800> us<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> put<00:01:11.580> two

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
because they didn't expect us to put two

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.029 
because they didn't expect us to put two
meant<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.270> example<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.950> our

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
meant for example and then the our

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.920 
meant for example and then the our
compositions<00:01:14.789> were<00:01:15.000> involved<00:01:15.720> games

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
compositions were involved games

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.910 
compositions were involved games
superior<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.130> theirs<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.530> they<00:01:19.530> went<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
superior to theirs so they went for a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560 
superior to theirs so they went for a
lot<00:01:20.039> of<00:01:20.160> single<00:01:20.369> target<00:01:20.789> damage<00:01:20.910> we<00:01:21.300> spread

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
lot of single target damage we spread

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
lot of single target damage we spread
out<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> between<00:01:22.289> channel<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.280> counter<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
out and between channel to counter that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.680 
out and between channel to counter that
and<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> was<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.289> was<00:01:25.350> perfect<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.340> pretty<00:01:27.240> of
