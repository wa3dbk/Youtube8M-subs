 consequently each sector 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.780
 but these monthly meetings and that passes this motivation to the collaborator 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:39.189

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.819
 Anatel is doing this, wants to see it. 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.630

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.730
 if at least the sertanejo is sensitive to the new motivations, 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.680
