they<00:04:27.850> have<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.180> range<00:04:28.420> they<00:04:28.720> have<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:28.960> punch

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
they have the range they have to punch

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.820 
they have the range they have to punch
longbow<00:04:30.190> is<00:04:30.220> fine<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:31.170> just<00:04:32.170> need<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.410> redo<00:04:32.710> the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
longbow is fine to just need to redo the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.450 
longbow is fine to just need to redo the
malleus<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:35.380> have<00:04:35.500> five<00:04:35.860> your<00:04:36.220> pulse

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
malleus and I have five your pulse

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.870 
malleus and I have five your pulse
lasers<00:04:36.790> at<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:36.910> moment<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.390> see<00:04:38.700> they<00:04:39.700> can

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
lasers at the moment I see they can

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.970 
lasers at the moment I see they can
carry<00:04:40.120> heavy<00:04:40.300> large<00:04:41.230> lasers<00:04:46.440> they<00:04:47.440> don't<00:04:47.620> need

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
carry heavy large lasers they don't need

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.460 
carry heavy large lasers they don't need
all<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.430> heat<00:04:48.460> sinks<00:04:48.910> then<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:50.020> can<00:04:50.170> carry<00:04:50.380> a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
all the heat sinks then you can carry a

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.960 
all the heat sinks then you can carry a
big<00:04:50.620> electric<00:04:50.980> rope<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.400> some<00:04:51.490> miss<00:04:51.760> house

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
big electric rope and some miss house

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.480 
big electric rope and some miss house
that<00:04:52.390> should<00:04:52.980> trigger<00:04:55.590> yep<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.980> it's<00:04:57.160> smaller

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
that should trigger yep and it's smaller

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:05.670 
that should trigger yep and it's smaller
number<00:04:57.940> one<00:04:59.490> number<00:05:00.490> two<00:05:02.820> strip<00:05:04.470> seven<00:05:05.470> pulse

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
number one number two strip seven pulse

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.020 
number one number two strip seven pulse
lasers<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.160> wonder<00:05:06.430> how<00:05:06.520> many<00:05:06.760> I<00:05:06.850> can<00:05:07.060> fit

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
lasers I wonder how many I can fit

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.620 
lasers I wonder how many I can fit
eventually<00:05:10.030> on<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.690> Daiichi<00:05:12.090> yeah<00:05:13.090> it's

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
eventually on the Daiichi yeah it's

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.030 
eventually on the Daiichi yeah it's
gonna<00:05:13.750> be<00:05:13.930> really<00:05:14.110> op<00:05:14.350> mech<00:05:14.560> but<00:05:14.710> I'm<00:05:14.860> gonna

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
gonna be really op mech but I'm gonna

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.950 
gonna be really op mech but I'm gonna
try<00:05:15.280> and<00:05:15.520> put<00:05:16.210> my<00:05:16.360> feet<00:05:16.570> in<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:16.810> water<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:18.960> try

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
try and put my feet in the water and try

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.630 
try and put my feet in the water and try
it<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.320> keep<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:20.680> heat<00:05:20.890> in<00:05:21.040> check<00:05:21.280> but<00:05:21.490> it's

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
it to keep the heat in check but it's

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.700 
it to keep the heat in check but it's
it's<00:05:22.240> gonna<00:05:22.450> be<00:05:22.750> a<00:05:22.780> really<00:05:23.200> strange

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
it's gonna be a really strange

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.909 
it's gonna be a really strange
configuration<00:05:25.140> let's<00:05:26.140> see

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.260 

also<00:05:29.919> take<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:30.250> big<00:05:30.430> light<00:05:30.640> probe<00:05:31.000> for<00:05:31.210> the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
also take the big light probe for the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.950 
also take the big light probe for the
missiles<00:05:31.660> and

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.540 

probably<00:05:35.960> could<00:05:36.140> buy<00:05:36.320> some<00:05:36.620> er<00:05:36.920> locks<00:05:37.130> lasers

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
probably could buy some er locks lasers

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.000 
probably could buy some er locks lasers
if<00:05:37.670> there<00:05:37.820> are<00:05:37.940> some<00:05:38.060> on<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.210> market

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
if there are some on the market

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.290 
if there are some on the market
it's<00:05:40.010> decent<00:05:40.250> for<00:05:40.550> this<00:05:40.670> mission<00:05:40.820> out<00:05:41.120> there

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
it's decent for this mission out there

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:51.670 
it's decent for this mission out there
plenty<00:05:41.510> I'll<00:05:41.990> take<00:05:42.370> six<00:05:44.830> I'll<00:05:45.830> take<00:05:46.130> six<00:05:50.680> how

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
plenty I'll take six I'll take six how

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.260 
plenty I'll take six I'll take six how
the<00:05:51.740> number<00:05:52.100> two<00:05:53.380> it's<00:05:54.380> still<00:05:54.590> in<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:54.830> skin<00:05:55.270> so

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
the number two it's still in the skin so

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.370 
the number two it's still in the skin so
Tasha<00:05:56.690> teres<00:05:57.080> requested<00:05:58.840> one<00:05:59.840> really<00:06:00.170> we

six pulse lasers tiny heatsink since you

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.830 
six pulse lasers tiny heatsink since you
can't<00:06:41.780> see<00:06:42.050> it<00:06:42.890> really<00:06:43.130> doesn't<00:06:43.490> matter<00:06:46.840> but

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
can't see it really doesn't matter but

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.870 
can't see it really doesn't matter but
it's<00:06:48.500> the<00:06:48.680> best<00:06:48.830> I<00:06:49.010> can<00:06:49.070> think<00:06:49.370> of<00:06:49.580> with<00:06:49.760> the

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
it's the best I can think of with the

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.520 
it's the best I can think of with the
weapons<00:06:50.180> I<00:06:50.300> have<00:06:50.330> I<00:06:50.630> wish<00:06:50.810> I<00:06:50.900> had<00:06:51.020> like<00:06:51.230> a<00:06:51.290> bunch

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
weapons I have I wish I had like a bunch

of<00:06:51.740> clan<00:06:52.370> Gauss<00:06:52.640> rifles<00:06:53.470> would<00:06:54.470> make<00:06:54.650> this<00:06:54.800> a

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
of clan Gauss rifles would make this a

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.030 
of clan Gauss rifles would make this a
lot<00:06:55.070> easier<00:06:55.960> but<00:06:56.960> still<00:06:57.140> hard<00:06:57.530> this<00:06:57.710> mission

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
lot easier but still hard this mission

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.670 
lot easier but still hard this mission
is<00:06:58.190> very<00:06:58.580> hard

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.110 

let's<00:07:03.220> see<00:07:04.949> Daishi<00:07:05.979> I<00:07:06.190> haven't<00:07:06.550> renamed<00:07:06.940> it

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
let's see Daishi I haven't renamed it

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.160 
let's see Daishi I haven't renamed it
but<00:07:07.330> it's<00:07:07.870> okay

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
but it's okay

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.730 
but it's okay
this<00:07:09.770> should<00:07:10.490> be<00:07:10.700> fun<00:07:11.240> fight<00:07:11.600> I'll<00:07:12.470> see<00:07:12.680> you
