00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.550
 friends find themselves welcome back in a video 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.330
 dedicated to robbie we arrived at 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.460
 issue number 12 and we continue indeed 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.170
 we complete the right arm as in al 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.269
 usually we go to see first of all 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.520
 to the components that are included in this 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.800
 dossier 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.829
 let's start with the shoulder plate 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.829
 right 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.629
 the metal joint of the right shoulder 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.730
 the square always on the right shoulder 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.079
 then we have another cable and a hub 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.420
 engine reserve and three screws 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.150
 we will also need the built arm 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.730
 up to now and protective stickers 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.270
 let's go first to position the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.450
 shoulder square by passing 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.820
 the servo motor cable first 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.870
 inside the square in this 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.500
 way and then back inside 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.500
 this hole 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.869
 now we insert the square of the shoulder 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.720
 once again passing the garment 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.720
 of the servant inside this hole 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.119
 in this way 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.210
 after that we go to position the 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.850
 incorrect so we can 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.579
 connect it to the thief here of the servo motor 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.289
 always pay attention to this 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.509
 groove that must fit together 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.880
 perfectly with the natural scale 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.509
 present in the special 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.509
 support 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.149
 when you are sure you have done 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.850
 perfectly match these 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.810
 two pieces we are going to push so as to 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.810
 block everything 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.600
 finally pull the servo motor cable 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.210
 so as to position it in the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.620
 correct position that there is not too much 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.050
 Cable on this side where there is high 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.300
 as a last step we go to cover 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.300
 the joint with the placa 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.120
 we fix everything with screws 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.190
 done 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.960
 the arm is ready to be connected 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.400
 to the body of robbie for this number was 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.440
 simple enough 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.480
 I thank you for watching you do 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.870
 appointment to the next dedicated videos 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.870
