earth so we're just gonna begin with
some<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> basics<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> x1<00:00:59.640> II<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
some of the basics the x1 II is a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.090 
some of the basics the x1 II is a
traditional<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> top<00:01:02.370> loading<00:01:02.640> pack<00:01:04.100> just

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
traditional it's a top loading pack just

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.210 
traditional it's a top loading pack just
basically<00:01:05.790> unzip<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.770> if<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.010> see

basically unzip it and if you can see

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.950 
basically unzip it and if you can see
inside<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> shelf

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
inside there you can see there's a shelf

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.039 
inside there you can see there's a shelf
and<00:01:10.729> then<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.060> some<00:01:12.270> pockets<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.840> there

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and then there are some pockets in there

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
and then there are some pockets in there
so<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.680> isolate<00:01:13.830> some<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.369> your

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460 
so that you can isolate some of your
items<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.900> some<00:01:16.110> smaller

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
items and then there are some smaller

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.740 
items and then there are some smaller
clips<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.270> hang<00:01:18.479> things

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
clips in there which you can hang things

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.420 
clips in there which you can hang things
from<00:01:19.020> maybe<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.290> lighter<00:01:19.560> something<00:01:19.979> my<00:01:20.070> dad<00:01:20.310> if

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
from maybe a lighter something my dad if

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.719 
from maybe a lighter something my dad if
you<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.909> needed<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.810> something<00:01:22.490> we<00:01:23.490> talked

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
about that shelf in there and basically

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.249 
about that shelf in there and basically
what<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.780> divide<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
what that is is that will divide you

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.300 
what that is is that will divide you
from<00:01:28.439> top<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.680> bottom

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
from top and bottom

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.359 
from top and bottom
you<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.000> neat<00:01:30.150> thing<00:01:30.329> about<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> is

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
you know the neat thing about that is

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.700 
you know the neat thing about that is
once<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.490> divide<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.630> top<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.900> bottom<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
once you divide the top and bottom you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.160 
once you divide the top and bottom you
can<00:01:35.610> still<00:01:35.939> access<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.840> bottom<00:01:39.170> without

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
can still access the bottom without

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.289 
can still access the bottom without
having<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.560> take<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> whole<00:01:40.920> pack<00:01:41.280> apart<00:01:41.700> so

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
having to take the whole pack apart so

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.270 
having to take the whole pack apart so
you<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:42.899> still<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.380> access<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:44.009> goods

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you can still get access to your goods

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
you can still get access to your goods

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
shoot off of it does have a handle here

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.520 
shoot off of it does have a handle here
for<00:04:58.560> quick<00:04:58.710> access<00:04:58.949> and<00:04:59.190> carry<00:04:59.610> and<00:05:00.440> then<00:05:01.440> the

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
for quick access and carry and then the

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.810 
for quick access and carry and then the
padding<00:05:01.710> on<00:05:01.979> these<00:05:02.130> things<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.460> love<00:05:02.669> them

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
padding on these things I love them

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.939 
padding on these things I love them
because<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.270> padding<00:05:03.599> itself<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.260> ventilated

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
because the padding itself is ventilated

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.760 
because the padding itself is ventilated
so<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:06.000> get<00:05:06.150> air<00:05:06.360> flow<00:05:06.599> moving<00:05:07.410> in<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.650> out<00:05:07.710> of

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
so you get air flow moving in and out of

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.189 
so you get air flow moving in and out of
the<00:05:07.889> pads<00:05:08.130> themselves<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.910> then<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:10.050> can

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
the pads themselves and then you can

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.260 
the pads themselves and then you can
also<00:05:10.349> see<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.830> channels<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.550> where<00:05:11.849> air<00:05:12.060> flow

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
also see the channels to where air flow

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.990 
also see the channels to where air flow
can<00:05:12.510> come<00:05:12.690> up<00:05:12.900> and<00:05:13.440> come<00:05:13.680> in<00:05:13.800> between<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.460> back

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
can come up and come in between and back

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.120 
can come up and come in between and back
out<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.360> top<00:05:15.570> so<00:05:15.780> you<00:05:15.810> can<00:05:15.930> get<00:05:16.260> a<00:05:16.289> lot<00:05:16.889> of<00:05:16.919> air

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
out the top so you can get a lot of air

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.980 
out the top so you can get a lot of air
movement<00:05:17.400> through<00:05:17.550> these<00:05:17.820> things<00:05:18.090> then<00:05:18.960> you

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
movement through these things then you

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.570 
movement through these things then you
have<00:05:19.199> a<00:05:19.229> real<00:05:19.440> nice<00:05:19.590> pad<00:05:19.919> here<00:05:20.160> in<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.310> smaller
