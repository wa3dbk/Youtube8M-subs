00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.740
 let's begin 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.940
 so first of all here I say that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.620
 currently the Roma is not very stable 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.270
 therefore there may be some 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.890
 errors during use 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.020
 I also tell you that to follow this 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 procedure you will need to have recovery 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.739
 modified on our device 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.930
 you will also need root permissions 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.520
 if you don't have these two requirements you can 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.960
 follow the two videos I made where 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.879

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.780
