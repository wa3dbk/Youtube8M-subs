now<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.560> put<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.159> there<00:01:50.399> about<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:51.149> 6am<00:01:51.899> this

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
now I put it on there about at 6am this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
now I put it on there about at 6am this
morning<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.799> haven't<00:01:53.159> touched<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.579> at<00:01:53.909> all

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
morning and I haven't touched it at all

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.280 
morning and I haven't touched it at all
so<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.259> see<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.649> very<00:01:56.869> good<00:01:57.869> color

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
so you can see it's very good color

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.039 
so you can see it's very good color
payoff<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.920> putting<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.670> 6am<00:02:00.060> now

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
payoff for putting it out at 6am now

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.380 
payoff for putting it out at 6am now
it's<00:02:01.860> super<00:02:02.310> creamy<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.909> when<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> first

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
it's super creamy and when I first

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.999 
it's super creamy and when I first
bought<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.840> was<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.200> skeptical<00:02:04.590> just

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
bought it I was really skeptical just

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.190 
bought it I was really skeptical just
because<00:02:05.280> usually<00:02:05.880> creamy<00:02:06.420> eye<00:02:06.540> liners

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
because usually creamy eye liners

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.809 
because usually creamy eye liners
that<00:02:07.409> usually<00:02:07.619> come<00:02:08.160> off<00:02:08.340> your<00:02:08.520> waterline

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that usually come off your waterline

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.369 
that usually come off your waterline
really<00:02:09.239> easily<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.229> are

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
really easily just because they are

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.699 
really easily just because they are
creamy<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.760> pretty<00:02:12.690> watery<00:02:13.140> themselves

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
creamy and are pretty watery themselves

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.180 
creamy and are pretty watery themselves
but<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.400> one<00:02:14.610> doesn't<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.269> all<00:02:15.590> I'll<00:02:16.590> swatch

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
but this one doesn't at all I'll swatch

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.160 
but this one doesn't at all I'll swatch
it<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.030> basically<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
it for you and basically on the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.630 
it for you and basically on the
packaging<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:20.069> know<00:02:20.129> I'll<00:02:20.220> swatch<00:02:20.459> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
packaging you know I'll swatch it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.360 
packaging you know I'll swatch it
hopefully<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.239> see<00:02:21.950> like<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:22.980> takes

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
hopefully you can see like that takes

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.850 
hopefully you can see like that takes
absolutely<00:02:23.610> no<00:02:24.239> effort<00:02:24.450> whatsoever<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:25.560> make

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
absolutely no effort whatsoever to make

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.850 
absolutely no effort whatsoever to make
that<00:02:26.130> dark<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.880> line<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:28.170> colors<00:02:28.530> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that dark of a line and the colors and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.790 
that dark of a line and the colors and
these<00:02:28.980> are<00:02:29.220> metallic<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.989> black<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.530> can't

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
these are metallic the black you can't

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.320 
these are metallic the black you can't
tell<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.280> metallic<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:32.940> because<00:02:33.150> it's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
tell is metallic just because it's

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.850 
tell is metallic just because it's
really<00:02:33.510> hard<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.870> make<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.049> black<00:02:34.380> actually

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
really hard to make a black actually

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.580 
really hard to make a black actually
metallic<00:02:35.400> um<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:36.720> there<00:02:36.900> are<00:02:36.989> super<00:02:37.349> creamy

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.089 
my finger at all and these come in
different<00:03:00.690> colors<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.349> know<00:03:01.709> for<00:03:01.980> sure<00:03:02.069> that

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
different colors I know for sure that

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.280 
different colors I know for sure that
they<00:03:02.400> have<00:03:02.579> a<00:03:02.610> brown<00:03:02.970> they<00:03:03.450> have<00:03:03.720> I'm<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.110> sure

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
they have a brown they have I'm not sure

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.809 
they have a brown they have I'm not sure
I'm<00:03:04.349> pretty<00:03:04.560> sure<00:03:04.680> they<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.069> colored<00:03:05.549> ones

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
I'm pretty sure they have colored ones

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.300 
I'm pretty sure they have colored ones
like<00:03:06.150> blues<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.840> greens<00:03:07.500> i'm<00:03:07.829> pretty<00:03:08.040> sure

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
like blues and greens i'm pretty sure

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.860 
like blues and greens i'm pretty sure
but<00:03:08.549> they<00:03:08.730> are<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> little<00:03:09.150> bit<00:03:09.360> more<00:03:09.510> metallic

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
but they are a little bit more metallic

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.960 
but they are a little bit more metallic
finish<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.950> that's<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:11.370> something<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.760> like

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
finish so that's not something you like

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.849 
finish so that's not something you like
like<00:03:12.180> if<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.450> are<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.900> brown<00:03:13.319> person<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.799> think

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
like if you are a brown person I think

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.250 
like if you are a brown person I think
it's<00:03:14.160> more<00:03:14.220> like<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.519> vibrato<00:03:15.030> shade<00:03:15.569> just

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
it's more like a vibrato shade just

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.170 
it's more like a vibrato shade just
because<00:03:16.530> they<00:03:16.680> are<00:03:16.859> metallic<00:03:17.310> finish<00:03:17.819> but<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
because they are metallic finish but the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.390 
because they are metallic finish but the
black<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.660> completely<00:03:19.200> matte<00:03:19.470> there's<00:03:20.130> no

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
black is completely matte there's no

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.620 
black is completely matte there's no
metallic<00:03:20.819> in<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.239> um<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.819> I<00:03:23.819> have<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.359> sharpen

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
metallic in it um and I have to sharpen

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.420 
metallic in it um and I have to sharpen
this<00:03:24.810> about<00:03:25.049> once<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.470> week<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.130> really
