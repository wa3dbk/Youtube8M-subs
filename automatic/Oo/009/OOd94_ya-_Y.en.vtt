00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
order for you not to do this twice save

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.970

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
because I've done that before so I'm

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.390 
because I've done that before so I'm
just<00:03:15.840> going<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.049> overwrite<00:03:16.319> for<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.069> guys<00:03:17.220> to

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
just going to overwrite for you guys to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.390 
just going to overwrite for you guys to
see<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:18.660> going<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> look<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.079> this

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
see so it's going to look like this

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.280 
see so it's going to look like this
after<00:03:20.400> all<00:03:20.430> then<00:03:21.120> what<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.959> do<00:03:22.079> next

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
after all then what you have to do next

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.640 
after all then what you have to do next
is<00:03:22.560> click<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.280> log<00:03:23.519> in<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.970> then<00:03:24.349> let<00:03:25.349> it<00:03:25.380> do

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
is click the log in and then let it do

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.100 
is click the log in and then let it do
its<00:03:25.799> thing<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.250> course<00:03:26.640> mine<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.120> faster

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
its thing of course mine is faster

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.440 
its thing of course mine is faster
because<00:03:28.319> I've<00:03:28.620> done<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:28.980> before<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.549> just<00:03:30.060> is

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
because I've done it before but just is

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.020 
because I've done it before but just is
gonna<00:03:30.660> be<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> bit<00:03:31.200> slower<00:03:31.590> if<00:03:32.370> it's<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.790> first

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
gonna be a bit slower if it's the first

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.539 
gonna be a bit slower if it's the first
time<00:03:33.269> if<00:03:34.079> it<00:03:34.319> doesn't<00:03:34.530> want<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:35.069> keep<00:03:35.280> trying

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
time if it doesn't want just keep trying

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.150 
time if it doesn't want just keep trying
it's<00:03:36.000> going<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.299> work<00:03:36.420> eventually<00:03:36.890> i'll<00:03:37.890> show

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160
