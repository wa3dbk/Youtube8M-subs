we saw with the Lumia 925 at this sort

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.450 
we saw with the Lumia 925 at this sort
of<00:01:10.049> metallic<00:01:10.530> edge<00:01:10.740> running<00:01:11.159> along<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
of metallic edge running along the

of metallic edge running along the
device<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.240> plastic<00:01:12.780> polycarb

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
device and then this plastic polycarb

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.789 
device and then this plastic polycarb
back<00:01:14.430> shell<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> 20<00:01:16.290> megapixel

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
back shell this is the 20 megapixel

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.399 
back shell this is the 20 megapixel
shooter<00:01:16.830> which<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.549> same<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.720> camera

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
shooter which is the same as the camera

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.969 
shooter which is the same as the camera
on<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.150> Lumia<00:01:21.150> 1520<00:01:21.570> which<00:01:22.049> will<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> little

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
on the Lumia 1520 which will do a little

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.700 
on the Lumia 1520 which will do a little
kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.340> comparison<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.470> mean<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
kind of comparison there I mean it has a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.249 
kind of comparison there I mean it has a
dual<00:01:26.070> LED<00:01:26.490> flash<00:01:26.670> here's<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> back<00:01:27.840> speaker

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
dual LED flash here's the back speaker

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.600 
dual LED flash here's the back speaker
and<00:01:28.439> then<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.829> start<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.430> little

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and then we start to see these little

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
and then we start to see these little
pin<00:01:29.939> holes<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.540> over<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.180> Lumia<00:01:33.659> icon

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
pin holes all over the the Lumia icon

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.899 
pin holes all over the the Lumia icon
and<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.100> thing<00:01:35.280> has<00:01:35.490> four

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and that's because this thing has four

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.390 
and that's because this thing has four
microphones<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.900> doing<00:01:37.470> very<00:01:37.860> high<00:01:38.100> quality

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
microphones for doing very high quality

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.359 
microphones for doing very high quality
audio<00:01:38.820> recording<00:01:39.570> I'm<00:01:40.229> already<00:01:40.560> uploading<00:01:41.220> as
