00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.600
 hello in this tutorial will be explained 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.459
 how to make windows safer 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.350
 can and how easy it is 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.970
 Extra protection next to the firewall and 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.460
 set up virus scanner 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.530
 Unfortunately, many people think that when 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.120
 she has a firewall installed 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.550
 All risks are protected 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.620
 but that's wrong with his firewall 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.700
 Trusting blind is the biggest mistake 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.890
 you can do 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.039
 Already the name fire probably 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.960
 even the biggest fairy tale, namely one 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.880
 impenetrable barrier 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.339
 this would be a term like 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.120
 barn doors therefore much is open 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.300
 aptly 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.429
 What aggravating added is that the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.350
 antivirus programs increasingly independent 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.370
 work and make important decisions 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.440
 meet yourself 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.969
 that means the user is getting more and more 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.920
 restricted and only sees one 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.800
 green light with the message you 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.389
 computer is safe and in times in 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.030
 which even the state Trojaner 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:56.769
 computer espionage uses it comes to the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.780
 Green lamb does not blindly trust 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.799
 and the user the control again 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.629
 return 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.010
 and that is exactly how a control can be 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.989
 easy to set up 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.600
 the whole thing works with the program 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.219
 md5 because escher from digital tronic 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.649
 download links are below in the 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.450
 description first we open the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.180
 program and go to the rider 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.219
 orders here, we can now a 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.200
 Create order for automatic 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.810
 File monitoring of all sensitive 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.700
 system files that means we will be the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.399
 largest weak point independent of 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.180
 monitor the kernal 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.729
 manipulation and changes 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.460
 delicate dll sweet or excel files 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.380
 we recognize this immediately because of this 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.359
 program creates a kind of files 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.920
 fingerprint and compare this at 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.020
 later investigations 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.609
 ok then we create a new one now 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.560
 order if we have the whole time 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:51.729
 Monitor 1 and click Next 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.210
 now we can choose which 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.590
 directories and which files resp 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.810
 file types should be monitored 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.999
 here are already the windows and the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.219
 system folder suggested that can 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:06.759
 we assume so that looks like this 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.890
 that in windows folder all dlls exe and 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.670
 the remaining file types are monitored here 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.230
 become 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.270
 and if, for example, an exe 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.190
 file gets infected with a trojan 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.190
 then the fingerprint changes too 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.770
 so the hash worth of the file and that 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.420
 program tells us that then that 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.330
 program has already realized that this is here 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.310
 a 64 bit windows is because of that 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.580
 here are two system directories in it 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.680
 once for all 64 bit files and one 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.780
 for all 32 bit files 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.900
 Of course we will both be folders 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.080
 monitor the folder my documents 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.569
 we need to add light instead 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.610
 the hosts file that is also a 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.050
 very sensitive area and I think that 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.069
 Most know what manipulates here 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.530
 can be 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.290
 important is that here is the error for 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.299
 We adapt the file types accordingly 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.400
 just select all files here 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.580
 Subfolders do not need to be monitored 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.900
 be so we let the disabled 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.180
 however, we are interested in the hidden ones 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.310
 files and we activate this hook 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.340
 Okay, let's go to the next one 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.569
 Here we determine how often 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.580
 to be tested 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.380
 for example you can choose that after 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.959
 every system startup should be checked 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.329
 but we will use the option interval and 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.620
 Let's say he should go every five hours 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.870
 this order automatically data 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.390
 Okay, now we can say how it reacts 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.250
 should be changed when new files 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.030
 files or deleted files found 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.030
 become 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.500
 we have activated everything here became so 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.780
 a test report in case of a change 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.890
 created and we still get everything per 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.890
 program message communicated 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.600
 completed and so far is 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.970
 everything for automatic monitoring 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.430
 set up here we see program 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.900
 now our surveillance order of 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.200
 Hook here in front means that the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.700
 Automatic monitoring is activated 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.530
 handy is that for manual 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.380
 exams the order directly into the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.950
 link system bar 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.670
 that looks like this order 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.790
 Monitor 1 Execute once 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.810
 and already is checked 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.000
 this window will only be at one 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.770
 Manual check displayed the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.230
 automatic monitoring is running 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.450
 Beautifully hidden in the background you will 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.700
 only informed if something was found 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.620
 and has been accepted lately 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.630
 no new software and no update 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.280
 installed and you receive the message 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.500
 that in the windows folder an exe-file 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.210
 changed or found again 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.220
 then you can be sure that 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.960
 there is something wrong with the file 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.300
 and maybe a bad software 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.010
 behind the manipulation is out 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.810
 For this reason, it is highly recommended 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.730
 an automatic file monitoring 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.500
 to set up exactly this 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.220
 sensitive files and folders too 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.040
 monitor 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.440
 the big advantage of the md5 extinguisher is yes 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.090
 that automatic monitoring completely 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.010
 regardless of the antivirus program 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.320
 works and exactly this combination 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.360
 makes the program so recommendable 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.010
 and if you are a spectator 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.390
 suspicious file change to yours 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.830
 determine system 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.140
 then you are welcome to talk about it 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.150
 inform you best write the 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.710
 filenames with the corresponding hash 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.480
 value below in the comments 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.550
 we like to help and as I said 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.360
 the download link to the program is available 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.360
 below in the description
