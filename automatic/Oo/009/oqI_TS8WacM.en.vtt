to want to fold over the top of the bag

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
which is so the outside doesn't get

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.830 
which is so the outside doesn't get
messy<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.979> create<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.270> cuff<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
messy and create a little cuff and you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.770 
messy and create a little cuff and you
can<00:01:22.470> hold<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.040> hand<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> cup<00:01:23.939> or<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.210> great

can hold your hand like a cup or a great
trick<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.710> use<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.159> pint<00:01:26.490> glass<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
trick is you can use a pint glass and

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.710 
trick is you can use a pint glass and
put<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.320> bag<00:01:28.530> right<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.579> fold<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
over the top and that makes it a lot

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
over the top and that makes it a lot
easier<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:33.299> fill<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:34.799> your

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
easier to fill it so you just take your

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.690 
easier to fill it so you just take your
icing<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.689> scoop<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.710> push<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
all the way down and you scrape it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.440 
all the way down and you scrape it
against<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> side<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> glass<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.299> your

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
against the side of the glass or your

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.999 
against the side of the glass or your
thumb<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.079> you're<00:01:43.259> holding<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:43.770> hand

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
thumb if you're holding it in your hand

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.359 
thumb if you're holding it in your hand
to<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> all<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.100> you're<00:01:47.100> really

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to get it all in there and you're really

only going to want to fill it about
halfway<00:01:48.899> full<00:01:49.549> this<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.450> control

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
halfway full this is so you have control

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.020
