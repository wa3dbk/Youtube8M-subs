connected<00:01:54.410> to<00:01:54.470> your<00:01:54.890> iDevice<00:01:57.490> because<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.610> mean

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
connected to your iDevice because I mean

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
it's pretty epic to do this and then I

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.560 
it's pretty epic to do this and then I
also<00:02:01.040> relieve<00:02:01.460> any<00:02:01.550> attention<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.060> lightning

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570

AV<00:02:02.960> Adapter<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.979> think<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.490> what<00:02:04.790> it's<00:02:05.450> being

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
AV Adapter I think that what it's being

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.660 
AV Adapter I think that what it's being
called<00:02:05.900> that<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:07.010> you<00:02:07.100> can<00:02:07.250> connect<00:02:07.550> your

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
called that is so you can connect your

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.510 
called that is so you can connect your
your<00:02:08.600> iPhone<00:02:09.140> or<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:09.320> iOS<00:02:09.440> device<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.280> look

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
your iPhone or your iOS device to look

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.170 
your iPhone or your iOS device to look
at<00:02:10.700> 50-inch<00:02:11.209> TV<00:02:12.070> which<00:02:13.070> is<00:02:13.100> an<00:02:13.459> adapter<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
at 50-inch TV which is an adapter a to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.320 
at 50-inch TV which is an adapter a to
HDMI<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.140> might<00:02:16.100> do<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.670> my<00:02:16.760> own<00:02:16.790> probably

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
HDMI I might do that on my own probably

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.240 
HDMI I might do that on my own probably
buy<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:17.600> because<00:02:18.170> our<00:02:18.410> 5th<00:02:18.709> stage<00:02:18.890> like

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
buy that because our 5th stage like

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.090 
buy that because our 5th stage like
Samsung<00:02:19.640> TV<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.940> think<00:02:20.240> so<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:21.350> we<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.860> pretty
