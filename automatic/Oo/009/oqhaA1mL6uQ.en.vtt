 with everyone with united states 1 video the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.680
 103 applications that your mind had 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.540
 to be able to play two players what 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.700

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.290
 blog zinc and the third glow haqiq 2 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.750
 when we think that the first 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.790

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.190

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.109
 players 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.579
 but when some really 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.789
 personalism of two people 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.250

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.640
 two buttons in one blue and one orange 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.710
 that we have on the buttons for the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.239
 control 2 and control 1 for example the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.070
 control 1 is the low button we do not know 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.079
 we press and the two players are 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.079
 will move 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.119
 as you can see and one of control two the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.330
 blue button on the we press and it 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.040
 players will move this as as 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.480
 type of football what we have to do 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.960
 in sports matter otherwise 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.270
 with the web as you can see is this 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.400
 put a lot had to be able to play with 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.440
 companions 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.950
 sign up for a while one under the next 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.950
 application 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.350
 the sudden application is called blog sing 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:41.070
 which is like a few divers as you can 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 see we want who does not appear 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.690
 what we have to do is chop in the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.990
 forms the same form that does not appear in 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.170
 orange stripes say gray 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.930
 clear for example press the blue and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.690
 does not hit blue 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.690
 and the blue basket also and green 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.810
 and I have a game wins 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.810
 for example 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.490
 as a note 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:24.700
 understands terms games and won the 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.700
 good opponent with the following 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.140
 this application is called glow co2 spirit 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.550
 good that we also made good 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.380
 only that this from above and 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.730
 we have to mention the screen but 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.290
 to be able to handle a ball 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.280
 As you can see here, a menu offers a 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.720
 player to the players and not adjustments 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.790
 we press the players as they can 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.620
 see here will not appear to move us 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.590
 we just have to push with the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.810
 finger on the screen of each of the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.560
 three circuits that make it explode 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.780
 You can bring the two 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.920
 as as some goals here that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 we have up to the video 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.090
 supposedly had it recommended that the 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.370
 players green 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.709
 you can play from only one that will be 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.190
 more difficult if not as entertaining as 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.940
 sticks 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.940
 and then not 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.260
 an application society but you 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.540
