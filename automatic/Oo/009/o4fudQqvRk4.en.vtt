00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
hello so this is a quick hands-on with a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.650 
hello so this is a quick hands-on with a
Motorola<00:00:08.040> MOTO<00:00:08.400> Lux<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.599> a

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
Motorola MOTO Lux this is a

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.230 
Motorola MOTO Lux this is a
pre-production<00:00:10.260> unit<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> must<00:00:11.969> stress

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
pre-production unit so I must stress

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.780 
pre-production unit so I must stress
that<00:00:12.269> things<00:00:12.690> could<00:00:13.019> change<00:00:13.049> by<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.070> time<00:00:14.250> of

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
that things could change by the time of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.090 
that things could change by the time of
official<00:00:15.389> launch<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:15.990> don't<00:00:16.440> expect<00:00:16.890> that

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
official launch but we don't expect that

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.519 
official launch but we don't expect that
really<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.609> be<00:00:17.699> any<00:00:17.880> changes<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:19.320> will<00:00:19.410> be

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
really to be any changes that will be

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.070 
really to be any changes that will be
too<00:00:19.800> noticeable<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:21.330> we've<00:00:21.570> got<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> couple<00:00:21.990> of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
too noticeable so we've got a couple of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.300 
too noticeable so we've got a couple of
other<00:00:22.199> videos<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.740> our<00:00:22.800> channel<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.189> looks

home screen for applications or contacts

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.670 
home screen for applications or contacts
so<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.500> have<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:50.480> most<00:03:51.480> popular<00:03:51.780> ones<00:03:52.170> at<00:03:52.530> the

so you have the most popular ones at the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.740 
so you have the most popular ones at the
top<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.130> then<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.730> less<00:03:53.940> popular<00:03:54.390> ones<00:03:54.540> go

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
top and then the less popular ones go

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.560 
top and then the less popular ones go
around<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.560> edge<00:03:55.800> but<00:03:56.220> those<00:03:57.090> ones<00:03:57.390> around

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
around the edge but those ones around

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.060 
around the edge but those ones around
the<00:03:57.690> edges<00:03:57.930> still<00:03:58.140> ones<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.500> use<00:03:58.709> quite

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
the edges still ones you use quite

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.660 
the edges still ones you use quite
frequently<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.860> automatically<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:02.610> will

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
frequently so automatically it will

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.550 
frequently so automatically it will
change<00:04:03.120> those<00:04:03.420> if<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.750> choose<00:04:04.050> or<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.410> can

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
change those if you choose or you can

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.000 
change those if you choose or you can
have<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.739> manual<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.780> maybe<00:04:06.780> Facebook<00:04:07.650> is

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
have it manual that maybe Facebook is

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.350 
have it manual that maybe Facebook is
the<00:04:08.130> app<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.489> go<00:04:08.640> into<00:04:10.640> most<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.120> can

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
the app that you go into most so you can

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.949 
the app that you go into most so you can
have<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.870> middle<00:04:12.900> like<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.959> the

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
have that in the middle like so and the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.650 
have that in the middle like so and the
concept<00:04:16.500> applies<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.250> same<00:04:17.489> for<00:04:17.850> contacts<00:04:18.359> as

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
concept applies the same for contacts as

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.460 
concept applies the same for contacts as
well<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.940> that's<00:04:21.030> quite<00:04:21.330> cool<00:04:21.690> feature<00:04:22.049> here

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
well so that's quite cool feature here

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.970 
well so that's quite cool feature here
we've<00:04:22.740> got<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.250> camera<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.090> here<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.570> 8

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.650 

you'll<00:04:43.920> actually<00:04:44.070> see<00:04:44.520> here<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:45.000> screen<00:04:45.390> is

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
you'll actually see here the screen is

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.170 
you'll actually see here the screen is
in<00:04:46.530> landscape<00:04:46.800> mode<00:04:47.160> as<00:04:47.610> well<00:04:47.790> this<00:04:48.000> is<00:04:48.150> a

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
in landscape mode as well this is a

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.060 
in landscape mode as well this is a
really<00:04:48.630> nice<00:04:48.960> feature<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.650> hope<00:04:49.890> this

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
really nice feature and I hope this

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.040 
really nice feature and I hope this
isn't<00:04:50.640> just<00:04:50.850> something<00:04:51.750> that's<00:04:51.810> on<00:04:52.020> the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
isn't just something that's on the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.680 
isn't just something that's on the
pre-production<00:04:52.980> unit<00:04:53.120> so<00:04:54.120> many<00:04:54.330> devices

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
pre-production unit so many devices

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.320 
pre-production unit so many devices
orientate<00:04:55.650> in<00:04:55.830> portrait<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.430> landscape<00:04:56.790> mode

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
orientate in portrait and landscape mode

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.910 
orientate in portrait and landscape mode
but<00:04:57.660> none<00:04:58.020> really<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:59.160> date<00:04:59.370> of<00:05:00.230> orientated<00:05:01.230> of

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
but none really to date of orientated of

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.580 
but none really to date of orientated of
the<00:05:02.700> home<00:05:02.940> screen<00:05:03.360> in<00:05:03.600> landscape<00:05:04.230> mode<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:04.440> I

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
the home screen in landscape mode and I

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.300 
the home screen in landscape mode and I
think<00:05:04.830> it's<00:05:05.010> a<00:05:05.300> massive<00:05:06.650> negative<00:05:07.650> on<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.130> lot

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
think it's a massive negative on a lot

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.130 
think it's a massive negative on a lot
of<00:05:08.340> devices<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:09.000> date<00:05:09.210> because<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.840> find

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
of devices to date because I find

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.950 
of devices to date because I find
especially<00:05:10.230> if<00:05:10.740> you're<00:05:10.860> in<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.040> messaging

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
especially if you're in the messaging

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.200 
especially if you're in the messaging
application<00:05:12.960> you've<00:05:13.850> typed<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:15.240> message<00:05:15.900> out

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
application you've typed a message out

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.670 
application you've typed a message out
like<00:05:18.210> this<00:05:18.420> you<00:05:18.840> go<00:05:18.990> back<00:05:19.260> to<00:05:19.410> your<00:05:19.500> home

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
like this you go back to your home

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.980 
like this you go back to your home
screen<00:05:19.920> and<00:05:20.310> normally<00:05:21.180> you'd<00:05:21.270> get<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.480> portrait

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
screen and normally you'd get a portrait

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.260 
screen and normally you'd get a portrait
orientation<00:05:22.290> of<00:05:23.010> the<00:05:23.580> home<00:05:23.760> screen<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.180> you

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270
