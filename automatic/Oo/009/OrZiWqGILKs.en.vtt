were<00:00:19.109> playing<00:00:19.439> today<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.130> thinking<00:00:20.550> about

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
were playing today and thinking about

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.240 
were playing today and thinking about
how<00:00:20.970> they<00:00:21.000> might<00:00:21.390> change<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.560> way<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.920> learn

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
how they might change the way we learn

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.790 
how they might change the way we learn
and<00:00:23.730> live<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.449> work<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.140> future<00:00:25.320> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and live and do work in the future I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220 
and live and do work in the future I
look<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.550> kinds<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> cognitive<00:00:27.930> skills

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
look at the kinds of cognitive skills

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.529 
look at the kinds of cognitive skills
that<00:00:28.529> we're<00:00:28.650> learning<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.160> kind<00:00:29.369> of

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
that we're learning the kind of

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.680 
that we're learning the kind of
emotional<00:00:31.489> repertoire<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.520> we're<00:00:33.239> creating

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
emotional repertoire that we're creating

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750 
emotional repertoire that we're creating
for<00:00:33.719> ourselves<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.430> how<00:00:35.700> we

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
for ourselves and I think about how we

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.090 
for ourselves and I think about how we
might<00:00:36.149> change<00:00:36.570> our<00:00:36.870> real-life<00:00:37.290> habits<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
might change our real-life habits as a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.700 
might change our real-life habits as a
result<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.640> playing<00:00:38.760> all<00:00:39.030> these<00:00:39.210> games<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> one

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
result of playing all these games so one

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.959 
result of playing all these games so one
of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> most<00:00:41.040> important<00:00:41.430> things<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.730> we're

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
of the most important things that we're

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.319 
of the most important things that we're
learning<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> difference<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.090> level

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
learning is the difference in the level

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.779 
learning is the difference in the level
of<00:00:45.420> engagement<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:46.680> went<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.610> with

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
of engagement we went that you have with

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.639 
of engagement we went that you have with
games<00:00:48.030> versus<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> level<00:00:49.050> engagement<00:00:49.170> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
games versus the level engagement that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.340 
games versus the level engagement that

not<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.689> you're<00:02:03.810> trying<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.170> achieve<00:02:04.469> some

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
not like you're trying to achieve some

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.969 
not like you're trying to achieve some
benchmark<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.549> say

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
benchmark and you say

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.100 
benchmark and you say
you're<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.759> failure<00:02:07.119> you're<00:02:07.780> getting

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
you're a failure you're getting

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.919 
you're a failure you're getting
incrementally<00:02:08.709> better<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.849> learning<00:02:10.660> about

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
incrementally better and learning about

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.960 
incrementally better and learning about
specifically<00:02:11.890> what<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.220> can<00:02:12.370> do<00:02:12.489> better<00:02:12.670> to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
specifically what you can do better to

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.630 
specifically what you can do better to
achieve<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.560> know<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.069> see<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
achieve and and so you know we see that

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.610 
achieve and and so you know we see that
this<00:02:16.000> opens<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> lot<00:02:16.629> of<00:02:16.660> possibilities<00:02:16.780> for

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
this opens a lot of possibilities for

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.520 
this opens a lot of possibilities for
education<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:19.180> could<00:02:19.480> design<00:02:19.629> curriculum

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
education if we could design curriculum

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.830 
education if we could design curriculum
design<00:02:20.920> classroom<00:02:21.550> experiences<00:02:22.269> so<00:02:22.810> that

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
design classroom experiences so that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.540 
design classroom experiences so that
there<00:02:23.440> wasn't<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:23.860> fear<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.160> failure<00:02:24.370> so

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
there wasn't this fear of failure so

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.930 
there wasn't this fear of failure so
there<00:02:24.970> was<00:02:25.180> greater<00:02:25.480> sociability<00:02:26.080> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
there was greater sociability and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.360 
there was greater sociability and
sharing<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.090> knowledge<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
sharing of knowledge and and in the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.460 
sharing of knowledge and and in the
sense<00:02:30.640> they<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:31.360> feedback<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.989> were<00:02:32.110> getting

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
sense they the feedback you were getting

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.250 
sense they the feedback you were getting
is<00:02:33.510> positive<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:34.599> consistently<00:02:35.080> positive

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
is positive it's consistently positive

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.309 
is positive it's consistently positive
and<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.069> constructive<00:02:36.989> those<00:02:37.989> are<00:02:38.170> some

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
and it's constructive those are some

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.320 
and it's constructive those are some
things<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.620> we<00:02:38.830> could<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.970> future<00:02:40.239> of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
things that we could to the future of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.240 
things that we could to the future of
Education<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.650> have<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.830> favorite

Education and you have a favorite

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.430 
Education and you have a favorite
example<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.970> gaming<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.599> learning<00:02:43.900> or<00:02:44.170> just

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
example of gaming and learning or just

example of gaming and learning or just
gaming<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.560> something<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.519> I'm<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.640> big<00:02:48.910> fan

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
gaming so something that I'm a big fan

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.140 
gaming so something that I'm a big fan
of<00:02:49.180> right<00:02:49.480> now<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.200> Xbox<00:02:50.739> Live<00:02:51.040> system<00:02:51.549> and

in these environments and and start

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.390 
in these environments and and start
thinking<00:04:18.200> about<00:04:18.410> how<00:04:18.560> we<00:04:18.740> could<00:04:18.980> apply<00:04:19.100> that

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.240 
thinking about how we could apply that
into<00:04:20.020> real-world<00:04:21.020> objectives<00:04:21.710> instead<00:04:22.160> of

into real-world objectives instead of

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.720
