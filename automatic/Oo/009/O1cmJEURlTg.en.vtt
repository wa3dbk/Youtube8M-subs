Dropbox<00:00:15.860> now<00:00:16.279> that<00:00:16.460> I've<00:00:16.550> gotten<00:00:16.759> used<00:00:16.970> to<00:00:17.089> it

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300

I<00:00:17.420> think<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.050> features<00:00:18.470> are<00:00:18.679> a<00:00:18.710> lot<00:00:18.890> cleaner

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
I think the features are a lot cleaner

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.820 
I think the features are a lot cleaner
nicer<00:00:19.970> easier<00:00:20.539> to<00:00:20.660> use

something<00:01:11.180> super<00:01:11.570> simple<00:01:11.930> I've<00:01:12.770> heard<00:01:12.980> of

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
something super simple I've heard of

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.080 
something super simple I've heard of
some<00:01:13.250> people<00:01:13.280> were<00:01:13.580> writing<00:01:13.820> their<00:01:13.940> game

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
some people were writing their game

some people were writing their game
design<00:01:14.420> document<00:01:14.450> on<00:01:14.900> napkins<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.560> I<00:01:15.650> just

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
design document on napkins and I just

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.080 
design document on napkins and I just
think<00:01:16.010> that<00:01:16.100> that's<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.430> exception<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
think that that's the exception to the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.030 
think that that's the exception to the
rule<00:01:17.120> and<00:01:17.450> not<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.780> norm<00:01:17.990> if<00:01:18.260> what<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:19.010> have

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
rule and not the norm if what you have

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.700 
rule and not the norm if what you have
is<00:01:19.580> less<00:01:20.120> than<00:01:20.360> four<00:01:20.630> pages<00:01:21.080> what<00:01:21.620> you

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
is less than four pages what you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.350 
is less than four pages what you
probably<00:01:22.100> have<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.760> kind<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.180> general
