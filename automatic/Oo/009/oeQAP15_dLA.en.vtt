00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 do as you know I love doing 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.799
 statement of hairstyles evidence of Eiben 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.590
 that's it, but I have a little problem 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.389
 that my hair in the front is a little 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.210
 rebel and they have a hard time tackling 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.660
 without the application of a gene 11 i stop 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.820
 and we see that right away from the show 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 start by actually applying a cream 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.170
 so moisturizing the curling swing and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.760
 since also two brewster dogs under the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.640
 resell my hair knowing that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.330
 well hydrated hair gets plaque and more 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.330
 easily done 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.510
 here I do not like it better 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:01:02.860
 then with my brush g brush all 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:01:05.660
 up a little bit just for 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:11.140
 arrange my hair and be sure they 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.140
 be well enclosed in quotation marks 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.380
 I do not use it for me 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.270
 dÃ©merder hair so then 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.570
 I use stae costa school and their 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.280
 freeze i'm going to apply on all of 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.280
 the front of my hair here 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.770
 if I still use the little payne 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.870
 in fact the stallergenic echo tends to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.600
 to flee my frizzy hair so then 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.290
 I will apply on rebel areas 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.670
 is really rebels said gilles and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.670
 of course pass the brush 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.030
 so with a scarf already sorting I'm looting 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.890
 in triangle and then that I bend under 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.620
 banner shape I'm going to apply it on 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.270
 my hair and I'm going to attach that to his 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.860
 series but still not too much because 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.870
 that the meaning must come 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.810
 up to my brain and I'm going back 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.550
 that's always in the sense of 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.490
 hairstyle and let that rest like 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.620
 a cupcake what can I 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.620
 to do while waiting to make up 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.960
 discuss 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.400
 via a book 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.120
 all done to the mad 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.580
 so after a few minutes basically me 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.730
 I leave to kind 15 minutes of which it is 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.950
 the time to make up what actually 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.930
 then here is the result 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.370
 so the hair is well plated well 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.740
 smoothed and I think it's more 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.410
 pretty like that and it's my preference 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.420
 personal one so after some you 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.590
 maybe not like but that's me 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.350
 I like as much hair 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.970
 plated on the front so here I am you 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.040

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.310
