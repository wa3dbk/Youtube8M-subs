micrograms<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:26.299> yeah

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
micrograms if you can see that but yeah

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.780 
micrograms if you can see that but yeah
it<00:01:27.659> increases<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.560> metabolism<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.729> proteins

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
it increases the metabolism of proteins

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.410 
it increases the metabolism of proteins
and<00:01:30.420> carbohydrates<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.090> turn

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and carbohydrates and so that in turn

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.990 
and carbohydrates and so that in turn
helps<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.110> hair<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:35.340> skin<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:35.820> nails

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
helps your hair your skin in your nails

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.740 
helps your hair your skin in your nails
because<00:01:36.479> Haren<00:01:37.850> hair<00:01:38.850> nails<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.509> dead

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
because Haren hair nails are dead

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.219 
because Haren hair nails are dead
protein<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.610> increase<00:01:41.610> metabolism<00:01:42.229> increase

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
protein so increase metabolism increase

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.319 
protein so increase metabolism increase
the<00:01:43.380> amount<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.590> hair<00:01:43.740> growth<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.520> yeah<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.060> take
