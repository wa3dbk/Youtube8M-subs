00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
and then he scores with this type of

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.060 
and then he scores with this type of
goal<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.780> just<00:04:52.930> felt<00:04:53.170> so<00:04:53.410> unlucky<00:04:53.740> at<00:04:53.950> that

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.500 
I dribbler across and here's the shot
and<00:05:07.410> that's<00:05:08.410> right<00:05:08.770> Paul<00:05:09.250> I've<00:05:09.760> been<00:05:10.120> having

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
and that's right Paul I've been having

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.620 
and that's right Paul I've been having
the<00:05:10.900> worst<00:05:11.470> luck<00:05:11.950> in<00:05:12.400> this<00:05:12.640> game<00:05:12.970> I've<00:05:13.420> had

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
the worst luck in this game I've had

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.740 
the worst luck in this game I've had
about<00:05:13.780> four<00:05:14.290> shots<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:15.120> this<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:16.450> probably

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
about four shots and this is probably

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.830 
about four shots and this is probably
the<00:05:16.990> best<00:05:17.260> I've<00:05:17.440> done<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:18.480> didn't<00:05:19.480> typically

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
the best I've done I didn't typically

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.930 
the best I've done I didn't typically
don't<00:05:19.990> play<00:05:20.200> like<00:05:20.230> this<00:05:20.730> alright<00:05:21.730> and<00:05:21.760> that's

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
don't play like this alright and that's

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.240 
don't play like this alright and that's
how<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.150> game<00:05:22.360> ended<00:05:22.750> so<00:05:23.290> now<00:05:23.440> you're<00:05:24.160> gonna

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.970 
game I'm just gonna say a few words over
I'm<00:05:28.750> already<00:05:28.960> gonna<00:05:29.110> commentate<00:05:29.590> over<00:05:29.830> this

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
I'm already gonna commentate over this

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.310 
I'm already gonna commentate over this
game<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.510> I<00:05:31.510> know<00:05:31.720> by<00:05:31.960> now<00:05:32.140> you're<00:05:32.290> probably

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
game and I know by now you're probably

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.820 
game and I know by now you're probably
thinking<00:05:32.680> that<00:05:33.780> I'm<00:05:34.780> not<00:05:34.990> gonna<00:05:35.200> win<00:05:35.680> the

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
thinking that I'm not gonna win the

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.260 
thinking that I'm not gonna win the
title<00:05:35.860> not<00:05:36.550> even<00:05:36.670> gonna<00:05:36.760> make<00:05:36.910> it<00:05:36.970> out<00:05:37.120> of<00:05:37.150> the

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
title not even gonna make it out of the

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.850 
title not even gonna make it out of the
vision<00:05:37.420> Ted<00:05:37.720> I<00:05:37.750> mean<00:05:38.080> I'm<00:05:38.260> getting<00:05:38.410> destroyed

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
vision Ted I mean I'm getting destroyed

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.950 
vision Ted I mean I'm getting destroyed
in<00:05:39.010> the<00:05:39.130> second<00:05:39.490> game<00:05:39.610> too<00:05:39.910> so<00:05:40.720> you're

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
in the second game too so you're

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.210 
in the second game too so you're
probably<00:05:41.080> thinking<00:05:41.320> there's<00:05:41.650> not<00:05:41.830> much<00:05:42.010> glory

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
probably thinking there's not much glory

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.350 
probably thinking there's not much glory
to<00:05:42.520> be<00:05:42.780> one<00:05:43.780> with<00:05:44.530> this<00:05:44.710> guy<00:05:44.919> but<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.640> gotta<00:05:46.300> tell

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
to be one with this guy but I gotta tell

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.960 
to be one with this guy but I gotta tell
you<00:05:46.570> that's<00:05:46.960> not<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.230> case<00:05:47.530> because<00:05:47.800> this<00:05:48.520> was

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
you that's not the case because this was

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.000 
you that's not the case because this was
too<00:05:49.210> rare<00:05:49.450> occasions<00:05:50.020> that<00:05:50.440> I<00:05:50.500> made<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.770> big

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
too rare occasions that I made a big

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.830 
too rare occasions that I made a big
mistake<00:05:51.070> on<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.760> big<00:05:51.910> mistake<00:05:52.240> was<00:05:52.480> trying<00:05:52.720> to

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
mistake on the big mistake was trying to

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.220 
mistake on the big mistake was trying to
play<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:53.530> low<00:05:53.710> star<00:05:53.980> team<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.630> am<00:05:55.630> NOT<00:05:55.900> good

with<00:05:56.440> low<00:05:56.710> Thirteen's<00:05:57.190> I<00:05:57.370> mean<00:05:57.520> I'll<00:05:57.640> be<00:05:57.669> all

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
with low Thirteen's I mean I'll be all

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.720 
with low Thirteen's I mean I'll be all
right<00:05:57.910> but<00:05:58.470> it's<00:05:59.470> just<00:05:59.710> way<00:06:00.010> different<00:06:00.040> when

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
right but it's just way different when

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.460 
right but it's just way different when
you're<00:06:01.090> playing<00:06:01.330> with<00:06:01.630> a<00:06:01.690> two<00:06:01.930> or<00:06:01.960> three<00:06:02.290> star

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
teen and when you're playing with a 513

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.420 
teen and when you're playing with a 513
and<00:06:04.450> you'll<00:06:05.350> be<00:06:05.530> able<00:06:05.620> to<00:06:05.740> see<00:06:05.980> the<00:06:06.070> difference

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
and you'll be able to see the difference

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.159 
and you'll be able to see the difference
in<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.640> upcoming<00:06:06.820> videos<00:06:07.390> but
