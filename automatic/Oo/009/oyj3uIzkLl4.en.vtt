00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
circus yeah when I go into the circuit
that's<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.610> disagree<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> fact

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that's what I disagree with the fact

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.390 
that's what I disagree with the fact
that<00:01:25.020> Phaedra<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that Phaedra was not there for the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.710 
that Phaedra was not there for the
sentencing<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.210> she<00:01:27.450> should<00:01:27.509> have

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
sentencing I don't think she should have

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.030 
sentencing I don't think she should have
taken<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> kids<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:28.680> aren't<00:01:28.829> too

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
taken the kids because there aren't too

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
taken the kids because there aren't too
small<00:01:29.310> yeah<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> think<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> woman<00:01:30.869> when

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
small yeah but I think as a woman when

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.600 
small yeah but I think as a woman when
you<00:01:31.140> decide<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:31.860> married<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.460> with

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
you decide to get married you are with

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.830 
you decide to get married you are with
some<00:01:32.790> buddies<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.119> good<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> bed<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
some buddies are good in the bed and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.690 
some buddies are good in the bed and
this<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> whole<00:01:34.380> lot<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> bad<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.490> guess

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
this is a whole lot of bad but guess
