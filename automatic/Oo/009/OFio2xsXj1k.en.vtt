 that goes up to the main menu of the play and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.859

 this is for if you want to play for 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.729

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.220
 I never usually get good at seeing these 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.940

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.920

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.330
 as I said 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.060
 Now if you press up on the crosshead you 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.310
 appears and to the menu 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.159
 here we'll put me face store 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.200
 It's worth seeing how fluid the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.850
 notifications that I do not have here 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.369
 you can see all the messages that have 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.670

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.369
 invitations you have so party or 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.640
 normal invitations sent to you by 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.099
 notices of games that have the downloads 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.050
 the download that you have downloaded the 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.870
 loads and from this I do not know I only know what 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.360
 means but good hey the list of 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.819
 friends the messages that you have 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.730
 groups here we have the profile the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.690
 trophies that have and good adjustments and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.580
 Power management exit ps4 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.880
 this is to enter standby mode and 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.330
 turn off the ps4 here I think you can 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 leave it until you download the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.069
 that is downloading the ps4 can noise 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.780
 can prepare for the next time 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.330
 use it for example when downloading 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 content and updates and when loading 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.930
 the controls do not unplug cables 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.880
 lamentation in the standby mode is worth 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.930
 perfect to change a user's worth 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.239
 perfect 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.519
 good fit here is already wider is 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.790
 more or less similar to ps3 but is more 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.909
 distributed against the midwife this already 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.690
 is to get into each of the options and 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.700
 is to go looking 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.510
 has energy saving adjustment the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.020
 play 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.680

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.600
 for the typical privacy of messages or 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.900
 thing about that and here we can see the 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.330
 gallery gallery of catches where 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.800

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.239
 you have the command you can delete it copy 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.120
 in usb and sort them good this is 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.180
 seemed like what happens that is different 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.930
 the good menu here you put I believe in the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.840
 last things that you play 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.579

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.519
