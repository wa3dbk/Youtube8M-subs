00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.160 

now<00:00:05.250> there's<00:00:05.490> another<00:00:05.609> way<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.569> work<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.930> that

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
now there's another way to work of that

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.260 
now there's another way to work of that
and<00:00:07.470> we<00:00:08.219> can<00:00:08.370> make<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.519> little<00:00:08.670> bit<00:00:08.760> harder<00:00:09.090> we

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
and we can make a little bit harder we

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.619 
and we can make a little bit harder we
use<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> medicine<00:00:09.660> ball<00:00:10.020> sure<00:00:11.240> we<00:00:12.240> all<00:00:12.330> know<00:00:12.510> the

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629 
use a medicine ball sure we all know the

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.539 
use a medicine ball sure we all know the
medicine<00:00:12.990> ball<00:00:13.020> and<00:00:13.379> actually<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.250> could<00:00:14.369> use

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
medicine ball and actually you could use

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.010 
medicine ball and actually you could use
a<00:00:14.580> softball<00:00:15.029> or<00:00:15.209> volleyball<00:00:15.240> at<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.779> same

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
a softball or volleyball at the same

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.929 
a softball or volleyball at the same
time<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:17.100> that's<00:00:17.369> going<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> be<00:00:17.609> over<00:00:17.820> here<00:00:18.199> now

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
time so that's going to be over here now

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.989 
time so that's going to be over here now
you<00:00:20.939> guys<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.269> a<00:00:21.300> lot<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.509> trust<00:00:21.779> back<00:00:22.050> thing

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:22.999 
you guys have a lot of trust back thing

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.730 
you guys have a lot of trust back thing
so<00:00:23.999> what<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.419> do<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.960> same<00:00:25.169> movement

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
so what they do is the same movement

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.650 
so what they do is the same movement
basically<00:00:26.249> but<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.789> get<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.179> dynamic

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
basically but now we get more dynamic

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.630 
basically but now we get more dynamic
and<00:00:27.929> we're<00:00:28.740> working<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> ball<00:00:29.369> which

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and we're working with the ball which

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
and we're working with the ball which
again<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.419> ball<00:00:30.749> has<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> very<00:00:31.140> strange<00:00:31.439> effect

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
again the ball has a very strange effect

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.710 
again the ball has a very strange effect
on<00:00:31.859> us<00:00:32.009> no<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.910> think<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.240> have<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.510> overdo

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
on us no we think we have to overdo

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.510 
on us no we think we have to overdo
things<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.530> control<00:00:34.829> things<00:00:35.130> which

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
things we have to control things which

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.070 
things we have to control things which
we<00:00:35.670> don't<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.180> don't<00:00:36.360> want<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> control<00:00:36.900> the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
we don't we don't want to control the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.600 
we don't we don't want to control the
ball<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.130> control<00:00:38.400> our

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
ball we just want to control our

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.820 
ball we just want to control our
movement<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:39.720> stay<00:00:39.990> free<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> bowl<00:00:40.680> but

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
movement and stay free in the bowl but

going the right direction so this trail

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.560 
going the right direction so this trail
right<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:44.670> need<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.850> partner<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.480> you

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
makes a big difference there are these

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.370 
makes a big difference there are these
how<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.820> be<00:01:49.940> perfect<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.780> just<00:01:50.810> make<00:01:51.140> sure<00:01:51.170> you

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
how to be perfect so just make sure you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.190 
how to be perfect so just make sure you
finish<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.310> letter<00:01:52.580> slide<00:01:52.880> out<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.119> here<00:01:56.200> go

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
finish the letter slide out of here go

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.859 
finish the letter slide out of here go
to<00:01:57.259> turn<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.800> back<00:01:58.490> one<00:01:59.420> more<00:01:59.570> thing<00:01:59.600> she

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
to turn is it back one more thing she

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.180 
to turn is it back one more thing she
could<00:01:59.990> do<00:02:00.140> better<00:02:00.170> sorry<00:02:00.649> I'm<00:02:00.770> picking<00:02:01.070> it

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
could do better sorry I'm picking it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.650 
could do better sorry I'm picking it
that's<00:02:01.610> certainly<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.149> what<00:02:02.330> ever<00:02:02.479> hear

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
that's certainly that's what ever hear

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.389 
that's certainly that's what ever hear
the<00:02:03.140> thing<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.560> could<00:02:03.680> do<00:02:03.830> is<00:02:03.979> leave

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
the thing that you could do is leave

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.850 
the thing that you could do is leave
your<00:02:04.580> arms<00:02:04.789> out<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:04.970> little<00:02:05.119> more<00:02:05.560> which<00:02:06.560> makes

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
your arms out a little more which makes

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.469 
your arms out a little more which makes
it<00:02:07.009> keeping<00:02:07.250> your<00:02:07.490> arms<00:02:07.700> out<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.270> game

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
it keeping your arms out of the game

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.910 
it keeping your arms out of the game
right<00:02:08.720> now<00:02:08.780> you're<00:02:09.140> talking<00:02:09.470> event<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.770> little

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
right now you're talking event a little

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.410 
right now you're talking event a little
bit<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.220> then<00:02:10.340> you're<00:02:10.520> already<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:11.180> little<00:02:11.270> bit

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
bit and then you're already a little bit

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.729 
bit and then you're already a little bit
if<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.630> are<00:02:11.770> 18<00:02:12.770> hours<00:02:13.160> here<00:02:13.820> we<00:02:13.910> go<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.900> relax

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
if you are 18 hours here we go so relax

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.710 
if you are 18 hours here we go so relax
your<00:02:15.950> arms<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.850> build<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.150> momentum<00:02:17.570> by

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
your arms you build a momentum by

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.090 
your arms you build a momentum by
rotation<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:19.130> by<00:02:19.400> pushing<00:02:19.730> at<00:02:20.000> manipulating

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
rotation of by pushing at manipulating

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
here we go much nicer there we go very

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.610 
here we go much nicer there we go very
good<00:02:31.440> little<00:02:32.070> bit<00:02:32.220> here<00:02:32.510> finish<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.810> little<00:02:34.500> bit

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620

your finish that means again use the
upper<00:02:49.470> body<00:02:49.590> too<00:02:49.890> much<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.910> also<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.270> is<00:02:51.390> good

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
upper body too much but also it is good

swing<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.910> lot<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.870> times<00:02:55.110> what<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
swing a lot of times what you see on the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.220 
swing a lot of times what you see on the
range<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.310> when<00:02:56.940> people<00:02:57.270> stop<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:58.050> your

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
range is when people stop in your

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.400 
range is when people stop in your
backswing<00:02:58.650> or<00:02:59.040> have<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> very<00:02:59.580> dramatic

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
backswing or have a very dramatic

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.010 
backswing or have a very dramatic
transition<00:03:01.410> exactly<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.970> an<00:03:03.150> acceleration

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
transition exactly it's an acceleration

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.100 
transition exactly it's an acceleration
to<00:03:04.860> impact<00:03:05.310> isn't<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:06.510> stopped<00:03:06.900> to

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
to impact isn't it just stopped to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.440 
to impact isn't it just stopped to
reload<00:03:07.460> and<00:03:08.460> what<00:03:08.640> we<00:03:08.760> want<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.300> we<00:03:09.420> want

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
reload and what we want to do is we want

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.360 
reload and what we want to do is we want
to<00:03:09.690> make<00:03:09.810> sure<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:10.080> have<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> continuous<00:03:11.010> curve

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
to make sure we have a continuous curve

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.400 
to make sure we have a continuous curve
of<00:03:11.700> movement<00:03:12.150> right<00:03:12.270> there<00:03:12.330> which<00:03:12.990> means<00:03:13.230> when

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
of movement right there which means when

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.650 
of movement right there which means when
you<00:03:13.500> go<00:03:13.680> back<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.190> don't<00:03:14.310> want<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.580> stop<00:03:14.850> it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
you go back you don't want to stop it

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.180 
you go back you don't want to stop it
should<00:03:15.870> be<00:03:16.020> continuous<00:03:16.380> acceleration

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
should be continuous acceleration

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.210 
should be continuous acceleration
because<00:03:18.060> then<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.840> power<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.710> build<00:03:19.920> up<00:03:20.040> in

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
because then the power you build up in

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.350 
because then the power you build up in
your<00:03:20.310> muscles<00:03:20.490> basically<00:03:21.000> what<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.210> do<00:03:21.330> is

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
your muscles basically what you do is

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.090 
your muscles basically what you do is
you<00:03:21.570> concentrically<00:03:22.230> loading<00:03:22.650> your<00:03:22.710> muscles

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
you concentrically loading your muscles

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.160 
you concentrically loading your muscles
you<00:03:23.520> want<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.730> unload<00:03:24.120> them<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.870> by<00:03:24.960> rotating

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
you want to unload them just by rotating

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.860 
you want to unload them just by rotating
through<00:03:25.740> again<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.700> don't<00:03:26.880> stop<00:03:27.210> if<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.540> stop

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
through again so don't stop if you stop

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.600 
through again so don't stop if you stop
all<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.230> power<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.740> build<00:03:28.950> up<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.280> here

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
all the power that you build up to here

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.790 
all the power that you build up to here
is<00:03:30.150> going<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.450> leave<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.720> now<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.470> have<00:03:31.650> to

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
is going to leave you now you have to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.130 
is going to leave you now you have to
start<00:03:32.040> from<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.310> beginning<00:03:32.670> again<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.630> keep

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
start from the beginning again so keep

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.960 
start from the beginning again so keep
it<00:03:34.290> momentum<00:03:34.800> is<00:03:35.070> called<00:03:35.310> elastic<00:03:35.580> strain
