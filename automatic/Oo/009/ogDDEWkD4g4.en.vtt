navigation in vim so let's pull up them

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.330 
navigation in vim so let's pull up them
here<00:00:09.139> and<00:00:10.139> we'll<00:00:10.380> get<00:00:10.559> started<00:00:13.190> first<00:00:14.190> thing

here and we'll get started first thing

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.320 
here and we'll get started first thing
for<00:00:14.849> basic<00:00:15.210> navigation<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:16.820> there's<00:00:17.820> multiple

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
for basic navigation is there's multiple

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.550 
for basic navigation is there's multiple
modes<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.750> you're<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.050> work<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.439> in

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
modes that you're going to work in in

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.700 
modes that you're going to work in in
vim<00:00:20.150> currently<00:00:21.150> I'm<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.570> normal<00:00:22.199> mode<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
vim currently I'm in normal mode and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.960 
vim currently I'm in normal mode and
that's<00:00:23.490> where<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.850> see<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> block<00:00:24.510> cursor<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
that's where we see the block cursor and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.419 
that's where we see the block cursor and
it<00:00:27.199> allows<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.439> easily<00:00:28.650> move<00:00:29.099> around

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it allows me to easily move around

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.389 
it allows me to easily move around
instead<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.449> typing<00:00:30.660> text<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.250> most

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
instead of typing text and for the most

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.010 
instead of typing text and for the most
part<00:00:32.520> you're<00:00:32.910> gonna<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> stay<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.630> normal

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
part you're gonna want to stay in normal

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.410 
part you're gonna want to stay in normal
mode<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.380> much<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.890> possible<00:00:35.180> that's<00:00:36.180> your

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
mode as much as possible that's your

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.990 
mode as much as possible that's your
call<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.750> Finn<00:00:37.070> that's<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.340> most<00:00:38.489> efficient

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
call and Finn that's the most efficient

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.920 
call and Finn that's the most efficient
way<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.180> work<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.040> if<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.520> insert<00:00:41.940> mode<00:00:42.180> we

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
way to work so if I go to insert mode we

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.150 
way to work so if I go to insert mode we
can<00:00:43.079> see<00:00:43.230> at<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.379> bottom<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> screen

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
can see at the bottom of the screen

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.799 
can see at the bottom of the screen
there<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.430> says<00:00:44.579> insert<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.660> way

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
there it says insert so that's one way

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.650 
there it says insert so that's one way
you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.110> tell<00:00:46.379> which<00:00:46.620> mode<00:00:46.950> you're<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.570> but<00:00:48.570> if

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
you can tell which mode you're in but if

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.940 
you can tell which mode you're in but if
you're<00:00:48.780> trying<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.230> back<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> normal<00:00:49.620> mode

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you're trying to get back to normal mode

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.549 
you're trying to get back to normal mode
best<00:00:50.879> approach<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.660> you're<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.870> sure<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
best approach and you're not sure the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.920 
best approach and you're not sure the
best<00:00:52.710> approach<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> hit<00:00:53.610> escape<00:00:53.930> then

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
best approach is just a hit escape then

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600 
best approach is just a hit escape then
you<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.170> you'll<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.559> normal<00:00:55.980> mode<00:00:56.129> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you know you'll be in normal mode so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.369 
you know you'll be in normal mode so
when<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.879> normal<00:00:57.270> mode<00:00:57.449> that's<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.260> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
when your normal mode that's when you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
when your normal mode that's when you
really<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.100> bulk<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> your<00:00:59.460> navigating

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
really do the bulk of your navigating

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.610 
really do the bulk of your navigating
and<00:01:00.270> moving<00:01:00.480> around<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.840> that's<00:01:01.020> actually

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and moving around and that's actually

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.770 
and moving around and that's actually
much<00:01:01.829> preferred<00:01:02.370> than<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.879> guess<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.660> you're

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
much preferred than I guess what you're

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.149 
much preferred than I guess what you're
probably<00:01:03.960> used<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.680> using<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
probably used to which is using the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.480 
probably used to which is using the
arrow<00:01:05.309> keys<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.930> vim<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.950> try<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> stay<00:01:08.430> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
arrow keys so in vim you try to stay in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.370 
arrow keys so in vim you try to stay in
the<00:01:08.580> homeroom<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> navigation

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the homeroom so a lot of the navigation

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.289 
the homeroom so a lot of the navigation
is<00:01:10.470> built<00:01:10.710> off<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> homeroom<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> move

there<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> home<00:01:15.689> row<00:01:15.840> anyway<00:01:16.820> pressing<00:01:17.820> J

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
there on the home row anyway pressing J

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.420 
there on the home row anyway pressing J
takes<00:01:18.270> me<00:01:18.479> down<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> line<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.439> move<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.040> press

could<00:02:45.500> do<00:02:45.790> GG<00:02:47.230> which<00:02:48.230> basically<00:02:48.560> takes<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.010> to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
could do GG which basically takes you to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.910 
could do GG which basically takes you to
the<00:02:49.220> top<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.610> page<00:02:49.850> or<00:02:50.180> capital<00:02:50.959> G<00:02:51.170> which

the top of the page or capital G which

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.710 
the top of the page or capital G which
takes<00:02:52.190> me<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.430> bottom<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.209> like<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.600> think

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
takes me the bottom so I like to think

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.750 
takes me the bottom so I like to think
of<00:02:53.930> those<00:02:54.050> as<00:02:54.230> go<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.370> like<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.580> think<00:02:55.730> that

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
of those as go and I like to think that

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.940 
of those as go and I like to think that
too<00:02:56.000> little<00:02:56.239> Jesus<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.930> lighter<00:02:57.320> than<00:02:57.560> one<00:02:57.739> big

flowy<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.850> top<00:03:05.620> it's<00:03:06.620> always<00:03:06.890> nice<00:03:07.040> to

flowy to the top it's always nice to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.759 
flowy to the top it's always nice to
keep<00:03:07.370> something<00:03:07.640> in<00:03:07.850> your<00:03:07.970> mind<00:03:08.180> with<00:03:09.140> vim<00:03:09.410> so

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
keep something in your mind with vim so

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.320 
keep something in your mind with vim so
even<00:03:10.280> though<00:03:10.370> there's<00:03:10.580> sort<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.790> terse<00:03:11.060> key

even though there's sort of terse key
commands<00:03:11.660> at<00:03:11.870> least<00:03:12.050> there's<00:03:12.230> something<00:03:12.470> new

you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.890> keep<00:03:13.040> in<00:03:13.160> your<00:03:13.190> head<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.700> remember

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
you can keep in your head to remember

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.810 
you can keep in your head to remember
how<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.780> move<00:03:15.050> around

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.760 

other<00:03:20.820> ways<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.360> move<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.870> go<00:03:22.050> by<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> word

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
other ways to move you can go by a word

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.330 
other ways to move you can go by a word
so<00:03:23.280> if<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.150> press<00:03:24.330> W<00:03:24.570> it's<00:03:25.560> jumping<00:03:25.950> by<00:03:26.100> word

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
so if you press W it's jumping by word

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.940 
so if you press W it's jumping by word
and<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.240> press<00:03:27.450> B<00:03:27.750> it's<00:03:28.380> jumping<00:03:28.710> back<00:03:28.920> a

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
and if I press B it's jumping back a

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:39.350 
and if I press B it's jumping back a
word<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.590> that's<00:03:37.830> your<00:03:37.980> basic<00:03:38.220> navigation<00:03:39.210> in

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
word so that's your basic navigation in

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.220 
word so that's your basic navigation in
them<00:03:39.860> as<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:41.100> move<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.490> for<00:03:42.480> further<00:03:42.840> future

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
them as I move on for further future

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.810 
them as I move on for further future
episodes<00:03:43.770> I'll<00:03:43.980> talk<00:03:44.190> about<00:03:44.220> some<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.700> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
episodes I'll talk about some of the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.920 
episodes I'll talk about some of the
different<00:03:45.090> modes<00:03:45.270> which<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.570> can<00:03:45.720> do<00:03:45.810> an

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
different modes which you can do an

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.710 
different modes which you can do an
insert<00:03:46.200> mode<00:03:46.440> I'll<00:03:47.340> talk<00:03:47.610> about<00:03:47.720> changing

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
insert mode I'll talk about changing

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.280 
insert mode I'll talk about changing
characters<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:50.570> say<00:03:51.570> if<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.810> want<00:03:51.990> change

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
characters so say if you want change

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.360 
characters so say if you want change

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
everything up to the are there we could

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.800 
everything up to the are there we could
do<00:03:56.490> that<00:03:56.640> but<00:03:58.490> for<00:03:59.490> today<00:03:59.760> this<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.210> your<00:04:00.510> basic

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
do that but for today this is your basic

I<00:04:01.670> recommend<00:04:02.670> disabling<00:04:02.820> your<00:04:03.210> arrow<00:04:03.480> keys

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510
