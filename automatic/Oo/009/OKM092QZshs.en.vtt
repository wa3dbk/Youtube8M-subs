00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
still in pretty darn good shape because

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.060 
still in pretty darn good shape because
of<00:01:47.380> its<00:01:47.650> remoteness<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:50.830> know<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:50.950> think

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
of its remoteness and you know I think

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.950 
of its remoteness and you know I think
right<00:01:51.490> now<00:01:51.640> it's<00:01:51.820> super<00:01:52.180> critical<00:01:52.390> for<00:01:52.930> a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
right now it's super critical for a

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.130 
right now it's super critical for a
project<00:01:53.440> baseline<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.880> embrace<00:01:55.510> this<00:01:55.720> area

project baseline to embrace this area

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.890 
project baseline to embrace this area
document<00:01:56.980> it<00:01:57.340> really<00:01:57.580> well<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.600> keep

document it really well and keep

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.110 
document it really well and keep

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
monitoring it over the years so that we
