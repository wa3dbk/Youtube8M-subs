put together to put all that power to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.639 
put together to put all that power to

the ground tenth scale wheels and tires

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.160 
the ground tenth scale wheels and tires
of<00:00:40.950> course<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> first<00:00:42.420> mini<00:00:42.719> T<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
of course it was the first mini T in the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.049 
of course it was the first mini T in the
world<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.739> one-tenth<00:00:44.309> scale<00:00:44.370> wheels<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
world to have one-tenth scale wheels and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.850 
world to have one-tenth scale wheels and
tires<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.809> actually<00:00:46.140> fit<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.680> worked

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
tires that actually fit and worked

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.790 
tires that actually fit and worked
properly<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> looks<00:00:48.300> stupid<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.469> was<00:00:49.620> way

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
properly but it looks stupid it was way

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.670 
properly but it looks stupid it was way
too<00:00:49.829> short<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.420> made<00:00:51.899> an<00:00:52.020> entirely<00:00:52.350> new

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
too short so I made an entirely new

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.670 
too short so I made an entirely new
chassis<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> extended<00:00:54.600> length<00:00:54.809> carbon

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
chassis for it extended length carbon

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.310 
chassis for it extended length carbon
fiber<00:00:55.969> Delrin<00:00:56.969> batteries<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:57.899> down<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
fiber Delrin batteries right down the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.440 
fiber Delrin batteries right down the
center<00:00:58.500> thing<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> beauty<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.390> body<00:01:03.680> yeah

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
center thing of beauty and the body yeah

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.469 
center thing of beauty and the body yeah
so<00:01:06.450> moving<00:01:07.320> along<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.490> mini<00:01:08.700> sized<00:01:08.970> batteries

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
so moving along the mini sized batteries

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.940 
so moving along the mini sized batteries
of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> day<00:01:09.930> weren't<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> be<00:01:10.710> able<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
of the day weren't going to be able to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.550 
of the day weren't going to be able to
put<00:01:11.100> enough<00:01:11.340> power<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.320> motivate<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
put enough power out to motivate that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.310 
put enough power out to motivate that
big<00:01:13.830> ol<00:01:13.979> 540<00:01:14.729> size<00:01:14.909> brushless<00:01:15.270> motor<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
big ol 540 size brushless motor so I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.859 
big ol 540 size brushless motor so I
came<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.979> pack<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.850> 10<00:01:18.540> sail

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
came up with this pack it's a 10 sail

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.249 
came up with this pack it's a 10 sail
it's<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.890> wired<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.430> 2<00:01:20.939> v<00:01:21.299> cell<00:01:21.600> packs<00:01:21.869> in

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it's actually wired as 2 v cell packs in

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
it's actually wired as 2 v cell packs in
parallel<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.009> figured<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> extra<00:01:24.420> weight

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
parallel I figured all the extra weight

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
parallel I figured all the extra weight
would<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.170> good<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.650> especially<00:01:25.830> with

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
would be a good thing especially with

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
would be a good thing especially with
the<00:01:26.640> power<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.570> big<00:01:27.780> motor<00:01:27.990> so

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the power of that big motor so

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
the power of that big motor so
everything<00:01:29.250> installed<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.450> bit

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
everything installed I was a little bit

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.330 
everything installed I was a little bit
heavier<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:30.960> helped<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> balance<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.009> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
heavier but helped to balance it out I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.890 
heavier but helped to balance it out I
thought<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> work<00:01:33.689> out

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
thought this was going to work out

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
thought this was going to work out
pretty<00:01:34.110> well<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.250> went<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> drive<00:01:35.700> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
pretty well and then I went to drive it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.679 
pretty well and then I went to drive it
for<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.210> time<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.780> even<00:01:37.189> with<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
for the first time and even with the

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
for the first time and even with the
exponential<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:40.170> my<00:01:40.799> radio<00:01:41.040> turned<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
exponential on my radio turned all the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.270 
exponential on my radio turned all the
way<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.329> extreme<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.200> slipper<00:01:44.130> clutch

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
way to the extreme and slipper clutch

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.609 
way to the extreme and slipper clutch
running<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.170> really

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
running really really really really

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.010 
running really really really really
really<00:01:47.040> loose<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.790> couldn't<00:01:48.540> keep<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> front

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
really loose I couldn't keep the front

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.720 
really loose I couldn't keep the front
end<00:01:49.259> down

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
end down

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.210 
end down
one<00:01:49.820> had<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.570> slow<00:01:50.840> way<00:01:51.050> down<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.830> take<00:01:52.040> any

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
one had to slow way down to take any

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.120 
one had to slow way down to take any
turns<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:53.420> was<00:01:53.600> just<00:01:53.840> miserable<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.620> really

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
turns it was just miserable I really

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.950 
turns it was just miserable I really
didn't<00:01:55.400> like<00:01:55.520> this<00:01:55.760> project<00:01:56.240> at<00:01:56.420> all<00:01:56.630> anymore

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
didn't like this project at all anymore

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.100 
didn't like this project at all anymore
and<00:01:57.410> so<00:01:58.310> I<00:01:58.340> completely<00:01:58.730> lost<00:01:59.240> all<00:01:59.750> motivation

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
and so I completely lost all motivation

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.280 
and so I completely lost all motivation
and<00:02:00.740> all<00:02:00.860> hope<00:02:01.160> for<00:02:01.430> working<00:02:01.730> on<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:01.970> at<00:02:02.090> all

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
and all hope for working on it at all

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.720 
and all hope for working on it at all
four<00:02:03.290> years<00:02:04.870> 2006<00:02:05.870> I<00:02:06.050> finally<00:02:06.730> motivated

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
four years 2006 I finally motivated

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.510 
four years 2006 I finally motivated
myself<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:08.390> start<00:02:08.660> working<00:02:08.930> on<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.170> again

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
myself to start working on it again

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.520 
myself to start working on it again
starting<00:02:10.520> with<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.700> new<00:02:11.000> chassis<00:02:11.380> longer<00:02:12.380> than

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
starting with a new chassis longer than

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.210 
starting with a new chassis longer than
before

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
before

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.090 
before
wider<00:02:13.730> all<00:02:14.390> 10<00:02:14.750> cells<00:02:15.050> would<00:02:15.290> fit<00:02:15.500> right<00:02:15.800> down

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
wider all 10 cells would fit right down

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.100 
wider all 10 cells would fit right down
on<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.370> baseline<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.480> lowest<00:02:17.810> center<00:02:17.990> of

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
on the baseline the lowest center of

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.450 
on the baseline the lowest center of
gravity<00:02:18.470> possible<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:18.920> even<00:02:19.160> came<00:02:19.310> up<00:02:19.340> with

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
gravity possible I even came up with

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.730 
gravity possible I even came up with
this<00:02:19.700> cool<00:02:19.970> little<00:02:20.120> idea<00:02:20.510> for<00:02:20.870> how<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.290> connect

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
this cool little idea for how to connect

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.470 
this cool little idea for how to connect
the<00:02:21.830> batteries<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.250> based<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.790> how<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.030> put

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
the batteries just based on how I put

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.090 
the batteries just based on how I put
the<00:02:23.570> batteries<00:02:23.720> onto<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.500> chassis<00:02:24.740> they

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
the batteries onto the chassis they

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.590 
the batteries onto the chassis they
would<00:02:25.220> automatically<00:02:25.790> configure<00:02:26.330> as<00:02:26.420> either

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
would automatically configure as either

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.560 
would automatically configure as either
series<00:02:27.230> or<00:02:27.530> parallel<00:02:27.710> for<00:02:28.190> speed<00:02:28.550> or<00:02:29.060> runtime

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
series or parallel for speed or runtime

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.500 
series or parallel for speed or runtime
and<00:02:30.440> then<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.190> ran<00:02:31.460> out<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.640> motivation<00:02:32.270> again

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
and then I ran out of motivation again

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.250 
and then I ran out of motivation again
for<00:02:32.960> another<00:02:33.200> few<00:02:33.560> years<00:02:34.450> 2009<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.600> decided<00:02:35.750> you

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
for another few years 2009 I decided you

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.080 
for another few years 2009 I decided you
know<00:02:36.410> what<00:02:36.710> I<00:02:36.890> really<00:02:37.400> need<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.670> finish<00:02:37.820> this

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
know what I really need to finish this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.580 
know what I really need to finish this
thing<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.510> been<00:02:38.690> sitting<00:02:38.960> around<00:02:39.020> for<00:02:39.290> way

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
thing it's been sitting around for way

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.190 
thing it's been sitting around for way
too<00:02:39.650> long<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:41.120> got<00:02:41.390> rid<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.780> idea<00:02:42.080> of

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
too long so I got rid of the idea of

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.810 
too long so I got rid of the idea of
using<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.650> old<00:02:42.680> nickel<00:02:43.520> metal<00:02:43.670> hydride

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
using the old nickel metal hydride

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.480 
using the old nickel metal hydride
batteries<00:02:44.630> that's<00:02:45.020> old-school<00:02:45.650> by<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.100> time

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
batteries that's old-school by this time

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.610 
batteries that's old-school by this time
and<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.450> even<00:02:47.570> got<00:02:47.810> rid<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.260> big<00:02:48.470> ol

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
and I even got rid of the big ol

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.490 
and I even got rid of the big ol
ridiculous<00:02:49.430> stupid<00:02:49.820> 540<00:02:50.690> size<00:02:50.870> brush<00:02:51.140> system

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
ridiculous stupid 540 size brush system

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.180 
ridiculous stupid 540 size brush system

everything<00:03:00.800> was<00:03:01.070> not<00:03:01.910> again<00:03:03.040> yes<00:03:04.040> again<00:03:04.880> I

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
everything was not again yes again I

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.790 
everything was not again yes again I
drove<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:05.780> for<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.989> first<00:03:06.200> time<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.709> the

drove it for the first time and the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.350 
drove it for the first time and the
center<00:03:07.070> of<00:03:07.130> gravity<00:03:07.550> was<00:03:07.670> still<00:03:07.910> way<00:03:08.120> too<00:03:08.150> high

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
center of gravity was still way too high

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.180 
center of gravity was still way too high
especially<00:03:09.200> with<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.410> body<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.770> I<00:03:09.980> had
