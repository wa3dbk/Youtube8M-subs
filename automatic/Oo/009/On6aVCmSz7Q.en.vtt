00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.030 
that he was going to do I look back over
the<00:01:14.580> last<00:01:14.729> year<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> Bray<00:01:15.869> Wyatt<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.439> don't

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the last year of Bray Wyatt I don't

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.469 
the last year of Bray Wyatt I don't
really<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.000> guy<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
really think of a guy that is a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.660 
really think of a guy that is a
superstar<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.130> guy<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.490> had<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
superstar I think of a guy that had a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.070 
superstar I think of a guy that had a
whole<00:01:20.909> bunch<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.210> boring<00:01:21.450> matches<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
whole bunch of boring matches that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.530 
whole bunch of boring matches that
nobody<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.770> cares<00:01:23.159> about<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:24.090> doesn't

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
nobody really cares about that doesn't

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
nobody really cares about that doesn't
need<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:25.380> having<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.009> series<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.430> matches<00:01:26.700> or

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
need to be having a series of matches or

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.840 
need to be having a series of matches or
even<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.600> match<00:01:27.930> against<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> Undertaker<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
even all match against the Undertaker it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.060 
even all match against the Undertaker it
doesn't<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.360> make<00:01:30.600> any<00:01:30.659> sense<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.860> end

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
doesn't really make any sense at the end

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.710 
doesn't really make any sense at the end
of<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.670> think<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.119> everybody<00:01:33.450> walks

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
of this I think when everybody walks

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.630 
of this I think when everybody walks
away<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.110> don't<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.710> anybody's<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
away I don't think anybody's going to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
away I don't think anybody's going to
win<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:36.479> Undertaker<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.350> don't

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
win I don't think Undertaker I don't

think<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.150> shriek<00:02:31.480> meant<00:02:31.780> anything<00:02:32.260> until<00:02:33.250> it

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
think the shriek meant anything until it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.009 
think the shriek meant anything until it
was<00:02:33.489> finally<00:02:33.670> broken<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.420> made<00:02:34.629> videos

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
was finally broken I made videos

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.229 
was finally broken I made videos
basically<00:02:35.980> saying<00:02:36.579> that<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.790> thought<00:02:37.030> the

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
basically saying that I thought the

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.759 
basically saying that I thought the
streak<00:02:37.540> should<00:02:37.750> be<00:02:37.930> broken<00:02:38.349> because<00:02:38.470> there's

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
streak should be broken because there's

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.920 
streak should be broken because there's
no<00:02:38.920> way<00:02:39.159> that<00:02:39.790> Undertaker's<00:02:40.359> should<00:02:40.689> be<00:02:40.810> able

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
no way that Undertaker's should be able

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.619 
no way that Undertaker's should be able
to<00:02:41.200> walk<00:02:41.470> away<00:02:41.709> from<00:02:42.099> Debbie<00:02:42.909> keeping<00:02:43.450> that

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
to walk away from Debbie keeping that

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.349 
to walk away from Debbie keeping that
title<00:02:44.409> and<00:02:44.620> not<00:02:45.190> giving<00:02:45.730> anything<00:02:46.120> back

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
title and not giving anything back

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.479 
title and not giving anything back
honestly<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.319> thought<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.680> Brock<00:02:47.889> Lesnar<00:02:48.310> was

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
honestly I thought the Brock Lesnar was

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.819 
honestly I thought the Brock Lesnar was
the<00:02:48.670> wrong<00:02:48.909> guy<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.299> beat<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> streak<00:02:50.200> but

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
the wrong guy to beat the streak but

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.680 
the wrong guy to beat the streak but
look<00:02:51.069> what<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.370> really<00:02:51.519> did<00:02:51.819> for<00:02:52.060> Brock<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.540> mean

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
look what it really did for Brock I mean

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.569 
look what it really did for Brock I mean
Brock<00:02:52.959> really<00:02:53.349> didn't<00:02:53.650> need<00:02:53.859> it<00:02:54.099> that<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.340> mean

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
Brock really didn't need it that I mean

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.149 
Brock really didn't need it that I mean
it<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:55.450> shot<00:02:55.810> Brock<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.439> out<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.920> being

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
it it shot Brock and out of being

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.559 
it it shot Brock and out of being
basically<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:59.400> borderline<00:03:00.400> guy<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:01.000> WT<00:03:01.389> paid

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
basically a borderline guy that WT paid

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
character and really shot him in the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.770 
character and really shot him in the
right<00:04:47.439> direction<00:04:47.500> if<00:04:48.370> Bray<00:04:49.150> would<00:04:49.419> have<00:04:49.539> beat

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
right direction if Bray would have beat

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.200 
right direction if Bray would have beat
Cena<00:04:50.289> at<00:04:50.469> WrestleMania<00:04:50.759> because<00:04:51.759> that<00:04:51.909> is<00:04:52.060> the
