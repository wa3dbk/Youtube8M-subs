00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello to all so today I you 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.300
 found for a quick video for 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.640
 show how I realize my trait 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.710
 daily eyeliner for those who 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.689
 watch my videos for some time 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.519
 already you will surely have noticed that 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.249
 me and my line of eyeliner we are 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.439
 inseparable here I can not go out 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.569
 on my eyeliner trait that makes it very 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.119
 for a long time that's the case even before 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.859
 be it fashion one of the cat eye 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.310
 it was a bit of my trademark 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.800
 so I'm going to show you how 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.079
 I proceed when I'm in a hurry that I have 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.350
 not necessarily the time to use a 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.519
 maiden brush and row etc 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.980
 that's what is something that I 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.140
 guard for one the occasions I have 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.469
 good of a makeup with an outfit 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.089
 extra strong like for a wedding or a 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.719
 evening where I know I'm going to cry or 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.910
 So here than there I therefore favors 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.070
 random end of year rangel waterproof 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.510
 but that's everyday, it's not 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.890
 everything I use so I'll get you 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.360
 quickly show the products that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.130
 I use and then I will show you 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.620
 how do i proceed we will need 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.690
 of a highly pigmented black kohl pencil on 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.460
 more pigmented possible so the one that 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.520
 I use for some time so 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.410
 it's the master drama from maybelline 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.580
 which is like this so it exists in 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.950
 full of colors so there we will use 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.660
 black is really a great pencil 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 Hyper pigmented hyper easy 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.710
 of use the texture is really at 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.380
 top and at the level of the outfit there are 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.710
 really nothing to complain about so another one that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.970
 I also appreciate enough we will say that 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.920
 I used for a long time before 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.590
 know master drama go out so this is 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.900
 the club so the clubbing client 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.210
 waterproof from bourjois so and 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 like those who are not bad too 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.770
 if not in the brands a little bit more 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.380
 dear you have the perversion of home 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.960
 urban decay that's fine 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.140
 also or so you have the lead to 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.000
 feline home mac 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.500
 that's very good too so that's it 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.270
 after you are spoiled for choice the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.870
 only constraint is that it is necessary 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.450
 that it is extremely pigmented is 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.519
 always very well cut 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.000
 a lot simpler for what I'm going 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.700
 show you 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.040
 and then you will also need an eye 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 felt liner 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.599
 my favorite is the super liner 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.579
 at l'orÃ©al who is like this one I 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.250
 shows you the tip that is like that 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.480
 so this kind of eyeliner is really 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.310
 really much easier 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.629
 of use that the high liner with a 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.689
 brush here is if you start here 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.209
 or if you're just right here if you have 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.560
 struggling with to trace your and 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.900
 besides, I really recommend 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.239
 the lnr felt is the grip 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.969
 is really a lot easier then 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.980
 we will start immediately so I have 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:51.129
 now finished applying montfort 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.980
 eyelid so you 'll take 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.780
 so my black pencil so he has to 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.409
 be well cut as I told you 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.540
 previously 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:07.510
 so I always start from the corner 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:12.370
 internal of my left eye trace a 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:15.639
 line flush with the lashes all the way down 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.359
 your eyelash line by making 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:21.010
 little traits like never done 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.750
 a stroke of a blow like that it's worth 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.049
 better build your very small to 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.049
 small 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.280
 that's what it gives then we go 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:47.829
 take our felt liner so that's 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.560
 here one and so we're still going 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.030
 so be able to trace the comma are 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.209
 so the comma 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.680
 in fact you have to go late follow the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.200
 shape of your eye in fact so I know 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.760
 not if you see and so must go 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.859
 join the tail of your dowser 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.010
 so if I'm an extension of my 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:09.220
 eye despite her in this valley 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.060
 direction there so it must be enough in 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.639
 draw a straight line from the corner 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.680
 external of your eye 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:24.190
 we begin to make the tail 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:29.460
 your source there while following the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.460
 extension of your eye 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:38.360
 and then so you join the top 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.960
 of your from the line that you have 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.040
 drawn with the pencil with the tip of 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.139
 the line you have drawn 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.790
 previously so that makes a triangle in 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.800
 do it so you see it's very 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.780
 fast and so is next if you 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.120
 wish with your felt liner 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.040
 could fill the small spaces that 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.360
 you have between the eyelashes that we see 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.660
 still pretty good 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.930
 so to have really a very good 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.930
 not to be 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.100
 so that's what it gives so if you 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.260
 you do not feel comfortable 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.770
 trace the straight line you have you 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.940
 with a map for example 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.420
 so here and then follow 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.880
 this imaginary line here and so 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.920
 you draw your line like that it can 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.280
 to be it can be an idea if you 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.930
 Feel uncomfortable doing this at hand 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.650
 lift that's it you can use a 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.570
 map also a map or train it's 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.620
 what is simpler I think so 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.910
 so here I am doing the same thing 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.190
 on the other side and I find you 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.540
 then I did the other side and 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.720
 applied my mascara 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:53.140
 so that's the end result so like 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.140
 you can see it we do not see 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.540
 we're going to use a pencil rather than a 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.810
 that a real eyeliner so that's it 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.180
 given 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.660
 I hope you liked this idea and I 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.660
 tell you very soon
