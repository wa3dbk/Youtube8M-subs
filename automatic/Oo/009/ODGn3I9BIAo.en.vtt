has<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> very<00:00:19.859> uninteresting<00:00:20.789> product<00:00:21.210> name

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
has a very uninteresting product name

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.929 
has a very uninteresting product name
but<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.109> very<00:00:22.590> interesting<00:00:23.100> product<00:00:23.609> for

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
but it is a very interesting product for

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.849 
but it is a very interesting product for
a<00:00:23.970> couple<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.330> reasons<00:00:24.480> number<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
a couple of reasons number one is I

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.150 
a couple of reasons number one is I
think<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.699> under<00:00:27.119> 23<00:00:27.750> inches<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.410> around<00:00:28.619> 23

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
think just under 23 inches or around 23

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.970 
think just under 23 inches or around 23
to<00:00:29.310> 24<00:00:29.730> inches<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.779> optimal<00:00:31.349> size<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
to 24 inches is the optimal size for a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.430 
to 24 inches is the optimal size for a
1080p<00:00:32.579> monitor<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.149> think<00:00:33.930> when<00:00:34.110> they<00:00:34.260> get

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
1080p monitor I think when they get

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.250 
1080p monitor I think when they get
smaller<00:00:34.920> I've<00:00:35.219> seen<00:00:35.579> 21<00:00:36.270> inch<00:00:36.510> monitors<00:00:36.989> or

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
smaller I've seen 21 inch monitors or

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.369 
smaller I've seen 21 inch monitors or
like<00:00:37.410> 21.5<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.730> are<00:00:38.850> 1080p<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:40.020> text

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
like 21.5 that are 1080p I think text

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.380 
like 21.5 that are 1080p I think text
gets<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:41.040> small<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.149> say

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
gets a little bit small and you can say

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.030 
gets a little bit small and you can say
all<00:00:42.600> day<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:43.020> while<00:00:43.200> lightest<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.860> just

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
all day all while lightest you can just

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.470 
all day all while lightest you can just
adjust<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.489> text<00:00:44.730> size<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.239> operating

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
adjust the text size in your operating

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.610 
adjust the text size in your operating
so<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> know<00:00:45.809> what<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.110> every<00:00:46.320> operating

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
so you know what not every operating

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.770 
so you know what not every operating
system<00:00:46.710> handles<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> well<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.940> lot<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
system handles it that well a lot of the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.060 
system handles it that well a lot of the
time<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> end<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.500> things<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.950> being

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
time you end up with things just being

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.799 
time you end up with things just being
tiny<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> unreadable<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> go

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
tiny and unreadable and then when you go

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.299 
tiny and unreadable and then when you go
above<00:00:52.079> 24<00:00:52.649> inch<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:52.980> go<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
above 24 inch when you go up to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
above 24 inch when you go up to
something<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> 27-inch<00:00:54.360> pixels<00:00:55.050> get

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
something like a 27-inch pixels get

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.189 
something like a 27-inch pixels get
pretty<00:00:55.469> big<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> starts<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.250> look<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.670> like

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
pretty big it starts to look more like

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.540 
pretty big it starts to look more like
using<00:00:58.199> your<00:00:58.350> computer<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> TV<00:00:59.399> that's

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
using your computer on a TV that's

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.639 
using your computer on a TV that's
sitting<00:00:59.850> on<00:00:59.910> your<00:01:00.059> desk<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
sitting on your desk so I think it's the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.969 
sitting on your desk so I think it's the
optimal<00:01:02.039> size<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.930> think<00:01:03.930> surround<00:01:04.320> gaming<00:01:04.830> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
optimal size I think surround gaming is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.340 
optimal size I think surround gaming is
very<00:01:05.519> very<00:01:05.790> cool<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.140> things

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
very very cool but one of the things

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.370 
very very cool but one of the things
holding<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> back<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.549> lack<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.380> monitors

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
holding it back is the lack of monitors

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.030 
holding it back is the lack of monitors
that<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.680> very<00:01:11.460> slim<00:01:11.850> bezels<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.560> mean<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that have very slim bezels that I mean a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.100 
that have very slim bezels that I mean a
big<00:01:14.490> bezel<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.060> between<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.600> two<00:01:15.780> monitors

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
big bezel in between your two monitors

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.499 
big bezel in between your two monitors
when<00:01:16.409> you're<00:01:16.530> playing<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.860> game<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
when you're playing a game is kind of

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.179 
when you're playing a game is kind of
ridiculous<00:01:18.960> unless<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> racing

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
ridiculous unless it's like a racing

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.350 
ridiculous unless it's like a racing
game<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.759> pretend<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> yourself

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
game and you can pretend to yourself

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.020 
game and you can pretend to yourself
that<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.650> part<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> cockpit<00:01:24.000> or

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that it's like part of the cockpit or

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
that it's like part of the cockpit or
something<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.979> unless<00:01:25.979> it's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
something like that like unless it's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.289 
something like that like unless it's
something<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.150> takes

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
something like that I think it takes

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.660 
something like that I think it takes
away<00:01:27.450> from<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.780> gaming<00:01:27.990> experience<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:29.490> then

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
away from the gaming experience and then

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.719 
away from the gaming experience and then
as<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.420> guys<00:01:30.600> probably<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.409> I'm<00:01:31.920> not<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> huge

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
as you guys probably know I'm not a huge

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.690 
as you guys probably know I'm not a huge
fan<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.659> TN<00:01:34.290> monitors<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.520> they

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
fan of TN monitors I don't think they

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.090 
fan of TN monitors I don't think they
enhance<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.659> computing<00:01:37.229> experience<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.950> any

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
enhance the computing experience in any

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.910 
enhance the computing experience in any
way<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:39.030> surround<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.170> bringing<00:01:40.650> this

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
way and in surround so I'm bringing this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.100 
way and in surround so I'm bringing this
all<00:01:41.040> around<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.729> mice<00:01:41.939> around<00:01:42.150> gaming<00:01:42.630> message

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
all around to mice around gaming message

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.609 
all around to mice around gaming message
in<00:01:43.979> surround<00:01:44.549> TN<00:01:45.540> panels<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> bit<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.530> an

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
in surround TN panels can be a bit of an

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:46.969 
in surround TN panels can be a bit of an
issue

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
issue

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.819 
issue
because<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:48.000> almost<00:01:48.420> never<00:01:48.960> get<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.439> so

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
because you can almost never get it so

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.069 
because you can almost never get it so
that<00:01:50.009> every<00:01:50.490> single<00:01:50.670> monitor<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.479> facing

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that every single monitor is facing

that every single monitor is facing
directly<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.829> which<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> optimal<00:01:53.579> way

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
directly at you which is the optimal way

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.870 
directly at you which is the optimal way
to<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> TN<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.700> all<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.930> my<00:01:58.229> friends

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
to use a TN so this all this my friends

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.490 
to use a TN so this all this my friends

beautiful it is an IPS monitor it is 23
I<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.679> 23.6<00:02:10.679> inches<00:02:11.039> or<00:02:11.190> something

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
I think it's 23.6 inches or something

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.820 
I think it's 23.6 inches or something
like<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.640> there<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.480> maybe<00:02:12.660> 20<00:02:13.020> maybe<00:02:13.140> 23

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
like that there are maybe 20 maybe 23

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.630 
like that there are maybe 20 maybe 23

notice about this monitor is something a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.230 
notice about this monitor is something a
little<00:02:39.840> bit<00:02:39.960> different<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:41.550> actually<00:02:42.030> has<00:02:42.210> a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
little bit different it actually has a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.630 
little bit different it actually has a
little<00:02:42.600> magnetic<00:02:42.930> spot<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.800> base<00:02:44.010> that

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
little magnetic spot on the base that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.120 
little magnetic spot on the base that
allows<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.270> store<00:02:46.170> anything<00:02:46.470> with<00:02:46.920> iron

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
allows you to store anything with iron

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.130 
allows you to store anything with iron
content<00:02:47.790> there<00:02:48.180> without<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.720> sort<00:02:49.110> of

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
content there without it sort of

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.660 
content there without it sort of
escaping<00:02:49.620> from<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.160> I'll<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.310> clap<00:02:50.520> that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
escaping from you so I'll be clap that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.820 
escaping from you so I'll be clap that
was<00:02:50.790> kind<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.000> cool<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.600> base<00:02:51.780> also<00:02:52.050> has<00:02:52.380> a

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
was kind of cool the base also has a

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.130 
was kind of cool the base also has a
brushed<00:02:53.280> plastic<00:02:53.910> finish<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.630> as<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.990> guys

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
brushed plastic finish that as you guys

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.750 
brushed plastic finish that as you guys
probably<00:02:55.170> know<00:02:55.680> I'm<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> pretty<00:02:56.250> big<00:02:56.459> fan<00:02:56.730> of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
probably know I'm a pretty big fan of

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.640 
probably know I'm a pretty big fan of
because<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.209> like<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.600> way<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.840> looks<00:02:58.410> it

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
because I like the way that looks it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.740 
because I like the way that looks it
looks<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.490> brushed<00:02:59.760> aluminum<00:03:00.240> but<00:03:00.540> it

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
looks like brushed aluminum but it

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.990 
looks like brushed aluminum but it
actually<00:03:01.080> doesn't<00:03:01.320> stain<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.730> brushed

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
actually doesn't stain like brushed

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.070 
actually doesn't stain like brushed
aluminum<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:03.600> that's<00:03:03.750> great

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
aluminum so that's great

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.990 
aluminum so that's great
assembly<00:03:04.680> simple<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.310> all<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.490> got<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.820> is

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
assembly simple so all you got to do is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
assembly simple so all you got to do is
screw<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.870> one<00:03:07.260> piece<00:03:07.470> from<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.830> bottom<00:03:08.130> here

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
screw in one piece from the bottom here

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.610 
screw in one piece from the bottom here
then<00:03:08.880> clip<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.240> monitor<00:03:09.750> onto<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.470> base

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
then clip the monitor onto the base

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.020 
then clip the monitor onto the base
station<00:03:11.040> here<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.400> there's<00:03:11.610> only<00:03:11.700> three

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
station here so there's only three

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.730 
station here so there's only three
pieces<00:03:12.209> Acer<00:03:13.110> includes<00:03:13.350> pretty<00:03:13.590> much

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
pieces Acer includes pretty much

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.690 
pieces Acer includes pretty much
everything<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.130> need<00:03:14.160> now<00:03:14.340> due<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.520> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
everything you need now due to the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.160 
everything you need now due to the
slimness<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.510> monitor<00:03:15.870> I'm<00:03:15.959> going<00:03:16.080> to

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
slimness of this monitor I'm going to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.990 
slimness of this monitor I'm going to
pull<00:03:16.320> up<00:03:16.350> my<00:03:16.500> iPhone<00:03:16.950> for<00:03:17.220> my<00:03:17.340> trademark

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
pull up my iPhone for my trademark

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.420 
pull up my iPhone for my trademark
iPhone<00:03:18.600> comparison<00:03:19.200> there<00:03:19.920> we<00:03:20.100> go

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
iPhone comparison there we go

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.979 
iPhone comparison there we go
due<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.970> sliminess<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.600> monitor

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
due to the sliminess of this monitor

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.570 
due to the sliminess of this monitor
there<00:03:22.200> wasn't<00:03:22.530> much<00:03:22.680> they<00:03:22.890> could<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:23.340> about

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
there wasn't much they could do about

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.610 
there wasn't much they could do about
the<00:03:24.060> positioning<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.720> bulky<00:03:25.110> connectors<00:03:25.590> like

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
the positioning of bulky connectors like

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.640 
the positioning of bulky connectors like
say<00:03:26.489> for<00:03:26.550> example<00:03:26.810> DVI<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.900> they<00:03:28.320> didn't<00:03:28.530> want

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
say for example DVI and they didn't want

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.870 
say for example DVI and they didn't want
them<00:03:28.800> sticking<00:03:29.010> like<00:03:29.280> right<00:03:29.459> at<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.640> bottom

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
them sticking like right at the bottom

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.979 
them sticking like right at the bottom
of<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.030> monitor<00:03:30.360> because<00:03:30.570> there's<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:30.840> much

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
of the monitor because there's not much

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.540 
of the monitor because there's not much
of<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.230> bezel<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.650> hide<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.010> behind<00:03:32.160> which<00:03:32.519> is

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
of a bezel to hide it behind which is

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.440 
of a bezel to hide it behind which is
what<00:03:32.790> they<00:03:32.910> normally<00:03:33.360> do<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:34.140> instead<00:03:34.800> the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
what they normally do so instead the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.610 
what they normally do so instead the
connectors<00:03:36.450> all<00:03:36.660> come<00:03:36.959> directly<00:03:37.350> out<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
connectors all come directly out the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.860 
connectors all come directly out the
back<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.400> monitor<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.090> it's<00:03:39.209> got<00:03:39.330> HDMI<00:03:39.810> DVI

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
back of the monitor so it's got HDMI DVI

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.949 
back of the monitor so it's got HDMI DVI
and<00:03:40.260> VGA<00:03:40.530> as<00:03:41.220> well<00:03:41.790> as<00:03:41.940> an<00:03:42.030> audio<00:03:42.180> out<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:42.630> it

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
and VGA as well as an audio out so it

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.870 
and VGA as well as an audio out so it
can<00:03:43.080> process<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.680> HDMI<00:03:44.130> audio<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.580> can<00:03:44.610> plug

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
can process the HDMI audio you can plug

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.220 
can process the HDMI audio you can plug
in<00:03:45.000> your<00:03:45.090> headphones<00:03:45.239> or<00:03:45.570> whatever<00:03:45.810> else<00:03:46.019> and

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
in your headphones or whatever else and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.340 
in your headphones or whatever else and
dcn<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.400> includes<00:03:47.910> actually<00:03:48.630> every<00:03:49.019> cable

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
dcn so it includes actually every cable

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.990 
dcn so it includes actually every cable

that it's compatible with come to the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.770
