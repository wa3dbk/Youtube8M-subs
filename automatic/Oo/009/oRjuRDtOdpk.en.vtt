00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
talked to you you were talking about the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.519 
talked to you you were talking about the
batteries<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:26.939> were<00:00:27.300> used<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.930> Tesla<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
batteries that were used in Tesla and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.830 
batteries that were used in Tesla and
how<00:00:28.680> important<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:29.880> batteries<00:00:30.660> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
how important it was for batteries and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.600 
how important it was for batteries and
now<00:00:31.170> you're<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.710> without<00:00:31.980> E<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.700> Volkswagen

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
now you're here without E and Volkswagen

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.299 
now you're here without E and Volkswagen
creating<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.820> battery<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.510> them<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:38.040> most

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
creating a battery for them the most

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
creating a battery for them the most
difficult<00:00:38.790> part<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.690> get<00:00:39.989> right<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> know

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
difficult part to get right you know

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.100 
difficult part to get right you know
electric<00:00:40.680> car<00:00:40.829> yes<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> batteries<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
electric car yes the batteries it is the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.299 
electric car yes the batteries it is the
reason<00:00:43.379> why<00:00:43.469> electric<00:00:43.800> cars<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.070> expensive

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
reason why electric cars are expensive

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.729 
reason why electric cars are expensive
today<00:00:44.579> oh<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.230> limitation<00:00:46.680> on

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
today oh and is the limitation on

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.470 
today oh and is the limitation on
driving<00:00:47.100> range<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.940> need<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
driving range so you need to get the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.350 
driving range so you need to get the
matters<00:00:48.719> right<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:50.160> make<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.610> successful<00:00:51.120> at

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
matters right to make a successful at

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
matters right to make a successful at
your<00:00:51.480> car<00:00:51.660> whether<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.620> small<00:00:52.829> startup

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
your car whether it's a small startup

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.310 
your car whether it's a small startup
company<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.210> become<00:00:54.750> they<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.199> know

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
company or it become they like to know

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.099 
company or it become they like to know
like<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.530> looks<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.090> using<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.870> same

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
like a looks like are you using the same

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.580 
like a looks like are you using the same
theory<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.800> Tesla<00:00:59.489> used<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:01.020> Audi<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
theory that Tesla used in the Audi and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.189 
theory that Tesla used in the Audi and
Volkswagen<00:01:01.829> vehicles<00:01:02.760> well<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.719> using<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
Volkswagen vehicles well I'm using the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.160 
Volkswagen vehicles well I'm using the
idea<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:05.540> consumer<00:01:06.540> cells<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.960> brought

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
idea of consumer cells that are brought

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.020 
idea of consumer cells that are brought
to<00:01:07.350> Tesla<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.950> mean<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.250> still<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
to Tesla I mean I still think it's a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.399 
to Tesla I mean I still think it's a
good<00:01:09.119> idea<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.510> haven't<00:01:09.990> bringing<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
good idea and I haven't bringing in a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.030 
good idea and I haven't bringing in a
deal<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> books<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.650> have

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
deal for the books I you so you you have

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.920 
deal for the books I you so you you have
been<00:01:14.220> working<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> Audi<00:01:14.939> e-tron<00:01:15.090> how<00:01:15.720> long

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
been working on the Audi e-tron how long

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.100 
been working on the Audi e-tron how long
was<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.350> concept<00:01:16.979> before<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.490> came<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
was it in concept before you came on the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.630 
was it in concept before you came on the
engineering<00:01:19.439> work<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.100> car<00:01:20.280> started

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
engineering work for that car started

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.679 
engineering work for that car started
about<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> time<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.150> started<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
about the time I started with the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.170 
about the time I started with the
company<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.799> difference<00:01:23.189> between<00:01:23.400> what

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
company the difference between what

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.880 
company the difference between what
Tesla<00:01:24.659> will<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.900> able<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.619> outtie

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
Tesla will be able to do and what outtie

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.380 
Tesla will be able to do and what outtie
will<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.340> able<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:26.939> an<00:01:27.060> electric

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
will be able to do with an electric

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.109 
will be able to do with an electric
vehicle<00:01:27.540> has<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.500> lot<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.220> how<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
vehicle has a lot to do with how it

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.060 
vehicle has a lot to do with how it
succeeds<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.350> would<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.650> car

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
succeeds and that would be car

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
succeeds and that would be car
dealerships<00:01:32.700> car<00:01:33.150> servicing<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
dealerships car servicing and the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.450 
dealerships car servicing and the
ability<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> vehicle<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.600> has<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.460> 300

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
ability to have a vehicle that has a 300

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
ability to have a vehicle that has a 300
mile<00:01:38.670> range<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.420> all<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.140> those<00:01:40.290> things<00:01:40.590> are

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
mile range and all of those things are

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.600 
mile range and all of those things are
now<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:42.240> an<00:01:42.479> Audi<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:44.159> has<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
now I know in an Audi and it has the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730 
now I know in an Audi and it has the
backing<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.000> someone<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.479> truly<00:01:46.259> believed

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
backing of someone that I truly believed

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.030 
backing of someone that I truly believed
in<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.570> me<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.720> think<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.170> Audi<00:01:49.439> program<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
in so for me I think the Audi program is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
in so for me I think the Audi program is
exciting<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
exciting but I think that the that the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.560 
exciting but I think that the that the
possibility<00:01:53.369> programs<00:01:53.670> across<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> brands

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
possibility programs across the brands

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.179 
possibility programs across the brands
the<00:01:54.720> Volkswagen<00:01:55.170> owns<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.619> much<00:01:56.009> more

a by far the best way to build batteries
I<00:02:34.799> talked<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.069> little<00:02:35.280> bit<00:02:35.489> about<00:02:35.609> the<00:02:35.909> battery

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
I talked a little bit about the battery

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.479 
I talked a little bit about the battery
system<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.409> were<00:02:37.670> reporting<00:02:38.670> well<00:02:40.489> the

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
system that you were reporting well the

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.550 
system that you were reporting well the
concept<00:02:42.209> I've<00:02:42.359> been<00:02:42.510> promoting<00:02:42.870> since<00:02:43.379> even

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
concept I've been promoting since even

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.170 
concept I've been promoting since even
before<00:02:43.680> Tesla<00:02:44.189> existed<00:02:44.609> was<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.849> idea<00:02:45.120> of

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
before Tesla existed was the idea of

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.339 
before Tesla existed was the idea of
using<00:02:46.579> commodity<00:02:47.579> lithium-ion<00:02:48.450> cells<00:02:48.780> in

using commodity lithium-ion cells in
automobiles<00:02:49.889> and<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.519> means<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:51.239> cylindrical

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
automobiles and that means a cylindrical

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.599 
automobiles and that means a cylindrical
cell<00:02:52.260> was<00:02:52.379> 18<00:02:52.650> millimeters<00:02:53.040> by<00:02:53.159> 65

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.970 
cell was 18 millimeters by 65
millimeters<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.739> one

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
millimeters and and it is the one

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
winds up in this form factor first so

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.220 
winds up in this form factor first so
that<00:03:12.359> means<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.629> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.049> make<00:03:13.200> a
