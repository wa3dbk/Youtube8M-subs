00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
forward very disappointing really maybe

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.110

they<00:00:33.239> feel<00:00:33.770> should<00:00:34.770> also<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.309> started<00:00:35.640> again

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
they feel should also have started again

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.580 
they feel should also have started again
perhaps<00:00:36.750> he<00:00:36.870> should<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.110> done<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> mean<00:00:37.530> I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590

would<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.920> had<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> firm<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.340> knee<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.550> there

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
would have had a firm a knee in there

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.010 
would have had a firm a knee in there
from<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> start<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.450> know<00:00:39.570> he's<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> leader

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
from the start you know he's a leader

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.639 
from the start you know he's a leader
he's<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.290> winner

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
he's a winner

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.560 
he's a winner
he<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> few<00:00:41.820> cages<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> Linden

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
he that was a few cages at the Linden

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.150

when<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.840> had<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.170> today<00:00:43.379> we've<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:43.980> really

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
when we had that today we've not really

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.130 
when we had that today we've not really
replaced<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.820> since<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.360> know<00:00:45.420> Tony<00:00:45.750> Adams

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
replaced that since you know Tony Adams

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.959 
replaced that since you know Tony Adams
really<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:47.100> that's<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> big<00:00:47.730> player

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
really but I think that's a big player

really but I think that's a big player
you<00:00:48.149> need<00:00:48.300> when<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> come<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> places<00:00:49.050> like

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
you need when you come to places like

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.840 
you need when you come to places like
Stoke<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.920> drive<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.309> forward

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
Stoke you can drive you forward

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.760 
Stoke you can drive you forward

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
maybe not win the game but certainly not

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.860 
maybe not win the game but certainly not

team<00:02:29.040> overnight<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.760> think<00:02:30.180> losing<00:02:30.330> our<00:02:30.570> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690

team overnight I think losing our and
Ramsey<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.320> we<00:02:31.890> did<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.400> midseason<00:02:32.850> has<00:02:33.090> really

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
Ramsey as we did a midseason has really

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.870 
Ramsey as we did a midseason has really
had<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> major<00:02:34.290> impact<00:02:34.650> obviously<00:02:35.460> we<00:02:35.580> all<00:02:35.700> know

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
had a major impact obviously we all know

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.250 
had a major impact obviously we all know
the<00:02:36.030> squad<00:02:36.270> isn't<00:02:36.540> as<00:02:36.630> strong<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:36.900> we'd<00:02:37.140> like

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the squad isn't as strong as we'd like

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.140 
the squad isn't as strong as we'd like
it<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.530> be<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:38.040> think<00:02:38.430> perhaps<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.850> should<00:02:39.060> have

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
it to be I think perhaps we should have

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.520 
it to be I think perhaps we should have
gone<00:02:39.240> out<00:02:39.390> there<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.630> January<00:02:39.960> for<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.260> couple

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
gone out there in January for a couple

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.410 
gone out there in January for a couple
of<00:02:40.620> key<00:02:40.770> players<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.400> those<00:02:41.700> key<00:02:41.910> positions

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
of key players in those key positions

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.480 
of key players in those key positions
and<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:43.050> think<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:43.560> wouldn't<00:02:43.920> be<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.340> know

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
and I think now we wouldn't be you know

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:52.860 
and I think now we wouldn't be you know
left<00:02:44.970> wanting<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.540> those<00:02:45.690> key<00:02:45.900> areas
