00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.180 
so I'm using my shea butter mix I have
gotten<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.120> used<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.660> my<00:00:39.870> big<00:00:40.140> curly<00:00:40.590> hair<00:00:40.860> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
gotten so used to my big curly hair that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.479 
gotten so used to my big curly hair that
I<00:00:41.430> cannot<00:00:41.820> take<00:00:42.120> bone<00:00:42.540> straight<00:00:43.079> hair<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.920> need

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
I cannot take bone straight hair I need

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.180 
I cannot take bone straight hair I need
volume<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> use<00:00:46.200> flexi<00:00:46.680> rods<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
volume and so I use flexi rods to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.420 
volume and so I use flexi rods to
achieve<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.720 

so<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.720> is<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.410> portion<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.400> small

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
so what I do is I portion of a small

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
so what I do is I portion of a small
section<00:00:54.060> brush<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.140> through<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.650> then<00:00:55.830> take

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
section brush it through and then take

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.180 
section brush it through and then take
the<00:00:56.250> flexi<00:00:56.700> rod<00:00:56.910> roll<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.080> ends<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> rod

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the flexi rod roll the ends on the rod

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.460
