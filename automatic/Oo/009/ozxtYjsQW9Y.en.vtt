00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.090
 today I make a delicious one 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.889
 casserole ready cannelloni filled with 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.710
 minced spinach and ricotta 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.869
 on a bed of delicious tomato sauce 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.050
 I start going with us 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.750
 I take this 400g chicken mince than 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.349
 I put in the pine nuts and now I go in 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.800
 the pan 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.800
 listen 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.730
 Next our spinach I have on 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.559
 the leaves well rinsed in advance 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.450
 stems from done 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.489
 and now I actually make a pile 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.809
 that I will roll up nicely and in that way 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.200
 I can get them quickly 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.200
 chop finely 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.780
 where they at the mince so on the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.120
 pine nuts 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.900
 those were cool that he certainly didn't 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.830
 continue to burn 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.830
 so the ricotta cheese 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:12.940
 I've been going for the pine nuts for ages 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:14.020
 season well with salt and pepper and then go 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.330
 I the whole 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.490
 knead a good advice that I want to give 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.440
 if you chopped knead brutally always 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.720
 First wet your hands because that's what it 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.720
 affects fewer surfaces 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.679
 zoom and filling is ready then I can here 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:40.630
 preheat the oven to 180 degrees and 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.490
 I can now stuff the cannelloni and me 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.740
 you are for a piping bag in a disposable 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.600
 Piping bag you don't have that at home 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.440
 problems can be filled equally well 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.369
 with a spoon 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.530
 when i get my spoon and then i go the 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.690
 put the filling in 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.679
 I have a better way and I pack 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.539
 for this a simple fashion or a canoe 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.250
 and then I pull the sides out 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.950
 but then i can just do it on this one 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.170
 way I want without another 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.590
 meet there will also not 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.590
 topple 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.470
 oh yes the filling well forward 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.130
 then just put that aside 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.620
 we will first prepare the casserole 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.630
 for our cannelloni to fill for the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.350
 tomato sauce and I the kibet he with 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.350
 basil 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.990
 tomatoes a can are also that easy 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.540
 to use and if they are tasty 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.740
 if they were fresh tomatoes they would 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.030
 do not use 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.650
 nice to be with is that there is none 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.650
 preservatives or colors and the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.020
 sauce and kids love it 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.950
 one batch and is ready and now I can do it 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.220
 can economy 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.220
 to fill 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.500
 so it is ready and I can now 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.390
 make bechamel sauce to pour over it 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.390
 and I start with the bone for that 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.959
 I will completely melt the butter will 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.580
 according to I rather longa at the and the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.019
 the intention is that I have about the same amount 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.019
 to take flour as a cabbage 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.980
 this is now my brother and that i am good at 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.980
 to tackle 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.099
 then the milk is added and 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.870
 you actually add milk until ours 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.030
 has the correct thickness 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.049
 now only need salt and pepper 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.049
 miss broken 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.950
 and then pour our cannelloni 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.950
 with our channel sauce 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.590
 so and then we only have the 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.590
 Parmesan cheese 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.880
 he can't go on the oven for half an hour 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.880
 180 degrees 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.860
 finish with a basil leaf 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.169
 and our carrot is ready our delicious 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.539
 cannelloni with minced chicken and ricotta 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.949
 and spinach on a bed of delicious 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.949
 tomato sauce makes it taste
