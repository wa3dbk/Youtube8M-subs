00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.440 

those<00:02:35.140> are<00:02:35.410> pretty<00:02:35.620> self-explanatory<00:02:36.450> so

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
those are pretty self-explanatory so

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.229 
those are pretty self-explanatory so
overall<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.560> great<00:02:38.950> free<00:02:39.549> application

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
overall this is a great free application

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.890 
overall this is a great free application
that<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:41.440> very<00:02:42.430> essential<00:02:42.790> for<00:02:43.030> every<00:02:43.390> iPad

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
that is very essential for every iPad

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.890 
that is very essential for every iPad
because<00:02:44.079> you<00:02:44.799> know<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.400> ipad<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.360> ipad<00:02:46.690> 2

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
because you know that ipad and ipad 2

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.319 
because you know that ipad and ipad 2
does<00:02:47.200> not<00:02:47.230> come<00:02:47.829> with<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.250> timer<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.410> is

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
does not come with the timer so this is

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.229 
does not come with the timer so this is
probably<00:02:52.329> one<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.109> applications<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.950> would

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
probably one of the applications I would

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.440 
probably one of the applications I would
