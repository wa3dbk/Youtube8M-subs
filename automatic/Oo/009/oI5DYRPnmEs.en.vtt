get and so let's run over here and for

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.320 
get and so let's run over here and for
the<00:01:11.880> final<00:01:12.240> goat<00:01:13.790> it's<00:01:14.790> basically<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the final goat it's basically going to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.510 
the final goat it's basically going to
be<00:01:15.390> at<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> end<00:01:16.350> by<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.650> car<00:01:16.920> right

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
be at the at the end by this car right

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
be at the at the end by this car right
down<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.390> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.990> final<00:01:19.320> go

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
down here it's going to be the final go

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.149 
down here it's going to be the final go
so<00:01:20.369> once<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.180> these<00:01:21.420> goats<00:01:22.159> it'll

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
unlock the very tall skin so you go to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.590 
unlock the very tall skin so you go to
custom<00:01:27.240> games<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.369> tall<00:01:29.939> skin<00:01:30.329> in

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
custom games you put the tall skin in

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.810 
custom games you put the tall skin in
the<00:01:30.840> effects<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.950> start<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.250> custom<00:01:32.640> game

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the effects and you start a custom game

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.609 
the effects and you start a custom game
and<00:01:33.090> when<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.229> draft

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
and when you do that you get your draft

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
and when you do that you get your draft
so<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.759> giraffe<00:01:36.030> you're<00:01:36.240> going

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so when you get you giraffe you're going
