here I think it's easiest to just
disconnect<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.830> for<00:02:10.729> now<00:02:10.850> let<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.510> back

of<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.610> bracket<00:02:46.790> already<00:02:47.410> these<00:02:48.410> are<00:02:48.650> shorter

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
of the bracket already these are shorter

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.740 
of the bracket already these are shorter
they're<00:02:49.700> different<00:02:49.910> than<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.180> other<00:02:50.390> screws

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
they're different than the other screws

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.120 
they're different than the other screws
to<00:02:50.989> keep<00:02:51.019> them<00:02:51.410> separate<00:02:56.290> these<00:02:57.290> are<00:02:57.440> teeny<00:02:57.709> so

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
to keep them separate these are teeny so

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.290 
to keep them separate these are teeny so
it's<00:02:58.340> really<00:02:58.489> easy<00:02:58.610> good<00:02:58.940> boss<00:02:59.450> but<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.610> else

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
it's really easy good boss but so else

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.259 
it's really easy good boss but so else
you<00:03:02.510> should<00:03:02.870> pop<00:03:03.110> out<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.440> bracket<00:03:04.269> then

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
you should pop out of the bracket then

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.680 
you should pop out of the bracket then
look<00:03:05.930> back<00:03:06.110> here<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:08.060> now<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:08.209> only<00:03:08.450> have<00:03:08.570> to

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
look back here so now we only have to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.440 
look back here so now we only have to
undo<00:03:09.200> one<00:03:09.410> ribbon<00:03:10.070> cable

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
undo one ribbon cable

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.170 
undo one ribbon cable
this<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:12.380> taped<00:03:12.709> down<00:03:12.890> but<00:03:13.280> it's<00:03:13.400> pretty<00:03:13.820> weak

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
this is taped down but it's pretty weak

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.710 
this is taped down but it's pretty weak
so<00:03:14.630> we're<00:03:15.350> gonna<00:03:15.440> pop<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:16.730> ribbon<00:03:17.150> cable<00:03:17.180> out

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720

just<00:04:12.379> have<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.769> make<00:04:12.919> sure<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:14.109> that<00:04:15.109> is<00:04:15.290> on

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
just have to make sure the that is on

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.430 
just have to make sure the that is on
the<00:04:15.560> bottom<00:04:15.889> board<00:04:16.220> my<00:04:16.729> board<00:04:16.970> is<00:04:17.840> obviously

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
the bottom board my board is obviously

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.890 
the bottom board my board is obviously
used<00:04:19.009> to<00:04:19.099> pull<00:04:19.280> again<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:20.530> pop<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.560> back<00:04:21.709> in<00:04:22.900> get

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
used to pull again so pop it back in get

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.980 
used to pull again so pop it back in get
this<00:04:24.080> cable<00:04:24.470> out<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.740> way<00:04:28.870> then<00:04:29.870> we're

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
this cable out of the way then we're

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.300 
this cable out of the way then we're
going<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:31.960> screw<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.020> into<00:04:33.139> the<00:04:33.320> brackets<00:04:33.889> this

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
going to screw it into the brackets this

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.850 
going to screw it into the brackets this
is<00:04:34.490> easiest<00:04:37.210> if<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:38.270> have<00:04:39.050> another<00:04:39.590> person

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
is easiest if you have another person

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.020 
is easiest if you have another person
helping<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:41.979> I'll<00:04:42.979> do<00:04:43.159> it<00:04:43.250> by<00:04:43.400> myself<00:04:43.550> so

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
helping you but I'll do it by myself so

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.899 
helping you but I'll do it by myself so
just<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:45.169> know<00:04:45.199> the<00:04:45.440> same<00:04:45.680> thing<00:04:45.949> just<00:04:46.190> pull

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
just you know the same thing just pull

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:52.360 
just you know the same thing just pull
these<00:04:47.060> screws<00:04:47.240> back<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:50.590> show<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.650> when<00:04:52.340> I

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
these screws back in and show you when I

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.050 
these screws back in and show you when I
do<00:04:52.490> my<00:04:52.669> last<00:04:52.849> one<00:04:53.150> on<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:55.280> back<00:04:55.460> bracket<00:04:55.820> again

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
do my last one on the back bracket again

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:08.629 
do my last one on the back bracket again
just<00:04:58.450> make<00:04:58.660> sure<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.900> whole<00:04:59.080> thing<00:04:59.230> lining<00:04:59.530> up

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.930 

lot<00:05:09.639> screws<00:05:10.090> in<00:05:10.480> so<00:05:11.520> that's<00:05:12.520> probably<00:05:12.790> the

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
lot screws in so that's probably the

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.680 
lot screws in so that's probably the
most<00:05:13.740> tough<00:05:14.740> part<00:05:15.040> of<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.220> process<00:05:15.760> it<00:05:16.510> is

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
most tough part of the process it is

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.360 
most tough part of the process it is
easier<00:05:17.080> with<00:05:17.169> two<00:05:17.350> people<00:05:17.380> you<00:05:17.830> have<00:05:17.980> somebody

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
easier with two people you have somebody

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.190 
easier with two people you have somebody
holding<00:05:18.700> this<00:05:18.850> but<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.810> can<00:05:19.930> do<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:20.110> yourself

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
holding this but you can do it yourself

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.240 
holding this but you can do it yourself
so<00:05:22.290> we're<00:05:23.290> going<00:05:23.380> to<00:05:23.470> do<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.740> same<00:05:23.919> cable

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
so we're going to do the same cable

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.810 
so we're going to do the same cable
we're<00:05:24.550> going<00:05:24.669> to<00:05:25.169> end<00:05:26.169> up<00:05:27.540> popping<00:05:28.540> this<00:05:28.630> in

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
we're going to end up popping this in

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.640 
we're going to end up popping this in
really<00:05:30.820> pretty<00:05:31.330> simple<00:05:34.320> make<00:05:35.320> sure<00:05:35.470> it's

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
really pretty simple make sure it's

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:42.480 
really pretty simple make sure it's
secure<00:05:36.780> so<00:05:37.780> that's<00:05:38.340> in<00:05:39.340> all<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.610> way<00:05:41.340> tape<00:05:42.340> it

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
secure so that's in all the way tape it

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.460 
secure so that's in all the way tape it
down

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
down

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.650 
down
follow<00:05:45.130> this<00:05:45.280> tape<00:05:45.550> down<00:05:48.060> this<00:05:49.060> connections

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
follow this tape down this connections

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.630 
follow this tape down this connections
obviously<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.620> most<00:05:50.770> important<00:05:51.220> one<00:05:51.370> so<00:05:51.580> you

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
obviously the most important one so you

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.570 
obviously the most important one so you
have<00:05:51.700> to<00:05:51.880> make<00:05:52.090> sure<00:05:52.120> that's<00:05:52.600> secure<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:54.340> then

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
have to make sure that's secure and then

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:15.440 
have to make sure that's secure and then
we're<00:05:54.820> going<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.030> pop<00:05:55.450> this<00:05:55.480> one<00:05:55.690> back<00:05:56.020> in

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.130 

and<00:06:15.990> I<00:06:16.080> bring<00:06:16.320> the<00:06:16.410> screen<00:06:16.710> back<00:06:16.950> to<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:17.430> cover

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
and I bring the screen back to the cover

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.940 
and I bring the screen back to the cover
not<00:06:19.140> tape<00:06:19.470> should<00:06:20.450> now<00:06:21.450> get<00:06:21.900> back<00:06:22.260> on<00:06:22.530> the<00:06:22.710> back

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950

00:07:32.989 --> 00:07:32.999

top make sure you
the<00:07:33.899> bottom<00:07:34.259> as<00:07:34.949> well<00:07:35.749> thought<00:07:36.749> it<00:07:36.899> might<00:07:37.049> not

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 
the bottom as well thought it might not

the bottom as well thought it might not
be<00:07:37.349> that<00:07:37.379> firm<00:07:37.889> that's<00:07:38.369> just<00:07:38.610> how<00:07:38.759> it's

00:07:38.929 --> 00:07:38.939 
be that firm that's just how it's

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:42.169 
be that firm that's just how it's
designed<00:07:40.009> because<00:07:41.009> that's<00:07:41.339> where<00:07:41.669> it<00:07:41.759> closes

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:42.179 
designed because that's where it closes

00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:44.389 
designed because that's where it closes
so<00:07:42.479> it<00:07:43.469> should<00:07:43.799> be<00:07:43.829> good

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:44.399
