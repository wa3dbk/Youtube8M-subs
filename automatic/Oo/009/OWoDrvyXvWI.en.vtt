00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
because I want to do something different

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.089 
because I want to do something different
with<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.849> lineup<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.690> that's<00:00:10.440> moved<00:00:10.769> trick

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
with a lineup and that's moved trick

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.660 
with a lineup and that's moved trick
cold<00:00:11.429> over<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.809> left<00:00:13.139> end<00:00:13.440> position<00:00:14.099> so

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
cold over to the left end position so

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.330 
cold over to the left end position so
now<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.109> run<00:00:16.350> offense<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.949> still

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
now this is the run offense I still

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.189 
now this is the run offense I still
think<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.699> need<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> adjust<00:00:18.180> my<00:00:18.660> offensive<00:00:19.050> line
