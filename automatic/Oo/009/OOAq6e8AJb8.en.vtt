thicker<00:00:59.710> the<00:01:00.610> next<00:01:00.880> ones<00:01:01.030> are<00:01:01.150> very<00:01:01.360> gel<00:01:01.690> like

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
thicker the next ones are very gel like

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.979 
thicker the next ones are very gel like
and<00:01:02.260> I<00:01:02.440> learned<00:01:02.860> how<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.190> use<00:01:03.340> them<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.690> next

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
and I learned how to use them the next

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.410 
and I learned how to use them the next
ones<00:01:05.230> with<00:01:05.530> pal<00:01:05.800> I<00:01:06.160> usually<00:01:06.910> put<00:01:07.210> either

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
ones with pal I usually put either

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.690 
ones with pal I usually put either
powder<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.440> gel<00:01:08.680> or<00:01:08.920> just<00:01:09.160> gel<00:01:09.400> and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
powder and the gel or just gel and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.450 
powder and the gel or just gel and
glitter<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.530> next<00:01:11.800> ones<00:01:12.010> because<00:01:12.340> the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
glitter with the next ones because the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.000 
glitter with the next ones because the
next<00:01:12.700> ones<00:01:12.880> crease<00:01:13.180> horribly<00:01:13.750> but<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.530> started

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
next ones crease horribly but I started

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.320 
next ones crease horribly but I started
learning<00:01:15.160> a<00:01:15.400> tape<00:01:15.700> if<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:15.940> want<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.210> do<00:01:16.300> a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
learning a tape if I want to do a

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.810 
learning a tape if I want to do a
glitter<00:01:16.660> shadow<00:01:16.900> I<00:01:17.320> could<00:01:17.830> use<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.340> next<00:01:18.610> ones

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
glitter shadow I could use the next ones

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.359 
glitter shadow I could use the next ones
or<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.479> Korean<00:01:19.780> shadow<00:01:20.170> so<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:20.890> think<00:01:21.010> that's<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
or a Korean shadow so I think that's the

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.730 
or a Korean shadow so I think that's the
only<00:01:21.430> thing<00:01:21.760> that<00:01:21.910> that's<00:01:22.030> good<00:01:22.360> for<00:01:22.390> I<00:01:22.960> tried

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
only thing that that's good for I tried

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.620 
only thing that that's good for I tried
using<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.550> with<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.790> powder<00:01:25.090> because<00:01:25.390> with

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
using this with a powder because with

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.900 
using this with a powder because with
the<00:01:25.750> next<00:01:26.050> one<00:01:26.200> with<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.500> powder<00:01:26.740> will<00:01:27.310> set<00:01:27.729> it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
the next one with the powder will set it

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.630 
the next one with the powder will set it
