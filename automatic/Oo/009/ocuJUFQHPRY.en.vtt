on<00:02:40.910> their<00:02:40.940> own<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.569> judging<00:02:42.200> by<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.379> pacing

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
on their own and judging by the pacing

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.339 
on their own and judging by the pacing
of<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.310> way<00:02:43.849> this<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.209> going<00:02:44.390> down<00:02:44.690> if<00:02:45.049> it<00:02:45.200> does

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
of the way this is going down if it does

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.680 
of the way this is going down if it does
want<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.680> do<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:46.190> battle<00:02:46.579> an<00:02:46.640> episode<00:02:47.030> most

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
want to do one battle an episode most

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.479 
want to do one battle an episode most
likely<00:02:47.959> next<00:02:48.349> week<00:02:48.620> we'll<00:02:48.799> have<00:02:48.920> one<00:02:49.129> battle

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
likely next week we'll have one battle

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.699 
likely next week we'll have one battle
finished<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.120> then<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.989> last<00:02:51.290> battle<00:02:51.530> will

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
finished and then the last battle will

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.160 
finished and then the last battle will
be<00:02:51.799> finished<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.579> third<00:02:53.060> episode<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:53.720> I'm

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
be finished on the third episode so I'm

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.660 
be finished on the third episode so I'm
getting<00:02:54.500> at<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.590> we<00:02:54.950> probably<00:02:55.160> have<00:02:55.340> two<00:02:55.489> more

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
getting at is we probably have two more

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.069 
getting at is we probably have two more
episodes<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:56.299> then<00:02:56.510> this<00:02:56.629> little<00:02:56.750> match

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
episodes and then this little match

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.110 
episodes and then this little match
between<00:02:57.470> taigun<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.160> their<00:02:58.280> opponent<00:02:58.790> will

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
between taigun in their opponent will

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.849 
between taigun in their opponent will
end<00:02:59.359> so<00:02:59.569> two<00:02:59.750> more<00:02:59.959> episodes<00:03:00.139> next<00:03:00.680> week's

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
end so two more episodes next week's

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.860 
end so two more episodes next week's
episode<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.730> episode<00:03:02.209> after<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.720> will

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
episode and the episode after that will

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.569 
episode and the episode after that will
probably<00:03:03.109> finish<00:03:03.410> this<00:03:03.709> little<00:03:03.980> dispute<00:03:04.370> and

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
probably finish this little dispute and

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.400 
probably finish this little dispute and
I<00:03:04.940> wonder<00:03:05.239> how<00:03:05.389> it's<00:03:05.599> going<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.870> be<00:03:05.930> handled

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
I wonder how it's going to be handled

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.110 
I wonder how it's going to be handled
judging<00:03:06.769> by<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:06.920> way<00:03:07.069> this<00:03:07.220> episode<00:03:07.670> was<00:03:07.790> done

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
judging by the way this episode was done

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.809 
judging by the way this episode was done
because<00:03:08.859> we<00:03:09.859> come<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.130> find<00:03:10.280> out<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.549> do<00:03:10.669> with

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
because we come to find out to do with

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.360 
because we come to find out to do with
the<00:03:10.880> minigun<00:03:11.209> wasn't<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.720> guy<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.319> kind<00:03:13.250> of

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the minigun wasn't the guy that kind of

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.520 
the minigun wasn't the guy that kind of
tortured<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.000> girl<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.419> the<00:03:14.510> past<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.139> you

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
tortured the girl in the past and you

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.960 
tortured the girl in the past and you
think<00:03:15.799> that<00:03:16.040> would<00:03:16.190> be<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.430> guy<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:16.609> mean

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
think that would be the guy I mean

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.759 
think that would be the guy I mean
looking<00:03:17.599> at<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.840> minigun<00:03:18.230> in<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.530> type<00:03:18.739> of

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
looking at the minigun in the type of

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.680 
looking at the minigun in the type of
devastation<00:03:19.669> it<00:03:19.790> caused<00:03:20.000> in<00:03:20.299> this<00:03:20.329> episode

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
devastation it caused in this episode

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.599 
devastation it caused in this episode
you<00:03:21.079> would<00:03:21.200> instantly<00:03:21.620> key<00:03:21.829> in<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.250> think<00:03:22.459> it

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
you would instantly key in and think it

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.550 
you would instantly key in and think it
was<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:22.730> guy<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.630> did<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.959> damage<00:03:24.139> to<00:03:24.470> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
was that guy that did the damage to the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.530 
was that guy that did the damage to the
girl<00:03:24.709> but<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.250> seemed<00:03:25.430> like<00:03:25.579> he<00:03:25.700> had<00:03:25.730> no<00:03:25.880> idea

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
girl but it seemed like he had no idea

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.610 
girl but it seemed like he had no idea
at<00:03:26.750> all<00:03:27.079> in<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.500> episode<00:03:27.829> so<00:03:28.989> it's<00:03:29.989> obviously
