00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.210
 today we have the ax remix of aqua 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 computer here the pumps for one 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.869
 water cooling course so special about 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.169
 This pump is one you can over a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 timer correctly over and pc control with 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.890
 execution temperature and everything 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.119
 possible in the traverse at least if 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.699
 but then her but also her 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.199
 version offers a few extras with me 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.239
 things we unpack the thing directly 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.480
 In my opinion that is definitely 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.300
 the best pump the skepticism 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.200
 and yes I want you home right away 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.000
 of course, distribute directly to the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.010
 seeding are bigger than you are so 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.809
 actually one thinks thinking in the picture 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 this little next much bigger 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.980
 this will connect you how much 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 molex electricity and we can then go to the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.340
 points themselves still fan afterwards 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.590
 the last honor under it and concealed 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.539
 a usb cable what we internally from 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.800
 if stuck there 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.259
 important here is first that we the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.700
 connections are not standard 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.310
 a quarter pulled out as the key 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.560
 needed adapter league is synonymous yes 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.479
 Everything else is in the description otherwise 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.190
 linked and you have this adapter 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.380
 use and then have one 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.790
 quarter inch thread what you your 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.830
 connection box for your hoses 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.420
 then I believe the cost 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.220
 5 euros or just on each 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.640
 case extra and you can not 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.450
 Give the pump a cool start 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.820
 feature of the pump is on the filling 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.659
 Mode I have to get out of here we have here 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.790
 through a jumper the power supply 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.280
 can thus connect the power supply 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.079
 also power out there although the pc even 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.149
 not running for this we close this 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.790
 tal to the power supply to was a jumper and 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.970
 then the power supply with the pump the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.540
 poker in such a vent pipe must be 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.159
 pump and the pump then leaves again 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.620
 Take a short break with the water again 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.420
 so say she comes then can 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.640
 looked so good on that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.200
 fill and gentleman I would say that 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.850
 is also a really good feature 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.630
 this pump and I can only 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.790
 Recommend 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.410
 what we still say to yourself 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.060
 fan cable then he could be the buddy 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.010
 then probably to cpu probably 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.440
 then connect under a usb 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.970
 cable for connection to the mainboard 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.750
 so of course you have the full 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.130
 control 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.320
 if you still partly under it 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.010
 suffers or the software said that 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.320
 full control over the pump and its 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.750
 functions the cables are now thick 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.390
 on it made in china but the pump 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.390
 itself is made in germany and i think 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.370
 that's something very special 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.100
 is already made in germany made in 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.690
 germany drops the thought I have to 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.800
 Anyway, I'm personally quality 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.720
 of course have experience with the 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.070
 pump and can tell you i could 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.990
 really the madness 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.180
 we are after the small sank around the 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.970
 development mode to start for this 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.470
 here at the pump behind stuck where 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.560
 then the whole thing goes well 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.630
 bit of paperwork and yes we say 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.310
 There is not much more to the pump 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.690
 if you want to see technical data 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.070
 then just click on the link in the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.500
 video description i can give you this 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.510
 Pump is definitely recommend 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.950
 By the way, a modified home points 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.140
 So computer has that easy 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.150
 Modifies the color changes and one 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.220
 Matching software for it all comes 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.800
 a top product best pump on the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.480
 I can only recommend the market as a market 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.170
 be a bit bland, she writes in the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.150
 Comments 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.200
 Otherwise we'll see you there 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.200
 next video until then
