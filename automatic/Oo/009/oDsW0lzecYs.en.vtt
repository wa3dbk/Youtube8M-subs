00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.649 
moment there are some things with this
plug-in<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.680> been<00:01:55.740> added<00:01:56.189> yet<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
plug-in that have not been added yet and

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.179 
plug-in that have not been added yet and
I'll<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.930> into<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.799> second

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
I'll get into that here in just a second

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.469 
I'll get into that here in just a second
so<00:01:59.990> basically<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.640> these<00:02:02.640> two<00:02:02.939> little<00:02:03.240> half

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
so basically the these two little half

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.740 
so basically the these two little half
slabs<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.729> walk<00:02:05.969> over<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.450> Riggs<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
slabs here as I walk over it Riggs the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.490 
slabs here as I walk over it Riggs the
Ritz<00:02:06.960> triggers<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.649> redstone<00:02:07.920> signal<00:02:08.300> and

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
Ritz triggers a redstone signal and

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.960 
Ritz triggers a redstone signal and
opens<00:02:10.500> these<00:02:10.679> little<00:02:11.009> doors<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.730> can't

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
opens these little doors and you can't

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.740 
opens these little doors and you can't
even<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> Pistons<00:02:12.750> how<00:02:12.900> one

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
even see the Pistons how one

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.510 
even see the Pistons how one
is<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:13.990> I'm<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.530> high<00:02:14.980> whatever<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.340> want<00:02:15.460> in

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
is that I'm so high whatever you want in

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.330 
is that I'm so high whatever you want in
this<00:02:15.580> chest<00:02:15.880> leave<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.140> voila<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.220> will

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
this chest leave and voila it will

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.210 
this chest leave and voila it will
magically<00:02:18.490> clothes<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.440> maybe<00:02:20.440> it's<00:02:21.130> a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
your own pocket mine server so let's get

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.410 
your own pocket mine server so let's get
into<00:02:36.700> how<00:02:37.240> this<00:02:37.420> actually<00:02:37.720> works<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.459> with<00:02:40.240> the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
into how this actually works so with the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.650 
into how this actually works so with the
plugin<00:02:40.990> we<00:02:41.470> have<00:02:41.820> certain<00:02:42.820> capabilities<00:02:43.030> of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
plugin we have certain capabilities of

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.600 
plugin we have certain capabilities of
redstone<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.650> we<00:02:44.740> have<00:02:44.890> in<00:02:45.040> let<00:02:45.310> me<00:02:45.340> go<00:02:45.490> and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
redstone that we have in let me go and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.370 
redstone that we have in let me go and
pull<00:02:45.820> some<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.090> these<00:02:46.209> out<00:02:46.390> here<00:02:46.600> i'll<00:02:47.260> show

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
pull some of these out here i'll show

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.570 
pull some of these out here i'll show
you<00:02:47.470> guys<00:02:47.590> some<00:02:47.920> quick<00:02:48.250> examples<00:02:48.900> we've<00:02:49.900> got<00:02:50.580> i

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
you guys some quick examples we've got i

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.979 
you guys some quick examples we've got i
think<00:02:52.060> we're<00:02:52.150> going<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.330> make<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.510> completely

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
think we're going to make a completely

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.229 
think we're going to make a completely
separate<00:02:53.200> video<00:02:53.470> on<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:54.730> actually<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:57.239> I'm

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
separate video on this actually so I'm

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.040 
separate video on this actually so I'm
not<00:02:58.360> actually<00:02:58.480> going<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.780> explain<00:02:58.989> this

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
not actually going to explain this

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.920 
not actually going to explain this
basically<00:02:59.770> what<00:03:00.489> happens<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:00.940> they<00:03:01.660> have<00:03:01.900> a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
basically what happens is they have a

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.210 
basically what happens is they have a
feature<00:03:02.290> where<00:03:03.280> when<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.860> when<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.890> place

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
feature where when you when you place

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.130 
feature where when you when you place
down<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.790> half<00:03:07.030> slabs<00:03:07.330> on<00:03:07.570> top<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.900> each<00:03:07.989> other

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
down to half slabs on top of each other

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.250 
down to half slabs on top of each other
like<00:03:08.410> so<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:09.070> basically<00:03:09.700> enables<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.840> pressure

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
like so it basically enables a pressure

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.150 
like so it basically enables a pressure
plate<00:03:12.070> basically<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:13.030> pressure<00:03:13.239> plate<00:03:13.450> so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
plate basically is a pressure plate so

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.740 
plate basically is a pressure plate so
they've<00:03:15.160> also<00:03:15.430> got<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:15.970> netherrack<00:03:16.420> the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
they've also got this netherrack the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.949 
they've also got this netherrack the
netherrack<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.799> redstone<00:03:18.519> wire<00:03:19.450> pretty

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
netherrack is the redstone wire pretty

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.970 
netherrack is the redstone wire pretty
much<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:20.890> when<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.190> step<00:03:21.580> on<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.150> activates

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
much so when I step on that it activates

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.890 
much so when I step on that it activates
this<00:03:23.980> redstone<00:03:24.489> wire<00:03:24.790> here<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.450> redstone

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
this redstone wire here in the redstone

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.270 
this redstone wire here in the redstone
wire<00:03:26.650> continues<00:03:27.540> farther<00:03:28.540> this<00:03:28.690> way<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:29.280> think

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
wire continues farther this way I think

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.880 
wire continues farther this way I think
a<00:03:30.459> goes<00:03:30.940> somewhere<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.540> can't<00:03:32.500> remember<00:03:32.680> why

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
a goes somewhere I can't remember why

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.320 
a goes somewhere I can't remember why
but<00:03:33.040> it's<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.610> goes<00:03:33.730> back<00:03:33.940> there<00:03:34.120> somewhere

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
but it's it goes back there somewhere

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.460 
but it's it goes back there somewhere
and<00:03:35.549> as<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.910> can<00:03:37.030> see<00:03:37.060> what<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.360> hop<00:03:37.450> on<00:03:37.630> wall

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
and as you can see what you hop on wall

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.979 
and as you can see what you hop on wall
I<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.709> opens<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.820> I'll<00:03:40.000> go<00:03:40.150> hold<00:03:40.570> on<00:03:40.630> let<00:03:40.840> me<00:03:40.870> go

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
I it opens and I'll go hold on let me go

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.560 
I it opens and I'll go hold on let me go
back<00:03:41.170> here<00:03:41.200> real<00:03:41.470> quick<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:42.459> signal<00:03:42.850> is

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
back here real quick so this signal is

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.470 
back here real quick so this signal is
transferred<00:03:44.410> back<00:03:45.070> over<00:03:45.370> here<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.730> behind<00:03:46.390> the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
transferred back over here to behind the

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.670 
transferred back over here to behind the
structure<00:03:46.750> that's<00:03:46.900> why<00:03:47.049> this<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.440> large

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
structure that's why this is so large

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.400 
structure that's why this is so large
just<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.730> hide<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:49.060> little<00:03:49.180> red<00:03:49.750> stone<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.290> be

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
just to hide the little red stone and be

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.800 
just to hide the little red stone and be
it<00:03:50.470> behind<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.010> all<00:03:51.130> um<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:52.030> let<00:03:52.239> me<00:03:52.329> let<00:03:52.720> me

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
it behind it all um so let me let me

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.000 
it behind it all um so let me let me
just<00:03:52.989> break<00:03:53.170> some<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.799> see<00:03:53.890> if<00:03:53.920> we

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
just break some of this and see if we

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.130 
just break some of this and see if we
can<00:03:54.100> get<00:03:54.160> into<00:03:54.430> where<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.390> win<00:03:55.540> actually<00:03:55.930> um

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
can get into where that win actually um

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.729 
can get into where that win actually um
I<00:03:56.950> forgot<00:03:57.459> where<00:03:57.730> we<00:03:57.850> actually<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.360> think<00:03:59.230> this

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
I forgot where we actually I think this

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.780 
I forgot where we actually I think this
part<00:03:59.980> right<00:04:00.040> here<00:04:00.160> just<00:04:00.519> goes<00:04:00.640> straight

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
part right here just goes straight

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.630 
part right here just goes straight
underground<00:04:02.070> yes<00:04:03.070> this<00:04:03.340> part<00:04:03.549> goes

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
underground yes this part goes

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.910 
underground yes this part goes
underground<00:04:04.120> over<00:04:05.110> here<00:04:05.320> connected<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.829> the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
underground over here connected to the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.259 
underground over here connected to the
pressure<00:04:06.100> plates<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:06.610> when<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.820> step<00:04:07.030> on<00:04:07.120> this

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
pressure plates so when you step on this

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.810 
pressure plates so when you step on this
particular<00:04:07.480> pressure<00:04:08.019> plate<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.700> sends<00:04:09.700> the

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
particular pressure plate it sends the

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.949 
particular pressure plate it sends the
signal<00:04:10.269> over<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.870> this<00:04:10.989> one<00:04:11.280> through<00:04:12.280> here<00:04:12.670> and

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
signal over to this one through here and

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.120 
signal over to this one through here and
all<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.680> way<00:04:14.799> up<00:04:15.070> here<00:04:15.100> to<00:04:15.989> this<00:04:16.989> piston<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.890> I

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
all the way up here to this piston and I

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.469 
all the way up here to this piston and I
know<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.519> doesn't<00:04:18.640> look<00:04:18.760> like<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:18.970> piston<00:04:19.359> but

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
know it doesn't look like a piston but

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.050 
know it doesn't look like a piston but
the<00:04:19.570> nether<00:04:19.780> brick<00:04:19.959> acts<00:04:20.320> as<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:21.040> piston<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
the nether brick acts as a piston so the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.820 
the nether brick acts as a piston so the
signals<00:04:22.419> coming<00:04:22.510> in<00:04:22.750> on<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.110> side<00:04:23.289> it<00:04:23.470> pushes

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
signals coming in on this side it pushes

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.360 
signals coming in on this side it pushes
the<00:04:24.220> block<00:04:24.490> that's<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:25.510> this<00:04:25.840> side<00:04:26.050> of<00:04:26.200> it

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
the block that's on this side of it

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.780 
the block that's on this side of it
downward<00:04:27.370> one<00:04:27.490> block

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
downward one block

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.940 
downward one block
and<00:04:28.510> when<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:28.720> go<00:04:28.840> back<00:04:28.990> over<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.380> over<00:04:29.830> the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
and when you go back over it over the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.040 
and when you go back over it over the
pressure<00:04:30.130> plate<00:04:30.340> right<00:04:30.610> here<00:04:30.640> it<00:04:31.000> will<00:04:31.600> close

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
pressure plate right here it will close

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.440 
pressure plate right here it will close
it<00:04:32.320> so<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:33.070> also<00:04:33.340> works<00:04:33.460> for<00:04:33.580> this<00:04:33.760> side<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.210> just

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
it so it also works for this side I just

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.390 
it so it also works for this side I just
rigged<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.900> pretty<00:04:35.140> much<00:04:35.400> completely

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
rigged it pretty much completely

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.310 
rigged it pretty much completely
symmetrical<00:04:36.970> for<00:04:37.330> both<00:04:37.450> sides<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:37.960> it's<00:04:38.140> nice

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
symmetrical for both sides so it's nice

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.850 
symmetrical for both sides so it's nice
and<00:04:38.350> even<00:04:38.740> looking<00:04:39.120> all<00:04:40.120> pretty<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:41.440> this<00:04:41.710> just

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
and even looking all pretty so this just

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.670 
and even looking all pretty so this just
comes<00:04:42.070> over<00:04:42.160> here<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:43.690> mean<00:04:44.140> let<00:04:44.440> me<00:04:44.500> try<00:04:44.620> to

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
comes over here and I mean let me try to

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.270 
comes over here and I mean let me try to
dig<00:04:44.890> in<00:04:45.040> here<00:04:45.190> for<00:04:45.730> these<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.720> side<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.290> this

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
dig in here for these the side of this

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.610 
dig in here for these the side of this
gosh<00:04:48.880> dang<00:04:49.060> at<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.270> side<00:04:50.430> pistons<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:52.380> here<00:04:53.380> is

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
gosh dang at the side pistons so here is

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.830 
gosh dang at the side pistons so here is
the<00:04:53.800> little<00:04:54.070> box<00:04:54.370> area<00:04:54.880> where<00:04:55.510> you<00:04:55.690> would

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
the little box area where you would

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.170 
the little box area where you would
here's<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.560> chest<00:04:56.890> and<00:04:57.070> basically<00:04:57.880> right

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
here's the chest and basically right

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.810 
here's the chest and basically right
here<00:04:58.380> right<00:04:59.380> behind<00:04:59.530> this<00:04:59.770> area<00:05:00.130> is<00:05:00.310> our

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
here right behind this area is our

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.380 
here right behind this area is our
piston<00:05:01.470> pushing<00:05:02.470> this<00:05:03.070> block<00:05:03.460> right<00:05:03.490> here<00:05:03.670> I

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
piston pushing this block right here I

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.360 
piston pushing this block right here I
know<00:05:04.900> it's<00:05:05.140> in<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:05.350> can't<00:05:05.590> see<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.040> actual

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
know it's in you can't see the actual

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.520 
know it's in you can't see the actual
peasant<00:05:06.790> piston<00:05:07.300> right<00:05:07.480> there<00:05:07.630> but<00:05:08.410> this

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
peasant piston right there but this

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.170 
peasant piston right there but this
pushes<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.980> block<00:05:09.130> back<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:09.850> forth<00:05:10.030> between

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
pushes the block back and forth between

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.970 
pushes the block back and forth between
these<00:05:10.420> two<00:05:10.630> blocks<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.170> also<00:05:11.590> works<00:05:11.710> for<00:05:11.890> the

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
these two blocks it also works for the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.800 
these two blocks it also works for the
same<00:05:12.190> on<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.400> other<00:05:12.430> side<00:05:12.640> I<00:05:13.090> know<00:05:13.450> it's<00:05:13.660> kind

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
same on the other side I know it's kind

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.600 
same on the other side I know it's kind
of<00:05:13.840> difficult<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.290> explain<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:14.920> will<00:05:15.520> be

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
of difficult to explain I will be

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.730 
of difficult to explain I will be

plugin every feature coming along with
it<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.230> what's<00:05:23.440> actually<00:05:23.650> for<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.640> future<00:05:25.060> of

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
it and what's actually for the future of

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.840 
it and what's actually for the future of
this<00:05:25.600> plug-in<00:05:25.900> so<00:05:26.400> there's<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.490> lot<00:05:27.640> of<00:05:27.670> new

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
this plug-in so there's a lot of new

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.130 
this plug-in so there's a lot of new
things<00:05:27.880> that<00:05:28.180> are<00:05:28.270> about<00:05:28.420> to<00:05:28.570> be<00:05:28.660> added<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.020> it

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
things that are about to be added to it

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.480 
things that are about to be added to it
anyway<00:05:29.980> this<00:05:30.490> signal<00:05:30.970> connects<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.930> this<00:05:32.050> one

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
anyway this signal connects to this one

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.400 
anyway this signal connects to this one
pushing<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.790> bottom<00:05:34.180> parts<00:05:34.720> of<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:35.020> door<00:05:35.200> and

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
pushing the bottom parts of the door and

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.290 
pushing the bottom parts of the door and
then<00:05:35.980> the<00:05:36.130> signal<00:05:36.460> also<00:05:36.610> comes<00:05:36.910> up<00:05:37.030> here<00:05:37.180> to

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
then the signal also comes up here to

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.250 
then the signal also comes up here to
the<00:05:37.390> top<00:05:37.420> which<00:05:38.110> pushes<00:05:38.530> down<00:05:39.060> or<00:05:40.060> up<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.870> this

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
the top which pushes down or up the this

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.910 
the top which pushes down or up the this
part<00:05:41.500> of<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.650> door<00:05:41.800> so<00:05:42.130> we'll<00:05:42.580> go<00:05:42.730> run<00:05:43.480> over

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
part of the door so we'll go run over

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.800 
part of the door so we'll go run over
the<00:05:44.920> Pistons<00:05:45.490> one<00:05:45.850> more<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.300> pressure<00:05:46.570> plates

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
the Pistons one more the pressure plates

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.630 
the Pistons one more the pressure plates
one<00:05:46.900> more<00:05:47.020> time<00:05:47.140> and<00:05:47.380> that<00:05:48.220> will<00:05:48.340> pretty<00:05:48.520> much

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
one more time and that will pretty much

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.960 
one more time and that will pretty much
be<00:05:48.760> d.video<00:05:49.240> so<00:05:49.660> as<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:50.590> can<00:05:50.680> see<00:05:50.950> walk<00:05:51.580> over

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
be d.video so as you can see walk over

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.190 
be d.video so as you can see walk over
this<00:05:53.250> activating<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.580> little<00:05:54.910> wire<00:05:55.200> going

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
this activating the little wire going

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.950 
this activating the little wire going
around<00:05:56.470> and<00:05:56.730> there's<00:05:57.730> no<00:05:57.910> smooth<00:05:58.270> motion<00:05:58.510> with

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
around and there's no smooth motion with

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.930 
around and there's no smooth motion with
the<00:05:58.990> Pistons<00:05:59.470> obviously<00:06:00.010> and<00:06:00.700> they're<00:06:00.820> not

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
the Pistons obviously and they're not

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.560 
the Pistons obviously and they're not
that<00:06:01.120> far<00:06:01.360> into<00:06:01.480> it<00:06:01.630> yet<00:06:01.870> but<00:06:02.740> that's<00:06:03.520> that<00:06:04.000> it

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
that far into it yet but that's that it

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.940 
that far into it yet but that's that it
opens<00:06:04.870> up<00:06:04.960> just<00:06:05.170> like<00:06:05.230> a<00:06:05.290> piston<00:06:05.590> would<00:06:05.740> and

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
opens up just like a piston would and

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.460 
opens up just like a piston would and
that's<00:06:06.790> pretty<00:06:07.060> much<00:06:07.210> how<00:06:07.840> it<00:06:07.870> all<00:06:08.110> works<00:06:08.320> if

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
that's pretty much how it all works if

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.600 
that's pretty much how it all works if
you<00:06:08.500> guys<00:06:08.650> didn't<00:06:08.860> really<00:06:09.010> understand<00:06:09.400> I
