00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:15.539
 min 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.900
 conclude 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 Fatima in the process of disappearing 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.450
 in the outskirts of the city 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.940
 at that time there was a tremendous discovery 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.260
 has the competence for it 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.480
 uu 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.330
 at that time in the council 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.600
 I had warned them 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.730
 that's how a plan came about 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.730
 in the missive he has failed in his duty 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.450
 will return today from an inspection by 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.930
 we will ask our monarch to adapt 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.520
 our monarch to return 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 this problem I claim my judgment that lasted longer than one can solve 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140
 it's not about drinks 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 because is not here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 we are man is not sick 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.190
 has abused our trust 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.590
 impossible 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.330
 what evidence do they have on its impact on its 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.400
 Mr 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.620
 the picket taken from neptune 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.700
 55 minute 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.940
 can not be 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.530
 it's me and rules we have authority to take the trident 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.010
 the proof is quite clear 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.660
 I can not believe that which will be able to such club pressure until fled 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.230
 from your own lips 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.200
 but that they finish contract before receiving them because the corridors of 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.370
 trident 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.340
 apparently 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 502 guards search all atlantis 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.780
 no more dormal try to find 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.780
 the clue in the papers of the Grand Vizier 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.070
 populism and some stranger for more 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.180
 favs crisis 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.850
 unable to press 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.320
 amnesty 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.849
 credit ap 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.239
 after all the syndic 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.239
 among them was the coaching staff 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.599
 a white amethyst 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.849
 they can only be found in the forbidden caverns to many I put here 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.149
 not even insects 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.359
 but it can also be a trap 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.949
 I must take that risk 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.959
 I will go to the forbidden caverns 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.369
 since if the danger persists with his last I can save them 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.039
 and if crazed 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.759
 I must clarify that it has been my unconditional friend benjamin hickey 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.579
 boudou you should not stay 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.429
 if it's a sinister complicity, it needs someone to stay here watching 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.429
 if your eyes and your unprincipled solitaire 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.229
 yesterday starts 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.129
 when love goes to the forbidden caverns 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.129
 A strange foreboding harass your heart 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.859
 what we do is a well-founded because its deadly enemy to tumor 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.859
 watched his departure with great rejoicing 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.159
 viable god of mine said 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.829
 you go to your grave 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 no one can survive in the forest of carnivorous plants 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.209
 and if he comes home 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.209
 Terrible Barazal Caveman 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.809
 hoping that to take you to your military profile 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.959
 then the seven seas will get rid of the Napoleon prince 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.660
 and now allied albatrosses 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.660
 I have the sacred Trident of Neptune 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:52.209
 prepare the attack and invasion for now nothing 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.349
 thus he interposes before miguel toro de apandis without knowing the perverse plans 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.749
 from the grave 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:02.280
 Prince Love continues the quest for Basti with the speed of 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:04.879
 A vehicle 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.199
 in some countries 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.290
 this only means one thing the forest of carnivorous plants 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.429
 I have to face for less 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.599
 the brave princes of the tales very late of the tremendous danger 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.229
 after meeting in the new gasometer 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.710
 not far from there 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.419
 in the forbidden caverns 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.639
 the crazy ones you face the payment the men of the caverns 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.059
 I have been taken prisoner by water ski purpose of driving to 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:41.439

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.830
 let out 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.279
 and prevent hadad 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:50.369
 gasquet and find the unfathomable abysses the entrance was integrated with 

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:53.369
 the frightening men of the prairies 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.669
 but there is hope but for the salvation of the staff 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.669
 princely try 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.289
 children 2 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.800
 cruzeiro and shooting must be repeated soon 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800
 the whole city will be totally turned into ruins 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:25.110
 please love craig city council spit desperately civil 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.669

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.669
 we must withdraw 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.169
 we will evacuate the city and our town will be destroyed 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.839
 we can not think of such a thing we will do what our monarch would have 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.789
 will depend atlantist until the fifth 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:47.419
 while another site 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.900
 efe cross 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.039
 fight for his life 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.039
 a carnivorous giant clam 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.289
 caught between 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.289
 he fought for his life before the armies of he could attack him with all his care 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.330
 our forces have not prevented the enemy advance 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.819
 the shot are before our doors 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.839

 and we can not let atlantis be destroyed 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.490
 we must capitulate before the grave 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.490
 ochoa begged that he waits 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.509
 from the others 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.509
 only the crisis remains 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.809
 in which the white flag is raised
