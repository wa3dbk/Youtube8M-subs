00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
powers there's pretty basic stuff right

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050

is<00:01:52.439> basic<00:01:52.920> stuff<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.670> part<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:53.970> the

is basic stuff and it's part of the
Constitution<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.079> think<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.649> big

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
Constitution but I think one of the big

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.399 
Constitution but I think one of the big
legal<00:01:56.640> ramifications<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.750> should<00:01:58.140> come<00:01:58.380> out

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
legal ramifications that should come out

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.690 
legal ramifications that should come out
of<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.890> would<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> class<00:02:00.329> action<00:02:00.659> lawsuit

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
of this would be a class action lawsuit

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.310 
of this would be a class action lawsuit
by<00:02:02.700> all<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> those<00:02:03.329> who<00:02:03.600> had<00:02:03.810> him<00:02:04.049> as<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
by all of those who had him as a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.200 
by all of those who had him as a
constitutional<00:02:05.100> law<00:02:05.250> instructor<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.060> get

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
constitutional law instructor to get

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.440 
constitutional law instructor to get
their<00:02:06.390> money<00:02:06.659> back<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.200> think<00:02:07.259> it'd<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:08.450> lay

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
their money back I think it'd be a lay

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.630 
their money back I think it'd be a lay
down<00:02:09.629> case<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.259> them<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.739> guy<00:02:10.979> does<00:02:11.400> not
