00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.690 

but<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.900> have<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.470> add<00:01:55.620> going<00:01:56.130> back<00:01:56.370> to<00:01:56.580> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
but I do have to add going back to the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.210 
but I do have to add going back to the
tightly<00:01:56.910> coiling<00:01:57.420> method<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.920> think

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
tightly coiling method is that I think

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.310 
tightly coiling method is that I think
it<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.370> did<00:01:59.760> change<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.510> hair<00:02:00.660> structure<00:02:01.140> I

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
it really did change my hair structure I

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.920 
it really did change my hair structure I
think<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.830> really<00:02:02.010> did<00:02:02.220> break<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.730> down<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
think it really did break it down to the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.880 
think it really did break it down to the
point<00:02:04.140> where<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:05.570> am<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.080> have<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:07.590> keep

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
point where I am going to have to keep

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
ridiculously soft all times now and this

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.160 
ridiculously soft all times now and this
is<00:02:53.610> know<00:02:53.820> I'm<00:02:54.210> kind<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.630> like<00:02:54.810> tripping

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
is know I'm kind of like tripping

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.410 
is know I'm kind of like tripping
because<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.890> usually<00:02:56.340> set<00:02:56.730> my<00:02:56.760> hair<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.210> shea

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
because I usually set my hair with shea

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.949 
because I usually set my hair with shea
butter<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:59.250> feels<00:02:59.550> absolutely<00:02:59.760> bomb<00:03:00.510> in

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
butter and this feels absolutely bomb in

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.020 
butter and this feels absolutely bomb in
my<00:03:01.530> hair<00:03:01.770> right<00:03:01.950> now<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.520> wouldn't<00:03:02.880> and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
my hair right now and I wouldn't and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.790 
my hair right now and I wouldn't and
there's<00:03:03.450> no<00:03:03.630> butter<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.260> was<00:03:04.410> just<00:03:04.620> thick

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
there's no butter but it was just thick

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.990 
there's no butter but it was just thick
enough<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.250> guess<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:06.420> maybe<00:03:06.750> it'll<00:03:06.959> be<00:03:08.000> leaving

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
enough I guess so maybe it'll be leaving

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.900 
enough I guess so maybe it'll be leaving

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
here on out so like really where my as

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.020 
here on out so like really where my as
close<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.530> my<00:03:16.650> natural<00:03:16.860> texture<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.580> possible

close to my natural texture as possible

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.660 
close to my natural texture as possible
maybe<00:03:18.180> not<00:03:18.450> my<00:03:18.630> natural<00:03:19.440> curl<00:03:19.739> pattern<00:03:20.190> but

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
maybe not my natural curl pattern but

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.820 
maybe not my natural curl pattern but
I'll<00:03:20.820> definitely<00:03:21.540> be<00:03:21.720> wearing<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.140> lot<00:03:22.320> more<00:03:22.590> of

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
I'll definitely be wearing a lot more of

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.570 
I'll definitely be wearing a lot more of
my<00:03:23.010> natural<00:03:23.190> texture<00:03:24.000> out<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:25.080> about

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
my natural texture out and about

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.360 
my natural texture out and about
it's<00:03:25.910> frizzy<00:03:26.420> like<00:03:27.050> for<00:03:27.650> real<00:03:28.130> but<00:03:28.880> um<00:03:29.330> I<00:03:30.370> think

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
it's frizzy like for real but um I think

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.290 
it's frizzy like for real but um I think
that's<00:03:31.760> it

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
that's it

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.900 
that's it
so<00:03:32.720> that's<00:03:33.380> all<00:03:33.710> I've<00:03:33.890> been<00:03:33.920> doing<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.580> old

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
is built-up and that would be like after

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.830 
is built-up and that would be like after
about<00:03:44.480> five<00:03:45.170> six<00:03:45.530> seven<00:03:46.010> days<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:47.300> shea<00:03:47.600> butter

in<00:03:48.080> it<00:03:48.110> and<00:03:48.530> then<00:03:48.860> I'd<00:03:48.980> shampoo<00:03:49.430> but<00:03:49.670> I've<00:03:49.760> been

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
in it and then I'd shampoo but I've been

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.370 
in it and then I'd shampoo but I've been
doing<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.210> lot<00:03:50.360> of<00:03:50.390> co<00:03:50.600> washing<00:03:50.870> lately

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380
