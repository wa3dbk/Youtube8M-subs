sometimes<00:01:58.770> so<00:02:01.189> here's<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> setting<00:02:02.640> i've<00:02:02.759> been

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
sometimes so here's a setting i've been

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.740 
sometimes so here's a setting i've been
using<00:02:04.130> mid<00:02:05.130> control<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.819> up<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.420> think<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
using mid control is up I think the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.109 
using mid control is up I think the
newer<00:02:06.929> pedals<00:02:07.439> actually<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.549> mid

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
newer pedals actually have like a a mid

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.410 
newer pedals actually have like a a mid
nom<00:02:09.410> but
