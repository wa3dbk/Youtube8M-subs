one<00:00:05.060> of<00:00:05.180> the<00:00:05.240> things<00:00:05.420> that<00:00:05.570> I<00:00:05.600> think<00:00:05.840> is<00:00:05.960> unique

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
one of the things that I think is unique

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.200 
one of the things that I think is unique
about<00:00:06.529> petty<00:00:06.800> is<00:00:07.010> that<00:00:07.250> it's<00:00:07.490> a<00:00:07.609> school<00:00:07.910> that

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
about petty is that it's a school that

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.720 
about petty is that it's a school that
is<00:00:08.270> large<00:00:08.960> enough<00:00:09.320> so<00:00:10.100> it's<00:00:10.280> hard<00:00:10.490> for<00:00:10.670> a

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
is large enough so it's hard for a

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.790 
is large enough so it's hard for a
student<00:00:10.790> to<00:00:11.120> outgrow<00:00:11.420> petty<00:00:11.780> but<00:00:12.379> it's<00:00:12.530> small

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
student to outgrow petty but it's small

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.350 
student to outgrow petty but it's small
enough<00:00:12.830> that<00:00:13.160> it's<00:00:13.460> hard<00:00:13.700> to<00:00:13.910> fall<00:00:14.120> through

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
enough that it's hard to fall through

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.019 
enough that it's hard to fall through
the<00:00:14.450> cracks<00:00:14.720> we<00:00:15.050> have<00:00:15.290> the<00:00:16.040> facilities<00:00:16.580> the

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
the cracks we have the facilities the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.880 
the cracks we have the facilities the
curricular<00:00:17.450> programs<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.140> extracurricular

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
curricular programs the extracurricular

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.370 
curricular programs the extracurricular
programs<00:00:19.340> that<00:00:19.759> people<00:00:20.599> might<00:00:20.960> tend<00:00:21.259> to

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
programs that people might tend to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.190 
programs that people might tend to
associate<00:00:21.770> with<00:00:21.950> a<00:00:21.980> much<00:00:22.189> larger<00:00:22.489> school<00:00:23.200> and

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
associate with a much larger school and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.620 
associate with a much larger school and
petty<00:00:24.590> at<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.430> same<00:00:25.640> time<00:00:25.910> is<00:00:26.210> small<00:00:26.329> enough

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
petty at the same time is small enough

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.870 
petty at the same time is small enough
to<00:00:26.960> have<00:00:27.079> a<00:00:27.110> close-knit<00:00:27.500> community<00:00:27.880> close

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
to have a close-knit community close

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.490 
to have a close-knit community close
relationships<00:00:29.570> between<00:00:29.779> students<00:00:30.410> and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
relationships between students and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.560 
relationships between students and
faculty<00:00:30.590> members<00:00:31.309> and<00:00:31.579> so<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:31.939> think<00:00:32.090> in<00:00:32.390> some

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
faculty members and so I think in some

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.030 
faculty members and so I think in some
ways<00:00:32.720> petit<00:00:33.020> has<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.440> best<00:00:33.649> of<00:00:33.860> both<00:00:34.010> worlds

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
ways petit has the best of both worlds

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.759 
ways petit has the best of both worlds
in<00:00:34.579> that<00:00:34.640> regard<00:00:35.120> petit<00:00:35.690> is<00:00:35.809> an<00:00:35.960> open<00:00:36.380> place<00:00:36.739> in

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
in that regard petit is an open place in

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.060 
in that regard petit is an open place in
a<00:00:37.129> number<00:00:37.789> of<00:00:37.940> respects<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.629> one<00:00:39.140> of<00:00:39.289> them<00:00:39.800> is

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
a number of respects and one of them is

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.970 
a number of respects and one of them is
that<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.850> people<00:00:41.359> who<00:00:41.510> are<00:00:41.750> here<00:00:42.079> I<00:00:42.500> think<00:00:42.649> are

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
that the people who are here I think are

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.849 
that the people who are here I think are
are<00:00:43.250> not<00:00:43.640> very<00:00:43.940> concerned<00:00:44.449> about<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:45.530> lot<00:00:45.710> of

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
are not very concerned about a lot of

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.009 
are not very concerned about a lot of
external<00:00:46.370> stuff<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:47.449> there's<00:00:47.690> not<00:00:47.989> a

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
external stuff so there's not a

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.739 
external stuff so there's not a
particular<00:00:48.739> sort<00:00:49.070> of<00:00:49.129> stamped<00:00:49.999> petit<00:00:50.300> kid

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
particular sort of stamped petit kid

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.189 
particular sort of stamped petit kid
that<00:00:51.379> looks<00:00:51.739> like<00:00:52.070> this<00:00:52.519> or<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.510> steps<00:00:53.960> out<00:00:54.170> of

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
that looks like this or the steps out of

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.319 
that looks like this or the steps out of
that<00:00:54.379> catalog<00:00:55.309> our<00:00:55.579> kids<00:00:55.789> come<00:00:55.940> from<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:56.269> many

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
that catalog our kids come from so many

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.759 
that catalog our kids come from so many
different<00:00:56.480> backgrounds<00:00:56.839> so<00:00:57.379> many<00:00:57.530> different

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
different backgrounds so many different

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.009 
different backgrounds so many different
countries<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.550> they<00:00:59.239> really<00:00:59.570> get<00:00:59.690> along

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
countries and they really get along

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.590 
countries and they really get along
Petie<00:01:00.620> kids<00:01:00.949> are<00:01:01.190> here<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:02.059> learn<00:01:02.179> from<00:01:02.239> each

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
Petie kids are here to learn from each

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.899 
Petie kids are here to learn from each
other<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.379> kids<00:01:03.620> really<00:01:03.829> like<00:01:04.550> each<00:01:04.699> other

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
other the kids really like each other

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.060 
other the kids really like each other
for<00:01:05.239> being<00:01:05.390> who<00:01:05.510> they<00:01:05.540> are<00:01:05.690> which<00:01:06.650> makes<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.010> a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
for being who they are which makes it a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.620 
for being who they are which makes it a
very<00:01:07.190> safe<00:01:07.520> place<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.270> think<00:01:08.450> when<00:01:08.570> you

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
very safe place and I think when you

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.420 
very safe place and I think when you
feel<00:01:08.780> safe<00:01:09.049> then<00:01:09.590> it's<00:01:09.619> easy<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.070> step<00:01:10.220> outside

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
feel safe then it's easy to step outside

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.789 
feel safe then it's easy to step outside
your<00:01:10.850> boundaries<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.810> try<00:01:12.020> new<00:01:12.200> things

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
your boundaries and to try new things

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.080 
your boundaries and to try new things
petit<00:01:13.280> has<00:01:13.399> really<00:01:13.640> given<00:01:13.759> me<00:01:13.909> those

petit has really given me those

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.940 
petit has really given me those
opportunities<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:15.549> explore<00:01:16.549> new<00:01:17.149> avenues<00:01:17.950> but

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
opportunities to explore new avenues but

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.859
