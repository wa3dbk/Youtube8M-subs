originally<00:00:28.410> designed<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:28.769> guitar<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.580> it

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
originally designed for guitar but it

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
originally designed for guitar but it
turns<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.420> works<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:31.080> well<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
but let's hear the sound through a clean

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:01.700 
but let's hear the sound through a clean
bass<00:00:54.840> amp

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.479 

all<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.610> then<00:01:04.010> for<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.190> rambling

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
all right and then for just rambling

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.940 
all right and then for just rambling
purposes<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.120> dime<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.500> volume

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
purposes I'm going to dime the volume

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:54.740 
purposes I'm going to dime the volume
get<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.370> little<00:01:08.550> bit<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.700> grit<00:01:08.880> here

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.970 

I<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:56.220> click<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.060> full<00:01:57.330> mode<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.500> get<00:01:58.740> even

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
I can click it to full mode and get even

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:08.010 
I can click it to full mode and get even
more<00:01:59.010> low-end<00:01:59.760> thump

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:20.170 

or<00:02:09.020> back<00:02:09.350> it<00:02:09.500> off<00:02:09.620> and<00:02:09.830> still<00:02:09.980> get<00:02:10.130> some<00:02:10.280> more

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
so here there's quite a bit to the low

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.020 
so here there's quite a bit to the low
frequencies

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.410

control that other than just turning

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:57.830 
control that other than just turning
this<00:04:47.759> knob

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.500

all manner of weird things by turning

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.120 
all manner of weird things by turning
those<00:05:00.690> but<00:05:01.320> there's<00:05:01.470> another<00:05:01.680> way<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:01.889> can

just<00:05:08.790> by<00:05:08.970> turning<00:05:09.270> them<00:05:09.360> back<00:05:09.389> and<00:05:09.690> forth

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
just by turning them back and forth

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.220 
just by turning them back and forth
here's<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.590> sound<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:10.860> had
