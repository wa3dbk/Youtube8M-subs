00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.659 
this device that is the t999 and the i
747<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.869> this<00:00:20.019> is<00:00:20.109> a<00:00:20.140> 4.4<00:00:20.679> arm<00:00:20.890> it's<00:00:21.160> based<00:00:21.519> on

except for the front facing camera and a
couple<00:00:40.000> other<00:00:40.180> things<00:00:40.500> relating<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.590> the

couple other things relating to the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.650 
couple other things relating to the
keyboard<00:00:41.830> but<00:00:42.520> basically<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:43.120> ROM<00:00:43.300> is<00:00:43.480> very

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
keyboard but basically the ROM is very

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.260 
keyboard but basically the ROM is very
stable<00:00:44.070> as<00:00:45.070> you<00:00:45.400> can<00:00:45.520> tell<00:00:45.580> everything<00:00:46.090> is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
stable as you can tell everything is

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.970 
stable as you can tell everything is
running<00:00:46.450> fast<00:00:46.720> I'd<00:00:47.320> say<00:00:47.470> this<00:00:47.590> is<00:00:47.680> running<00:00:47.920> at

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
running fast I'd say this is running at

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.470 
running fast I'd say this is running at
a<00:00:48.040> full<00:00:48.190> 60<00:00:48.460> frames<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.790> second<00:00:49.120> it's<00:00:49.270> a<00:00:49.330> lot

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
a full 60 frames a second it's a lot

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.320 
a full 60 frames a second it's a lot
faster<00:00:49.690> than<00:00:49.990> 4.3<00:00:50.410> was<00:00:50.680> on<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.430> sgs3<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.240> this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
faster than 4.3 was on the sgs3 and this

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.930 
faster than 4.3 was on the sgs3 and this
is<00:00:52.420> just<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.720> alpha<00:00:53.020> built<00:00:53.200> to<00:00:53.410> so<00:00:53.950> this<00:00:54.550> isn't

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
is just a alpha built to so this isn't

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.480 
is just a alpha built to so this isn't
you<00:00:55.150> know<00:00:55.180> this<00:00:55.960> is<00:00:55.990> a<00:00:56.110> lot<00:00:56.290> faster<00:00:56.530> obviously

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
you know this is a lot faster obviously

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.560 
you know this is a lot faster obviously
the<00:00:57.700> new<00:00:57.900> projects<00:00:58.900> felt<00:00:59.110> is<00:00:59.410> working<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.570> so

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
the new projects felt is working and so

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.450 
the new projects felt is working and so
let's<00:01:01.720> just<00:01:01.900> hop<00:01:02.020> into<00:01:02.200> this<00:01:02.380> um<00:01:02.650> obviously

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
let's just hop into this um obviously

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.120 
let's just hop into this um obviously
there's<00:01:04.000> there's<00:01:04.479> no<00:01:04.629> home<00:01:04.780> button<00:01:05.130> there's

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
there's there's no home button there's

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.359 
there's there's no home button there's
no<00:01:06.310> virtual<00:01:07.270> on-screen<00:01:07.630> buttons<00:01:08.020> on<00:01:09.009> this

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
no virtual on-screen buttons on this

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.310 
no virtual on-screen buttons on this
device<00:01:09.670> because<00:01:10.119> it<00:01:10.509> comes<00:01:10.749> with<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.049> hard

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
device because it comes with the hard

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.139 
device because it comes with the hard
buttons<00:01:11.530> so<00:01:12.189> you<00:01:12.310> won't<00:01:12.579> see<00:01:12.640> that<00:01:12.820> but<00:01:13.090> you

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
buttons so you won't see that but you

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.340 
buttons so you won't see that but you
can<00:01:13.270> see<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:13.509> up<00:01:13.600> in<00:01:13.719> the<00:01:13.810> notification<00:01:14.020> bar

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
can see it up in the notification bar

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.319 
can see it up in the notification bar
it's<00:01:14.710> actually<00:01:14.829> transparent<00:01:15.670> until<00:01:15.999> you<00:01:16.119> act

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
can see here it turns translucent which

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.690 
can see here it turns translucent which
is<00:01:21.609> a<00:01:21.640> nice<00:01:21.909> touch<00:01:21.969> in<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.420> new<00:01:22.600> UI<00:01:23.549> they<00:01:24.549> got

is a nice touch in the new UI they got

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.919 
is a nice touch in the new UI they got
rid<00:01:24.819> of<00:01:24.880> hollow<00:01:25.149> so<00:01:25.420> everything<00:01:25.689> the<00:01:25.749> white

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
this is 4.3 in fact or 4.4 right here

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.099 
this is 4.3 in fact or 4.4 right here
4.4<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.689> here's<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.960> little<00:01:38.770> thing<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.479> there

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
you want to the 4.3 I think it's

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.740 
you want to the 4.3 I think it's
actually<00:03:34.960> the<00:03:35.050> same<00:03:36.000> yeah<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:37.270> working<00:03:37.600> fine

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
actually the same yeah it's working fine

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.970 
actually the same yeah it's working fine
on<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.990> back<00:03:38.140> let's<00:03:38.380> see<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.650> front<00:03:38.800> one

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
on the back let's see if the front one

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
on the back let's see if the front one
works<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:40.209> let's<00:03:40.240> just<00:03:40.630> switch<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:44.940> no<00:03:45.940> no

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
works so let's just switch it no no

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.280 
works so let's just switch it no no
actually<00:03:46.180> does<00:03:46.510> work<00:03:46.660> look<00:03:46.840> at<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:47.080> the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
actually does work look at that the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.780 
actually does work look at that the
front-facing<00:03:47.560> camera<00:03:47.890> does<00:03:48.010> work<00:03:48.130> so<00:03:48.490> in<00:03:48.700> this

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
front-facing camera does work so in this

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.130 
front-facing camera does work so in this
build<00:03:49.030> at<00:03:49.330> least<00:03:49.480> 40<00:03:50.010> t999<00:03:51.010> i<00:03:51.660> 747<00:03:52.660> my<00:03:52.990> bad

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
build at least 40 t999 i 747 my bad

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.750 
build at least 40 t999 i 747 my bad
facing<00:03:54.070> camera<00:03:54.370> does<00:03:54.550> work<00:03:54.820> oh<00:03:55.440> oh<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.700> it

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
facing camera does work oh oh so it

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.000 
facing camera does work oh oh so it
looks<00:03:57.940> like<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.209> crashes<00:03:58.660> when<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:58.930> run<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.560> it

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
looks like it crashes when you run it it

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.320 
looks like it crashes when you run it it
looks<00:04:00.190> like<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.340> could<00:04:00.550> be<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.640> memory<00:04:00.970> leak<00:04:01.150> or

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
looks like it could be a memory leak or

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.510 
looks like it could be a memory leak or
something<00:04:01.450> like<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.950> guess<00:04:03.220> we<00:04:03.430> need

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
something like that so I guess we need

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.740 
something like that so I guess we need
to<00:04:03.580> do<00:04:03.730> turn<00:04:03.910> on<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.150> front<00:04:04.300> faith<00:04:04.420> camera

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
to do turn on the front faith camera

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.790 
to do turn on the front faith camera
which<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:05.020> little<00:04:05.260> bit<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:07.630> that's<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.620> wrong

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
which a little bit so that's the wrong

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.470 
which a little bit so that's the wrong
