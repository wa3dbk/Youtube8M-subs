 warfare and let's continue with the theme 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.880
 of the envelopes on this occasion would be 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.410
 episode number 17 if I 'm not wrong 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.820
 regarding the numbering that we have 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.710
 been carrying and good basically 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.359
 we are unlocking what is an envelope 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.160
 spectacular I say lately we have 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.050
 unlocked enough characters and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
 through the stickers watching me the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.260
 spectacular by different things 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.849
 but well I think that most of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.010
 characters we're already pretty close to 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.869
 finish them and obviously with this 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.399
 every time we are completing more what is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.750
 the game as such so let's go guys 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.340
 there on this occasion for this video 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.350
 I have a little bit more than it is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.030
 half a million coins since they did not have 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.379
 a long time to keep moving forward and this 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.850
 I say for those who have been watching 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.129
 lately the videos have more or less 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 seen how it's been like my 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.399
 progress regarding the most currencies 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.539
 doubles how is that been going up how 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.520
 is that I have been running out 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.750
 regarding the videos and such but good 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.280
 guys today I'll stay with a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.199
 a little less half a million obviously 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.750
 making this expenditure of 40 thousand coins 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.190
 that I will give at this time and nothing guys 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.440
 equally so that you have a couple of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.719
 level 9 envelopes the characters the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.560
 which also aims to unlock 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.869
 I say to do a little bit more 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.790
 no less the subject so let's go there 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.829
 about songs level 9 I will try to 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.390
 do it also here I say no matter salt 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.039
 just like that to try that 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.780
 just notice it and well we have here 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.399
 a piece of what is the character that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.070
 go out to level 10 we have auto revive 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.860
 for three and we have to act in pots 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.090
 so let's continue with what is 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.799
 expert has jumped to level 9 which 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.170
 it's also going to be a piece of the soldier 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.700
 Level 10 and 2 extra stuff out there 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.649
 and perfectly as we had 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.840
 planned we have here a piece of the 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.690
 soldier this is a goalkeeper for three and 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.369
 super fever a gesture for the soldiers 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.530

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.759
 really there are not many characters of 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.110
 done there is no character that 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.640
 missing full so it's already 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.959
 completely unknown what should 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.299

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.119

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.540
 to finish it and we do not have to have 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.630

 joints whenever it regenerates 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.110
