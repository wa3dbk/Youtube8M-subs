 hi dear friends with you Vlad and this 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.590
 another review of the mod for the game minecraft 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.980
 version 1 62 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.900
 This mod is dedicated to tourism and all 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.130
 subjects are devoted to tourism 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.739
 let's consider them so this mod 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.109
 adds us a tent and a sleeping bag 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:26.739
 on which we can naturally sleep 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:30.119
 still this mod adds us such 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:35.289
 bonfire but there is a lot of nastya 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.609
 Here is an example of this fire that's so now they 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.210
 not all these fires 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:46.269
 they differ only in strength and for what 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:52.629
 us a fire so we go marshmallows 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:55.749
 there we kraft marshmallow ourselves then dress 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.600

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.979

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:10.390

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.409

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.500
 this mod 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.680

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.440

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.900
