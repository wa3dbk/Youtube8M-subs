one with the most students for that
class<00:04:10.260> associated<00:04:11.260> with<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.740> then<00:04:11.980> all

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
class associated with it and then all

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.590 
class associated with it and then all
the<00:04:12.580> other<00:04:12.610> access<00:04:13.000> points<00:04:13.030> will<00:04:13.360> trade

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
the other access points will trade

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.840 
the other access points will trade
information<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.320> that<00:04:14.470> access<00:04:15.250> point<00:04:15.490> and

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
information to that access point and

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.940 
information to that access point and
that's<00:04:15.940> automatic<00:04:16.510> by<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.720> way<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.170> don't

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
that's automatic by the way so you don't

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.380 
that's automatic by the way so you don't
have<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.130> do<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:18.280> we<00:04:18.700> just<00:04:18.910> chose<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.299> one

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
have to do that we just chose the one

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.550 
have to do that we just chose the one
that<00:04:19.540> has<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.690> most<00:04:19.930> students<00:04:20.200> connect<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.440> do

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
that has the most students connect to do
