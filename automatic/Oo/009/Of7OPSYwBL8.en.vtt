so i was like oh no I'm not and so back
then<00:01:32.759> no<00:01:32.970> internet<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> spent<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> lot<00:01:33.930> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
then no internet so I spent a lot of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
then no internet so I spent a lot of
time<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> library<00:01:34.500> reading<00:01:34.979> about<00:01:35.850> this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
time the library reading about this

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
time the library reading about this
problem<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.659> discovered<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.590> really

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
problem and discovered what it really

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.920 
problem and discovered what it really

oil<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.329> lot<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> people<00:01:51.750> are<00:01:51.869> allergic<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
oil a lot of people are allergic to that

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.380 
oil a lot of people are allergic to that
on<00:01:52.619> their<00:01:52.770> skin<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.310> actually<00:01:53.909> creates<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
on their skin it actually creates a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
on their skin it actually creates a
airtight<00:01:55.380> seal<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.549> happens<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.939> that

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
airtight seal and what happens is that

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.609 
airtight seal and what happens is that
bacteria<00:01:57.570> sits<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.229> sinks<00:01:58.500> into

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
bacteria sits in there and sinks into

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.080 
bacteria sits in there and sinks into
the<00:01:58.799> pores<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> your<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.759> immune<00:01:59.969> system

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the pores and your your immune system

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.760 
the pores and your your immune system
reacts<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> breakout<00:02:01.409> because

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
reacts and you get the breakout because

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.770 
reacts and you get the breakout because
that's<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> block<00:02:02.700> poor<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.540> if

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that's all it is is a block poor but if

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.080 
that's all it is is a block poor but if
you're<00:02:04.140> eating<00:02:04.740> poorly<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> lot

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and cause acne no no no no what it is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.730 
and cause acne no no no no what it is
not<00:02:13.510> does<00:02:13.870> not<00:02:13.900> what<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.410> does<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.710> it

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
not does not what it does is it

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.010 
not does not what it does is it
increases<00:02:15.430> oil<00:02:15.670> production<00:02:15.940> which<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
increases oil production which the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.710 
increases oil production which the
bacteria<00:02:17.530> lives<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.330> plays<00:02:19.690> a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
bacteria lives on so that it plays a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.450 
bacteria lives on so that it plays a
role<00:02:20.050> but<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.380> does<00:02:20.500> not<00:02:20.650> actually<00:02:20.860> cause<00:02:21.280> it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
role but it does not actually cause it

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.970 
role but it does not actually cause it
it's<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.700> bacteria<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.240> causes<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.260> trying

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
it's a bacteria that causes it so trying

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.680 
it's a bacteria that causes it so trying
to<00:02:24.010> dry<00:02:24.250> out<00:02:24.400> your<00:02:24.430> skin<00:02:24.610> what<00:02:25.240> does<00:02:25.360> your<00:02:25.480> skin

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
to dry out your skin what does your skin

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.750 
to dry out your skin what does your skin
do<00:02:25.840> produce<00:02:26.260> more<00:02:26.440> oil<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.310> that's<00:02:27.580> where

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
do produce more oil so that's where

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.100 
do produce more oil so that's where
people<00:02:28.000> go<00:02:28.150> wrong<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.660> talk<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> lot<00:02:29.020> about

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
people go wrong and I talk a lot about

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.050

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
really true it is and the bacteria

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.230 
really true it is and the bacteria
doesn't<00:02:38.500> like<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.459> doesn't<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:40.180> doesn't
