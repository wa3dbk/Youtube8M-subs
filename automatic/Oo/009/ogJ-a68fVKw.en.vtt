00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.229
 oh god that heads 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.840
 and you brought me to the picture to teach them 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.080
 motril you did not see that he just arrived from 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.190
 another dimension to nobody did you bring me something 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.730
 or not 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.730
 do not 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.600
 and go your way 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:38.570
 ok let's go the most grandfather 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:41.720
 on the flight once you know what happened 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.940
 yes yes and I know what happened he told me 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.470
 same from the other dimension not obviously 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.360
 I'm more handsome 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.390
 but for some reason I go in caiber 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.950
 also but I do not know where it will be gone 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.630
 that can wait now for something that 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.810
 you should know about this from 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.680
 travel through the dimensions 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.680
 what's going on 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.860
 I come to explain what happened in this 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.330
 funny power point look when the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.530
 outlet tricks is from all of you 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.840
 found in the same dimension 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.869
 something happened that the truth I could not 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.360
 explain by getting together so much of that power 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.070
 a shock is created beyond the power of 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.110
 any of the affairs of either 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.340
 of the dimensions that's why I 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.990
 I met with fries photo after 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.939
 play put the queue in the population already 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.560
 break the veil that we said every time 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.569
 he had to take his ex name to one of 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.819
 points 3 in the different places 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.350
 that we put in the dimensions if something 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.810
 this was the case 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.390
 what are points 3 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.920
 the 3 points my dear see are certain 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.380
 points taken in different parts of the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.150
 guarded world clear where only the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.760
 non- metric holders could pass 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.790
 that is, it has traps that do not work 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.040
 with me 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.020
 no no if they work and you can get the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.899
 dirt silvio the link 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.289
 and what would happen if I'm not going to stop 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:12.629
 work in 5 years good but there's still 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:17.700
 five years galvanic time or one day 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.700
 mom give me the lunch box I'm going on a trip 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.190
 very well I could not go with you but 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.860
 now you have to take to the point 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.860
 Exactly sad I think it's fine 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.629
 I'm ready we put a boy 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.840
 intelligence that will take you without any 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:44.060
 problem of this point trips 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.060
 this was from the motorcycle 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.140
 humans 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.000
 you hear what happens because to 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.120
 you say goodbye to a princess 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.260
 this insect 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.050
 i am 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.710
 now you put on 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.710
 now 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.099
 ok that was weird 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.230
 good will be time to look for the point 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.129
 tricks alone 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.129
 I'm afraid 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.040
 the scenography of the base the achievements 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.300
 that you gave me can not spend on another 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.300
 thing that this guy loves 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.500
 good just hungry frustrated should 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:05.010
 look for point 3 that remove the eclipse 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.010
 its ringing 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.080
 what happens by the way since there was the 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.380
 presence of animals in yours right now 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.570
 it comes out that China is the one who created 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.340
 these names there is that they taught me a 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.160
 program to create names so it's 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.530
 very nice but but but I eat like 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.230
 who thinks that does not stop me for an animal 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.680
 this companion 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:35.620
 ok hopefully out who said jobs 4 or 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.260
 a saurian is chosen because the 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.260
 will choose how to direct this player 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.660
 OK 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:53.630
 generally beetle face and you what 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.620
 wave process it interesting see me and I 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:01.210
 they chose in my two 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.790
 well better stop playing ham bull with 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.860
 the ham good if we want this 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.599
 work we should be 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:13.000
 and trustworthy in the other and now I 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:16.599
 he wanted me not to know he nurtures him that he 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.669
 he chose for something he should be but not you 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.360
 worry that I'm going to help you in everything 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.840
 what you can 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.500
 and now the important thing is to look for the point 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.810
 3 because if we do not wash ourselves we have left 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.400
 time and this thing is spoiled 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.500
 have a good point should look for the point 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.930
 text right now what if you 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.960
 We asked the lord there that here the 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:43.509
 Lord now hey 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:46.180
 they look for point 3 and so to know something of 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.770
 so look, I found a guy who 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.720
 it looks like pure bone that has gone through 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.720
 here looking for the same thing I take a photo 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.930
 tell me everything you know about that person 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.460
 bones okay I tell you today they say the 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.080
 caribe is around here you have to have 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.080
 caber care yes 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.550
 yes 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.699
 or in case you have to be very careful and 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:15.380
 I think we should hide and give 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:17.210
 uned should not be the monkey 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.220
 and after that he meets billy and 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.650
 mandy almost half because she dances 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.600
 slime now I understand very well what 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.890
 you want to say this is getting very 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.810
 important 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:34.720
 ametex that we have to save what 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:36.370
 I want to grab and that's why after 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.410
 of that they take a billy mann and the air 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.870
 because nobody saw it and I think that if 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.910
 not a weird thing should 10 be nonsense 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.500
 they do not put us the cartoon network for 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.600
 design and now where we put it the 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.580
 I do not know if they know that gap 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.100
 it looks like it could be videos has face 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:55.960
 of the point tricks point atrix ok 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.960
 I was swimming in Havana 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:05.810
 God is sounding weird 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.550
 to see with permission you did not see 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.420
 all right you got it in the tricks point 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.450
 today and from him except the day 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.670
 where I was in now do not notice and so 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.920
 our heroes saved the day again 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.230
 I include myself a new friend who was a chef 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.020
 cook but it burned your face and you 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.330
 again did the omni pandev in the 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.250
 motorcycles will continue using your damn machine 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.580
 to create names I achieved from the 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:33.480
 next 8 and unleashed aliens 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.340
 by the way caliber is quite an idiot 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.010
 in the previous chapter of aliens 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.050
 unleashed the grandfather max law to all 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.660
 plumbers who added has a new weapon 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.250
 it is a deadly machine that brings 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.350
 to different villains of different 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.670
 dimensions so I came with the command 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.650
 in the last mission that is to catch 

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.360
 cold and he succeeds but to Gregory with 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.670
 all the villains decided to kill cold 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.830
 already good but in that the others arrive 

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.830
 green 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.700
 and loves and remember it can be up to 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.340
 baby view 

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:06.650
 Ventilate and tell me but that's what 

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.650
 come from this country vision
