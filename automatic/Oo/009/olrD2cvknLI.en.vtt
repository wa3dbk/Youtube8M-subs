00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.609
 hey dude last time was unusual 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.070
 release about some idiot from 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.880
 Internet the second time such hack work is not 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.890
 will pass guys calmer this time all 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.500
 what I want to show you was happening 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 it is on television that means reasons 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.390
 for panic no and not normal release 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.100
 because the main character will be no light 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.980
 Yakovlev or Gauguin suns 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.550
 and vocalist punk rock band Michael 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.309
 potted pot 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 I'll tell you right away how I like creativity 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.120
 groups king and jester 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.190
 but here's the behavior of Mikhail Yuryevich now 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.770
 Recently, alarming me and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.379
 today we will enjoy one of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.809
 I hope the last interviews of the maestro 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.390
 everyone will find something new for themselves 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.570
 between rocky we only exist 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.280
 friendship other friendship just can't 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:13.140
 no absolute 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.670
 no brokers only five years old 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.549
 one football team 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.650
 how many of you and I have gone together 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.310
 I did not even think that the game could 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.100
 to combine 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.280
 I did not think that we would be with you 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.619
 friends dude are you crazy? 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.630
 what the fuck friends like she's friendship there 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.299
 between the players you are a TV in general 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.990
 look i don't understand are friends only 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.990
 brokers 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.799
 but the further the more interesting because Michael 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.060
 always famous for his skill very 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:51.590
 move smoothly from one topic to another 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 only brokers and they 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.820
 let's say bone kinchev 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.820
 he we as a tutor definitely but 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:12.989
 the sea from the destroy Russian rock such 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.590
 there were never more than I'm fine 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.049
 I understand you destroy Russian rock 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.080
 great but sorry how 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:25.049
 This is due to the thesis that is friendly 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.680
 only rockers though digging a little deeper 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:31.319
 I understood what Michael is probably talking about 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.690
 true friendship exists only between 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.680
 those rockers which unites 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.489
 any goal in this case is 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.950
 destruction of russian rock 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.950
 In general, I think it's worth doing a little 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.079
 a remark for people who don't follow 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.299
 King and the Fool 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.579
 most likely only one fact is known 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.590
 that this team is the brightest 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.410
 representative of russian rock 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.329
 and here the vocalist of the group declares that he 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.850
 This Russian rock is going to 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.160
 destroy at least this 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.319
 saying may seem strange 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.569
 the thing is that Michael Potenev 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.940
 is ardent supporter of western 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.859
 music in his opinion are the people who 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.260
 stood at the origins of Russian rock 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.780
 did not pay enough attention to music 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.239
 component and the main emphasis made 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.310
 on the text and it happened 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.349
 the reason is that at the time in the country not 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.319
 It was normal tools but 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.230
 now is not there and Michael calls 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.940
 learn to play these most musical 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.040
 tools and thereby increase 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.590
 the quality of the musical component in 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.720
 songs but as we go on completely 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.440
 a group recently went on a tour of 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:48.890
 Germany in Germany the bald 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:51.800
 I am all Russian ambassadors to hell why and 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.540
 there were such assholes who 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.880
 shifted songs 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.390
 the sorcerer's dolls there are rocks there with this 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.400
 heat everything to hell again small 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.040
 remark sorcerer's doll 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.040
 jump from the cliff is very famous 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.500
 songs of the group but not written by michael 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.480
 Mountains sky and Andrei Prince old 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.030
 vocalist of the group who left 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.720
 collective a couple of years ago and now by 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.519
 apparently everyone who sings these songs 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.450
 automatically go to hell and become 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.090
 assholes 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.520
 people came to the concert paid money 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.980
 and eventually were sent only because 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.560
 that performed songs that Michael 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.650
 of himself happily sang for 20 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.650
 years old 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.550
 since recently there was a fight well lovers 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.860
 dull channel and count me fit 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.740
 start this trouble does not speak does not mean 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.139
 the best releases 3 motived first 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.060
 issues well of course I sent troops to us 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.030
 you eat this jerk and hall 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.680
 please because I remember everyone already 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.600
 It is known that I have long disowned 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.310
 Well, you knew that first 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.690
 releases it was not that level and like that 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.090
 in general, you need to know about it 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.090
 respect your idol i believe 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.149
 but maybe a pot at least us 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.759
 explain why he did so with 

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:30.029
 by my fans I did it just like that 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:34.050
 to hazel 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:38.279
 Czechs the Germans had more to concern 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:42.689
 the farther into the forest the more firewood we are 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:45.719
 more gathered all the same check is not Russian 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:48.089
 public what's the matter I'm honestly not 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:49.399
 was at a concert in germany and therefore not 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:52.409
 I can with absolute certainty 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:54.300
 declare who was there but 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.099
 trust the person who is so 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.519
 original answers questions 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.919
 I, alas, also can not judging by the video 

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:03.929
 reviews on the forums there just was 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.749
 most Russians would venture to suggest 

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:08.879
 what the team members saw in the hall 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:11.399
 some Russians decided not to upset 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:14.129
 their ideological leader poured a glass 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:17.579
 little more than usual and there is a matter of 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:20.699
 technology and the germans and the czech and even 

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:22.979
 the Portuguese at the concert no problem this 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.159
 it was definitely cool pot always 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:28.259
 differed extraordinary interviews and 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:31.740
 unconventional behavior but the last 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.519
 fascination scare me a little though in 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.529
 the first place 

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:37.079
 Michael Gorshenev for me has always been 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.449
 creative person who writes 

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:40.169
 good songs has a bright stage 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.050
 form 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:45.149
 and the rest, in general, is not so important 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.829
 in conclusion I want to say that if you 

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:49.469
 there are some videos with a bang with 

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:51.959
 television please send us 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:53.939
 All this is good in a personal on youtube and on 

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:57.559
 today it's all thank you for 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.559
 attention and see you soon 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.330
 I have
