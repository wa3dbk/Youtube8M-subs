00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and 32 Renesys yep and this is actually

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.360 
and 32 Renesys yep and this is actually
going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> difficult<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> call

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
going to be a difficult one to call

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
going to be a difficult one to call
because<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> go<00:00:55.379> down

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
because it all it's all going to go down

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.810 
because it all it's all going to go down
to<00:00:55.590> whether<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.280> their<00:00:56.460> bombs<00:00:56.640> off

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
to whether they can get their bombs off

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.189 
to whether they can get their bombs off
correctly<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> start<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> match<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
correctly at the start of the match I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.049 
correctly at the start of the match I
think<00:01:01.129> we<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.520> they're<00:01:02.699> Devils

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
think we can see that they're Devils

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.910 
think we can see that they're Devils

from huzzah team just flying out towards
what<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.210> presume<00:01:06.450> would<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> stealth

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
what what I presume would be the stealth

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.340 
what what I presume would be the stealth
bombers<00:01:07.729> from<00:01:08.729> star<00:01:09.330> fraction<00:01:09.570> really

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
bombers from star fraction really

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
bombers from star fraction really
releasing<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> ton<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.130> bombs<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.780> at

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
releasing a ton of bombs I can see at

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
releasing a ton of bombs I can see at
least<00:01:12.990> five<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.409> six<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.460> on

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
least five or six of them just going on

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.520 
least five or six of them just going on
the<00:01:14.640> field<00:01:14.850> don't<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.020> they're<00:01:16.140> actually

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the field don't think they're actually

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.190 
the field don't think they're actually
doing<00:01:16.680> too<00:01:17.100> much<00:01:17.369> damage<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.060> point<00:01:18.330> cuz

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
doing too much damage at this point cuz

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.960 
doing too much damage at this point cuz
I'm<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.500> taking<00:01:19.890> any<00:01:20.040> damage<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.520> all<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
I'm not taking any damage at all and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.539 
I'm not taking any damage at all and
star<00:01:21.299> fraction<00:01:21.570> already<00:01:22.350> losing<00:01:22.650> their

star fraction already losing their
frigates<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.479> well<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
frigates and as well as I think one of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.980 
frigates and as well as I think one of
their<00:01:25.770> stealth<00:01:26.009> bombers<00:01:26.400> yeah<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
their stealth bombers yeah that was a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.569 
their stealth bombers yeah that was a
pretty<00:01:28.290> dumb<00:01:28.530> ass<00:01:28.680> move<00:01:28.979> by<00:01:29.100> star<00:01:29.369> fraction

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
pretty dumb ass move by star fraction

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
pretty dumb ass move by star fraction
they<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.060> basically<00:01:30.420> floated<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.140> our

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
they just basically floated with our

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.190 
they just basically floated with our
Daredevils<00:01:31.470> into<00:01:32.009> her<00:01:32.130> into<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.930> bombing<00:01:33.930> run

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
Daredevils into her into a bombing run

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.010 
Daredevils into her into a bombing run
from<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> bunch<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.890> stealth<00:01:35.130> bombers<00:01:35.460> um

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
believe one to run us that was actually

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950 
believe one to run us that was actually

first slept near down from star fraction

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.219 
first slept near down from star fraction
as<00:01:54.000> well<00:01:55.369> celeb<00:01:56.369> nur<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.450> went<00:01:57.899> down

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
as well celeb nur just it just went down

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.350 
as well celeb nur just it just went down
in<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.680> boom<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.490> I'm<00:01:59.759> not<00:01:59.909> sure<00:02:00.149> why<00:02:00.329> that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
in a boom like I'm not sure why that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
in a boom like I'm not sure why that
went<00:02:00.899> down<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.320> quickly<00:02:01.880> considering<00:02:02.880> they

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
went down so quickly considering they

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.700 
went down so quickly considering they
have<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> scimitar<00:02:04.259> from<00:02:04.409> wrapping

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
have you know a scimitar from wrapping

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.380 
have you know a scimitar from wrapping
although<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.460> roofs<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:05.820> probably<00:02:06.240> still

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
although the roofs are probably still

although the roofs are probably still
you<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.380> keeping<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.190> place<00:02:08.429> like

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
you know like keeping them in place like

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.520 
you know like keeping them in place like
the<00:02:09.209> last<00:02:09.420> time<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.869> would<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.229> star

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the last time I would think that star

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.900 
the last time I would think that star
fraction<00:02:10.770> would<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.489> know<00:02:11.520> maybe

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
fraction would have you know maybe

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.490 
fraction would have you know maybe

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.140 
minmatar team being jammed by ropes but
it<00:02:16.410> seems<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.740> they're<00:02:16.980> they're<00:02:17.730> actually

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
it seems like they're they're actually

cell<00:02:53.610> fraction<00:02:54.890> yeah<00:02:55.890> i<00:02:55.950> think<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.459> star

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
cell fraction yeah i think the star

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.910 
cell fraction yeah i think the star
fraction<00:02:57.060> cemeteries<00:02:57.750> are<00:02:57.780> hardly<00:02:58.440> doing<00:02:58.680> any

released any maintenance BOTS drones at
all<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.560> see<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> ton<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.550> warriors<00:03:06.270> on<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.570> field

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
all I see a ton of warriors on the field

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.840 
all I see a ton of warriors on the field
and<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.130> ton<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.340> also<00:03:08.820> Hornet<00:03:09.630> ec<00:03:10.320> ec<00:03:11.070> 300

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.260 
and a ton of also Hornet ec ec 300
drones<00:03:12.500> just<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.739> floating<00:03:14.430> around<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:15.209> I

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
drones just just floating around so I

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.180 
drones just just floating around so I
think<00:03:15.390> scimitars<00:03:16.170> not<00:03:16.530> really<00:03:16.830> doing<00:03:16.980> too

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
think scimitars not really doing too

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.670 
think scimitars not really doing too
much<00:03:17.280> rapping<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.780> star<00:03:19.049> fraction<00:03:19.290> side

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
much rapping on the star fraction side

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.070 
much rapping on the star fraction side
as<00:03:20.489> they<00:03:20.700> lose<00:03:20.910> another<00:03:21.150> Tyranus<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.019> looks

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
as they lose another Tyranus so it looks

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.560 
as they lose another Tyranus so it looks
really<00:03:22.709> bad<00:03:22.860> for<00:03:23.040> them<00:03:23.160> right<00:03:23.310> now<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.760> had

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
really bad for them right now I had

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.000 
really bad for them right now I had
thought<00:03:24.750> before<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:25.350> they<00:03:25.500> would<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.980> know

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
thought before that they would you know

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.530 
thought before that they would you know
go<00:03:26.280> straight<00:03:26.580> for<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.790> stealth<00:03:27.090> bombers<00:03:27.420> from

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.229 
um wow looks like as I was going to take
this<00:04:06.900> quite<00:04:07.320> comfortably<00:04:10.640> yeah<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:12.030> seems

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
this quite comfortably yeah it seems

like a like I said before the rocks are
probably<00:04:15.030> fit<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:16.229> counter<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.950> exact

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
probably fit to counter this exact

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.610 
probably fit to counter this exact
moment<00:04:17.609> herself<00:04:18.180> which<00:04:18.390> makes<00:04:18.660> me<00:04:18.810> wonder<00:04:19.290> if

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
moment herself which makes me wonder if

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.529 
moment herself which makes me wonder if
this<00:04:19.799> was<00:04:19.950> more<00:04:20.130> than<00:04:20.190> just<00:04:20.310> just<00:04:20.790> one<00:04:21.090> you

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
this was more than just just one you

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.240 
this was more than just just one you
know<00:04:21.630> isolated<00:04:22.140> case<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.440> intelligence<00:04:23.010> leak

know isolated case of intelligence leak

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.450 
know isolated case of intelligence leak
here<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.810> know<00:04:24.930> if<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.440> were<00:04:25.650> them<00:04:25.919> if<00:04:26.250> I

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
here and you know if I were them if I

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.350 
here and you know if I were them if I
wished<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:26.789> fraction

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
wished I fraction

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.760 
wished I fraction
would<00:04:27.509> probably<00:04:28.050> not<00:04:28.169> feel<00:04:28.379> the<00:04:28.530> same
