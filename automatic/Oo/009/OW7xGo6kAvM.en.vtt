shrimpers<00:00:04.770> rider<00:00:05.040> made<00:00:05.359> it<00:00:06.359> took<00:00:06.750> us<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.960> good

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
shrimpers rider made it took us a good

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.820 
shrimpers rider made it took us a good
like<00:00:07.319> six<00:00:07.710> hours<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:09.019> it's<00:00:10.019> essentially<00:00:10.620> it's

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
like six hours and it's essentially it's

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.700 
like six hours and it's essentially it's
not<00:00:11.010> really<00:00:11.370> long<00:00:11.610> race<00:00:11.880> map<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.480> it's<00:00:13.200> like<00:00:13.440> a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
not really long race map but it's like a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.160 
not really long race map but it's like a
minute<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.370> half<00:00:14.400> max<00:00:15.049> basically<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.139> just

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
minute and a half max basically you just

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.460 
minute and a half max basically you just
try<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.560> get<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.920> end<00:00:17.720> but<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:19.199> trick<00:00:19.439> is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
try and get to the end but the trick is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.189 
try and get to the end but the trick is
during<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.189> whole<00:00:20.430> time<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.510> kill

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
during this whole time you have kill

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.170 
during this whole time you have kill
balls<00:00:22.410> chasing<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:25.189> I'm<00:00:26.189> gonna<00:00:26.369> put<00:00:27.119> this

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
balls chasing you so I'm gonna put this

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.650 
balls chasing you so I'm gonna put this
in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> description<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:29.760> link<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> map

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
essentially just race except you make it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.389 
essentially just race except you make it
to<00:00:38.340> where<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.489> only<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.820> one<00:00:39.030> life<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399
