00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:05.880 
this particular pump ran dry again the

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.300 
this particular pump ran dry again the
water<00:00:06.450> level<00:00:06.810> was<00:00:07.140> low<00:00:07.380> I<00:00:07.649> spit<00:00:07.979> out<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.160> water

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.310

level get to low and there's no diverter
in<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> skimmer<00:00:10.470> so<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.520> just<00:00:11.670> ran<00:00:11.880> dry<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
in the skimmer so it just ran dry and

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.050 
in the skimmer so it just ran dry and
this<00:00:13.200> pump<00:00:13.740> has<00:00:13.860> been<00:00:13.920> replumb<00:00:14.430> several<00:00:14.820> times

this pump has been replumb several times
because<00:00:15.300> of<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.840> so<00:00:16.439> right<00:00:16.560> now<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.830> not

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
because of that so right now it's not

that real quick one more time and if you
leak<00:01:49.710> without<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.039> Union<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.429> want<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> just

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
leak without the Union you want to just

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.039 
leak without the Union you want to just
put<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.179> on<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.659> tie<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:52.020> tight

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
put it on here and tie it really tight

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.120 
put it on here and tie it really tight
that<00:01:55.049> should<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.289> should<00:01:55.470> allow<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.829> pool

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that should that should allow the pool

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.279 
that should that should allow the pool
to<00:01:56.250> Prime<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.970> I've<00:01:57.240> had<00:01:57.450> pools<00:01:57.689> run<00:01:57.960> for

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
to Prime and I've had pools run for

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.690 
to Prime and I've had pools run for
months<00:01:58.500> actually<00:01:59.039> with<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> paper<00:01:59.429> bag

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
if you have a pool without a union just

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.460 
if you have a pool without a union just
put<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.090> right<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> front<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> pump

right there and tie it really tight and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.029 
right there and tie it really tight and
you<00:02:09.899> should<00:02:10.049> be<00:02:10.170> able<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.319> prime<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.890> way

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you should be able to prime it that way

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.400 
you should be able to prime it that way
and<00:02:11.160> keep<00:02:11.310> cool<00:02:11.850> actually<00:02:12.000> running<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
front of the pump leaks you have a leak

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.640 
front of the pump leaks you have a leak
also<00:02:23.459> from<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:23.940> area<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.260> should<00:02:25.410> seal

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
also from this area and this should seal

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.449 
also from this area and this should seal
it<00:02:25.709> until<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.099> get<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.310> repaired

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.250 

and<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.060> second<00:02:31.360> gun<00:02:31.480> at<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.689> crime<00:02:31.840> actually

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.490 

oh<00:02:37.140> boy

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.440 

go<00:02:41.010> ahead<00:02:41.160> turn<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.460> hose<00:02:41.610> off<00:02:41.820> see<00:02:42.120> if<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.270> get

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
go ahead turn the hose off see if I get

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.870 
go ahead turn the hose off see if I get
school<00:02:42.660> section<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.380> turn<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.130> hose<00:02:44.280> off<00:02:44.550> why

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
school section I turn the hose off why

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.250 
school section I turn the hose off why
it's<00:02:45.060> trying<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> Prime<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.870> see<00:02:45.990> if<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.170> can

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
it's trying to Prime and see if it can

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.750 
it's trying to Prime and see if it can
suck<00:02:46.500> water<00:02:46.740> through<00:02:47.040> now<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.460> got<00:02:47.580> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
suck water through now that I got it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.160 
suck water through now that I got it
started<00:02:50.060> okay<00:02:51.060> I'm<00:02:51.210> gonna<00:02:51.330> pull<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.690> out<00:02:51.900> it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
started okay I'm gonna pull this out it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.690 
started okay I'm gonna pull this out it
looks<00:02:52.320> like<00:02:52.380> it's<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:52.830> priming<00:02:53.490> good

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
looks like it's actually priming good

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.070 
looks like it's actually priming good
now<00:02:56.120> that's<00:02:57.120> why<00:02:57.270> it's<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.510> crucial<00:02:57.750> not<00:02:58.050> to

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
now that's why it's so crucial not to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.360 
now that's why it's so crucial not to
let<00:02:58.290> your<00:02:58.380> water<00:02:58.590> level<00:02:58.770> get<00:02:59.010> low<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.250> your

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
let your water level get low in your

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.370 
let your water level get low in your
pool<00:02:59.550> otherwise<00:02:59.880> it'll<00:03:00.150> cause<00:03:00.330> many<00:03:00.870> leaks<00:03:01.170> in

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
pool otherwise it'll cause many leaks in

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.340 
pool otherwise it'll cause many leaks in
your<00:03:01.410> plumbing
