video to let you know what to expect

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.360 
video to let you know what to expect
after<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.730> rollers<00:00:06.150> have<00:00:06.509> dried<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.560> I've<00:00:08.099> set

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
after the rollers have dried so I've set

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.549 
after the rollers have dried so I've set
under<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.670> dryer<00:00:08.910> for<00:00:09.389> about<00:00:09.420> 50<00:00:10.050> minutes<00:00:10.380> and

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
under the dryer for about 50 minutes and

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.110 
under the dryer for about 50 minutes and
again<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.160> why<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.370> love<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.969> mesh

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
again this is why I love the mesh

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.520 
again this is why I love the mesh
rollers<00:00:12.450> because<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.230> magnetic

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
rollers because with the magnetic

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.200 
rollers because with the magnetic
rollers<00:00:13.980> I'm<00:00:14.160> usually<00:00:14.280> under<00:00:15.030> there<00:00:15.179> for

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
rollers I'm usually under there for

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.519 
rollers I'm usually under there for
about<00:00:15.360> an<00:00:15.540> hour<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> half<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.230> kind<00:00:16.500> of

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
about an hour and a half so kind of

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.340 
about an hour and a half so kind of
almost<00:00:16.859> cuts<00:00:17.039> my<00:00:17.160> time<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.550> half<00:00:18.020> but<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.050> get

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
almost cuts my time in half but you get

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.040 
almost cuts my time in half but you get
the<00:00:19.770> same<00:00:20.010> results<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:21.300> as<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.869> see

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the same results because as you can see

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.990 
the same results because as you can see
that<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.619> rollers<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.220> mesh<00:00:23.519> coating

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
that the rollers have this mesh coating

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.150 
that the rollers have this mesh coating
which<00:00:24.119> allows<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> air<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.750> circulate<00:00:25.170> really

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
which allows the air to circulate really

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.820 
which allows the air to circulate really
quickly<00:00:26.539> and<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.560> come<00:00:28.710> out

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
quickly and so what have to come out

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.259 
quickly and so what have to come out
from<00:00:29.039> under<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.609> dryer<00:00:29.820> you're<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
from under the dryer you're going to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.950 
from under the dryer you're going to
notice<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.349> hair<00:00:32.540> or<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> rollers

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
notice that the hair or the rollers

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
notice that the hair or the rollers
still<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> little<00:00:34.380> bit<00:00:34.559> looser<00:00:34.890> kind<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
still a little bit looser kind of the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.610 
still a little bit looser kind of the
same<00:00:35.579> way<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.329> feel<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:36.870> maybe<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.410> get

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
same way you feel when maybe you get

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.990 
same way you feel when maybe you get
when<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.129> set<00:00:38.309> your<00:00:38.430> hair<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.670> magnetic

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
when you set your hair with magnetic

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729 
when you set your hair with magnetic
rollers<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:40.020> because<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.559> hair

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
rollers and that's just because the hair

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.860 
rollers and that's just because the hair
has<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.129> set<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> dried<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> little

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
has now set and dried so it's a little

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.560 
has now set and dried so it's a little
bit<00:00:43.020> more<00:00:43.170> movement<00:00:44.000> now<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.210> usually<00:00:45.329> do

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
bit more movement now what I usually do

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690 
bit more movement now what I usually do
is<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.870> kind<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> feel<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> curl<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.070> make

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
is just kind of feel the curl and make

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.470 
is just kind of feel the curl and make
sure<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:48.270> dry<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.210> should

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
sure it's all the way dry and it should

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.650 
sure it's all the way dry and it should
you<00:00:51.690> feels<00:00:51.899> good<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> way<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> ends

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
you feels good all the way to the ends

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.330 
you feels good all the way to the ends
so<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:54.989> take<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.350> another

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
so then I'm going to take down another

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.479 
so then I'm going to take down another
one<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.660> lot<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.870> people<00:00:58.050> ask<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.190> pins

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
one and a lot of people ask are the pins

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
one and a lot of people ask are the pins
uncomfortable<00:01:00.359> they're<00:01:00.899> definitely<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.440> as

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
uncomfortable they're definitely not as

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.770 
uncomfortable they're definitely not as
comfortable<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.000> magnetic<00:01:03.600> roller

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
comfortable as the magnetic roller

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.679 
comfortable as the magnetic roller
duckbills<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.670> won't<00:01:05.909> feel<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.510> may

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
duckbills but you won't feel so you may

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.850 
duckbills but you won't feel so you may
feel<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.170> you're<00:01:07.290> putting<00:01:07.500> them<00:01:07.680> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
feel that when you're putting them in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
feel that when you're putting them in
but<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.340> sit<00:01:08.760> under<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.060> dryer<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.960> won't

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
but as you sit under the dryer you won't

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.590 
but as you sit under the dryer you won't
feel<00:01:10.290> them<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.770> all<00:01:11.010> they'll<00:01:11.400> basically<00:01:11.640> kind

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
feel them at all they'll basically kind

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.030 
feel them at all they'll basically kind
of<00:01:12.659> go<00:01:12.780> away<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:13.380> now<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> heat

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
of go away because now the heat

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.429 
of go away because now the heat
circulating<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.869> doesn't<00:01:16.200> feel<00:01:16.380> as

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
circulating and it doesn't feel as

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.039 
circulating and it doesn't feel as
awkward<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.229> general

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
awkward so that's just a general

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.679 
awkward so that's just a general
observation<00:01:22.049> I've<00:01:22.229> made<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:23.509> just<00:01:24.509> kind<00:01:24.659> of

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
observation I've made I just kind of

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.580 
observation I've made I just kind of
take<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.049> out<00:01:26.119> like<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
take them out like so and one of the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
take them out like so and one of the
great<00:01:28.740> things<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.670> hair<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.270> feels

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
great things is that the hair it feels

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.899 
great things is that the hair it feels
just<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.229> silky<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:31.979> silk<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
just a silky if not silk here with the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340 
just a silky if not silk here with the
magnetic<00:01:33.329> rollers<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.049> sure<00:01:34.200> why<00:01:34.320> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
magnetic rollers I'm not sure why that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.749 
magnetic rollers I'm not sure why that
is

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
is

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.660 
is
but<00:01:35.759> I've<00:01:36.119> noticed<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.590> feels<00:01:38.040> really

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
but I've noticed that it feels really

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.120 
but I've noticed that it feels really
really<00:01:38.790> still<00:01:39.090> keep<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.509> addition<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.680> curl

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
really still keep in addition the curl

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.730 
really still keep in addition the curl
lasts<00:01:41.850> longer<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:43.020> sometimes<00:01:43.439> like

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
lasts longer so you know sometimes like

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.950 
lasts longer so you know sometimes like
when<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.460> take<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.180> magnetic<00:01:45.570> rollers

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
when you take out the magnetic rollers

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.120 
when you take out the magnetic rollers
and<00:01:46.110> maybe<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.350> blow<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.680> roots<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and maybe you blow out your roots and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
and maybe you blow out your roots and
the<00:01:47.189> curls<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.610> gone<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.000> feel<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> curl

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the curls all gone I feel like the curl

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.050 
the curls all gone I feel like the curl
lasts<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> little<00:01:49.590> bit<00:01:49.740> longer<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.909> mesh

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
lasts a little bit longer with the mesh

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.520 
lasts a little bit longer with the mesh
rollers<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.689> they<00:01:51.840> don't<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> doesn't<00:01:52.380> just

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
rollers like they don't it doesn't just

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.880 
rollers like they don't it doesn't just
kind<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.740> fall<00:01:52.920> flat<00:01:53.479> as<00:01:54.479> quickly<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
kind of fall flat as quickly as with the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.590 
kind of fall flat as quickly as with the
magnetic<00:01:56.130> roller<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.390> something

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
magnetic roller so that's just something

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.789 
magnetic roller so that's just something
I've<00:01:57.780> noticed<00:01:57.930> did<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.439> guys<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
I've noticed did you guys see the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.620 
I've noticed did you guys see the
rollers<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.340> fall<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.479> they're

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
rollers just kind of fall out so they're

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.830 
rollers just kind of fall out so they're
really<00:02:00.840> easy<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.170> take<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.799> discard<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
really easy to take out I discard the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.039 
really easy to take out I discard the
papers<00:02:04.189> because<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.670> won't<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.840> back

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
papers because they won't really go back

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.449 
papers because they won't really go back
to<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:08.640> know<00:02:08.759> bending<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.709> same<00:02:10.979> way<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
to you know bending the same way the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.290 
to you know bending the same way the
second<00:02:11.760> time<00:02:11.910> around

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.940 

the<00:02:15.300> only<00:02:15.450> downside<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.020> sometimes<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.560> pins

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the only downside is sometimes the pins

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.580 
the only downside is sometimes the pins
get<00:02:17.160> stuck<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.580> netting<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.440> don't

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
get stuck in the netting so you don't

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.650 
get stuck in the netting so you don't
really<00:02:19.710> need<00:02:19.980> betting<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.580> use<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.300> because

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
really need betting I use it because

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.230 
really need betting I use it because
that's<00:02:21.810> how<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> was<00:02:22.590> taught<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.190> honestly<00:02:24.090> you

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
that's how I was taught but honestly you

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.830 
that's how I was taught but honestly you
really<00:02:24.450> don't<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.930> don't<00:02:25.080> really<00:02:25.260> need<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.650> so

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
really don't you don't really need it so

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.290 
really don't you don't really need it so
take<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.990> out<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.700> see<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.970> hair<00:02:30.090> feels

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
take it out as you see the hair feels

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.180 
take it out as you see the hair feels
really<00:02:30.690> shiny<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.530> really<00:02:31.890> silky<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:34.380> has

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
really shiny and really silky and it has

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.130 
really shiny and really silky and it has
nice<00:02:35.460> bounce<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.030> weave<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.750> lot<00:02:37.110> of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
nice bounce and weave to it a lot of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.320 
nice bounce and weave to it a lot of
people<00:02:37.320> think<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.800> because<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.490> grooves

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
people think that because of the grooves

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.760 
people think that because of the grooves
in<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> roller<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.140> hair<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.410> going<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.620> make

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
in the roller the hair is going to make

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.470 
in the roller the hair is going to make
me<00:02:40.860> take<00:02:41.010> on<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> different<00:02:41.430> curl<00:02:41.850> pattern<00:02:42.270> or

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
me take on a different curl pattern or

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.730 
me take on a different curl pattern or
maybe<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.750> gonna<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.050> little<00:02:43.170> bit<00:02:43.380> coarser

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
maybe it's gonna be a little bit coarser

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.360 
maybe it's gonna be a little bit coarser
and<00:02:43.890> that's<00:02:44.490> definitely<00:02:44.760> not<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.330> case<00:02:49.370> so

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
and that's definitely not the case so

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.710 
and that's definitely not the case so
anyway<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.820> wanted<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.150> show<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.570> guys

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
anyway I just wanted to show you guys

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.300 
anyway I just wanted to show you guys
kind<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.260> what<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.860> hair<00:02:53.040> looks<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:55.310> one

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
kind of what the hair looks like and one

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.200 
kind of what the hair looks like and one
more<00:02:56.460> thing<00:02:56.610> before<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.850> go

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
more thing before I go

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.350 
more thing before I go
some<00:02:57.570> people<00:02:58.100> wonder<00:02:59.100> if<00:02:59.460> it's<00:02:59.850> better<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.150> use

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
some people wonder if it's better to use

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.420 
some people wonder if it's better to use
the<00:03:00.810> endpapers<00:03:01.110> or<00:03:01.530> not<00:03:01.680> use<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.040> papers

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the endpapers or not use the in papers

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.550 
the endpapers or not use the in papers
it<00:03:03.090> really<00:03:03.450> doesn't<00:03:03.750> matter<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.990> just<00:03:04.140> find

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
it really doesn't matter I just find

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.830 
it really doesn't matter I just find
that<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.980> ends<00:03:05.400> tend<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.820> dry<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> lot<00:03:06.330> smoother

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
that the ends tend to dry a lot smoother

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.930 
that the ends tend to dry a lot smoother
with<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.110> end<00:03:07.230> papers<00:03:07.680> but<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.460> you<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.760> see<00:03:08.910> I

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
with the end papers but as you can see I

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.150 
with the end papers but as you can see I
did<00:03:09.210> one<00:03:09.420> kind<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.930> without<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.620> end<00:03:10.770> papers

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
did one kind of without the end papers

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.270 
did one kind of without the end papers
and<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.670> ends<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.330> feel<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.840> little<00:03:12.990> bit<00:03:13.290> they

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
and the ends just feel a little bit they

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.870 
and the ends just feel a little bit they
just<00:03:14.490> don't<00:03:14.610> feel<00:03:14.760> as<00:03:14.970> silky<00:03:15.780> smooth<00:03:16.140> and

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
just don't feel as silky smooth and

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.180 
just don't feel as silky smooth and
sealed<00:03:17.880> shut<00:03:18.030> as<00:03:18.480> with<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.930> end<00:03:19.020> paper<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.650> but

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
sealed shut as with the end paper so but

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.440 
sealed shut as with the end paper so but
again<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:20.460> you<00:03:20.520> don't<00:03:20.640> have<00:03:20.820> them<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.030> hand<00:03:21.270> one

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
again if you don't have them on hand one

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.900 
again if you don't have them on hand one
day<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:21.810> not<00:03:21.900> gonna<00:03:22.080> kill<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.910> just

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
day it's not gonna kill you so just

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.690 
day it's not gonna kill you so just
wanted<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.210> touch<00:03:24.960> on<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.380> topic<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:26.130> the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
wanted to touch on that topic so the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.980 
wanted to touch on that topic so the
next<00:03:26.880> video<00:03:27.000> we're<00:03:27.240> going<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.390> talk<00:03:27.540> about<00:03:27.690> pin

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
next video we're going to talk about pin

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.840 
next video we're going to talk about pin
placement<00:03:28.260> because<00:03:28.620> that's<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:29.010> common

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
placement because that's a common

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.790 
placement because that's a common
question<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.480> how<00:03:30.660> do<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.960> place<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.100> pins

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
question is how do you place the pins

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.020

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
the head and that's kind of it's really

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.040

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.920 
easy once you get the hang of it but it
does<00:03:40.170> take<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> little<00:03:40.710> bit<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.950> instruction<00:03:41.190> so

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930
