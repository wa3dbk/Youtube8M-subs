00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 today we are in a meadow where art and culture 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.840
 they are an instrument of social cohesion 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.359
 in 2009 we met a city 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.940
 that was in conflict over the issue 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.769
 Chinese apparently, however, in the stalls 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.879
 electoral right and left we found 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.879
 Chinese as an enemy 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.430
 people are children until they are in kindergarten 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.399
 or perhaps the elementary still have the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.960
 possibility of mixing and after instead 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.960
 in the city there is no possibility 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.689
 see the future here in the meadow no how many no 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.680
 everyone is almost raising their hands included 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.840
 foreigners 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.330
 when we asked the second question 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.860
 you are foreigners 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.450
 too many in these cities all have 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.450
 raised his hand including foreigners 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.760
 we came here in 2009 we have 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.610
 met how to say a Chinese yanfeng 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.820
 destiny made this place which is a 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.820
 woolen mill 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.860
 recognize an ongoing example of 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.530
 possible society for Europe there is a 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.369
 center of the world where there are 119 themes and 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.000
 hence a small mosaic of the world of 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.000
 today and the future 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.160
 the working line of this space e 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.700
 over time it has been towards first 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.770
 pure theatrical art because it is born 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.600
 around a desire of artists e 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.020
 tell something that matters most 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.020
 to people 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.450
 many come to the hall of santanna 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.070
 about 250 boys are enrolled more than 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.130
 70 percent are nationalities 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.130
 Italian 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.040
 the association of walls that deals with 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.040
 art education addresses issues 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.350
 social through the languages ​​of art 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.840
 she got in touch with cristina 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.790
 pieces the compost space and with 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.190
 the oratory and sant'anna for the project 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.740
 paper wall 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.600
 so we used the theater 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.180
 they have practically investigated theirs 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.300
 identity all their issues of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.220
 living in a city like a meadow 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.230
 of how they relate to each other of how 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.450
 comment in contact with the others 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.910
 cultures what we do precisely 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.330
 is dealing with social issues 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.530
 through the languages ​​of art why 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.040
 we very much believe that art facilitates 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.570
 relationships facilitate relationships yes 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.230
 he can practically arrive 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.390
 really deep to deal with 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.140
 thematic relations and so on 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.140
 much faster 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.500
 I believe this is a fine example 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.870
 also for cohesion for cohesion 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.820
 social for cultural cohesion I think 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.270
 that in 15 years these guys will be able to 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.670
 be the new adults of tomorrow 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.170
 I believe we can do that, that is 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.850
 they are boys who have matured and are 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.410
 perfectly capable of being well 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.870
 together despite the differences 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.730
 beautiful religious cultural build 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.680
 together not having unfortunately dg of 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.680
 citizenship think so 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.519
 we are happy to have helped to do 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.349
 starting project face wall this 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.609
 project and you will tend to see later is 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:12.370
 born from an idea by cristina pezzoli 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:14.439
 imagine 100 photographs taken by 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.690
 hillary constant in short a big one 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:20.549
 very young photographer where they are 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.549
 always an Italian is an Italian name 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.330
 and if they ask me what is the recipe for 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.729
 the integration I always say the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.830
 disintegration of the sense to recognize the 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.379
 inconsistent parts that themselves or the 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.990
 extended family in which we are already a 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.509
 first step to accept them because we are 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.639
 human beings and to try to go one 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.669
 step towards the other based on 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.240
 curiosity about the desire to know about 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.340
 pleasure of sharing, etc. close 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.509
 with his is a Chinese term 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.729
 something like looking or wanting 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.949
 bigger things in common by preserving themselves 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:02.509
 the small differences indeed and of love and 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:06.289
 respect and sweet tour long way up 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:09.789
 spratt the something dark and clinique on 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.789
 lockout asn in the field
