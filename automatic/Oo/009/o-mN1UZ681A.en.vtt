00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
two ways of doing this well show you the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.030 
two ways of doing this well show you the
second<00:02:45.450> way<00:02:45.569> in<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.989> little<00:02:46.230> bit<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.470> right<00:02:46.889> now

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
second way in a little bit but right now

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.020 
second way in a little bit but right now
you're<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.310> come<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:47.599> stick<00:02:48.599> him<00:02:48.810> and

you're just come on stick him and
sticking<00:02:51.030> him<00:02:51.209> will<00:02:51.480> cause<00:02:51.690> him<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.319> start

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
sticking him will cause him to start

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.280 
sticking him will cause him to start
swinging<00:02:53.069> his

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
swinging his

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.589 
swinging his
weapon<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.189> annihilate<00:02:55.060> all<00:02:55.269> of<00:02:55.450> these

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
weapon and just annihilate all of these

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.199 
weapon and just annihilate all of these
civilians<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:57.189> just<00:02:57.519> it's<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:57.849> a<00:02:58.060> good

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
civilians and it's just it's just a good

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.030 
civilians and it's just it's just a good
time<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.689> mean<00:02:59.230> probably<00:02:59.530> not<00:02:59.739> for<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
time I mean probably not for the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.890 
time I mean probably not for the
civilians<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.950> watch<00:03:03.189> and<00:03:03.459> see

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
right now I'm just fast-forward me

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.910 
right now I'm just fast-forward me
because<00:03:06.219> there's<00:03:06.430> really<00:03:06.670> nothing<00:03:07.090> here<00:03:09.569> and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
because there's really nothing here and

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.199 
because there's really nothing here and

so it makes it 10 * easy so basically

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.710 
so it makes it 10 * easy so basically
what<00:05:12.610> you're<00:05:12.640> doing<00:05:12.880> is<00:05:13.180> just<00:05:13.240> going<00:05:13.450> to<00:05:13.540> make

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
what you're doing is just going to make

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.470

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
he's just going to annihilate them like

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.660 
he's just going to annihilate them like
I<00:05:18.940> said<00:05:19.500> we<00:05:20.500> found<00:05:20.650> out<00:05:20.830> that<00:05:20.860> this<00:05:21.100> is<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.310> lot

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
I said we found out that this is a lot

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.970 
I said we found out that this is a lot
easier<00:05:21.970> just<00:05:22.540> using<00:05:22.930> a<00:05:23.020> poison<00:05:23.470> dart<00:05:23.500> because

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
easier just using a poison dart because

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.690 
easier just using a poison dart because
you<00:05:24.220> do<00:05:24.370> not<00:05:24.520> get<00:05:24.730> alerted<00:05:25.090> so<00:05:25.930> often<00:05:26.590> with<00:05:27.580> the

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
you do not get alerted so often with the

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.190 
you do not get alerted so often with the
poison<00:05:28.060> knife<00:05:28.210> it's<00:05:28.450> just<00:05:28.630> it's<00:05:28.840> just<00:05:28.900> way

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
poison knife it's just it's just way

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.810 
poison knife it's just it's just way
harder<00:05:29.940> so<00:05:31.590> basically<00:05:32.590> just<00:05:32.890> make<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.460> rain<00:05:33.790> on

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
harder so basically just make it rain on

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.940 
harder so basically just make it rain on
them<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:35.850> try<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:37.200> Dylan<00:05:38.200> like<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.650> it

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
them and try and Dylan like it it

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.770 
them and try and Dylan like it it
stopped<00:05:39.250> working<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.790> money<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:40.180> start<00:05:40.420> stop

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
stopped working the money it start stop

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.290 
stopped working the money it start stop
tracking<00:05:41.170> them<00:05:41.440> subtracting<00:05:42.400> them<00:05:42.490> over<00:05:42.790> here

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300
