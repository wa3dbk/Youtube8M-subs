00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Hello, I will explain today how to create a beach bohemian hairstyle. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 I will use a hair curler and a hair fixer. I have added long hair links. This look is perfect for women with long hair. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 However, since my hair is not long, so I use hair clips. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 You also need a hair brush and comb, and a modern accessory such as a rose crown or a headband. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Stay with us, and see this educational paragraph on how to create this look. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 I have added a 24-inch hair link, which is very long. Now my hair reaches my waist, 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Because this length shows the corrugated bohemian view. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Now I will comb my hair 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 This look is beautiful and suitable if your hair is long or medium length. It is not suitable for short hair. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 This view should appear simple, but much must be done to get it. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Let's Begin. You will need a corrugated hair. You can use a scaffold as a pliers, but do not use the same pliers. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 When caressing, wave at random, because this view should look easy and simple innovation. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Hold it for just a few seconds, not for a long time. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 And other peeling times, in order to obtain the coronation to varying degrees. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 When the hair is close to the face, like this part, you should steer away from the face or it will look strange. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 I do not want to direct it from the top so as not to show the appearance of the afro, but to guide it from the bottom. As for the longer parts, they will travel longer to get the look of attractive winders. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 And now, you've got these attractive corrugated winders. As you see, I choose randomly. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 If you have natural curly hair, you are lucky, but if your hair is smooth and uncoiled, you should completely beautify it. Only the length of the corrugation from one part to another. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 You can put your fingers between the ripples to disperse them. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 We have finished this aspect, and as you see, consists of thick hair corrugated, and to guide better you must either use the mousse, or to breathe, or use the hair fixer. . 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 I'll show you how this works when the other side is capped. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Now after finishing the corrugation, you can blow the top to get greater density. So divide this part into small chunks 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Using a comb or comb hair infusion this way. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 To make sure the hair is stable, use the hair conditioner and brush it on the smoothed side. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Use a hair conditioner if your hair is not firm after the corrugation. My hair is holding tightly because I use hair clips. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Now put your fingers in the hair and make sure it is not very corrugated. Because it must appear natural and uncomplicated. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 This ensures the bohemian view, you can add an accessory such as a crown of roses. Put it and it will look like you are putting a small crown. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Or you can put the headband and some feathers by fixing them with a tie. 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 To ensure the beauty of this look, I used a shampoo "smooth and smooth" because it gives the hair a smooth, silky and smooth, and then use the humidifier and massage. 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 The bond is very good for ripples and greatly improves. 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 I would love to show this look when going out to dinner with my friends. This view is not fast, but beautiful, and you can also add it. 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Make-up should be simple and lively, because this view is simple and vibrant 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 As for the clothes, if you are looking behind the bohemian view of the beach, any loose and long dress fits. 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 I tend to wear crochet open from the top with a long maxi skirt. Any long and loose dress, maxi dress, or maxi skirt fits this look. 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 I hope this paragraph is useful. I will make more paragraphs soon. thank you for watching.
