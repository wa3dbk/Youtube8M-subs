00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello to everyone and I'm here in 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.090
 this video this wonderful day for a 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:20.100
 good news as always and is that at 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:22.170
 just like a little 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.900
 and we with them are very 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.600
 happy two parties because 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.390
 we have good products 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.700
 programs we give you an input and the truth 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.110
 is that it is a popular nation and what to say 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.850
 I just got these prices 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:44.610
 what should be a 2017 language that 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.610
 everyone you know is one of the best 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.329
 to place 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.190
 what 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.760
 how can you get off the frame 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.760
 is it so 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.250
 the table easy the same 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.050
 it's the first time we 're going 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.030
 good 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.840
 quite easy to put the truth is that 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.840
 are the other things 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.110
 3 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.410
 I suppose it will be if I'm not wrong 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.620
 the cables of the power supply 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.620
 Of course 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.409
 bored of the video I know this 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.680
 works 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.790
 I accept to work and little more 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.580
 I'm not interested but interesting from there 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.760
 easy cables 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.940
 easy to assemble flat play easy pim pam 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.210
 pum 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.450
 and let's see 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.119
 this is the laptop as you can see a 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.170
 pretty minimalist design that is said 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.010
 today 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.909
 I like very much simpleton without much 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.909
 without so much 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.650
 so you can see better 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.090
 if you want more 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.090
 let's open it 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.540
 species of colors the language of this 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.459
 This weather 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.090
 and the truth is that it is very complicated 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.969
 tell you here with words how it works 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.650
 the computer but I would say it has proven it I know 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:50.689
 that within the game goes immensely 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.689
 ok but this video for it has 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.000
 installed so surely a few days 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.810
 for another video explaining if it has 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.770
 liked 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.370
 surely play ancestry watching 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.140
 even so I 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.000
 let's see me this is this side 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.300
 trial by fire why 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.740
 I have to probably always 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.740
 I fix a lot very much very much 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.460
 It's very important 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.680
 normally the program of the 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.800
 portable these keys are very very 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.900
 sensitive then it's touching something and 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.010
 they immediately touch on topics that they did not want 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.010
 touch so let's see 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:43.940
 I expected it I expected it I like it 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.500
 very much because it's touch 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.840
 simple one from a port 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.110
 theoretically the touch of this sensitive 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.680
 but at the same time he has a deal 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.420
 much more like a keyboard 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.420
 mechanical because it makes more force 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.840
 I like it a lot 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.239
 to play 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.940
 let's see 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.410
 It is very minimalist as I have already said 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.540
 married has only what you need 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.540
 and it is also very pretty 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.280
 we have here a manual value your manual 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.820
 here says the website laverdad.com 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.470
 and on facebook facebook.com halliwell and 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.169
 elvis web radio 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.039
 the poor little guy but good 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.039
 it's very good very well 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.770
 look 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.860
 typical dwarf here there is 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.789
 the book describe the instructions 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.009
 the trains in the system portal 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.030
 operative that you have already installed in this 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.030
 case and possibly 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.480
 as 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:27.100
 because it is in order 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.530
 and if you play ten of the securities 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.300
 and little more friends this is portable from 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.069
 alienware I'm interested let's do this 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.380
 video the truth I weighed a lot 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:49.210
 make this video for the simple fact of 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:51.520
 that I already know from a while ago with 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.590
 two buttons years that alienware is a 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.680
 brand that cares very much the design of 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.169
 your cases of the design of your laptops and 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.889
 the truth is that good of your boxes of 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:05.800
 fish and the truth is that I was interested 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.690
 much that you would see the design of 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.130
 all this is not just that the audio and 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.650
 computer functions work because 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.289
 is what does not generate perfectly and of 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.330
 done I have tried it in other games and 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.740
 the truth is that has been superbly 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.740
 streaming 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.879
 I have no doubt that it will be fine 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:28.189
 there is also a video of it in the 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:31.009
 next days look for more to say 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.590
 which is because this video I hope you 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.540
 I liked it 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.430
 and it's one of these videos that makes me very 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.040
 happy to do for the simple fact that 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.249
 I contacted the video 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.939
 so thank you very much everyone 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.939
 single
