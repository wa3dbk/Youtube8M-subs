00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
now was running in kind of a point of

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.190 
now was running in kind of a point of
innocence<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:25.240> know<00:00:25.329> we<00:00:25.450> plan<00:00:25.840> on<00:00:25.990> being

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
innocence you know we plan on being

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.839 
innocence you know we plan on being
balanced<00:00:26.650> you<00:00:27.310> know<00:00:27.400> we<00:00:27.520> knew<00:00:27.640> there's<00:00:27.790> a

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
balanced you know we knew there's a

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.370 
balanced you know we knew there's a
chance<00:00:28.060> of<00:00:28.240> wind<00:00:28.390> it's<00:00:28.540> not<00:00:28.720> uncommon<00:00:29.020> here

this<00:00:29.560> time<00:00:29.740> of<00:00:29.800> year<00:00:29.919> and<00:00:30.040> I<00:00:30.430> think<00:00:31.119> that

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
this time of year and I think that

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.300 
this time of year and I think that
factored<00:00:31.660> into<00:00:31.810> it<00:00:32.020> certainly<00:00:32.349> but<00:00:32.650> you<00:00:33.250> know

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
factored into it certainly but you know

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.100 
factored into it certainly but you know
really<00:00:33.460> happy<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:33.910> way<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.090> guys<00:00:34.270> walked<00:00:34.900> out

jordans as I've said he's practiced
really<00:00:43.540> well<00:00:43.810> going<00:00:44.020> back<00:00:44.200> to<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.530> spring

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
really well going back to the spring

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.260 
really well going back to the spring
even<00:00:45.040> last<00:00:45.220> fall<00:00:45.520> if<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:45.730> want<00:00:45.880> look<00:00:45.970> at<00:00:46.090> that

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
even last fall if you want look at that

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.810 
even last fall if you want look at that
and<00:00:46.750> I<00:00:47.740> think<00:00:48.040> we're<00:00:48.280> at<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.400> point<00:00:48.460> right<00:00:48.700> now

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
and I think we're at the point right now

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.940 
and I think we're at the point right now
we're<00:00:49.120> just<00:00:49.150> ate<00:00:49.570> last<00:00:50.170> week<00:00:50.470> looking<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:50.920> bit

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
we're just ate last week looking a bit

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.490 
we're just ate last week looking a bit
more<00:00:51.310> often<00:00:51.580> than<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.850> other<00:00:52.030> guys<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:52.540> we

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
more often than the other guys so we

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.430 
more often than the other guys so we
gave<00:00:53.740> him<00:00:53.950> a<00:00:54.100> little<00:00:54.670> bit<00:00:54.790> more<00:00:54.970> work<00:00:55.120> than<00:00:55.440> in

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
gave him a little bit more work than in

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.740 
gave him a little bit more work than in
the<00:00:56.590> past<00:00:56.770> obviously<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.640> he<00:00:58.390> took<00:00:58.540> it<00:00:58.690> in

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
the past obviously and he took it in

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.000 
the past obviously and he took it in
rent<00:00:58.930> he<00:00:59.080> was<00:00:59.170> really<00:00:59.380> running<00:00:59.560> well<00:00:59.830> I<00:00:59.860> had

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
rent he was really running well I had

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.500

one<00:01:00.160> little<00:01:00.370> ball<00:01:00.610> security<00:01:00.970> issue<00:01:01.270> but

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
one little ball security issue but

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.120 
one little ball security issue but
that's<00:01:01.720> probably<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.290> bipartisan<00:01:02.770> you<00:01:03.070> know

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
that's probably a bipartisan you know

we're going to have to win these next
two<00:01:47.830> games<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:48.220> then<00:01:48.340> we're

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
two games and then we're

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
two games and then we're
nice<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.650> often<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:50.250> guys<00:01:50.370> a<00:01:50.430> lead

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
nice with often to get you guys a lead

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.190 
nice with often to get you guys a lead
so<00:01:50.910> there's<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.300> so<00:01:51.360> much<00:01:51.660> pressure<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.050> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so there's not so much pressure on the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800 
so there's not so much pressure on the
defense<00:01:52.290> yeah<00:01:53.130> that's<00:01:53.370> nice<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:53.910> I<00:01:54.270> think

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
defense yeah that's nice and I think

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.300 
defense yeah that's nice and I think
when<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.200> lead<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.830> you're<00:01:56.160> moving

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
when you have a lead and you're moving

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
when you have a lead and you're moving
the<00:01:56.550> ball<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.850> offense<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.870> puts<00:01:58.140> pressure<00:01:58.320> on

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the ball on offense it puts pressure on

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.469 
the ball on offense it puts pressure on
the<00:01:58.740> other<00:01:58.920> team<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.400> that<00:01:59.760> sort<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.150> limits

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the other team and that sort of limits

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.270 
the other team and that sort of limits
what<00:02:00.930> they're<00:02:01.140> able<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.470> do<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> type<00:02:02.250> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
what they're able to do the type of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.400 
what they're able to do the type of
plays<00:02:02.580> they<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:03.030> call<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.870> it<00:02:04.080> makes<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
plays they can call and it makes it a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.840 
plays they can call and it makes it a
little<00:02:04.500> easier<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.220> defense<00:02:05.550> because

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
little easier for the defense because

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.400 
little easier for the defense because
now<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.330> get<00:02:06.420> settle<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.170> start

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
now you can get settle in and start

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.169 
now you can get settle in and start
trying<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> figure<00:02:07.920> out<00:02:07.979> what<00:02:08.220> works<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.700> stop

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
trying to figure out what works to stop

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.020 
trying to figure out what works to stop
the<00:02:09.360> plays<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.929> offense<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:11.030> we

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the plays that the offense is really we

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.100 
the plays that the offense is really we
honestly<00:02:12.209> didn't<00:02:12.630> know<00:02:12.690> what<00:02:12.870> they're<00:02:12.990> going

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
honestly didn't know what they're going

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.630 
honestly didn't know what they're going
to<00:02:13.200> run<00:02:13.260> they've<00:02:13.440> run<00:02:13.620> different<00:02:14.160> defenses

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
to run they've run different defenses

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.670 
to run they've run different defenses
against<00:02:15.240> Nebraska<00:02:15.750> against<00:02:16.140> different

against Nebraska against different
opponents<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.100> they<00:02:17.250> played<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.150> didn't

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
opponents that they played so we didn't

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.510 
opponents that they played so we didn't
know<00:02:18.360> what<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.630> expect<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:20.040> coaches<00:02:20.250> did<00:02:20.459> a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
know what to expect the coaches did a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.220 
know what to expect the coaches did a
great<00:02:20.700> job<00:02:20.730> though<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.209> giving<00:02:21.570> us<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.840> general

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
great job though of giving us a general

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.979 
great job though of giving us a general
idea<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.800> what<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.580> expect<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.720> allowed

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
idea of what to expect and that allowed

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.900 
idea of what to expect and that allowed
us<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.709> comfortable<00:02:26.160> because<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:26.790> knew

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
us to be comfortable because we knew

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.240 
us to be comfortable because we knew
