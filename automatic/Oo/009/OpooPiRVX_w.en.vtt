 she's with ice handling ice 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.640
 durable and stable 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.500
 characteristics and excellent 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.479
 performance on any surface 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:12.699
 width thanks to which it became 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.029
 possibly 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:15.379
 this is mistake 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.379
 after the hour transfer 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.609
 such high performance on 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.639
 ice is achieved by 

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:24.439
 using bridgestone 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.439
 nanotechnology 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.800
 prefect slip arises due to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.420
 water film formation between ice and 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.420
 by bus 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.900
 upon contact the microflora became 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.590
 The composition of the tire is close to the revo gz chipboard surface 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.310
 road a lot of micro four tv channels in 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.180
 rubber tread provides drainage 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.810
 water film caller 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.240
 slip 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.890
 thus provided 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.160
 high rate and even when driving on 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 icy road 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.440
 during the brake test 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.290
 fictitiousness on ice was fixed 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.240
 stopping distance reduction by 3 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.550
 percent versus november neck for yours 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.550
 sixty 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.460
 the third test also showed that 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.560
 efficiency is close and its jazz 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.049
 25 percent higher than products 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.049
 one of the main competitors 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.340
 besides reliable grip 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.550
 provide microparticles inside 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 tread compound 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.090
 Close revo gz keeps efficiency in 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.430
 over a long period of time 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.140
 this is achieved thanks to the many 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.890
 micro forte microchannels 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.720

 salcom palm jersey 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.910
 micro laura and microchannels 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.380
 provide tire soft ripeness 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.700
 personalities 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.299
 and remains on the surface 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.810
 tread season after season 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.350
 demonstrates efficiency and 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.350
 durability 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.380
 the tire keeps its high 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.550
 performance on 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.460
 wet road for a few 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.889
 years old 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.219
 close real o jeans are excellent 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.649
 manageability indicators on 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:20.609
 any coverage 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.449
 this is achieved thanks to the composition 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.680
 rubber mixture for family 3 what figure 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.139
 tread 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.169
 Russia polymer composition of a mixture of multi 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:32.179
 salcom palm protects tires from 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.329
 changes under the action 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.749
 temperature providing 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.259
 maximum efficiency on 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.259
 any coverage 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.119
 asymmetric tread pattern 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.019
 provides effective 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.969
 clutch inner center 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.930
 tire tread with road surface 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.089
 has grown 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.089
 while wide blocks with external 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:52.799
 hand prevents sliding when 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.149
 cornering 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.629
 besides lamella shoulder parts of the tire 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.649
 provide high efficiency at 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.089
 braking on ice 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.449
 thus asymmetrical 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.289
 tread pattern allows 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.639
 significantly improve tire performance 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.639
 on the winter road 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.639
 asymmetrical bending of the sides improves 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.099
 manageability and stability on 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.909
 straight road and minimizes 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.599
 instability on roads with large 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.599
 number of turns 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.309
 it provides high 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.409
 tire performance on almost any 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.049
 family road dry wet important were 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.049
 covered in snow 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.079
 Bridgestone's advanced technology gives the answer 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.079
 harsh Russian winter 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.939
 modern studless tires 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.049
 bridgestone drivers meet all requirements 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.109
 who want to receive 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.109
 driving pleasure in winter 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.539
