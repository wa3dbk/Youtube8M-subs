and what I'm going to talk about is

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.040 
and what I'm going to talk about is
soloing<00:00:15.809> using<00:00:16.139> core<00:00:16.410> tones<00:00:17.000> a<00:00:18.050> basic

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
soloing using core tones a basic

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.599 
soloing using core tones a basic
understanding<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.740> harmony<00:00:20.160> theory<00:00:20.460> would

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
understanding of harmony theory would

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.960 
understanding of harmony theory would
help<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:22.100> but<00:00:23.100> basically<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.760> just

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
going to we're going to go through a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.839 
going to we're going to go through a
progression<00:00:25.170> I'm<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.859> show<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.550> how<00:00:26.789> to

progression I'm going to show you how to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.939

how<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.480> solo<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.140> using<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> chord<00:00:28.800> tones

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
how to solo just using the chord tones

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.959 
how to solo just using the chord tones
of<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:30.150> changes<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.800> changes<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.340> chose

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
of the changes so the changes I chose

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.900 
of the changes so the changes I chose
were<00:00:33.239> from<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> jazz<00:00:33.930> tune<00:00:34.260> standard<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.250> it's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
going to be an 8 bar phrase and it's the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.979 
going to be an 8 bar phrase and it's the
first<00:00:38.579> chord<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:38.969> C<00:00:39.000> 6<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.840> 2<00:00:39.989> bars<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.910> then

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
first chord is C 6 for 2 bars and then

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.040 
first chord is C 6 for 2 bars and then
d7<00:00:42.989> sharp<00:00:43.290> 11<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:44.010> 2<00:00:44.160> bars

don't<00:00:52.410> let<00:00:52.649> my<00:00:52.770> bass<00:00:52.949> fool<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.460> you're

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
don't let my bass fool you you're

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.729 
don't let my bass fool you you're
probably<00:00:54.480> looking<00:00:54.899> at<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.559> he

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
probably looking at it going how is he

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.090 
probably looking at it going how is he
playing<00:00:55.969> he's<00:00:56.969> playing<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.329> G<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.829> 5

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
playing he's playing a G I have a 5

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.590 
playing he's playing a G I have a 5
string<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> high<00:00:59.910> seat<00:01:00.149> no<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
string but I have a high seat no so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
string but I have a high seat no so
don't<00:01:00.629> let<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.989> confusion<00:01:01.850> okay<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
don't let that confusion okay so the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.109 
don't let that confusion okay so the
first<00:01:03.449> step<00:01:04.140> would<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.489> play<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
first step would be to just play the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.310 
first step would be to just play the
Triads<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.729> progression<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.990> I'm

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
Triads of the the progression so I'm

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.370 
Triads of the the progression so I'm
going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> solo<00:01:10.890> using<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.610> triads<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
going to solo using just triads and it's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
going to solo using just triads and it's
going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.740> more<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> mechanical<00:01:15.000> side

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
going to be more on the mechanical side

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.280 
going to be more on the mechanical side
I'm<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> worry<00:01:15.900> too<00:01:15.960> much<00:01:16.110> about

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
I'm not going to worry too much about

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.440 
I'm not going to worry too much about
the<00:01:16.590> creativity<00:01:17.220> because<00:01:17.310> again<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:17.880> goal<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the creativity because again my goal is

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.390 
the creativity because again my goal is
to<00:01:19.049> get<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> sound<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> changes

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
to get the sound of the changes

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.480 
to get the sound of the changes
happening<00:01:21.320> when<00:01:22.320> soloing<00:01:22.680> through<00:01:23.009> changes

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
happening when soloing through changes

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
happening when soloing through changes
75%<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.479> what<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.750> should<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.320> play

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
75% of what you should what you play

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
75% of what you should what you play
should<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.009> core<00:01:26.400> tones<00:01:26.700> because<00:01:27.420> again

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
should be core tones because again

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.390 
should be core tones because again
you're<00:01:28.049> playing<00:01:28.320> inside<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> changes<00:01:29.250> we

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you're playing inside the changes we

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.910 
you're playing inside the changes we
want<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> hear<00:01:29.850> those<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.200> first<00:01:31.470> step<00:01:31.710> is

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
want to hear those so the first step is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.710 
want to hear those so the first step is
triads<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.729> again<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
triads and again it's going to be a

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.600 
triads and again it's going to be a
little<00:01:33.930> mechanical<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.100> don't<00:01:35.310> worry<00:01:35.430> about

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
little mechanical but don't worry about

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.069 
little mechanical but don't worry about
that<00:01:35.909> ok<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:37.250> one<00:01:38.250> two<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.780> two

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that ok here we go one two a one two

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.500 
that ok here we go one two a one two
three

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:53.649 

Oh

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:07.850 

again

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.760 

so<00:02:08.860> very<00:02:09.130> simple<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:09.970> took<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:11.470> core

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
so very simple I just took the the core

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.010 
so very simple I just took the the core
tones<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.370> each<00:02:12.550> chord<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.660> tried<00:02:13.900> to

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
tones of each chord and I tried to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.930 
tones of each chord and I tried to
create<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.320> little<00:02:14.410> melodic<00:02:15.130> phrase<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:15.670> again

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
create a little melodic phrase but again

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.420 
create a little melodic phrase but again
I<00:02:15.970> wasn't<00:02:16.360> trying<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.720> get<00:02:16.870> too<00:02:17.200> creative<00:02:18.040> with

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
I wasn't trying to get too creative with

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.970 
I wasn't trying to get too creative with
it<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:19.060> wanted<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.600> sound<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.410> changes

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
it I just wanted it to sound the changes

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.860 
it I just wanted it to sound the changes
so<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.240> hear<00:02:22.510> there's<00:02:22.690> no

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
so that you can hear there's no

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.780 
so that you can hear there's no
accompaniment<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.800> don't<00:02:24.040> have<00:02:24.160> guitar<00:02:24.490> piano

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
accompaniment I don't have guitar piano

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.490 
accompaniment I don't have guitar piano
playing<00:02:25.120> chords<00:02:25.600> just<00:02:25.810> me<00:02:26.020> in<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.170> metronome

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
playing chords just me in a metronome

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.949 
playing chords just me in a metronome
but<00:02:27.310> yeah<00:02:27.520> when<00:02:27.730> I'm<00:02:27.850> playing<00:02:28.150> you're<00:02:28.600> hearing

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
but yeah when I'm playing you're hearing

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.540 
but yeah when I'm playing you're hearing
the<00:02:29.050> changes<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:29.650> that's<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.040> first<00:02:30.340> goal

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
the changes so that's the first goal

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.720 
the changes so that's the first goal
then<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.720> second<00:02:32.170> goal<00:02:32.290> would<00:02:32.500> be<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:33.490> play

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
then the second goal would be to play

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.850 
then the second goal would be to play
the<00:02:33.910> seventh<00:02:34.390> chords<00:02:34.750> now<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.170> Triad<00:02:35.590> is

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
the seventh chords now the Triad is

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.230 
the seventh chords now the Triad is
built<00:02:36.070> off<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.280> root<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.820> third<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
built off the root the third and the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.710 
built off the root the third and the
fifth

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
fifth

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.630 
fifth
so<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.440> seventh<00:02:38.800> chord<00:02:39.010> obviously<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.520> the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
so the seventh chord obviously is the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.390 
so the seventh chord obviously is the
root<00:02:39.820> third<00:02:40.090> fifth<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.540> seventh<00:02:41.170> now<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.310> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
root third fifth and seventh now in the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.070 
root third fifth and seventh now in the
first<00:02:42.640> chord<00:02:42.940> it's<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.209> sixth<00:02:43.630> chord<00:02:43.870> it's<00:02:44.020> a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
first chord it's the sixth chord it's a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.690 
first chord it's the sixth chord it's a
major<00:02:44.290> sixth<00:02:44.680> chord<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.070> I'm<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.430> use

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
major sixth chord so I'm going to use

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
major sixth chord so I'm going to use
the<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> instead<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.080> B<00:02:47.640> but<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.880> soloing

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
the a instead of the B but in soloing

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.320 
the a instead of the B but in soloing
you<00:02:49.840> certainly<00:02:50.230> could<00:02:50.410> use<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.739> B<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.060> here<00:02:52.239> we

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
you certainly could use the B so here we

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.900 
you certainly could use the B so here we
go<00:02:52.450> same<00:02:52.750> thing<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:53.200> now<00:02:53.350> I'm<00:02:53.470> using<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
go same thing but now I'm using the the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:06.680 
go same thing but now I'm using the the
seventh<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:57.400> two<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.570> one<00:02:58.870> two<00:02:59.140> ready<00:02:59.980> go

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:27.050 

you

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.240 

so<00:03:28.060> again<00:03:28.359> I'm<00:03:28.540> not<00:03:28.569> I'm<00:03:29.469> not<00:03:29.769> creating

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
so again I'm not I'm not creating

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.179 
so again I'm not I'm not creating
anything<00:03:30.489> brilliant<00:03:31.150> or<00:03:31.239> fancy<00:03:31.719> but<00:03:32.109> as<00:03:32.319> I'm

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
anything brilliant or fancy but as I'm

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.130 
anything brilliant or fancy but as I'm
playing<00:03:33.519> you're<00:03:34.090> hearing<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.659> sound<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:35.049> the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
playing you're hearing the sound of the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.550 
playing you're hearing the sound of the
changes<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:35.950> again<00:03:36.310> that's<00:03:36.489> our<00:03:36.640> first<00:03:36.939> goal

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
changes and again that's our first goal

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.080 
changes and again that's our first goal
then<00:03:38.560> what<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.920> can<00:03:39.069> do<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:39.519> once<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:39.939> get

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
then what you can do is once you get

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.319 
then what you can do is once you get
that<00:03:40.359> then<00:03:41.139> what<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.439> want<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.680> do<00:03:41.829> is<00:03:42.329> think

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
that then what you want to do is think

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.089 
that then what you want to do is think
about<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.629> creative<00:03:44.290> part<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.859> a<00:03:44.920> little

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
about the creative part of it a little

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.379 
about the creative part of it a little
bit<00:03:45.189> more<00:03:45.400> start<00:03:45.879> adding<00:03:46.560> scale<00:03:47.560> tones<00:03:48.389> maybe

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
bit more start adding scale tones maybe

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.360 
bit more start adding scale tones maybe
some<00:03:49.629> chromatic<00:03:50.170> tones<00:03:50.409> maybe<00:03:50.739> think<00:03:51.129> some

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
some chromatic tones maybe think some

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.569 
some chromatic tones maybe think some
bluesy<00:03:51.909> little<00:03:52.420> riffs<00:03:52.659> in<00:03:52.870> there<00:03:53.159> and<00:03:54.159> this<00:03:54.519> is

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
bluesy little riffs in there and this is

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.309 
bluesy little riffs in there and this is
where<00:03:54.849> the<00:03:55.000> fun<00:03:55.269> starts<00:03:55.299> because<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.139> is

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
where the fun starts because this is

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.550 
where the fun starts because this is
where<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.560> can<00:03:56.799> start<00:03:57.040> being<00:03:57.220> creative<00:03:58.560> here

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
where you can start being creative here

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:59.469 
where you can start being creative here
we<00:03:59.620> go<00:04:00.659> one<00:04:01.659> two<00:04:02.159> a-one<00:04:03.159> two<00:04:03.669> three

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.830 

so<00:05:00.800> now<00:05:01.800> what<00:05:02.159> I<00:05:02.189> did<00:05:02.430> was<00:05:02.460> I<00:05:02.699> used<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.509> can<00:05:03.719> hear

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
so now what I did was I used to can hear

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.649 
so now what I did was I used to can hear
the<00:05:03.960> changes<00:05:04.439> but<00:05:05.099> what<00:05:05.310> I<00:05:05.340> did<00:05:05.580> is<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:05.849> used<00:05:06.180> it

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
the changes but what I did is I used it

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:08.240 
the changes but what I did is I used it
in<00:05:06.810> more<00:05:06.990> of<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.110> creative<00:05:07.469> way<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:07.710> now<00:05:08.099> I'm

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
in more of a creative way so now I'm

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.459 
in more of a creative way so now I'm
able<00:05:08.370> to<00:05:08.520> create<00:05:08.849> a<00:05:08.879> solo<00:05:09.150> but<00:05:09.360> again<00:05:09.629> you<00:05:10.289> got

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
able to create a solo but again you got

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.429 
able to create a solo but again you got
to<00:05:10.650> learn<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:11.419> walk<00:05:12.419> before<00:05:12.659> you<00:05:12.870> run<00:05:13.139> so<00:05:13.409> I

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:13.439 
to learn to walk before you run so I

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.830 
to learn to walk before you run so I
would<00:05:13.740> start<00:05:14.069> as<00:05:14.189> simple<00:05:14.580> as<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:14.789> can<00:05:14.840> with

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
would start as simple as you can with

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.740 
would start as simple as you can with
the<00:05:15.990> triads<00:05:16.469> go<00:05:17.279> to<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.550> sevenths<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.180> then

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
the triads go to the sevenths and then

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.909 
the triads go to the sevenths and then
from<00:05:18.990> there<00:05:19.229> then<00:05:19.409> you<00:05:19.529> can<00:05:19.560> start

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
from there then you can start

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.450 
from there then you can start
improvising<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:21.919> you<00:05:22.919> know<00:05:23.009> start<00:05:23.340> making

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
improvising and you know start making

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.589 
improvising and you know start making
phrases<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.330> creating<00:05:25.139> ideas<00:05:25.529> so<00:05:26.460> take<00:05:27.449> it

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
phrases and creating ideas so take it

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.689 
phrases and creating ideas so take it
slow<00:05:27.719> you<00:05:28.319> know<00:05:28.469> don't<00:05:28.919> don't<00:05:29.189> expect<00:05:29.550> too

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
slow you know don't don't expect too

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.850 
slow you know don't don't expect too
much<00:05:29.909> and<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:31.020> certainly<00:05:31.349> can<00:05:31.529> take<00:05:31.710> the

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
much and you certainly can take the

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.029 
much and you certainly can take the
tempo<00:05:32.190> at<00:05:32.310> a<00:05:32.339> slower<00:05:32.610> tempo<00:05:32.699> as<00:05:33.089> well<00:05:33.300> so

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
tempo at a slower tempo as well so
