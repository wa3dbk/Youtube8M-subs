00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
subscribers and I finally got there and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880 
subscribers and I finally got there and
I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.690> been<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.110> eight<00:00:40.350> months<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
I think it's been like eight months and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.880 
I think it's been like eight months and
um<00:00:41.450> these<00:00:42.450> past<00:00:42.780> eight<00:00:42.989> months<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.469> feel<00:00:43.770> like

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
um these past eight months I feel like

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.190 
um these past eight months I feel like
it's<00:00:44.850> kind<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.719> roller<00:00:46.050> coaster

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
it's kind of like a roller coaster

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.010 
it's kind of like a roller coaster
because<00:00:46.800> sometimes<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.879> feel<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.660> pumped

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
because sometimes I feel like so pumped

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.170 
because sometimes I feel like so pumped
up<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> make<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> video<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.489> sometimes<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
up to make a video and then sometimes I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.299 
up to make a video and then sometimes I
feel<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.449> what's<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> point<00:00:52.620> no<00:00:53.129> one's

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
