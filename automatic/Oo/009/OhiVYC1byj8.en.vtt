00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 The proportions reached in a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 firefighters quickly acted 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.170
 control the flames and causes of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 fire is being cleared 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.619
 a man who was near the place was 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.609
 taken to the police station our team 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.369
 always look there 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.340
 the fire destroyed warehouse 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.650
 shipyard that manufactures tugboats in 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.510
 from the shed there were tons of material 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.230
 used in shipbuilding 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.390
 the loss has not yet been recorded 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.750
 galpón was very committed is 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.670
 practically the structure of the field 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.559
 the material that is there 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.020
 within the committed 80 per cent 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.640
 are those that were restricted to the container 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.559
 some managed to save because the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.870
 container safe the flames né 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.850
 but some of them contain neither the nor the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 content material was able to 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.440
 to resist the calorie were more than two 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.989
 hours to control the flames 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.000
 the workers were surprised 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.820
 by the incident in the shed that is in 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.770
 activity just over a month ago 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.780
 The movement here at the shipyard is now 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.780
 quieter dozens of staff 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.270
 were dispensed at least during the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.490
 morning activities were suspended 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.950
 because it is not yet known exactly what 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.630
 happened at that time within the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 shipyard in an area we do not have 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.970
 access or visual experience is an 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.250
 civil defense officials and also the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.460
 fire department assess whether there is 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.610
 conditions of the shed where the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.220
 keep standing or if it will 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.110
 demolished 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.240
 are being evaluated that they have not yet 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.270
 knows exactly what will happen by 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.860
 here what is known what is investigated is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 that this fire may have been 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.149
 criminal 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 this man was detained and taken to the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.700
 station he was found near the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.009
 shed and is not an employee of the company 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.320
 images of the monitoring system 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.420
 can assist in investigations 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.890
 He said he came in because he was 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.640
 escaped from the people who were chasing 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.950
 he is 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.560
 but it was quite contradictory 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.050
 then the fire will be investigated there 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.560
 was so great that firefighters of saints 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.240
 were also triggered but had 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.450
 difficulties to reach the guarujá them 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.680
 were prevented from crossing by the ferry 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.550
 we had difficulty reaching 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.800
 here because the ferry is not allowed to 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.800
 the vehicles crossed the raft 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.680
 so we had to go back there by 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.440
 Home dog is that back a little 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.420
 support is now more will be verified 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.720
 thereafter with the provisions 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.720
 will be adopted
