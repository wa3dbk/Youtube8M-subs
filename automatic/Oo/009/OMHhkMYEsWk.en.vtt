it to be on a zigzag stretch which is
this<00:01:10.210> one<00:01:10.420> here<00:01:10.450> on<00:01:10.930> number<00:01:11.200> two<00:01:11.440> I<00:01:12.120> machine

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
this one here on number two I machine

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.730 
this one here on number two I machine
shows<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.900> I'm<00:01:14.050> on<00:01:14.260> number<00:01:14.500> two<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.740> then

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
shows that I'm on number two and then

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.010 
shows that I'm on number two and then
the<00:01:17.980> width<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.520> usually<00:01:19.150> keep<00:01:19.360> that<00:01:19.600> my<00:01:19.780> default
