00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350 

this<00:00:00.149> is<00:00:00.269> a<00:00:00.299> purchase<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.719> very<00:00:00.930> tough

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.360 
this is a purchase a very tough

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.590 
this is a purchase a very tough
engineering<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.389> bummer<00:00:04.160> and<00:00:05.420> it<00:00:06.420> wasn't

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
engineering a bummer and it wasn't

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.440 
engineering a bummer and it wasn't
something<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.200> thought<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:08.460> wasn't<00:00:09.090> sure

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
something that I thought I wasn't sure

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.740 
something that I thought I wasn't sure
it<00:00:09.690> couldn't<00:00:09.929> be<00:00:10.080> solved<00:00:10.440> but<00:00:10.950> for<00:00:11.190> one<00:00:11.750> but

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
it couldn't be solved but for one but

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.839 
it couldn't be solved but for one but
then<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.469> think<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.519> relatively

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
then I think just just so relatively

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.109 
then I think just just so relatively
recently<00:00:15.920> listen<00:00:16.920> within<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> last<00:00:17.789> 12

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
recently listen within the last 12

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.790 
recently listen within the last 12
months<00:00:18.150> or<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.600> I've<00:00:18.960> company<00:00:19.350> clear<00:00:19.590> that

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
months or so I've company clear that

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.179 
months or so I've company clear that
that<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.039> can't<00:00:20.340> assault<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.769> space

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
that I can't assault and I think space

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.439 
that I can't assault and I think space
was<00:00:23.519> not<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> cottage<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:25.170> could<00:00:25.619> fail<00:00:26.449> I'm

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
was not the cottage up we could fail I'm

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.210 
was not the cottage up we could fail I'm
not<00:00:27.660> saying<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:28.080> we're<00:00:28.680> certain<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.039> success

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
not saying we we're certain of success

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.930 
not saying we we're certain of success
here<00:00:29.480> but<00:00:30.480> we're<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.109> try<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.579> and<00:00:32.579> we

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
here but we're going to try to do and we

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.530 
here but we're going to try to do and we
have<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> design<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.280> on<00:00:35.280> paper<00:00:36.000> doing<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
have a design that on paper doing the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.170 
have a design that on paper doing the
calculations<00:00:37.170> doing<00:00:37.380> simulations<00:00:38.180> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
calculations doing simulations it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
calculations doing simulations it
doesn't<00:00:39.480> work<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:40.649> now<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:40.829> need<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> make

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
doesn't work and now we need to make

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.040 
doesn't work and now we need to make
sure<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> simulations<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.450> reality

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
sure that the simulations and reality

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.860 
sure that the simulations and reality
agree<00:00:43.649> has<00:00:44.489> generally<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:45.660> don't

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
agree has generally when they don't

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.890 
agree has generally when they don't
reality<00:00:46.260> with

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.160 

and<00:00:51.590> then<00:00:51.770> this<00:00:51.860> is<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.930> simulation<00:00:53.930> that<00:00:54.050> you

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
and then this is the simulation that you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.140 
and then this is the simulation that you
may<00:00:54.290> have<00:00:54.320> seen<00:00:54.560> in<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.100> lobby<00:00:55.280> coming<00:00:55.700> in<00:00:55.850> i

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
may have seen in the lobby coming in i

was working posted to our website right
around<00:00:59.480> now<00:01:00.040> is<00:01:01.060> will<00:01:02.060> show<00:01:02.240> you<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.420> simulation

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
around now is will show you a simulation

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.940 
around now is will show you a simulation
of<00:01:03.230> what<00:01:03.800> we<00:01:04.070> 45<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:04.910> do<00:01:05.410> now<00:01:06.410> that<00:01:06.440> simulation

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
of what we 45 to do now that simulation

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.830 
of what we 45 to do now that simulation
is<00:01:07.250> is<00:01:07.490> mostly<00:01:07.940> accurate<00:01:08.150> but<00:01:08.600> there<00:01:08.750> are<00:01:08.810> a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
is is mostly accurate but there are a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.620 
is is mostly accurate but there are a
few<00:01:08.990> areas<00:01:09.230> which<00:01:09.530> are<00:01:09.680> inaccurate<00:01:10.190> in<00:01:10.730> some

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
few areas which are inaccurate in some

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.620 
few areas which are inaccurate in some
cases<00:01:12.340> just<00:01:13.340> do<00:01:13.730> timing<00:01:14.150> constraints<00:01:14.540> we

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
cases just do timing constraints we

weren't<00:01:14.840> able<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:15.080> work<00:01:15.260> with<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.150> simulation

and<00:01:20.480> some<00:01:20.870> cases<00:01:21.050> we're<00:01:21.350> keeping<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.800> few

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
and some cases we're keeping a few

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.000 
and some cases we're keeping a few
technical<00:01:22.310> things<00:01:22.670> under<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:23.630> have<00:01:23.920> but<00:01:24.920> it

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
technical things under I have but it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.469 
technical things under I have but it
