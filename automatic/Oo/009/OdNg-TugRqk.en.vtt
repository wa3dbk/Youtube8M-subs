posting public matches I really get into
the<00:04:20.349> competitive<00:04:20.650> side

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
the competitive side

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.340 
the competitive side
it's<00:04:22.760> funny<00:04:23.000> because<00:04:23.300> when<00:04:23.450> when<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:23.990> get<00:04:24.200> the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
it's funny because when when you get the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.540 
it's funny because when when you get the
competitive<00:04:24.770> side<00:04:24.860> of<00:04:25.010> call<00:04:25.160> duty<00:04:25.340> you

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
competitive side of call duty you

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.430 
competitive side of call duty you
realize<00:04:25.880> how<00:04:26.090> inferior<00:04:26.450> of<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:27.050> player<00:04:27.230> you<00:04:27.410> are

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
realize how inferior of a player you are

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.490 
realize how inferior of a player you are
compared<00:04:27.920> to<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.070> top<00:04:28.280> players<00:04:28.580> um<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:30.200> I

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
compared to the top players um so I

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.280 
compared to the top players um so I
guess<00:04:30.920> people<00:04:31.460> haven't<00:04:32.060> realized<00:04:32.390> their<00:04:33.020> true

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
guess people haven't realized their true

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.870 
guess people haven't realized their true
skill<00:04:33.620> level<00:04:33.890> just<00:04:34.190> because<00:04:34.430> they're<00:04:34.550> basing

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
skill level just because they're basing

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.610 
skill level just because they're basing
it<00:04:35.000> off<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.300> numbers<00:04:35.660> in<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.870> public<00:04:36.170> match<00:04:36.320> but

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
it off the numbers in a public match but

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.380 
it off the numbers in a public match but
I<00:04:36.800> think<00:04:37.280> I've<00:04:37.400> come<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.730> conclusion<00:04:37.940> where

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
I think I've come to a conclusion where

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.570 
I think I've come to a conclusion where
I<00:04:38.420> stand<00:04:38.810> out<00:04:38.990> as<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.170> player<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:40.250> think<00:04:40.460> a

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
I stand out as a player and I think a

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.100 
I stand out as a player and I think a
lot<00:04:40.730> of<00:04:40.760> other<00:04:41.030> people<00:04:41.240> need<00:04:41.540> to<00:04:41.570> understand

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
lot of other people need to understand

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.350 
lot of other people need to understand
where<00:04:42.260> they're<00:04:42.380> at<00:04:42.560> if<00:04:43.520> they<00:04:43.850> just<00:04:44.060> play

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
where they're at if they just play

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.000 
where they're at if they just play
straight<00:04:44.720> public<00:04:45.080> matches<00:04:45.230> they're<00:04:45.710> probably

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
straight public matches they're probably

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.320 
straight public matches they're probably
