00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.330
 we are about to receive a new year in the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 which lately there are parties where 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.640
 be and it is here that brings you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.730
 this option in video of how I 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.369
 would fix for these dates and before 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.880
 all good makeup is nothing 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.369
 exaggerated in my opinion since good the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.369
 wardrobe has a lot to do we start 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.399
 with the face already having applied our 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.220
 makeup applied a pre-base for the 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:35.130
 eyes after the test was applied a 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.140
 leader in golden color or can choose 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.260
 that you want is to give it a little more 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.450
 of brightness to the look and good that the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.790
 look look much better and expressive 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.100
 after turning we are going to apply a 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.540
 eyeliner in my opinion I like them 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.740
 plus the gel ones and between the more 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.810
 sophisticated and much better 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.079
 it calls more the attention the look a type 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.989
 block fine but with the leader we give you a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.510
 touch a little different the money has 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.729
 to be very marked a little more elongated 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.149
 so that the look looks elongated and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149
 big 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.750
 applied this type of shadow tone 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.299
 only in the eye socket to 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.759
 give more depth to the face and it looks 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.640
 a little more define a color pencil 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.829
 nude on the part of the water line 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.289
 so that our look is much more 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.630
 big and we only delineate the part 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.600
 bottom of eyelashes to enlarge the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 look the eyelashes can not miss and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.439
 eyes look much more expressive in 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.899
 what we expect we apply our mascara 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.299
 the one you want now, good 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.030
 eyelashes are much more make-up and 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.340
 we only apply our lashes and 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.700
 we finished with the touch of putting them together 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.280
 like a mascara to join later 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.979
 with a pencil in black tone only the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.200
 top of the water line to 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.689
 that resist being much thicker and 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.689
 the look much more impressive 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.380
 for the lips I have three options and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.050
 depending on the tastes 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.740
 can use in very light tones and 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.190
 Sweet tones stronger and more elegant 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.260
 much more striking buttons capture the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.660
 look towards your lips so you have 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.650
 here three options according to your 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.650
 preference 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.159
 here is the numbers of the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.780
 lipsticks that you saw in this video and it's 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.780
 of the web brand in wine 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.860
 good so we're not going to make a mistake 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.750
 and more that are very striking colors 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.239
 this kind of only apply our 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.459
 base as a type of a designer on the outside and 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.650
 Blend lips will look better 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.209
 delineated we went with the hair in 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.860
 this time I have much more hair 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.280
 short so we'll do a little bit a little 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.739
 different in the video its protector and 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.690
 brush my hair this time I'll 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.049
 to use skiable fabrics in the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.140
 past video glove past the shopping 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.260
 and we are going to start curling the hair 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.079
 we hold and we turn towards the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.840
 outside of the opposite of our face 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.940
 all over the hair the pincer is very 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.760
 thick so the curls are not so 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.090
 defined are only to have the 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.280
 hair wavy but not so marked and 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.280
 so we will do it all over the hair 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.250
 this kind of techniques can do it 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.250
 those of short hair as well as those of hair 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.620
 long and good here a choice of how 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.170
 use only loose hair 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.290
 but now that if you're going to a party 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.510
 and well you can not bring hair 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.720
 loose I suggest you good the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.270
 let's pick up a disheveled hairstyle but 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.670
 picked up and looks nice at the same time 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.180
 let's fasten our hair on 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.370
 several sections beginning with separate 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.980
 the part of the sides of our hair 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.930
 and from the back make a 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.930
 little horse tail 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.120
 we separate in several sections we roll up 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.460
 between our fingers and we apply 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.520
 our pins fasten and come back 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.820
 to do the same and so for all the rest 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.430
 of the tail 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.650
 in the opposite part the strands that 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.260
 we do and how many norris 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.410
 we will pass later towards the 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.910
 from behind to join it with the medium 8 what 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.330
 what we did in the back of the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.370
 Hair is a very simple hairstyle very 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.130
 easy and believe me in several 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.040
 celebrities have this type of hair 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.880
 on the red carpets and they are nothing 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.520
 nothing difficult here is the finished look 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.440
 it looks very simple and I think what 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.210
 calls a little more attention apart from the 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.830
 hairstyle that is very simple is the 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.830
 makeup as you want to use 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.970
 now we start that as you know 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.120
 I have three options starting with a 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.600
 more formal look more for a party a 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.310
 special event a small dress with 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.550
 the lace hello 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.590
 and put very striking accessories in 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.900
 is hot in a robbery but you can 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.600
 use a golden gray or any 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.139
 color to your preference the one you like the most 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.560
 the more striking the accessory a lot 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.870

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.680

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.630
 casual but also beautiful at the same time and 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.600
 Here you can use in three nude colors 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:58.320
 and the top part in the top a color 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.920
 more intense red blue in this color of 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.689

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.860
