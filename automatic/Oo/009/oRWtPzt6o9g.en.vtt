00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
is almost the thing that's the first so

00:01:28.780 --> 00:02:10.250 
is almost the thing that's the first so
your<00:01:28.900> second<00:01:29.200> chorus<00:01:29.440> goes<00:01:29.590> G

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.370 

okay<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.220> then<00:02:12.370> basically<00:02:12.700> you're<00:02:12.970> going<00:02:13.120> to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
okay and then basically you're going to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.809 
okay and then basically you're going to
afterwards<00:02:14.380> at<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.950> plane<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.489> part<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.760> the

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
afterwards at the plane that part of the

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:16.470 
afterwards at the plane that part of the
bridge

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
bridge

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.210 
bridge
I<00:02:16.510> believe<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.200> repeats<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.650> same<00:02:17.890> chords

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
I believe it repeats the same chords

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:28.740 
I believe it repeats the same chords
again<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:19.150> go<00:02:19.269> back<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.810> chorus<00:02:25.319> minor

very<00:02:35.380> end<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.430> goes<00:02:36.610> back<00:02:36.850> and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
very end of it it just goes back and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.840
