could it feel like it hit Tino sequel to
this<00:00:29.550> game<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.090> don't<00:00:30.269> think<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.920> yeah

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
this game but I don't think it is yeah

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.580 
this game but I don't think it is yeah
it<00:00:32.460> actually<00:00:32.730> depends<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.570> think<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.380> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it actually depends I think like if you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.790 
it actually depends I think like if you
get<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.040> right<00:00:35.070> ending<00:00:35.790> Scott<00:00:36.750> dies<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.680> then

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
get the right ending Scott dies and then

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.110 
get the right ending Scott dies and then
the<00:00:38.579> game's<00:00:38.820> over<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.600> no<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.440> know

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
the game's over there's no you know

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.750 
the game's over there's no you know
