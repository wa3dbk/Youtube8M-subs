00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
video with kind of just talking about

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.380 
video with kind of just talking about
why<00:01:15.840> someone<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.439> want<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.740> capture<00:01:17.100> card

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
why someone would want a capture card

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.820 
why someone would want a capture card
there<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.509> two<00:01:18.869> reasons<00:01:18.900> pretty<00:01:19.590> much<00:01:19.740> you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
there are two reasons pretty much you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.870 
there are two reasons pretty much you
would<00:01:19.950> want<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> capture<00:01:20.310> card<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> first

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
would want to capture card the first

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.760 
would want to capture card the first
reason<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.900> are<00:01:21.930> streaming<00:01:22.380> with

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
reason is if you are streaming with

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
reason is if you are streaming with
xsplit<00:01:23.159> or<00:01:23.280> any<00:01:23.400> other<00:01:23.580> program<00:01:23.790> or<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
xsplit or any other program or if you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
xsplit or any other program or if you
are<00:01:24.600> recording<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.409> videos<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> upload<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
youtube and you want to have less strain

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.649 
youtube and you want to have less strain
on<00:01:30.869> your<00:01:31.229> cpu<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.159> pretty<00:01:32.659> cpu

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
on your cpu because it's pretty cpu

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.030 
on your cpu because it's pretty cpu
intensive<00:01:33.960> i<00:01:34.229> actually<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
intensive i actually have one of the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.819 
intensive i actually have one of the
newer<00:01:35.640> top<00:01:36.030> aligned<00:01:36.390> cpus<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.650> still

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
newer top aligned cpus and it's still

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.010 
newer top aligned cpus and it's still
kind<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.100> hard<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.310> me<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.759> stream<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> record

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
kind of hard for me to stream a record

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.249 
kind of hard for me to stream a record
in<00:01:40.110> 1080p<00:01:40.530> or<00:01:40.710> 720p<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.229> reason

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
in 1080p or 720p so that is one reason

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.550 
in 1080p or 720p so that is one reason

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
the second reason would be so you can

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.859 
the second reason would be so you can
stream<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.950> record<00:01:47.159> console<00:01:48.119> games<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.720> your

brand<00:03:29.880> new<00:03:29.970> capture<00:03:30.239> card<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.690> I'm

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
brand new capture card that I'm

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.570 
brand new capture card that I'm
incredibly<00:03:31.260> excited<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.739> use<00:03:32.239> let's<00:03:33.239> see

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
incredibly excited to use let's see

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.720 
incredibly excited to use let's see
figure<00:03:35.580> out<00:03:35.700> how<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.910> take<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.239> out<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.630> box

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
components here and as you know even

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.790 
components here and as you know even
though<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.580> newer<00:03:51.090> ones<00:03:51.360> are<00:03:51.630> more<00:03:52.620> durable

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
actually touch the circuit board where

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.729 
actually touch the circuit board where
all<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.720> important<00:03:58.110> stuff<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.410> because<00:03:58.650> you

going to leave because you know why not

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.790 
going to leave because you know why not
I'm<00:04:04.590> not<00:04:04.769> installing<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.880> as<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.209> yet<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.800> then

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
I'm not installing it as of yet and then

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.039 
I'm not installing it as of yet and then
let's<00:04:08.130> try<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.340> take<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.550> button<00:04:08.850> out<00:04:08.970> ah<00:04:09.300> so

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
let's try to take the button out ah so

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.460 
let's try to take the button out ah so
much<00:04:10.080> difficulty<00:04:11.450> come<00:04:12.450> on<00:04:12.570> button<00:04:13.580> alright

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
much difficulty come on button alright

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
go so here's my little record button so

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.950 
go so here's my little record button so
awesome<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:29.240> looks<00:04:29.330> like<00:04:29.450> it's<00:04:29.540> USB

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
awesome and it looks like it's USB

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.950 
awesome and it looks like it's USB

this is I'm pretty bad with computers
but<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.230> think<00:05:30.650> this<00:05:30.740> is<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:31.300> what's<00:05:32.300> called

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
but I I think this is a what's called

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.159 
but I I think this is a what's called
not<00:05:34.070> hdmi<00:05:36.490> DVI<00:05:37.490> maybe<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.270> I<00:05:38.360> don't<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:38.900> don't
