00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570 

this<00:00:00.599> is<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.079> little<00:00:01.680> video<00:00:01.829> I'm<00:00:02.129> going<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.370> do

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
this is a little video I'm going to do

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.270 
this is a little video I'm going to do
and<00:00:03.000> it<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.810> inspired<00:00:04.500> by<00:00:05.000> a<00:00:06.649> Suzy<00:00:07.649> blue<00:00:07.950> tube

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
and it is inspired by a Suzy blue tube

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.900 
and it is inspired by a Suzy blue tube
and<00:00:09.050> I<00:00:10.050> thought<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.679> would<00:00:10.800> make<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.580> little

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
and I thought I would make a little

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.379 
and I thought I would make a little
Christmas<00:00:12.389> tree<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.900> kind<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.349> show<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.389> how

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
Christmas tree and kind of show you how

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.730 
Christmas tree and kind of show you how
I<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> using<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.970> bottle<00:00:20.970> then<00:00:21.740> I'm

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
I do it so using this bottle then I'm

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.210 
I do it so using this bottle then I'm
going<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> use<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:24.240> base<00:00:25.010> just<00:00:26.010> like<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
going to use this base just like a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.179 
going to use this base just like a
Styrofoam<00:00:26.970> sort<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.840> ringing<00:00:28.170> I'm<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
Styrofoam sort of ringing I'm going to

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.659 
Styrofoam sort of ringing I'm going to
use<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.490> base<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.570> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:32.340> bottom

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
use this base to kind of as the bottom

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.250 
use this base to kind of as the bottom
of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> tree<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.450> use<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.809> top<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
of the tree and use the top of the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.000 
of the tree and use the top of the
bottle<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> top<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> tree<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.850> then

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
bottle for the top of the tree and then

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.299 
bottle for the top of the tree and then
I'm<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> take<00:00:38.930> this<00:00:39.930> stuff<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:41.100> kind

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
I'm going to take this stuff this kind

00:00:41.309 --> 00:01:15.610 
I'm going to take this stuff this kind
of<00:00:41.430> paper<00:00:41.760> twine<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.719> green<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.469> red<00:00:43.649> twine

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.410 

but<00:01:16.160> what<00:01:16.280> I'm<00:01:16.370> going<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.550> do<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:17.090> I'm<00:01:17.240> going<00:01:17.360> to

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.280 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
glue<00:01:17.890> this<00:01:18.890> stuff<00:01:19.370> to<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.820> base<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:21.170> I'm

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
glue this stuff to the base and I'm

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.660 
glue this stuff to the base and I'm
going<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:21.470> go<00:01:21.560> all<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.800> way<00:01:21.920> around<00:01:22.130> it

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.950 

interchanging<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.700> red<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.300> green<00:01:26.660> and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
interchanging the red and the green and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.550 
interchanging the red and the green and
then<00:01:27.710> once<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.430> get<00:01:28.580> them<00:01:28.730> all<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:29.090> there<00:01:29.560> then

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
then once I get them all on there then

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.870 
then once I get them all on there then
I'm<00:01:30.710> going<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.890> figure<00:01:31.220> out<00:01:31.750> how<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.810> make<00:01:33.140> it

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
I'm going to figure out how to make it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.080 
I'm going to figure out how to make it
triangular<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:35.270> guess<00:01:35.450> cone-shaped<00:01:36.430> so<00:01:37.430> I'm

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
triangular I guess cone-shaped so I'm

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.970 
triangular I guess cone-shaped so I'm
going<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.300> start<00:01:38.420> by<00:01:38.780> hot<00:01:39.230> gluing<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:42.020> onto

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
going to start by hot gluing this onto

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.660 
going to start by hot gluing this onto
the<00:01:43.010> base<00:01:43.220> now<00:01:44.180> this<00:01:44.870> is<00:01:45.050> kind<00:01:45.230> of<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.560> hard<00:01:46.070> sort

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
the base now this is kind of a hard sort

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.210 
the base now this is kind of a hard sort
of<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:49.390> styrofoam<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:51.110> takes<00:01:51.620> hot<00:01:51.980> glue

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
of of styrofoam so it takes hot glue

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.360 
of of styrofoam so it takes hot glue
pretty<00:01:52.640> well<00:01:52.880> some<00:01:53.330> styrofoam<00:01:53.630> will<00:01:54.260> melt<00:01:55.010> as

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
pretty well some styrofoam will melt as

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.300 
pretty well some styrofoam will melt as
soon<00:01:55.910> as<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.210> hits<00:01:56.930> heat<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:57.710> this<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.130> pretty

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
soon as it hits heat so this is pretty

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.080 
soon as it hits heat so this is pretty
hard<00:01:58.730> and<00:01:59.030> dense<00:01:59.330> so<00:02:00.170> it's<00:02:00.650> not<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.950> case<00:02:01.340> and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
hard and dense so it's not the case and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:13.290 
hard and dense so it's not the case and
I'm<00:02:02.270> going<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.480> taper<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:03.050> off<00:02:03.170> at<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.430> bottom

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:35.120 

you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.490 

I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.860 

so<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:40.190> far<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:41.090> have<00:02:41.630> most<00:02:42.530> read<00:02:43.340> attached<00:02:44.180> to

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
so so far I have most read attached to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.280 
so so far I have most read attached to
the<00:02:45.560> bottle<00:02:49.480> honestly<00:02:50.480> like<00:02:50.600> just<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.200> you

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
the bottle honestly like just so you

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.330 
the bottle honestly like just so you
know<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.710> have<00:02:52.010> no<00:02:52.190> idea<00:02:53.410> if<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.280> to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
know I have no idea if this is going to

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.380 
know I have no idea if this is going to
work<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.510> when<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:56.930> say<00:02:57.020> work<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.980> mean<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.940> it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
work and when I say work I mean is it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.210 
work and when I say work I mean is it
going<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.750> look<00:02:59.870> like<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.080> Christmas<00:03:00.680> tree<00:03:00.710> and

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
going to look like a Christmas tree and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.410 
going to look like a Christmas tree and
I<00:03:01.670> guess<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:02.060> should<00:03:02.270> say<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:03.560> know

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
I guess I should say you know

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.370 
I guess I should say you know
artistically<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:05.810> going<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.050> work<00:03:06.230> no

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
artistically it's going to work no

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.280 
artistically it's going to work no
matter<00:03:06.500> what<00:03:06.830> cuz<00:03:07.400> I'll<00:03:07.640> just<00:03:08.060> make<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:08.960> work

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
matter what cuz I'll just make it work

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.730 
matter what cuz I'll just make it work
but<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.850> don't<00:03:11.630> know<00:03:11.720> if<00:03:11.810> my<00:03:11.840> original<00:03:12.530> concept

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
but I don't know if my original concept

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.680 
but I don't know if my original concept
is<00:03:13.310> going<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.550> be<00:03:13.700> enough<00:03:14.000> I<00:03:14.270> may<00:03:14.450> have<00:03:14.540> to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
is going to be enough I may have to

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:27.670 
is going to be enough I may have to
tweak<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.080> a<00:03:15.140> little<00:03:15.290> bit<00:03:15.470> but<00:03:15.710> we'll<00:03:15.920> see

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:38.320 

breathe

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.000 

see<00:03:39.330> this<00:03:39.570> but<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.750> cone-shaped<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:43.500> got<00:03:43.980> a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
see this but it is cone-shaped I got a

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.710 
see this but it is cone-shaped I got a
little<00:03:44.160> hole<00:03:44.490> back<00:03:44.730> here<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.060> I'm<00:03:45.300> going<00:03:45.660> to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
little hole back here that I'm going to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.150 
little hole back here that I'm going to
need<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.990> fix<00:03:46.290> but<00:03:47.100> overall<00:03:47.460> it<00:03:48.420> worked<00:03:49.160> I'm

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
need to fix but overall it worked I'm

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.970 
need to fix but overall it worked I'm
going<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.370> do<00:03:50.490> some<00:03:50.730> tweaking<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.530> then<00:03:52.530> i'll

it I think it makes it look a little
more<00:04:48.390> dynamic<00:04:49.280> mm-hmm<00:04:50.280> so<00:04:50.850> now<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.120> tree<00:04:51.510> is

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
more dynamic mm-hmm so now the tree is

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.130 
more dynamic mm-hmm so now the tree is
done<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.140> that<00:04:52.980> means<00:04:53.220> I<00:04:53.640> get<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:54.540> decorate<00:04:54.870> it
