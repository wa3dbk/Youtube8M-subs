00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:06.690
 during the director is the land management system well that the remains of culture 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.900
 shot by two countries among others are left on the surface of the ground 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.810
 being removed only advisory 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.940
 where they deposit the seeds and made them years of use 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.240
 the control of invasive plants he acted through the application of 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.570
 herbicides according to which the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.570
 crop rotation for pest and disease control 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.640
 planting system better the physical conditions and the fertility of the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.170
 nutrient and water content of organic matter 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.600
 stored 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.480
 to control erosion the great enemy of the farmer 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.680
 because the straw on the surface protests the soil another impact of the drops 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.739
 reducing the breakdown of 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.530
 Surface licking was observed, ensuring greater infiltration of water into the soil 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.560
 the whale on the surface of the ground 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.560
 also helps reduce surface temperature 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.560
 in four degrees centigrade 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.160
 the temperature oscillation between day and night also decreases 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.340
 for the sake of water savings in areas of irrigated production of up to 30% 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.680
 the cost of production in no-till is about 6 to 14 percent lower 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.100
 because in the southeast system there is no need to carry out operations 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.550
 of plowing hydrates son-in-law making the required power of tractors 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.330
 decreases between 30 and 60% 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.090
 increasing the useful life of the equipment and contributing to the reduction of 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.420
 costs of fuel consumption 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.480
 in up to 70% 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.900
 for adoption of this system 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.630
 adaptation of the cultivated area is necessary, eliminating erosion and 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.870
 compaction by correcting the soil acidity before the start of the new system 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.720
 it is also necessary to carry out the survey and the initial control of 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.159
 invasive plants 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.339
 we sought the correct management 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:18.719
 reduction in herbicide application as well as the 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.289
 been targeted
