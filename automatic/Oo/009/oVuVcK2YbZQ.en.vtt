00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
basically got the echo freeze so you can

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.030 
basically got the echo freeze so you can
do<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.090> little<00:02:17.300> pauses<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.260> stuff<00:02:18.500> we've<00:02:18.800> got

the beat masher

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.660 
the beat masher
we've<00:02:20.570> got<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:20.990> triplet<00:02:21.500> feel<00:02:21.890> quarters

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
we've got like a triplet feel quarters

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.710 
we've got like a triplet feel quarters
eighths<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:24.250> sixteenths<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.550> think<00:02:25.970> Berto

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
eighths and sixteenths I think Berto

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.610 
eighths and sixteenths I think Berto
quarters<00:02:27.260> or<00:02:27.980> triplets<00:02:29.350> 8/16<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.470> thirty

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
quarters or triplets 8/16 and thirty

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.690 
quarters or triplets 8/16 and thirty
twos<00:02:30.860> just<00:02:31.730> get<00:02:31.910> real<00:02:32.150> whacked<00:02:32.360> out<00:02:33.700> syncing

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
twos just get real whacked out syncing

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.600 
twos just get real whacked out syncing
for<00:02:35.030> each<00:02:35.300> deck<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.440> now<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:36.860> don't<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.490> to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
for each deck so now you don't have to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.030 
for each deck so now you don't have to
worry<00:02:37.820> about<00:02:38.030> just<00:02:38.210> one<00:02:38.780> master<00:02:39.350> sync<00:02:39.650> like<00:02:39.890> my

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
worry about just one master sync like my

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.980 
worry about just one master sync like my
last<00:02:40.250> mapping<00:02:40.760> was<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.240> then<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.450> plays<00:02:41.690> of

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
last mapping was and then the plays of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.020 
last mapping was and then the plays of
course<00:02:42.190> which<00:02:43.190> we<00:02:43.370> can't<00:02:43.610> hear<00:02:43.850> anything

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
course which we can't hear anything

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.120 
course which we can't hear anything
because<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.960> all<00:02:45.110> going<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.590> audio<00:02:45.950> too

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
because it's all going to the audio too

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.770 
because it's all going to the audio too
but<00:02:46.340> that's<00:02:46.460> okay<00:02:46.880> because<00:02:47.060> that's<00:02:47.360> not<00:02:47.630> what

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
but that's okay because that's not what

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.290 
but that's okay because that's not what
this<00:02:47.930> video<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.320> about<00:02:48.820> video<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:50.000> all<00:02:50.270> about

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
into a club and the mixer doesn't have

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.190 
into a club and the mixer doesn't have
filters<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.880> love<00:02:59.120> using<00:02:59.480> filters<00:02:59.900> and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
filters and I love using filters and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.630 
filters and I love using filters and

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
off then basically plus and minus so if

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.540 
off then basically plus and minus so if
I<00:03:26.420> hold<00:03:26.630> this<00:03:26.870> down<00:03:27.170> you<00:03:27.650> can<00:03:27.709> kind<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.100> see<00:03:28.370> it

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
I hold this down you can kind of see it

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.590 
I hold this down you can kind of see it
on<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:31.900> here<00:03:32.900> we<00:03:32.989> go<00:03:33.140> so<00:03:33.440> if<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.680> hold<00:03:33.830> that<00:03:33.950> down

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
on the here we go so if I hold that down

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.620 
on the here we go so if I hold that down

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
you'd see it go up if I hold it down

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.370 
you'd see it go up if I hold it down
this<00:03:38.959> is<00:03:39.110> button<00:03:39.530> bottom<00:03:40.220> right<00:03:40.400> here<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:42.290> you

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
this is button bottom right here so you

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.650 
this is button bottom right here so you
go<00:03:42.500> up<00:03:42.700> now<00:03:43.700> what<00:03:43.910> if<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.060> want<00:03:44.270> to<00:03:44.330> get<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.510> back

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
go up now what if I want to get it back

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.420 
go up now what if I want to get it back
to<00:03:44.900> exactly<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.470> middle<00:03:45.800> that's<00:03:46.070> what<00:03:46.280> this

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
to exactly the middle that's what this

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.660 
to exactly the middle that's what this
is<00:03:46.700> just<00:03:46.910> BAM<00:03:47.150> full<00:03:47.600> reset<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.500> middle<00:03:48.800> so

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
is just BAM full reset to the middle so

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.550 
is just BAM full reset to the middle so
I<00:03:49.700> could<00:03:50.090> be<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.239> true<00:03:50.690> true<00:03:50.870> true<00:03:50.900> about<00:03:51.320> pop

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
I could be a true true true about pop

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.910 
I could be a true true true about pop
pop<00:03:51.800> and<00:03:51.830> bam<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.610> then<00:03:52.730> right<00:03:53.300> back<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.720> it

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
pop and bam and then right back to it

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.100 
pop and bam and then right back to it
and<00:03:54.920> that's<00:03:55.820> really<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.330> I'm<00:03:56.540> gonna<00:03:56.660> add<00:03:56.870> more

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110
