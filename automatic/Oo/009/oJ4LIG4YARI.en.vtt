something so it goes up to why this
headset<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:34.549> an<00:01:35.549> important<00:01:36.000> thing<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
headset but an important thing is that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.240 
headset but an important thing is that
it<00:01:37.320> must<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.210> output<00:01:40.110> device<00:01:40.259> as

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it must we go to the output device as

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.670 
it must we go to the output device as
the<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.299> some<00:01:42.540> default<00:01:43.049> device<00:01:43.290> which

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the this is some default device which

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.380 
the this is some default device which
means<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> will<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:44.850> through<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
means that it will go out through the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.539 
means that it will go out through the
game<00:01:45.540> sound<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:46.860> come<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> through

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
game sound and it will come in through

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.630 
game sound and it will come in through
the<00:01:47.700> AV<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.210> into<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> LGP<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.460> very

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the AV in into the LGP which is very

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.639 
the AV in into the LGP which is very
important<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.659> then<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.320> come<00:01:52.500> in

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
important so then that will come in

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.700 
important so then that will come in
foody<00:01:53.369> capture<00:01:54.119> device<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> component

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
foody capture device got the component

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.620 
foody capture device got the component
our<00:01:56.009> audio<00:01:56.430> source<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.630> record<00:01:58.020> it

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
our audio source and you record it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.600 
our audio source and you record it
microphone<00:02:00.630> always<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.130> same<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:02.579> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
microphone always on and same as a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.749 
microphone always on and same as a
separate<00:02:03.030> dottie<00:02:03.530> mp3<00:02:04.530> file<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.280> easy<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
separate dottie mp3 file so it's easy to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.969 
separate dottie mp3 file so it's easy to
record<00:02:06.299> by<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> guess<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.350> don't<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
record by I guess you don't have to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.120 
record by I guess you don't have to
separate<00:02:08.369> them<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.840> what<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.489> just

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
separate them so what I do is just

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.370 
separate them so what I do is just
you<00:02:12.280> know<00:02:12.370> place<00:02:12.850> it<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.750> right<00:02:14.170> ear

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
you know place it in in the right ear

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.290 
you know place it in in the right ear
and<00:02:14.650> see<00:02:14.920> not<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.160> left<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.670> right<00:02:15.790> here<00:02:16.030> cuz

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
and see not the left the right here cuz

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.840 
and see not the left the right here cuz
this<00:02:16.930> takes<00:02:17.230> up<00:02:17.350> more<00:02:17.560> space<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:18.700> just

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
this takes up more space it's just

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.120 
this takes up more space it's just
easier<00:02:19.120> part<00:02:19.300> on<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> right<00:02:19.630> iPhone<00:02:20.050> be<00:02:20.740> aware

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
easier part on the right iPhone be aware

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.520 
easier part on the right iPhone be aware
fix<00:02:21.700> your<00:02:21.850> bow<00:02:21.940> or<00:02:22.210> you<00:02:22.390> could<00:02:22.570> just<00:02:22.600> attach<00:02:23.050> it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
fix your bow or you could just attach it
