silence does it happened and then the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.609 
silence does it happened and then the
second<00:01:22.540> that<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.720> was<00:01:22.750> over<00:01:23.110> like<00:01:23.200> it<00:01:23.350> was<00:01:23.470> like

I mean graphically the Super Nintendo
version<00:02:37.930> was<00:02:38.170> great<00:02:38.440> like<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:38.920> looked<00:02:39.099> so<00:02:39.250> much

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
version was great like it looked so much

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.309 
version was great like it looked so much
better<00:02:39.430> than<00:02:39.790> genesis<00:02:40.239> version<00:02:40.420> but<00:02:40.900> those

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
better than genesis version but those

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.320 
better than genesis version but those
fatalities<00:02:41.739> in<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.220> blood<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:43.239> know

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
fatalities in the blood you know

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.600 
fatalities in the blood you know
violence<00:02:43.780> aside<00:02:44.110> they<00:02:44.290> just<00:02:44.500> added<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.280> just

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
violence aside they just added to just

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.690 
violence aside they just added to just
the<00:02:46.000> feel<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.660> game<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:48.010> sega<00:02:48.280> genesis

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
the feel of the game on the sega genesis

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.160 
the feel of the game on the sega genesis
you<00:02:49.060> can<00:02:49.180> straight<00:02:49.330> up<00:02:49.420> put<00:02:49.540> up<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.720> code<00:02:49.959> right

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
you can straight up put up a code right

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.170 
you can straight up put up a code right
so<00:02:50.319> i<00:02:50.349> think<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.560> was<00:02:50.650> like<00:02:50.739> at<00:02:51.370> Aqaba<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:52.030> what

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
so i think it was like at Aqaba is what

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.259 
so i think it was like at Aqaba is what
we<00:02:52.239> used<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.420> call<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.900> BAC<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.650> BB<00:02:54.150> start<00:02:55.150> I

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
we used to call it a BAC a BB start I

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.970 
we used to call it a BAC a BB start I
think<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:55.660> like<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.019> was<00:02:56.230> what<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.650> would<00:02:56.799> do

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
think so like that was what you would do

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.400 
think so like that was what you would do
to<00:02:57.010> activate<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:58.150> awesome<00:02:58.540> old<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.290> know

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
to activate the awesome old you know

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:10.520 
to activate the awesome old you know
fatalities<00:02:59.980> in<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.430> genesis<00:03:00.790> version

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.270 

problem<00:03:11.530> was<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.680> Super<00:03:11.920> Nintendo<00:03:12.010> version

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
problem was a Super Nintendo version

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.309 
problem was a Super Nintendo version
looked<00:03:12.849> really<00:03:13.180> good<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.599> looked<00:03:13.959> like<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
looked really good it looked like the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.860 
looked really good it looked like the
arcade<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:15.489> sages<00:03:15.849> version<00:03:16.239> didn't<00:03:16.510> quite

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
arcade the sages version didn't quite

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.640 
arcade the sages version didn't quite
look<00:03:17.049> as<00:03:17.200> good

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
look as good

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.930 
look as good
it<00:03:17.739> played<00:03:17.980> perfectly<00:03:18.489> on<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.700> Super

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
it played perfectly on the Super

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.490 
it played perfectly on the Super
Nintendo<00:03:19.000> is<00:03:19.360> like<00:03:19.450> an<00:03:19.540> arcade<00:03:19.840> perfect<00:03:20.079> port

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
Nintendo is like an arcade perfect port

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.350 
Nintendo is like an arcade perfect port
so<00:03:21.099> even<00:03:21.310> though<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.459> was<00:03:21.610> like<00:03:21.790> toned<00:03:22.239> down

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
so even though it was like toned down

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.970 
so even though it was like toned down
with<00:03:22.629> the<00:03:22.810> with<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.110> violence<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.620> still<00:03:23.829> was

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
with the with the violence it still was

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.039 
with the with the violence it still was
like<00:03:24.099> the<00:03:24.459> game<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.849> I<00:03:24.910> wanted<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.660> on<00:03:25.810> some

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
like the game that I wanted and on some

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.199 
like the game that I wanted and on some
level<00:03:26.079> -<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.530> think<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.459> was<00:03:27.640> sort<00:03:27.849> of<00:03:27.970> this

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
level - I think it was sort of this

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.690 
level - I think it was sort of this
realization<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.379> the<00:03:29.590> industry<00:03:30.069> was<00:03:30.459> ready

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
realization that the industry was ready

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.420 
realization that the industry was ready
to<00:03:30.940> embrace<00:03:31.239> violent<00:03:32.110> games<00:03:32.349> not<00:03:33.099> that<00:03:33.250> gangs

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
to embrace violent games not that gangs

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.729 
to embrace violent games not that gangs
had<00:03:33.639> been<00:03:33.910> violent<00:03:34.299> before<00:03:34.329> that<00:03:34.870> but<00:03:35.560> this

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
had been violent before that but this

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.319 
had been violent before that but this
was<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> game<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.459> kind<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.760> transcended

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
was a game that kind of transcended

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.550

think<00:04:35.320> it'll<00:04:35.800> ever<00:04:36.450> achieve<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.690> relevance

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
think it'll ever achieve the relevance

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.930 
think it'll ever achieve the relevance
that<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.469> had<00:04:38.620> before<00:04:39.039> like<00:04:39.310> if<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:39.669> look<00:04:39.789> at

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
that it had before like if you look at

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.940 
that it had before like if you look at
you<00:04:40.180> know<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.270> new<00:04:40.450> more<00:04:40.599> calm

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
you know the new more calm

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.590 
you know the new more calm
just<00:04:41.070> kind<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.250> prove<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:41.940> more<00:04:42.270> combat

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
just kind of prove that the more combat

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.700 
just kind of prove that the more combat
came<00:04:42.780> out<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:42.990> was<00:04:43.050> like<00:04:43.200> within<00:04:43.440> like<00:04:43.680> a

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
came out it was like within like a

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.500 
came out it was like within like a
couple<00:04:43.950> days<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.880> know<00:04:44.970> I<00:04:45.000> was<00:04:45.180> like<00:04:45.300> pretty

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
couple days you know I was like pretty

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.090 
couple days you know I was like pretty
much<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.780> lot<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.140> stuff<00:04:46.380> was<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:46.770> know<00:04:46.860> out

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
much a lot of stuff was you know out

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.100 
much a lot of stuff was you know out
there<00:04:47.340> at<00:04:47.430> that<00:04:47.580> point<00:04:47.850> despite<00:04:48.390> you<00:04:48.750> know<00:04:48.780> the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
there at that point despite you know the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.810 
there at that point despite you know the
quality<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.710> games<00:04:49.920> going<00:04:50.310> up<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.670> down

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
quality of the games going up and down

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.670 
quality of the games going up and down
over<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.240> years<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.660> think<00:04:51.720> Mortal<00:04:52.230> Kombat

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
over the years I think Mortal Kombat

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.620 
over the years I think Mortal Kombat
really<00:04:52.980> is<00:04:53.190> probably<00:04:54.180> one<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.480> more

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
really is probably one of the more

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.830 
really is probably one of the more
important<00:04:55.050> games<00:04:55.230> in<00:04:55.410> videogame<00:04:55.800> history
