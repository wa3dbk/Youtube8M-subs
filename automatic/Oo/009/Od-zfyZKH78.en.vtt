00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.620
 hi guys today I'm here for you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.700
 make yourself a scarf cupcake in the week 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.310
 past that is called the finger scarf 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.189
 this scarf he is super quick to be 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.380
 made very simple and can be done by 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.989
 anyone who does not know or do 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.029
 Crochet in knitting because the only thing 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.439
 that you will use to make a scarf is 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.800
 beyond the movie 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.090
 in the session of 7 this thread here he stayed 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.660
 a thicker scarf because it is a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.930
 Do you have a mini movie? 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.840
 bonbons in him normal right around the movie 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.240
 and it is full of set to pine is what 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.950
 It gets louder, but that's it. 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.800
 school is very good to make the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.230
 child is a lighter scarf and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.550
 I trust the worker is also unemployed 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.730
 This summoned a very large adult then 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.519
 I'll teach you how to do 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.720
 first I'll get my son, it 's the color 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.700
 whatever you want 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.859
 I'm making this simple thread that's for 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.990
 to make it easier for you to see 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.179
 but at home you have a thread worked 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.569
 a thread that lets you work 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.780
 You know I 'm going to make it, I 'll go and get it. 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.560
 I'll leave a piece and medina 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.670
 my hand 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.850
 Okay, I'll catch it, I'm going to be 29 years old. 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:37.409
 this space here that the right son to 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:42.329
 do not drop my movie but one that stays 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.969
 I made a certain god 29 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.670
 in these parks or do I'll get 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.270
 this situation since I'm going to work 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 I'm going to pitch with that one from the tie here 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:00.420
 now give me a little twist and tie myself 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.229
 I'll come back and tie it again and tie 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.869
 last 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.940
 I found the four fingers crossing them is 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:14.690
 using my wire I'm going to do now 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:19.810
 let me pull it a little cold here I go 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.180
 I'll give them two laps in my hand. 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.410
 All right, every two turns I go. 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.930
 do it now 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.180
 this one was the side that for my 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.819
 Right son, I 'll get that one. 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.300
 First I'll tell you what I did and I'll 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.959
 pass by boat over those two 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.840
 and come here on the other side 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.519
 now about these two as much as I can 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.250
 make with that money 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.290
 This will not make any difference, I did. 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.769
 I took all my points 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.250
 I got two in each house in his will 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.940
 and passes again but two laps in the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.569
 my wire is right and I'm doing it here 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:09.239
 My son finished then and 60 first 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.239
 step and do it on the other side 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:21.970
 I did it here and like I said it does 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.489
 if I do this or another first self 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.980
 I'm going to do this until the end of my 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:35.950
 line right then I make two laps 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.750
 here comes the first step this comes from 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:44.079
 other side 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:46.060
 I now do both this and also love 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.549
 that on the other side is coming out my 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.709
 Work, let's go then. 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:58.000
 get two laps as I finished my 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:03.310
 son here these two first boy 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:09.790
 here this one I do it and whatever 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:17.530
 two certain I'm joining the team he 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:23.110
 do not leave mine and I'm going to 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:26.080
 the end of my ball doing it my 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:31.400
 Work, he's going out here, see. 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:36.009
 he will leave nor after that he pulls 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.009
 when it's going to give it some braiding 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.640
 Good folks then only to do soap opera. 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.910
 whole I did with the 40 grams model 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.170
 sure you will see pulling for us 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.790
 the size that will stay because it goes 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.860
 You 'll do it, then you have to pull it. 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.750
 To see the size of him, right? 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.570
 remembering what you're doing with a 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.160
 model 100 grams nÃ© move 100 grams 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.910
 it will get big 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.070
 so look at this size he got 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.660
 with a ball of 40 grams 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.690
 So you 're like he's got great 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.030
 Remember farm and pulling you to see 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.620

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:26.010
 Good now here at the end, right? 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:32.260
 let's once again remember 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:37.210
 two rounds shooting here first shooting here 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.370
 and everything here is good 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:44.650
 and to cast off effectively as I go 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:46.870
 I'm going to start your shooting profile from here. 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.030
 of his, it passes to him 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:57.370
 tel those right low 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:06:02.400
 I'll get this thread , I'll take it and get it. 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:07.620
 Go there, I got two tires. It's a 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.620
 and I'm going to pass over here on top of the other 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.220
 take my son's little bit here and 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.380
 Come here because it gives me the 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.890
 finish does not stay school 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:24.670

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:31.030

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:34.120
 he then with a tapestry needle 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:38.460
 You're going to hide this little thread there. 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.460
 inside my scarf, right? 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:51.640
