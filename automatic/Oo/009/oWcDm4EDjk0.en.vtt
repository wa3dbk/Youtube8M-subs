 while pointing sucks crying saliva me 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.640
 battled for an unexpected memory 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.810
 not between my eyelids in the vision of 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.479
 something that I'm tired of seeing 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.149
 what is the sunrise if not a sky that is 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.700
 has crashed for 'without brakes' as of 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.100
 impatience for your breasts often 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.560
 we miss by inertia simply 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.409
 to convince us that something was better 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.899
 that the present medicine of the future that 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.060
 he lies denying that he is sick in a 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.729
 space time blurred because the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.929
 eternity was nothing are siamese stress 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.869
 even those who live from the story 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.240
 spiritual the drugs you can take it 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.569
 in equal this dimension is left 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.959
 disguise minutes or murder your flows 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.759
 much better than the lsd with this drawing 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.580
 the way back to the place before 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.979
 to be born I remember that there was no pain 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.069
 heavy that demand you with arrogance 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.170
 when dozens of subjects has been given by the 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.810
 day you put me a fucking dish in the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.480
 same table you can have a minimal complaint 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.190
 my aura moves away but the body is still in 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.650
 this hell that sometimes infects 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.150
 madness seems half fun and I was 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.370
 my dress if even the bones are 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.250
 They undress a homeless shout verses 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.930
 of the apocalypse of the bible 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.270
 while I think about the exploiter pattern 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.420
 who have hung the land in India already 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.860
 has quite how life is going to be based 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.560
 speculating about alien invasions 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.290
 and gods that punish could I explore 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.210
 to the last corner of my mind but 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.640
 it will be much better for my enemies than 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.070
 nor try it better for me and there is something 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.750
 terrifying at the bottom of every human and 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.870
 not to have a bad time like that 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.750
 experienced the mystery is too much 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.600
 colossal as to assume it think this 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.850
 I followed and you will end up deranged as 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.730
 riot without danger ask for 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.090

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.040
 I'm working an orange breakfast 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.500
 mechanical 'welcome 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.810
 the government also experiment with you 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.209
 in this bacon sandwich with cheese 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.450
 I would put barbiturates but I'm happy 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.370
 going from your pharmaceutical business to 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.800
 not bite my tongue to the master the wounds 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.320
 of the planet the uv go daily against 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.330
 our attentive victims I sometimes think 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.760
 go to the trial of the national audience 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.230
 with a mickey mouse bed devouring 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.989
 with passion a bigmac 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.599
 screaming capitalism is not so bad 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.269
 same gives you a mirage if you try 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.549
 in being silly and you know how to suck even you 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.860
 lets throw a ballot every four years 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.799
 to give them license to steal you so much 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.370
 that you can never tell I never met 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:48.310
 nobody sadder than the air storing 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.010
 millennia of dramas drown with my ash 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.989
 some duke when this changes and johann 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.610
 in the sky where the stars are 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.890
 turn off 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.710
 I assume that I will not be able to leave this state 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.200
 of shock like the first Indian wanted 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.910
 get to the Spanish colonizer I've seen 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.740
 I did not want to forget who they are beyond 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.570
 of god talking about phenomena 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.450

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.060

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.120
 walking , the landscape was better appreciated and 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.590
 you learn from the falls you have 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.660
 zombie passengers greet me from the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.180
 windows with mocking smile happy trip 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.830
 between insipid and boring conversations 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.290

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.790

 grapo cattle in a raft full of 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.470
 Thick shit in the background there is a treasure 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.470
 but to see that the devil below
