00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
grow see it there's bounce there even

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.859 
grow see it there's bounce there even
with<00:01:40.280> what<00:01:40.579> you<00:01:40.700> call<00:01:40.939> is<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.149> foreshortening

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
with what you call is a foreshortening

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.450 
with what you call is a foreshortening
of<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.140> angle<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:42.500> can<00:01:42.679> see<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.950> little<00:01:43.250> bit<00:01:43.369> of

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
of the angle you can see a little bit of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.359 
of the angle you can see a little bit of
grass<00:01:43.719> kicking<00:01:44.719> up<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.829> my<00:01:45.979> mind<00:01:46.159> that

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
grass kicking up and to my mind that

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.459 
grass kicking up and to my mind that
ball<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.820> definitely<00:01:47.030> bounced<00:01:47.780> into<00:01:47.929> Mahendra

forward guys might not necessarily be on
the<00:01:55.520> ball<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.619> he<00:01:57.619> wouldn't<00:01:57.890> necessarily<00:01:58.520> know

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880
