a bit of trial and error figuring out

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.689 
a bit of trial and error figuring out
the<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.119> mapping<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.340> of<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> game

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the the mapping to the of the game

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.439 
the the mapping to the of the game
controls<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> Xbox<00:00:22.350> 360<00:00:22.980> controller<00:00:23.449> but

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
controls to the Xbox 360 controller but

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.259 
controls to the Xbox 360 controller but
what<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> basically<00:00:25.439> did<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.250> under<00:00:26.910> options

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
what I basically did was I under options

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.800 
what I basically did was I under options
I<00:00:27.449> picked<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> Xperia<00:00:28.500> Play<00:00:29.000> option<00:00:30.000> I've

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
I picked the Xperia Play option I've

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.749 
I picked the Xperia Play option I've
taken<00:00:31.050> off<00:00:31.260> auto<00:00:31.500> gases<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.579> put

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
taken off auto gases up to you can put

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.690 
taken off auto gases up to you can put
it<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.329> want<00:00:33.480> or<00:00:33.600> take<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> off<00:00:34.700> and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
it on if you want or take it off and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.049 
it on if you want or take it off and
then<00:00:36.390> I've<00:00:36.540> mapped<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:38.840> accelerator<00:00:39.840> brake

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
then I've mapped the accelerator brake

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.670 
then I've mapped the accelerator brake
to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.090> left<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.079> trigger<00:00:43.290> buttons

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
to the left and right trigger buttons

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.970 
to the left and right trigger buttons
and<00:00:45.710> steering<00:00:46.710> left<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> left

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
and steering left and right to the left

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.490 
and steering left and right to the left
thumbstick<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.520> also<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.539> I've<00:00:51.960> left<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
thumbstick and also this I've left the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.650 
thumbstick and also this I've left the
camp<00:00:53.460> sorry<00:00:54.090> camera<00:00:54.739> angle<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.629> reset<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
camp sorry camera angle and the reset to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
camp sorry camera angle and the reset to
track<00:00:58.050> buttons<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.800> well<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.850> we<00:00:59.969> start<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.420> up

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.109 

so<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> light<00:01:05.489> version<00:01:06.030> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so this is just the light version of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.120 
so this is just the light version of
pocket<00:01:06.659> rally<00:01:06.840> there's<00:01:07.110> also<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.439> paid<00:01:07.830> version

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
pocket rally there's also a paid version

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.800 
pocket rally there's also a paid version
as<00:01:08.460> well<00:01:13.280> using<00:01:14.280> their<00:01:14.580> triggers<00:01:15.390> which<00:01:15.570> seems

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
as well using their triggers which seems

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.630 
as well using their triggers which seems
to<00:01:15.960> work<00:01:16.080> quite<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:17.159> sure<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> fit

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
to work quite well right sure the fit

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.950 
to work quite well right sure the fit
side<00:01:17.909> alright<00:01:18.299> lift<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.780> if<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> break<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
side alright lift it if you break it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.450 
side alright lift it if you break it
made<00:01:21.960> quite<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.200> few<00:01:22.409> improvements<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:23.130> game

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
made quite a few improvements this game

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.609 
made quite a few improvements this game
that<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> little<00:01:24.150> bit<00:01:24.420> slow<00:01:25.170> understand

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
that was a little bit slow understand

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.710 
that was a little bit slow understand
move<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.009> speed<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> cars<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.329> very

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
move the speed of the cars is not very

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.359 
move the speed of the cars is not very
good<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.200> they've<00:01:31.350> sort<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> improved<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
good and they've sort of improved that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.719 
good and they've sort of improved that
apparently<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.299> seems<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:33.900> good<00:01:34.729> it's

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
apparently it seems pretty good it's

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.160 
apparently it seems pretty good it's
definitely<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> nice<00:01:36.270> game<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> play<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
definitely a nice game to play with the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.170 
definitely a nice game to play with the
joystick<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:41.270> I'll<00:01:42.270> pop<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> mapping<00:01:44.180> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
joystick so I'll pop the mapping that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.050 
joystick so I'll pop the mapping that
you<00:01:45.299> need<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> using<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> USB<00:01:47.430> BT

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you need to do on the using the USB BT

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.719 
you need to do on the using the USB BT
joystick<00:01:48.810> Center<00:01:49.259> app<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.799> down<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
joystick Center app and down on the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.319 
joystick Center app and down on the
description<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.680> copy<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.329> and
