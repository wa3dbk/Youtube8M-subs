00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.980
 Hello dear friends 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.560
 Nice to see you back again today 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.380
 I want to show you how to get one 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.349
 beautiful blood red sunset with 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.240
 can paint my technique 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.020
 you only need my basic colors 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.809
 and of course my brushes with those you 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.070
 conjure up the great effects quite simply 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.410
 could be my motive now 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.670
 her with Dietmann's painting technique easy 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.610
 By the way, if you can do more, you can do that 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.220
 then want to learn about my technique 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.970
 you will find detailed instructions 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:01:00.339
 my dvd landscapes in the light a lot 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.320
 fun first, I wear this 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.170
 shining lukas red in the upper 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.350
 half of the frame with my wide 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.450
 shallow brush on the red should be full 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.040
 come along and the white primer 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.150
 cover the frame well 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.770
 then I brush the bottom 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.960
 half of the wedge frame smit cadmium yellow 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.900
 red and yellow I merge in the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.080
 middle to a bright orange tone and 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.210
 I mix a little white one so 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.660
 the transition between the two colors 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.660
 merges 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.409
 now I stand with different 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.369
 blends of green and brown tones the 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.229
 Group of trees on the horizon with the narrow one 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.960
 flat brushes emerge differently 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.729
 Big tree groups as the silhouette of the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.729
 delimiting horizon from the sky 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.569
 with the lines cia i draw the trunks 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.310
 the trees that stand in the foreground 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.440
 the crowns of the trees piece like me with 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.640
 a mixture of color green and ocher 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.760
 on the branches of the stems of the brush becomes 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.780
 increased obliquely so the effect succeeds 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.580
 best with the lines especially since I the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.580
 branches of the trees again after 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.209
 then I stuff it with yellow and white 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.209
 the light side of the leaves 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.250
 so that the uferbÃ¶schung further forward 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.720
 I am getting more books in 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.909
 paint yellow with orange or with green 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.129
 I always pay attention to that too 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.180
 a light side with bright shades 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.489
 topped up 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.320
 only then can I get the necessary 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.570
 plasticity in my picture 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.740
 in the middle and left in my motifs 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.870
 arise further trees for the first time 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.660
 again with the line ornamental the stems and 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.270
 branches on it then I stop with 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:39.940
 a strong dark brown tone the 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:41.950
 shadow color of the treetops with the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.830
 ground color i stuff the leaves 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.680
 do not stand in the light 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.180
 then comes the bright light color 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.720
 now the light is reflected on the 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.210
 scroll 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.950
 It creates a beautiful shimmering 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.140
 light effect in the background piece for me 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.590
 still some treetops with bright and 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:07.320
 dark red that makes this area 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.320
 Lively and brings deeper into the picture 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.180
 the water surface of the lake in 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:28.290
 foreground of my picture reflects the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.600
 blood red sunset therefore 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.680
 I use the same red as here 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:39.090
 i mix in the middle of the sky 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.440
 yellow in the red primary colors thus arises 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.780
 the reflection of the sun 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.380
 which, however, are not accurate now 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.780
 it must be enough if the water surface 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.440
 with the same hues of the sky 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.440
 was painted 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.139
 the reflections of the trees on the 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.650
 Water is created by blending 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.380
 the dark brown ground color I interpret 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:10.050
 the tree you silva only and renounce 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:12.660
 on details then I pull the 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.169
 bright reflections with the broad 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.570
 flat brush over the primary color when 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.210
 Blend I prefer the flat brush 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.680
 across the surface 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.930
 This creates a blurry 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.819
 silhouette of the river bank now times 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.520
 I still the meadow and the bushes in the 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.860
 foreground of my picture that brings 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.330
 even more plasticity and depth in the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:42.539
 motive for the first time with the dark reason 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.910
 was the form of the wiesn on it 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:48.449
 come then with green the grass scrub 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.849
 and some bushes and the pieces like me 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:54.900
 with the fan brush on the gives 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:57.090
 beautiful grass and foliage effects the 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.370
 light reflections on the blades of grass 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.400
 I level with a bright mixture of 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:06.990
 tarnow green and white directly on the 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:10.190
 primary color the sun disappears behind 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.990
 the trees and is no longer visible 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.090
 a light wind sweeps over the c 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.360
 That is why the water surface is 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.639
 not completely smooth 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.940
 These gentle wave movements work 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.009
 I in the mirroring with a 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.130
 with titan white and my cat tongues 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:31.080
 brush, I prefer the zigzag course as 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.229
 streak from top to bottom 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.919
 This creates a glittering light effect 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.919
 on the water 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.330
 then jumps the necessary image depth 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:45.040
 the front of the background from the trend 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.780
 I'm almost done now but still 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.670
 not quite 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.580
 a few changes and details 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.560
 are painted after or supplemented first 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.430
 when I am satisfied I put that 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.430
 brush to the side 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.560
 I always advise you the picture after one 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.720
 to revise the day 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.540
 with a little distance you can see the mistakes 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.800
 very well and can one or the other 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.540
 improve detail and with acrylic paint and 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.110
 my brushes are all right anyway 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.990
 just if you know more about my technique 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:24.750
 you want to know the under 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:27.700
 www eckmann - times technik.de do 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.880
 There you will also find the template for 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.820
 this picture and now I wish you 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.420
 have fun imitating 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.420
 until next time
