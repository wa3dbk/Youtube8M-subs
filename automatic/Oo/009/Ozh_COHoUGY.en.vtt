00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.819
 and 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.830
 and well all guys come the psuv is 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.139
 a new mini guide a long time ago 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.089
 that we did not do one and I wanted a 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.009
 I could teach a little something that 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.050
 it does not happen that on rare occasions in this 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.230
 I play these new remakes that is the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.269
 island growing set here island 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.830
 growing is near the league pokemon 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.039
 so that of colossal city and street 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.679
 vitoria was colossal and just opposite 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.720
 is because it's nothing to see this is the 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.820
 growing leaves the actor and mind as 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.980
 all mirages and it's rare that 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.079
 appear but it appears so have 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.170
 patience and whoever is and guys 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.789
 is growing and so today I'm going to 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.730
 try to capture what is read to 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.100
 legendary pokemon come on if it landed ni 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.020
 the crescent we will take our goodbye 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.940
 and I gave my two pokemon that we already 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.070
 have accompanied on several occasions to 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.520
 capture the legendary that is me 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.340
 Austin and they know law and you will see me brought to 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.780
 my two pokemon island growing guys a 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.420
 deep calm envelops all the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.470
 environment you will see I have here to 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.750
 I have here my Austin and saber and 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.290
 let's try to capture to grow already if 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.479
 It makes clear to me I'm going to give it all guys 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.189
 here this island growing there is nothing to 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.450
 admire an object is worth what I catch 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.670
 so you can see what there is to show 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.659
 ok they would be in the growing ok for 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.690
 that you see that the first time 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.690
 landed here and we touched the hoop 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.320
 you want to put your hand in the hole yes 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.370
 guys would grow up for him or her 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.290
 rather 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.570
 to this one that went through the wall to person 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.460
 girl ahead of Austin step or psychic 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.460
 so we can avoid a little bit of 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 Austin, do not pass, it's okay, it's not girl, it's not 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.420
 you pass vale vale turn 1 data one 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.850
 little thing is worth it, it 's slowly 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.820
 I'm not, do not go here and treat them 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.260
 weakening it little by little it is already valid 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.410
 paralyzed I may not attack 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.690
 perfect has not attacked me so a 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.750
 psychic is worth to go down a little 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.440
 the ps is of the same type I do not think what 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.850
 weaken is worth great great can you 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.070
 hitting little by little gives me the same mist 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.950
 useful of what you want I lower you 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.380
 the hairs ps little by little guys we go 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.630
 there another psychic is good that you take 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.280
 a pokÃ©mon or that shares a good what 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.750
 better is that the beta is a false smack 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.730
 there would be no problem but that 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.900
 Austin came to me because normally I 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.340
 we put the gender that you are hunting 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.200
 psychic and they do not hurt me and in the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.030
 If your ghost is sinister 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.530
 got me to sabella according 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.170
 again psychic does not take anything away from me 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.940
 perfect life you do not get a critic that 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.010
 yes hostile me ok we go down a bit 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.290
 life we have almost half 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.700
 is beaked and enzymes easier to 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.040
 capture if an altered state goes up 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.049
 that's always good to paralyze or 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.970
 you take it or what you do to me but I 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.290
 I prefer paralysis or asleep because 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.400
 with the will-o'-the-wisp sometimes the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.040
 hand hot water with poisoning 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.209
 and you can weaken it according to me 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.980
 premonition this attack was going to 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.209
 hit two shifts here, nothing happens 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.530
 again the other psychic and I think that 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.299
 I started to throw him and pokemon 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.390
 find and then this psychic let me 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.859
 the tics your last psychic do not kill him 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.230
 perfect life red life red and 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.230
 paralyzed begins the show of the few 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.010
 guys there go my first because I go back 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.810

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.700
 an ultra low I do not have many left but 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.989
 I have valls, it's worth pokemon 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.209

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.609

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.639
