00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.790 

okay<00:01:04.369> now<00:01:05.269> for<00:01:05.540> an<00:01:05.630> explanation<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:06.500> what

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
okay now for an explanation of what

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.510 
okay now for an explanation of what
you've<00:01:06.950> just<00:01:06.979> seen<00:01:08.259> so<00:01:09.259> starting<00:01:09.950> off<00:01:10.070> here<00:01:10.130> I

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
you've just seen so starting off here I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.790 
you've just seen so starting off here I
guess<00:01:10.729> I'll<00:01:10.970> just<00:01:11.000> spawn<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.080> mobs<00:01:12.289> in<00:01:12.470> over

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
guess I'll just spawn the mobs in over

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.350 
guess I'll just spawn the mobs in over
here<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:15.500> we<00:01:15.619> have<00:01:15.649> Billy<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.700> test<00:01:16.910> of<00:01:17.030> good

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
here and we have Billy the test of good

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.889 
here and we have Billy the test of good
Billy<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.830> zombie<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:19.430> Billy<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.420> skeleton

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
Billy the zombie and Billy the skeleton

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.620 
Billy the zombie and Billy the skeleton
all<00:01:21.170> spawned<00:01:21.710> with<00:01:21.860> similar<00:01:22.430> commands<00:01:22.850> with

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
all spawned with similar commands with

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.900 
all spawned with similar commands with
just<00:01:23.930> custom<00:01:24.320> name<00:01:24.500> Billy<00:01:24.800> or<00:01:25.130> as<00:01:25.550> in<00:01:25.789> the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
just custom name Billy or as in the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.850 
just custom name Billy or as in the
example<00:01:26.000> over<00:01:26.509> there<00:01:26.800> bouncer<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:29.770> what<00:01:30.770> we

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
example over there bouncer and what we

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.950 
example over there bouncer and what we
have<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.490> just<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.240> splash<00:01:32.450> person<00:01:32.899> of

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
have is just a splash person of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.370 
have is just a splash person of
swiftness<00:01:33.320> or<00:01:33.649> ref<00:01:34.490> of<00:01:34.640> death<00:01:34.850> as<00:01:35.360> we<00:01:36.110> called

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
swiftness or ref of death as we called

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.520 
swiftness or ref of death as we called
it<00:01:36.560> oh<00:01:37.539> whoops<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.750> clock<00:01:38.960> isn't<00:01:39.229> working

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
it oh whoops the clock isn't working

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.050 
it oh whoops the clock isn't working
over<00:01:39.679> here

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
over here

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.300 
over here
okay<00:01:41.420> there<00:01:41.570> we<00:01:41.630> go<00:01:41.829> so<00:01:42.829> this<00:01:42.979> clock<00:01:43.280> is

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
okay there we go so this clock is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.480 
okay there we go so this clock is
testing<00:01:43.850> for<00:01:44.950> /<00:01:45.950> effect<00:01:46.369> at<00:01:46.670> e<00:01:47.439> 10<00:01:48.490> which

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
testing for / effect at e 10 which

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.370 
testing for / effect at e 10 which
essentially<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.240> testing<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.780> clear<00:01:51.079> the

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
essentially is testing to clear the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.620 
essentially is testing to clear the
swiftness<00:01:51.770> power<00:01:52.100> for<00:01:52.340> someone<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.299> since

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
swiftness power for someone and since

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.450 
swiftness power for someone and since
it's<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.899> te<00:01:54.079> they<00:01:54.380> can<00:01:54.560> work<00:01:54.680> on<00:01:54.860> any<00:01:55.039> mob<00:01:55.280> as

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
it's a te they can work on any mob as

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.310 
it's a te they can work on any mob as
well<00:01:55.990> then<00:01:56.990> what<00:01:57.409> happens<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:58.990> teleports<00:01:59.990> the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
well then what happens is teleports the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.279 
well then what happens is teleports the
zombie<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.130> villager<00:02:02.140> teleports<00:02:03.140> the

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
zombie to the villager teleports the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.770 
zombie to the villager teleports the
villager<00:02:03.890> 20<00:02:04.700> blocks<00:02:04.880> on<00:02:05.149> woods<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.659> then

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
villager 20 blocks on woods and then

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.669 
villager 20 blocks on woods and then
straight<00:02:06.110> away<00:02:06.229> after<00:02:06.979> that<00:02:07.340> kills<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.909> and

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
straight away after that kills it and

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.809 
straight away after that kills it and
then<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.800> does<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.039> same<00:02:10.099> things<00:02:10.489> at<00:02:10.700> the

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
then it does the same things at the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.150 
then it does the same things at the
skeleton<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.569> zombie<00:02:11.900> then<00:02:12.680> after<00:02:13.040> that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
skeleton to the zombie then after that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.600 
skeleton to the zombie then after that
it<00:02:13.819> kills<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.540> Skerton<00:02:15.049> this<00:02:15.890> example<00:02:16.310> which

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
it kills the Skerton this example which

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.580 
it kills the Skerton this example which
was<00:02:16.819> my<00:02:16.940> first<00:02:17.180> testing<00:02:17.569> area<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.200> slightly

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
was my first testing area is slightly

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.789 
was my first testing area is slightly
faster<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.610> also<00:02:20.120> one<00:02:20.750> source<00:02:20.989> recording<00:02:21.500> the

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
faster and also one source recording the

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.979 
faster and also one source recording the
effect<00:02:22.180> didn't<00:02:23.180> seem<00:02:23.360> quite<00:02:23.540> as<00:02:23.630> smooth

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
effect didn't seem quite as smooth

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.110 
effect didn't seem quite as smooth
probably<00:02:24.440> due<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.620> me<00:02:24.890> recording<00:02:25.400> although<00:02:26.030> on

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
probably due to me recording although on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.360 
probably due to me recording although on
a<00:02:26.150> side<00:02:26.420> note<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.080> just<00:02:27.799> started<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.220> see

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
a side note I have just started to see

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.970 
a side note I have just started to see
parts<00:02:28.819> for<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:29.120> computer<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.500> I'm<00:02:30.590> going<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.799> try

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
parts for a computer so I'm going to try

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.039 
parts for a computer so I'm going to try
and<00:02:31.010> demonstrate<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.970> scissors<00:02:32.900> better

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.940 

yep<00:02:39.370> much<00:02:40.370> faster<00:02:41.120> sped<00:02:41.599> up<00:02:41.720> version<00:02:41.950> that's

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
yep much faster sped up version that's

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.280 
yep much faster sped up version that's
essentially<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.810> it's<00:02:44.810> good<00:02:44.989> friend<00:02:45.200> i'm

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
essentially it it's good friend i'm

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.870 
essentially it it's good friend i'm
getting<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> new<00:02:45.709> computer<00:02:45.859> this<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.609> really

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
getting a new computer this is really

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.870 
getting a new computer this is really
slowing<00:02:47.180> down<00:02:47.329> quite<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.690> lot
