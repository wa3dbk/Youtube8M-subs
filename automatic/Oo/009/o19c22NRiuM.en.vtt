00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
how to bake your polymer clay creations

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.790 
how to bake your polymer clay creations
so<00:00:07.230> first<00:00:07.680> what<00:00:08.069> you'll<00:00:08.309> need<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:09.389> course

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
other brands i use theirs pmo sculpey

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.569 
other brands i use theirs pmo sculpey
and<00:00:34.610> crap<00:00:35.610> smart<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.930> i<00:00:37.290> also<00:00:37.469> use<00:00:37.829> emo<00:00:38.370> and

packages<00:00:41.850> right<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.399> primo<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.390> sculpey

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
packages right now so primo and sculpey

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.459 
packages right now so primo and sculpey
are<00:00:48.140> made<00:00:49.140> about<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.440> same<00:00:49.680> company<00:00:51.469> sculpey

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
are made about the same company sculpey

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.410 
are made about the same company sculpey
and<00:00:53.719> this<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.899> made<00:00:55.199> by<00:00:55.379> crashing<00:00:55.710> art<00:00:56.420> it's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and this is made by crashing art it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.470 
and this is made by crashing art it's
called<00:00:57.629> polymer<00:00:57.989> clay<00:00:58.910> so<00:01:00.020> um<00:01:01.910> customer<00:01:02.910> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
called polymer clay so um customer is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.010 
called polymer clay so um customer is
softer<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:05.030> sculpey<00:01:06.030> soft<00:01:06.330> too<00:01:06.540> they<00:01:06.900> have

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
softer and sculpey soft too they have

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.039 
softer and sculpey soft too they have
different<00:01:07.590> colors<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.040> sculpey<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.240> because

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
different colors for sculpey but because

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.340 
different colors for sculpey but because
it's<00:01:10.320> soft<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.130> not<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.610> durable<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.350> hard

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it's soft it's not as durable as hard

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.760 
it's soft it's not as durable as hard
clay<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:14.420> primo<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:18.049> here<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.259> some<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
clay like primo and so here are some of

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.840 
clay like primo and so here are some of
the<00:01:19.890> baking<00:01:20.340> times<00:01:21.110> wait<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> 130<00:01:26.689> Celsius<00:01:27.689> or

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
the baking times wait so 130 Celsius or

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.960 
the baking times wait so 130 Celsius or
275<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.780> height<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
275 there in height and that just that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.660 
275 there in height and that just that
goes<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> same<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> cross

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
goes the same for that in the cross

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
goes the same for that in the cross
smart

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.730 

275<00:01:45.070> Fahrenheit<00:01:45.670> or<00:01:45.880> 130<00:01:46.660> bags<00:01:49.170> suck<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:50.380> so

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
275 Fahrenheit or 130 bags suck this so

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.390 
275 Fahrenheit or 130 bags suck this so
they're<00:01:51.100> pretty<00:01:51.310> much<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.550> same<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:54.100> you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
they're pretty much the same and if you

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.040 
they're pretty much the same and if you
mix<00:01:54.730> the<00:01:55.000> colors<00:01:55.540> that's<00:01:56.020> okay<00:01:56.410> too<00:01:57.870> so<00:01:58.870> after

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
mix the colors that's okay too so after

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.980 
mix the colors that's okay too so after
you<00:01:59.340> make<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.610> polymer<00:02:01.120> clay<00:02:01.270> items<00:02:02.050> on<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
you make the polymer clay items on you

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.109 
you make the polymer clay items on you
put<00:02:05.410> them<00:02:05.800> in<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:07.710> toaster<00:02:08.710> oven<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.970> need

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
put them in a toaster oven and you need

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.860 
put them in a toaster oven and you need
a<00:02:10.149> toaster<00:02:10.420> oven<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:11.440> should<00:02:11.950> i<00:02:12.640> will<00:02:13.540> suggest

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a toaster oven it should i will suggest

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.260 
a toaster oven it should i will suggest
you<00:02:14.350> use<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.620> separate<00:02:15.190> oven<00:02:15.520> for<00:02:15.760> polymer<00:02:16.120> clay

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
you use a separate oven for polymer clay

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.820 
you use a separate oven for polymer clay
and<00:02:16.710> this<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.830> pretty<00:02:18.070> old<00:02:18.870> that's<00:02:19.870> why<00:02:20.080> use<00:02:20.680> it

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
and this is pretty old that's why use it

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.740 
and this is pretty old that's why use it
for<00:02:21.010> polymer<00:02:21.370> clay<00:02:21.490> because<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.360> got<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.570> new

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
for polymer clay because I got a new

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.240 
for polymer clay because I got a new
oven<00:02:22.959> for<00:02:23.500> another<00:02:23.700> um<00:02:24.700> yeah<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.750> cooking<00:02:26.320> so

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
oven for another um yeah for cooking so

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.170 
oven for another um yeah for cooking so
inside<00:02:27.990> what<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.020> do<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:30.459> take<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:32.070> child<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.370> put

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
inside what I do is I take a child I put

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.650 
inside what I do is I take a child I put
it<00:02:34.330> in<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:36.040> put<00:02:36.310> items<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.850> there<00:02:37.030> not

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
it in and I put items in there not

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.500 
it in and I put items in there not
showing<00:02:37.990> those<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.500> I<00:02:39.430> wait<00:02:39.640> until<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.090> get<00:02:40.330> a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
showing those and I wait until I get a

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.860 
showing those and I wait until I get a
full<00:02:41.080> tray<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.740> creations<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.820> then<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.630> bake

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
full tray of creations and then I bake

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.230 
full tray of creations and then I bake
it<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.770> course<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.280> leave<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:46.209> take

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
it and of course you leave you take

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.410 
it and of course you leave you take
these<00:02:46.660> off<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:47.110> top<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.890> oven<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:49.120> I'm

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
these off on top of the oven so I'm

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.960 
these off on top of the oven so I'm
pretty<00:02:49.810> sure<00:02:50.080> this<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.320> Fahrenheit<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.190> go<00:02:51.910> to

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
pretty sure this is Fahrenheit I go to

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.449 
pretty sure this is Fahrenheit I go to
275<00:02:52.750> right<00:02:53.200> there<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.940> usually<00:02:55.900> do<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.800> lower

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
275 right there and I usually do a lower

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.280 
275 right there and I usually do a lower
temperature<00:02:58.060> than<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.720> in<00:02:58.870> case<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.200> a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
temperature than that just in case of a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.910 
temperature than that just in case of a
burns<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.120> that's<00:03:01.120> about<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:01.590> hope<00:03:02.590> this

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
burns and that's about it hope this

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.950 
burns and that's about it hope this
helped<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.440> thanks<00:03:05.440> for<00:03:05.590> watching
