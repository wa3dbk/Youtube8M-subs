use<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.860> verismo<00:01:35.159> pods<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:36.240> there's<00:01:36.420> two

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
use of my verismo pods now there's two

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
use of my verismo pods now there's two
different<00:01:36.810> types<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.290> verissimo<00:01:37.650> pods<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
different types of verissimo pods and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.940 
different types of verissimo pods and
they<00:01:38.280> come<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.240> flip<00:01:39.570> top<00:01:39.900> kit<00:01:40.350> which<00:01:40.829> you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
they come in this flip top kit which you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
they come in this flip top kit which you
can<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.250> there's<00:01:41.520> eight<00:01:41.729> milk<00:01:42.000> pods<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
can get there's eight milk pods and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.600 
can get there's eight milk pods and
eight<00:01:43.110> espresso<00:01:43.649> pods<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.460> in

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
eight espresso pods you can get this in

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.210 
eight espresso pods you can get this in
regular<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.180> decaf<00:01:45.890> depending<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> type

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
regular and decaf depending on the type

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.200 
regular and decaf depending on the type
of<00:01:47.250> drink<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.759> would<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.180> course

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
of drink that you would like of course

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.880 
of drink that you would like of course
you're<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.229> I'll<00:01:49.320> discern<00:01:49.680> which

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
you're going to be I'll discern which

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.050 
you're going to be I'll discern which
one<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.130> these<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.369> which<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:50.850> easily

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
one of these is which very easily

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.910 
one of these is which very easily
because<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.509> milk<00:01:51.720> pod<00:01:51.930> obviously<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.680> white

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
because the milk pod obviously is white

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.060 
because the milk pod obviously is white
and<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> espresso<00:01:53.909> pod<00:01:54.149> has<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:55.049> brown<00:01:55.590> color

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
and the espresso pod has a brown color

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.310 
and the espresso pod has a brown color
on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> outside<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> espresso

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
on the outside of it now the espresso

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.800 
on the outside of it now the espresso
pods<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.950> not<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.790> foil<00:02:00.090> lining<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
pods do not have the foil lining on the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.840 
pods do not have the foil lining on the
bottom<00:02:01.110> which<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.770> will<00:02:01.920> find<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> brewed

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
bottom which you will find on the brewed

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.270 
bottom which you will find on the brewed
coffee<00:02:03.180> pods<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> verismo<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.860> espresso

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
coffee pods for the verismo the espresso

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.679 
coffee pods for the verismo the espresso
pods<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.909> very<00:02:06.060> simply<00:02:06.210> are<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
pods you just very simply are going to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.449 
pods you just very simply are going to
pop<00:02:06.840> these<00:02:07.020> into<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> machine<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:07.979> we're

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
pop these into the machine but we're

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.279 
pop these into the machine but we're
going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.640> start<00:02:08.910> off<00:02:09.030> by<00:02:09.270> making<00:02:09.599> our<00:02:09.959> milk

milk brewing process

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.140 
milk brewing process
now<00:02:33.840> there's<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.470> 19<00:02:35.069> bar<00:02:35.370> pressure<00:02:35.760> pump

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
now there's a 19 bar pressure pump

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.030 
now there's a 19 bar pressure pump
inside<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.050> verismo<00:02:37.319> so<00:02:37.709> that<00:02:37.890> is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
inside of the verismo so that is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.059 
inside of the verismo so that is
actually<00:02:38.220> above<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.060> standard<00:02:39.629> of<00:02:39.840> what<00:02:40.830> is

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
actually above the standard of what is

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.220 
actually above the standard of what is
always<00:02:41.640> consider<00:02:42.000> these<00:02:42.269> standard<00:02:42.840> for

making any kind of espresso using an
espresso<00:02:45.750> machine<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.349> that's<00:02:46.530> good<00:02:46.890> because

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
espresso machine so that's good because

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.160 
espresso machine so that's good because
you're<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.940> be<00:02:48.030> able<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.780> foam

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
you're going to be able to get that foam

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.320 
you're going to be able to get that foam
that<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.590> expect<00:02:50.010> from<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.340> cafe<00:02:50.519> latte<00:02:51.120> and

that you expect from a cafe latte and
you're<00:02:51.660> also<00:02:51.810> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.170> get<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.440> correct

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
you're also going to get the correct

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.440 
you're also going to get the correct
amount<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:53.069> pressure<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.580> make<00:02:53.730> sure<00:02:53.970> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
amount of pressure to make sure that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.910 
amount of pressure to make sure that
this<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.810> all<00:02:55.049> going<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.440> go<00:02:55.560> from<00:02:55.799> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
this is all going to go from the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920 
this is all going to go from the
powdered<00:02:56.340> form<00:02:56.700> which<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.180> milk<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.540> inside

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
powdered form which the milk is inside

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.070 
powdered form which the milk is inside
of<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.170> pod<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:59.099> actual<00:02:59.910> milk<00:03:00.299> inside<00:03:00.840> of

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
of that pod to actual milk inside of

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.979 
of that pod to actual milk inside of
your<00:03:01.230> cup<00:03:01.879> when<00:03:02.879> it's<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.209> done<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.720> Machine

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
your cup when it's all done the Machine

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.420 
your cup when it's all done the Machine
finishes<00:03:04.410> very<00:03:04.590> quickly<00:03:04.860> which<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.250> great
