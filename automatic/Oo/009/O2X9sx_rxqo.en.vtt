 visit it during a single day 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.359
 we devote three and a half days and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.560
 we did not have time to see everything though 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.560
 we repeat several attractions 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.920
 book your stay in advance 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.599

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.840
 will allow you to reduce your spending 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.940

 five we went out for the 100 euros eat 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.860
 in one of the restaurants with buffet 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.350
 another data a sandwich cost seven 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.660
 euros so we advise you that lame 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.330
 hotel and half board or full board 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.220
 If you do not go with a packaged trip 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.230
 you can buy tickets at the entrance 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.360
 from the same park is very good 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.280
 communicated with the airport when 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.699
 you will see that thousands of 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.530
 people it is estimated that about 43 thousand is 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.780
 the average daily visits that they have 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.420
 disney so you will not feel alone in 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.460

 Restaurant reservation the day before or 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.650
 very early in the morning 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.750
 you will avoid many queues but you will have to 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.820
 choose between eating at eleven thirty or 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.159
 the half past four p.m. or not you 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.220
 on the site and in the park it is difficult 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.619
 find some alternative that's why you 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.780
 we advise that you take picoteo not so much 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 for large meals but to take 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.100
 a snack during the many hours 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.289
 that you will be there are recommendable 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.560
 potatoes nuts and cookies 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.390
 Chocolates smoothies juices and water inside 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.149
 of the park there are fountains to fill 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.220
 bottles although at the entrance they are reviewed 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.940
 the backpacks do not put a problem if they see 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.120
 this type of food and drinks 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.950
 hotels we advise you to stay in 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.230
 one of the hotels in the park 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.030
 have two important advantages the 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.070
 first is that you can visit the park 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.230
 two hours before I open it to the rest 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.910
 of the public the second one is that 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.700
 buses are continually passing by 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.320
 they communicate the hotels in the park 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.020
 completing this tour in less than 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.660
 five minutes for those who have more 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.330
 of two children notify him and they will give you two 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.150
 communicated rooms almost everything is 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.680
 designed for families of two children 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.720
 When you arrive at the hotel they keep 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.150
 suitcases in consignment until they give you the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.540
 room so you better have prepared 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.400
 aside the clothes that you will use the first day 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.920
 As for the type of hotels, there are 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.320
 Various prices we stayed in 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.750
 the holy faith and we left happy 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.700
 is newly reformed as we are five 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.530
 they allowed us to stay in two 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.100
 rooms connected by a door 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.770
 that if he sins austere in soaps and 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.900
 does not have a fridge for breakfast that is 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.060
 in the same hotel santa fe there is a buffet 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.380
 basic is usually queued too but 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.170
 not too big 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.180
 peace will be your best friend in disney in 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.880
 many attractions there is this label 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.890
 fast when you take it out, it points to the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.500
 time you can enter doing very 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.630
 little tail for example if you want to see 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.270
 peter pan's about all things he catches 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.560
 the fast path as soon as possible 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.300
 surely you will not be able to enter until hours 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.730
 later so take advantage of that time 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.300
 to see other places when your 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.250
 hour 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.040
 approach peter pank and place you in the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.830
 fastback tail you'll see that soon you enter 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.290
 to discover the world of never again that 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.319
 yes you can not get more aesthetic and fast 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.439
 until you spend in that you already have removed 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.719
 fantasy and study about the two parks 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.060
 who can visit me personally 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:42.370
 I stay with fantasy in the whole is of 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.849
 true the dragon castle of the ship 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.579
 pirate 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.170
 our coach and feel the studies 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.489
 They are also very good and have 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.379
 attractions chuli simas but 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.989
 personally I did not find magic with 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.639
 fantasy the first and last hour is 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.980
 when fewer people are there to ride 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.900
 whenever you can avoid the ends of 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.940
 week because of the avalanche of people 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.670
 come 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.520
 staff there are a lot of people from 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.620
 Disney that are divided with visitors 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.390
 everything is made to make you happy almost 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.220
 everyone who works knows several 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.920
 languages ​​and in Spanish they understand it almost 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.080
 everybody that they are very rigid with 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.670
 the rules they put if they tell you not to 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.860
 you are always reached to see the 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.240
 ride without music and will be pending 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.240
 that you do not put any foot in the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.550
 pregnant women with disabilities 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.080
 they have priority over the rest 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.580
 raincoats in Paris almost always 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.550
 It rains and although at good temperature 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.300
 usually water fall we got lucky 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.400
 and the sun accompanied us every day 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.290
 stores there is a lot of stores 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.880
 all the park their prices are not 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.740
 cheap but even if you do not buy anything 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.050
 come to see them because some are a 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.060
 I'm staying with the one who is 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.700
 under the castle that reproduces the house 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.070
 of snow white granites walk 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.230

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.280
 chance to visit the western town 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.500
 located in the hotel selling for example 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.140
 it's close and they say it's very 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.330
 recommended that exclusion to finish 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.510
 two commandments above all things 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.919
 in disney there is fantasy and in disney 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.919
