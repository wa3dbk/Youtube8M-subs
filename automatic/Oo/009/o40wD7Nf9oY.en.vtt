00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.520
 Spiders have some great abilities, 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.610
 But let's take a scientific look at how realistic this superhero is. 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.750
 In order to modify the spider's gene, the spider that bites him must release a reverse-filtering virus in his body. 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.900
 The reversal of the viral virus carries genetic information that is embedded in the DNA in the cell. 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.740
 The cells then read the new DNA to produce special functions and proteins. 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.730
 However, this reversal of the viral virus is almost spread to every cell. 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.510
 It also has the ability to encode new, different functions in each cell. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.110
 So although theoretically possible, it is still very "magical." 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.300
 Spider silk is actually stronger and more elastic than steel in proportion. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.050
 The spider web, which is 1/10 the size of the hair, can catch insects that fly upwards at a speed of 15 miles (24 kilometers). 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.590
 And, believe it or not, if the spider web has a mile (2.54 cm) diameter (wire), it can actually block a jet fighter. 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.746
 Strength, some spiders can lift 50 times their own weight, and this muscle strength is directly related to size. 

00:00:56.746 --> 00:01:01.390
 Think about your biceps, when you exercise, it will increase the height and width, not the length. 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.240
 In this way, the power of the creature grows on a quadratic or two-dimensional scale. 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.835
 But when the creatures get bigger, their volume is in height, width and length, 

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.131
 Increase in cubic or three-dimensional space scale. 

00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:18.823
 This creates a 2:3 ratio, meaning that the larger the creature, the smaller the relative power. 

00:01:18.838 --> 00:01:21.123
 But because of the shape and size of the spider man, 

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:25.982
 This reversal of viral viruses must be coded to create more muscle and myosin. 

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:31.112
 These proteins achieve muscle contraction and are effective in strengthening the body. 

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:33.534
 Climbing the wall? For spiders, itâ€™s a stack of small dishes. 

00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:35.182
 They have fine hair on each foot. 

00:01:35.182 --> 00:01:38.759
 And there are countless, finer hairs with triangular ends on these hairs. 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.921
 They interact with atoms within a few nanometers of the surface of the object. 

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:48.057
 This creates an electrostatic force that sticks to 170 times its own weight. 

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:52.177
 In order to acquire this ability, Spider-Man needs a permanent "hairy". 

00:01:52.177 --> 00:01:55.027
 This may not give him a lot of goodwill for the girl waiting for the rescue. 

00:01:55.027 --> 00:01:57.148
 And finally, what about "Spider Premonition"? 

00:01:57.148 --> 00:02:01.418
 Well, spider hair is extremely sensitive to changes in vibration and air pressure. 

00:02:01.418 --> 00:02:06.060
 But this means that spiders should only be able to perceive things around them, not distant events. 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.203
