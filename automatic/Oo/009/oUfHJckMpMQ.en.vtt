00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.859
 share with you the opening of 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.190
 of the replacement iPhone that has me 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.780
 sent apple of with acting because 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.710

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.720
 damn you who don't follow me then 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.000
 I did not send the iPhone for assistance 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 because the below you can see in the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 macbook air boxing 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.210
 a kind of dot that you see more or 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.949
 less here than thanks because of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.230
 stabilization moves it seems that yes 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.540
 move instead want fixed is something that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.329
 stood under the camera I contacted 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530
 the no contacted only by on the site 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.780
 of apple service 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.149
 I have inserted I move here for a moment 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.039
 entered the phone's serial number 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.200
 and the next day they were the next morning 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.239
 6 am and 7 pm the next morning is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.440
 came ps to pick up the phone I do not 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.090
 I didn't even have the mall there 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.250
 given the phone he already had the packaging 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 put it in and took it on 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.449
 day later arrived in the morning at 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.049
 apple the same evening it was it was 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.580
 sent a phone three days three 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.020
 days to have the new iPhone I don't 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.740
 I moved home did not spend one 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.170
 lira 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.570
 this is the real additional service of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.340
 apple 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.640
 now I open the package with you because 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.890
 my fear my terror is to find 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.990
 then scratched an iphone and am about to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.930
 see with you right now I don't 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.700
 I have recently closed if actually the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.009
 shape and scratched or not then 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.550
 oaths swear live today relief 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.830
 live 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:42.380
 now I open it a little, because there 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:45.890
 they are military on the sturdy as we have 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.870
 the package that came from inside is the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.270
 serial number written on one side then 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.070
 I won't show it to you 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.350
 let's take a high instrument 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.180
 very high precision precision ed 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.700
 we open the box which is obviously 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.260
 sealed by opening the box we find 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.510
 inside another little box that is the 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:14.360
 classic did not see the serial too 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:15.890
 here we have to cut a piece then 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.640
 always with the precision instrument 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.950
 we also cut the part very precisely 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.400
 well glued is massacring the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.250
 box that I held in my hand 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.670
 all very well this is the beauty of 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.320
 live 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.110
 you know that I make videos every 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.180
 video on poetry so as not me 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.610
 even goes to mount it and now I tell you 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.920
 what am i doing i am unstuck 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.050
 the label from the hands once 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.940
 cut on one side maybe it's better than 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.570
 he took a knife from knife always 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:58.580
 precision cut once by 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:03.170
 we open the mace box and the ones with 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.510
 the hallucinatory ato and here will look for facts 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.810
 open the package as you say it is 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.380
 making a video on the table and here it is 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.030
 the replacement replacement iPhone that does not 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.360
 it's new as we all know it never has 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.220
 regenerated what it means regenerated that 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.500
 it's an iphone and someone sent it and 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.239
 has been refurbished dallas leaving 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.790
 from the body until you reach the 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.440
 internal components 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.330
 someone told me but it's not new not 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.450
 it is new it is regenerated for me it is better 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.340
 because the regenerated according to me I repeat 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.750
 I think it has more controls than the new one 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.360
 because the new leaves the factory e 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.130
 regenerated must bear a let's say a 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:50.750
 process according to me of what he says 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:52.740
 however different it is it is all a glue 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.980
 we have the phone we go to 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.590
 analyze it then calculating that me 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.280
 when i bought that new one was 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:07.350
 already half scratched let's see if this 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.110
 here the corners are perfect or not 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.820
 there is no problem 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.830
 we see the back let's forget the 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:20.280
 dress here too I don't know if 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.030
 focus there should be if there 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.860
 here too we have no problems whatsoever 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.110
 there are no scratches and he gave it up 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.960
 then here there are two dots but I don't know 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.680
 if it's a question of dust dust 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.330
 that which is 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.890
 meanwhile we light it up to see it higher 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.140
 if there are not even burnt pixels 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:46.170
 also this side has no problems me 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.990
 seems to have done is definitely sorry 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.050
 but I'm still sick, let's go second 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.810
 vent helps us is definitely better than 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.120
 what I bought in the center 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.400
 vodafone e 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.020
 has many fewer defects I want to give a 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.040
 catch a clean up here to see if 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.080
 remove these white and 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.290
 see if they are small scratches or if 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.600
 actually it was dirty no it was dirty 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.280
 so perfect it can be said that a 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.650
 a few months later I finally have 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.560
 a perfect iphone 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.560
 we see the pixels there are no problems 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.210
 perfect guys finally at iphone 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:33.060
 which can be defined as perfect even if 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:36.240
 excuse me even though we know very well 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.250
 which will last very little because it is indeed 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.840
 I will put myself immediately to the best indeed no 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.389
 immediately the cover immediately why not 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.560
 I have to insert the SIM but it will be immediately 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.160
 protected by the move it 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.260
 because this is a constant that I have 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.830
 reviewed so go to see in 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.180
 video if you want to understand which case and 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.729
 nothing we know very well that already alone 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.639
 looking at it framing the gamma rays 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.820
 of the camera are already digging and 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.810
 by ruffian do the cover let's say del 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.560
 iPhone and why you want the material 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.560
 makes shit hi
