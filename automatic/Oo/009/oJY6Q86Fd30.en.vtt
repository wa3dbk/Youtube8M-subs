00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
the other in yasha movies I would say

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.670 
the other in yasha movies I would say
that<00:03:35.090> this<00:03:35.209> one<00:03:35.480> runs<00:03:35.810> about<00:03:36.170> as<00:03:36.319> good<00:03:36.500> as

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
that this one runs about as good as

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.069 
that this one runs about as good as
number<00:03:37.040> three<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:38.329> first<00:03:38.569> two<00:03:38.780> movies

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
number three the first two movies

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.959 
number three the first two movies
certainly<00:03:39.590> lacked<00:03:39.859> especially<00:03:40.730> when<00:03:40.849> it

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:40.969 
certainly lacked especially when it

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.910 
certainly lacked especially when it
comes<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.540> final<00:03:41.930> fights<00:03:42.200> with<00:03:42.439> the<00:03:42.560> villains

and<00:03:43.670> though<00:03:43.909> the<00:03:44.180> villains<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.629> this<00:03:44.780> movie

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
and though the villains in this movie

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.800 
and though the villains in this movie
weren't<00:03:45.409> exactly<00:03:46.010> right<00:03:46.249> themselves<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.180> must

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
weren't exactly right themselves I must

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.110 
weren't exactly right themselves I must
say<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.409> fight<00:03:48.590> sequences<00:03:48.829> were<00:03:49.790> better

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
say that the fight sequences were better

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.479 
say that the fight sequences were better
carried<00:03:50.689> out<00:03:50.840> than<00:03:51.079> the<00:03:51.170> first<00:03:51.379> two<00:03:51.650> films<00:03:51.890> and

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
carried out than the first two films and

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.580 
carried out than the first two films and
what<00:03:53.030> I<00:03:53.060> especially<00:03:53.390> liked<00:03:53.810> about<00:03:53.959> this<00:03:54.230> movie

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
what I especially liked about this movie

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.410 
what I especially liked about this movie
was<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:54.950> there<00:03:55.099> was<00:03:55.249> lots<00:03:55.609> of<00:03:55.760> fighting<00:03:56.180> all

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
was that there was lots of fighting all
