00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.940
 chain 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.290
 Yes in it 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.580
 Taito's staling system 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.230
 of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.740
 Introduce the structure 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.740
 this is 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:30.080
 What a dream cast 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:33.100
 The handle box is itself 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.100
 I processed it a little 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.960
 Nakao 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.960
 Yup 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.950
 Thank you to the mast 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.960
 Yup 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.960
 Say this 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.810
 Something like thread loss 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.140
 Create 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:00.900
 Nakano steering wheel hurdles 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:06.750
 I am in contact with the point of concern 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:12.590
 This is using the bolt if it is kept by Poku 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.140
 I've opened this department stupid there in the 5th revision 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.220
 And 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.900
 It is shaped like a Japanese coffee belly 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.190
 What is it like 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.190
 This is serious 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.310
 so 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.310
 Though it is part of here 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.720
 It comes with a heart here 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.280
 This is 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.590
 The screen door 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.820
 It 's about time you fell, and it's from the 60 yen that is the part oo home center data of those days &amp; 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.820
 I think it was around 80 yen 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.940
 in addition 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.940
 Here 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.100
 Bolted 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.100
 The middle of these days 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.610
 I'm there even if the place of the body 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.730
 Is adopted 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.170
 It is also here. 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.170
 It is to say 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.100
 this is 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.069
 I tried to add this because it was heavier than before 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.430
 It looks like a stick today 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.760
 Where 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.819
 Demonstrate 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.319
 This is free to move 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.739
 It is said that it was like Horyu 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.739
 It is 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.900
 It looks like this 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.430
 This is a game console 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.750
 Dream cast's 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.630
 The box is the handle that did its end 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.210
 Then Yu' 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.550
 I have another one 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.849
 It is part that came out 9 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.510
 In fact, next to 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.890
 To receive and 2 Cor 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.840
 It's just one more way out of Burger Harbor 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:38.590
 Add this to this bar too 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.590
 It means that the sun is also flowing toward the Latter behind
