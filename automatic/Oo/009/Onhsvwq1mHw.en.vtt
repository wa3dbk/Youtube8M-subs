make the nether reactor a cow just brick
and<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.199> break<00:00:24.710> now<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> make<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> nether

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and a break now to make the nether

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.400 
and a break now to make the nether
reactor<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:27.810> we're<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.170> start

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
reactor is what we're going to start
