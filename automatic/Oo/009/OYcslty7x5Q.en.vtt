gaps<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.900> you<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.860> lower<00:00:47.040> grade

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
gaps like you do with the lower grade

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.070 
gaps like you do with the lower grade
plywood<00:00:47.820> that's<00:00:48.240> why<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> wanted<00:00:48.720> to<00:00:48.810> go<00:00:48.930> with

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
plywood that's why I wanted to go with

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.990 
plywood that's why I wanted to go with
cabinet<00:00:49.500> green<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.460> what<00:00:50.580> I'm<00:00:50.640> gonna<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.880> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
cabinet green so what I'm gonna do is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
cabinet green so what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:00:51.120> gonna<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.300> ahead<00:00:51.330> and<00:00:51.510> check<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.110> up

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.370

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
and I would say don't overly tighten it

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.930 
and I would say don't overly tighten it
just<00:01:08.590> tighten<00:01:08.980> it<00:01:09.040> snug<00:01:09.400> where<00:01:09.700> it's<00:01:09.790> not

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
going to move because if you put too

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.980 
going to move because if you put too
much<00:01:11.830> pressure<00:01:12.100> on<00:01:12.310> it<00:01:12.520> you'll<00:01:12.729> you'll<00:01:13.630> break

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
much pressure on it you'll you'll break

I'm<00:04:09.810> gonna<00:04:10.050> go<00:04:10.170> ahead<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.350> flip<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.650> over<00:04:10.860> now

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:05:40.820 

even<00:04:16.230> up<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> other<00:04:16.620> side

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.710 

toughest<00:05:41.830> trig<00:05:42.070> now<00:05:42.250> is<00:05:42.550> trying<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.450> get<00:05:43.600> them

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
toughest trig now is trying to get them

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.140 
toughest trig now is trying to get them
get<00:05:44.620> each<00:05:44.740> side<00:05:44.980> and<00:05:45.250> get<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.460> symmetrical<00:05:46.120> you

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
get each side and get it symmetrical you

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.810 
get each side and get it symmetrical you
don't<00:05:46.450> have<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.380> can<00:05:47.560> have<00:05:47.770> a<00:05:47.820> little

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
don't have to you can have a little

00:05:48.820 --> 00:06:05.700 
don't have to you can have a little
different<00:05:49.000> giving<00:05:49.390> a<00:05:49.450> little<00:05:49.660> unique

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.450 

a<00:06:05.770> little<00:06:06.610> lighter<00:06:07.620> when<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:08.650> hard<00:06:08.950> word<00:06:09.220> or

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
a little lighter when a hard word or

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.450 
a little lighter when a hard word or
even<00:06:09.490> though

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
even though

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:24.170 
even though
basically<00:06:12.330> hardly<00:06:17.630> ladies<00:06:18.630> risk<00:06:23.180> things

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
basically hardly ladies risk things

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.610 
basically hardly ladies risk things
often<00:06:24.740> show<00:06:25.740> you<00:06:25.800> what<00:06:25.979> it<00:06:26.070> looks<00:06:26.250> like<00:06:27.620> this

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
often show you what it looks like this

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.070 
often show you what it looks like this
it<00:06:28.889> looks<00:06:28.919> pretty<00:06:29.310> symmetrical<00:06:29.490> I<00:06:30.240> can<00:06:30.870> see

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
it looks pretty symmetrical I can see

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.070 
it looks pretty symmetrical I can see
there's<00:06:31.350> some<00:06:31.669> guess<00:06:32.669> break<00:06:33.240> out<00:06:33.479> here<00:06:33.780> on<00:06:33.960> the

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
there's some guess break out here on the

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.080 
there's some guess break out here on the
edge<00:06:34.110> where<00:06:34.590> it<00:06:34.680> gets<00:06:34.860> thin<00:06:35.190> I<00:06:35.460> think<00:06:35.850> I<00:06:35.940> can

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
edge where it gets thin I think I can

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.580 
edge where it gets thin I think I can
take<00:06:36.240> care<00:06:36.509> of<00:06:36.600> that<00:06:36.690> with<00:06:37.880> sandpaper<00:06:39.320> if<00:06:40.320> not

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
take care of that with sandpaper if not

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.550 
take care of that with sandpaper if not
I<00:06:40.620> can<00:06:40.979> do<00:06:41.479> one<00:06:42.479> here<00:06:42.690> and<00:06:42.810> touch<00:06:42.990> it<00:06:43.139> up<00:06:43.199> just<00:06:43.410> a

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
I can do one here and touch it up just a

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:53.350 
I can do one here and touch it up just a
little<00:06:43.590> bit

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.230 

so<00:06:54.360> much<00:06:54.630> better<00:06:55.160> then<00:06:56.160> now<00:06:56.850> it's<00:06:57.000> just<00:06:57.090> a

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
so much better then now it's just a

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.719 
so much better then now it's just a
matter<00:06:57.389> of<00:06:57.510> taking<00:06:57.780> the<00:06:58.139> sandpaper<00:06:59.130> and

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
matter of taking the sandpaper and

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:02.480 
matter of taking the sandpaper and
finishing<00:07:00.479> up<00:07:00.630> so<00:07:01.620> it's<00:07:01.770> a<00:07:01.919> real<00:07:02.280> simple

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
finishing up so it's a real simple

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.050 
finishing up so it's a real simple
project<00:07:03.060> quick<00:07:03.240> and<00:07:03.389> easy<00:07:04.280> then<00:07:05.280> take<00:07:05.520> I

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 
project quick and easy then take I

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.379 
project quick and easy then take I
always<00:07:06.660> like<00:07:06.840> spray<00:07:07.650> on<00:07:08.120> old<00:07:09.120> based

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389 
always like spray on old based

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.290 
always like spray on old based
polyurethane<00:07:09.690> I<00:07:10.530> just<00:07:11.250> buy<00:07:11.370> little<00:07:11.639> cans<00:07:11.940> of

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
polyurethane I just buy little cans of

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.730 
polyurethane I just buy little cans of
MIT<00:07:12.930> Minwax<00:07:13.620> and<00:07:14.930> spray<00:07:15.930> it<00:07:16.110> four<00:07:16.620> or<00:07:16.650> five

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
MIT Minwax and spray it four or five

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.879 
MIT Minwax and spray it four or five
times<00:07:16.860> and<00:07:17.400> it's<00:07:17.580> a<00:07:17.669> it's<00:07:18.210> ready<00:07:18.540> for<00:07:18.889> ready
