that's just who programmed it LCD
contrast<00:00:43.700> self-explanatory

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.240 

we're<00:00:47.789> gonna<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.329> program<00:00:48.750> vehicle<00:00:49.250> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
we're gonna go to program vehicle you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
we're gonna go to program vehicle you
can<00:00:50.399> either<00:00:50.579> install<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.120> tune<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> can

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
can either install the tune or you can

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.340 
can either install the tune or you can
return<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> stock<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.570> case<00:00:54.870> i'll<00:00:55.140> be

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
return it to stock in this case i'll be

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.250 
return it to stock in this case i'll be
returned<00:00:55.829> installing<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.430> tune<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.629> modify<00:00:58.109> an

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
returned installing a tune and modify an

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.970 
returned installing a tune and modify an
entire<00:00:58.590> size<00:00:58.920> parameter<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.800> this<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
entire size parameter here so this is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.319 
entire size parameter here so this is
the<00:01:02.129> only<00:01:02.250> tune<00:01:02.550> that's<00:01:02.760> installed<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the only tune that's installed on the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.640 
the only tune that's installed on the
unit<00:01:03.539> currently<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> 93<00:01:04.320> octane

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
unit currently it's a 93 octane

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.370 
unit currently it's a 93 octane
performance<00:01:05.189> tune<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> scene<00:01:06.869> out<00:01:07.049> intake

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
performance tune for a scene out intake

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.830 
performance tune for a scene out intake
so<00:01:08.280> we're<00:01:08.400> gonna<00:01:08.490> hit<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:11.210> hit<00:01:12.210> select<00:01:12.479> there

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so we're gonna hit it hit select there

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960 
so we're gonna hit it hit select there
and<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.320> wants<00:01:13.590> us<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> turn<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.460> key<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.700> but

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and it wants us to turn the key on but

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.160 
and it wants us to turn the key on but
not<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.360> start<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.720> engine<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:21.170> modify

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
not to start the engine so just modify

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
not to start the engine so just modify
optional<00:01:22.619> parameters<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.060> want<00:01:24.299> that

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
optional parameters we do want that

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.330 
optional parameters we do want that
since<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.680> tire<00:01:25.920> size

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.740 

here<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.460> can<00:01:30.610> change<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.880> spark<00:01:31.360> timings

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
here you can change the spark timings

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.650 
here you can change the spark timings

that<00:01:45.640> tire<00:01:46.479> revolutions<00:01:47.020> per<00:01:47.080> mile<00:01:47.290> we<00:01:47.410> do

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
that tire revolutions per mile we do

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.640 
that tire revolutions per mile we do
want<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.890> change<00:01:48.040> that<00:01:48.310> so<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:48.729> select<00:01:49.650> seven

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
want to change that so it's select seven

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.050 
want to change that so it's select seven
700<00:01:52.560> texture<00:01:53.560> what<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.770> needs<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:53.950> be<00:01:54.010> so<00:01:54.940> I'm

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
700 texture what it needs to be so I'm

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.680 
700 texture what it needs to be so I'm
gonna<00:01:55.180> leave<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.840> way<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.290> is<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.570> can

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
gonna leave it the way it is you can

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.340 
gonna leave it the way it is you can
also<00:01:58.810> change<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.380> speed<00:01:59.530> limiter<00:02:00.009> if<00:02:00.580> you<00:02:01.350> for

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
also change the speed limiter if you for

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:15.090 
also change the speed limiter if you for
whatever<00:02:02.470> reason<00:02:02.830> one<00:02:02.979> two<00:02:13.470> also<00:02:14.470> chooses<00:02:14.890> rev

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
whatever reason one two also chooses rev

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.850 
whatever reason one two also chooses rev

limiter yeah while in driver in gear you
can<00:02:18.040> choose<00:02:18.489> change<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.600> neutral<00:02:19.959> rev

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
can choose change the neutral rev

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.380 
can choose change the neutral rev
limiter<00:02:20.980> as<00:02:21.070> well<00:02:22.380> idle<00:02:23.380> speed<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.970> neutral
