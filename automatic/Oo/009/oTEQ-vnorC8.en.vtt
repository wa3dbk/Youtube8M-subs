00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
timing to things here the timing and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
timing to things here the timing and
power<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> shot<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> heart<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.189> the

experience so the the harder and better

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.979 
experience so the the harder and better
time<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.480> shot<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.230> better<00:00:34.440> result<00:00:35.870> kind<00:00:36.870> of

time the shot the better result kind of

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.860 
time the shot the better result kind of
put<00:00:37.200> hit<00:00:37.770> hit<00:00:38.190> too<00:00:38.430> much<00:00:38.670> power<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.510> poor

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
put hit hit too much power and poor

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.590 
put hit hit too much power and poor
timing<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.770> see<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> ball<00:00:41.280> go<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.879> hit<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
timing will see the ball go out hit the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
timing will see the ball go out hit the
net<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:43.050> hands<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.860> opponents<00:00:44.250> your

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
net or hands the opponents your

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.299 
net or hands the opponents your
advantage<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> players<00:00:46.739> playing<00:00:47.129> with

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
advantage so if the players playing with

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.029 
advantage so if the players playing with
a<00:00:47.340> lot<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> power<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.559> important

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
a lot of power it's so very important

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.410 
a lot of power it's so very important
that<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.340> also<00:00:50.520> balance<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.270> good

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that they also balance that with good

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.990 
that they also balance that with good
time<00:00:54.649> that<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> well-timed<00:00:56.190> shot<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
time that was a well-timed shot so the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
time that was a well-timed shot so the
you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.109> different<00:00:58.590> different

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you can see the different different

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.979 
you can see the different different
timing<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> ball<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.239> indicated<00:01:00.809> by<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
timing on the ball is indicated by the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.170 
timing on the ball is indicated by the
trial<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.670> golden<00:01:03.030> yellow

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
trial so they kind of golden yellow

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.560 
trial so they kind of golden yellow
color<00:01:03.329> denotes<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.409> best<00:01:05.010> time<00:01:05.280> shot<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
color denotes the best time shot the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.380 
color denotes the best time shot the
blue<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.189> standard<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.400> red<00:01:09.119> trail

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
blue is a standard and the red trail

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.770 
blue is a standard and the red trail
denotes<00:01:10.070> poorly<00:01:11.070> Tom<00:01:11.310> shot<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.360> when<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> see

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
denotes poorly Tom shot so when you see

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.469 
denotes poorly Tom shot so when you see
a<00:01:12.950> red<00:01:13.950> trail<00:01:14.430> head<00:01:14.670> toward<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.150> which<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
a red trail head toward you which is a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.840 
a red trail head toward you which is a
poor<00:01:15.840> shot<00:01:16.200> by<00:01:16.380> their<00:01:16.590> opponent<00:01:17.040> this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
poor shot by their opponent this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
poor shot by their opponent this
actually<00:01:18.750> allows<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.470> strike<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> ball

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
actually allows you to strike the ball

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.630 
actually allows you to strike the ball
back<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.880> better<00:01:21.659> timing<00:01:22.400> conversely<00:01:23.400> if

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
back with better timing conversely if

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.420 
back with better timing conversely if
Kazaam<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.350> well-timed<00:01:25.350> shot<00:01:25.740> heading<00:01:26.040> towards

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
Kazaam a well-timed shot heading towards

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.210 
Kazaam a well-timed shot heading towards
you<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.150> golden<00:01:28.080> trail<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.860> makes<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you with a a golden trail it makes it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
you with a a golden trail it makes it
more<00:01:29.369> difficult<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> player<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.360> hit<00:01:31.020> it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
more difficult for the player to hit it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.590 
more difficult for the player to hit it
back<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.710> equally<00:01:32.100> good<00:01:32.310> timing<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.390> maybe

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
back with equally good timing so maybe

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.940 
back with equally good timing so maybe
that's<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> time<00:01:34.200> when<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.439> want<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.770> back

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that's the time when you want to back

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.999 
that's the time when you want to back
off<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.280> power<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.350> wait<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.500> your<00:01:37.590> opponent

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
off on power and wait for your opponent

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
off on power and wait for your opponent
to<00:01:38.040> play<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> four<00:01:38.939> shot<00:01:39.329> which<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.110> then

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
to play a four shot which you can then

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.719 
to play a four shot which you can then
take<00:01:40.470> advantage<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.100> there's<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> poor<00:01:44.490> time

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
take advantage of so there's a poor time

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.609 
take advantage of so there's a poor time
shot<00:01:45.030> by<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> phone<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.899> there's<00:01:46.140> Andy<00:01:46.470> with

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
shot by the phone and there's Andy with

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.160 
shot by the phone and there's Andy with
a<00:01:46.649> good<00:01:46.920> well<00:01:47.820> hit<00:01:48.090> powerful<00:01:48.720> cross-court

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
a good well hit powerful cross-court

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.050 
a good well hit powerful cross-court
shot<00:01:49.229> winning<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.040> point<00:01:50.280> straight<00:01:50.610> away

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.120 

so<00:01:54.060> now<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.630> Andy<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> face<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.680> survive

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
so now it's a Andy to face to survive

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.430 
so now it's a Andy to face to survive
from<00:01:56.370> his<00:01:56.490> opponent<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.150> he's<00:01:57.659> activated<00:01:58.350> his

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
from his opponent and he's activated his

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.469 
from his opponent and he's activated his
power<00:01:58.710> player<00:01:59.010> in<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.610> case<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.150> super

classed<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.510> very<00:02:06.690> best<00:02:06.960> shot<00:02:08.630> so<00:02:09.630> in<00:02:09.959> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
classed as the very best shot so in that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.500 
classed as the very best shot so in that

case using that power player allowed it

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.650 
case using that power player allowed it
Andy<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.230> win<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> corner<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.580> he's<00:02:15.450> on

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
Andy to win the corner and now he's on

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.810 
Andy to win the corner and now he's on
the<00:02:15.750> power<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.110> Gaunt<00:02:16.410> which<00:02:17.280> means<00:02:17.550> he<00:02:17.670> needs

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
the power of Gaunt which means he needs

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.850 
the power of Gaunt which means he needs
to<00:02:18.090> return<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.709> using<00:02:19.709> his<00:02:19.830> own<00:02:19.980> ability

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
to return it using his own ability

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.010 
to return it using his own ability
that's<00:02:22.860> kind<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.220> slope<00:02:23.520> or<00:02:23.850> pulsar<00:02:24.720> from

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
that's kind of a slope or pulsar from

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.430 
that's kind of a slope or pulsar from
the<00:02:25.110> opponent<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.739> as<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:26.010> turn<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.520> well

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the opponent and as we turn that on well

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.570 
the opponent and as we turn that on well
and<00:02:28.440> there's<00:02:28.739> another<00:02:28.890> pawn<00:02:29.130> shop<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.520> this

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and there's another pawn shop in this

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.920 
and there's another pawn shop in this
pattern<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.030> Don<00:02:30.209> that's<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.510> very<00:02:30.720> powerful

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
pattern and Don that's a very powerful

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.220 
pattern and Don that's a very powerful
shot<00:02:31.410> again<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.340> very<00:02:32.670> well<00:02:33.360> timed<00:02:33.600> powerful

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
shot again a very well timed powerful

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.710 
shot again a very well timed powerful
shot<00:02:34.440> right<00:02:35.310> into<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.700> corner<00:02:36.090> makes<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.570> very

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
shot right into the corner makes it very

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.990 
shot right into the corner makes it very
difficult<00:02:36.989> for<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:38.130> level<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.580> opponents

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
difficult for this level of opponents

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.199 
difficult for this level of opponents
get<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.709> later<00:02:40.709> later<00:02:41.370> level<00:02:41.670> opponents<00:02:42.060> will

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
get to later later level opponents will

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.520 
get to later later level opponents will
be<00:02:42.239> able<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.570> get<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.870> that

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
be able to get to that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.300 
be able to get to that
so<00:02:44.160> therefore<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.209> player<00:02:45.420> has<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.780> play

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
so therefore the player has to play

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.430 
so therefore the player has to play
successive<00:02:47.310> good<00:02:47.550> shots<00:02:47.850> or<00:02:48.180> think<00:02:48.989> think

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
successive good shots or think think

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.170 
successive good shots or think think
more<00:02:49.680> about<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.160> shot<00:02:50.370> type<00:02:50.640> they're<00:02:50.910> playing

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
more about the shot type they're playing

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.210 
more about the shot type they're playing
looking<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.200> whether<00:02:52.410> opponent<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:53.190> a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
looking at whether opponent is on a

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
this game that's not a great serve by

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.720 
this game that's not a great serve by
the<00:03:03.900> opponent<00:03:04.410> oh<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:05.130> there's<00:03:05.280> no<00:03:05.430> great
