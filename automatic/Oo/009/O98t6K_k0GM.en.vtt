 today in bears recipes from the 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.110
 real life came a letter from the 'old 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:32.460

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.560
 click bears the face that will have passed 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.740
 had a recipe program to the 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.250
 grill before coming to england to 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.890
 study now that he returns it turns out that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 I'm no longer the star of the show 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.829
 tell me how to make a wellington bis 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.590
 traditional saucer of england and so 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.170
 choke my sorrows in flesh then friend 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.230
 we know how to do it and you 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.630
 let's say this is bears recipes 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.280
 the real life 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.710
 Well, this recipe is a little 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.270
 complex but it's worth it so the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.420
 let's do let's go step by step 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.180
 slowly and any doubt, do not hesitate 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.430
 in making comments on the video 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.230
 and we say that I'm going to 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.880
 start with this beef filet I'm going to 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.880
 put a little olive oil salt 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.330
 and pepper 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.150
 I'm going to seal my steak for all 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.060
 sides down up to the sides and also 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.610
 the tapas I have a high fire the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.430
 I can control it and I'm going to 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.060
 start 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.190
 I want it to be well golden brown then 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.620
 I will take it slowly slowly this 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.110
 recipe is usually made in pan and 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.570
 in an oven but we made this variation 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.940
 to the rotisserie 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.409
 we are going to seal as well as the effect of 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.800
 we will generate it in the grill 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.800
 as well 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.440
 but they can do it to their normal kitchen 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.690
 with a frying pan and an oven 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.510
 in a processor I'm going to put mushrooms 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.330
 with salt and pepper, I'm just going to 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.979
 grind until a paste is made 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.410
 I believe we will remember towards the 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.390
 huitlacoche is counted and we process them 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.430
 since I have mushroom pasta you 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.620
 I will give a pan to the pan not to 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.230
 we are going to add no oil to this anymore 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.500
 will progress nothing like it is 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.500
 we go 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.790
 to put in the pan 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.440
 you have to cook it to reduce the water 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.420
 that has and then change a little bit the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.130
 taste also since the pasta 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.110
 mushrooms this list that changed 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.790
 flavor color and that has little of 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.280
 water I'm going to start putting together the bid 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.720
 wellington is the only part of the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.140
 recipe that I 'm going to change I 'm going to use 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.790
 bacon instead of parma ham 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.790
 because I put it is cheaper 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.950
 I'm arranging it here on 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.830
 a paper the transparent paper that 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.680
 use to wrap the food 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.299
 and well more or less I will calculate 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.330
 that the width of the strips that I'm 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.450
 using 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.030
 and the width 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.030
 of the steak that I have since I have ready 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.020
 it's bacon strips I'm going to place my 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.030
 pasta 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.740
 the mushrooms 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.210
 you have to spread the leave a layer 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.010
 uniform 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.010
 try not to leave gaps too 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.380
 and I leave a bit 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.380
 about one inch 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.170
 since I have the bacon bed ready and 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.600
 of mushrooms I'm going to spend with my piece 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.010
 of meat again I'm going to paint it with 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.959
 mustard 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.920
 if they have to show English to what parents 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.959
 and do not be from the American 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.709
 if it's a stronger taste of mustard 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.709
 english 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.840
 it goes more like someone since I have the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.840
 steak I can place here in the center 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.250
 and we'll wrap it up this goes 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.110
 and then comes the other part 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.730
 that squeeze it from the sides as if it were 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.160
 a sweet a glory 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.160
 and there's the fun part ready 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.800
 maybe this is the hardest step they use 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.290
 all the transparent paper they need 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.110
 and since it's like this we're going to take it to 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.170
 freezer for 20 minutes 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.060
 since I rest 20 minutes the monotype 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.310
 this we did 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.919
 prepare a puff pastry is the 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.780
 they can buy do not have to do it 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.330
 where I'm going to wrap it up 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.560
 extended and now what I'm going to do is 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.840
 remove the plastic that he had 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.699
 I'm going to put a little egg 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.270
 they cure it well so that this what goes 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.270
 make him stick 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.580
 and will cut a little 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.389
 of the mass 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.660
 just like covering a book 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.060
 that there are no air bubbles left and 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.910
 The egg is also going to help us 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.780
 have a nice color then paint what 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.350
 Well all 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.350
 and now yes 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.100
 doubled here 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.870
 doubled here 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.000
 I turn it around 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.260
 I am the last pass is nothing more 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.729
 for the color and if they feel inspired 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.219
 if they think they can 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.569
 They can try to make some figures 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.569
 to the mass 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.440
 I'm going to go on the grill I have a 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.990
 stone that is like where the 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.420
 pizzas you can make an oven 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.550
 in an ornament would be 180 degrees 25 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.800
 minutes to half an hour 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.690
 and I will more or less be the same 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.460
 try to imitate it in the launcher the 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.260
 truth is harder to do here them 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.569
 I recommend that they do it in the oven but 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.710
 if they feel brave 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.710
 then do it linked 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.930
 you are ready our beat Wellington 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.910
 gordon brown logo saucer if the 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.400
 uncertainty always know if you're going to 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.840
 have the middle term in or not me 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.090
 I had to take it out because I already had the 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.580
 golden down do not get what from above 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.140
 so marked but you can 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.170
 achieve even with an oven that has 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:46.240
 the burner above as they do 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.240
 even easier the moment of truth 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.250
 oh my god is perfect this is how 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.050
 should be the cuts have to be 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.710
 of a centimeter of thickness more or less 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.710
 that is 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.640
 I'm going to do it 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.240
 if you look closely here we have the layer 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.820
 of the puff pastry the bacon layer that is 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:11.759
 so here we stuck Mushroom I 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.759
 here what I like 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:27.800
 Well that's how we solved one more of 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.300
