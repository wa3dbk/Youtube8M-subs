hybrid<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.260> two<00:00:46.500> key<00:00:46.860> things<00:00:47.090> firstly

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
hybrid there are two key things firstly

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.630 
hybrid there are two key things firstly
it<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.450> parallel<00:00:49.170> hybrid<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.309> believe

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it is a parallel hybrid and we believe

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
it is a parallel hybrid and we believe
parallel<00:00:51.149> systems<00:00:51.660> give<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> greater

been very reliable in service the future

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.499 
been very reliable in service the future
in<00:01:24.740> hybrid<00:01:25.740> technology<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.549> very<00:01:26.939> much<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
in hybrid technology is very much a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.170 
in hybrid technology is very much a
long-term<00:01:28.229> future<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.610> an<00:01:29.790> alleyway

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
long-term future this is not an alleyway

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.080 
long-term future this is not an alleyway
this<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.560> around<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:32.189> 30-40

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
this is going to be around for 30-40

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
this is going to be around for 30-40
years<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.290> next<00:01:34.470> step<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> hybrid

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
years and the next step with the hybrid

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.810 
years and the next step with the hybrid
is<00:01:36.210> what's<00:01:36.540> called<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.170> plug-in<00:01:37.770> hybrid<00:01:38.250> we

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
is what's called the plug-in hybrid we

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
is what's called the plug-in hybrid we
hate<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> word<00:01:39.390> plug-in<00:01:39.900> what's<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.710> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
hate the word plug-in what's going to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740 
hate the word plug-in what's going to
happen<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> bus<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.299> pick<00:01:42.570> up

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
happen is that the bus will pick up

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.649 
happen is that the bus will pick up
electric<00:01:43.380> charge<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:44.040> route<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.479> will

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
electric charge on route and this will

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.950 
electric charge on route and this will
give<00:01:45.840> us<00:01:46.250> further<00:01:47.250> range<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:48.149> battery<00:01:48.750> mode

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
give us further range in battery mode

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.810 
give us further range in battery mode
without<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.770> diesel<00:01:50.040> engine<00:01:50.310> running<00:01:50.579> at<00:01:50.670> all

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
without the diesel engine running at all

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.719 
without the diesel engine running at all
more<00:01:51.270> zero<00:01:51.570> emissions<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.320> big<00:01:52.770> fuel<00:01:53.070> savings

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
more zero emissions and big fuel savings

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.660 
more zero emissions and big fuel savings
so<00:01:54.060> today<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.600> hybrid<00:01:55.020> tomorrow<00:01:55.740> too

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so today the hybrid tomorrow too

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.600 
so today the hybrid tomorrow too
three<00:01:56.820> years<00:01:57.030> time<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.810> plug-in<00:01:58.259> will<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
three years time the plug-in will be the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.840 
three years time the plug-in will be the
next<00:01:59.939> stage<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.509> efficiency<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.470> savings<00:02:02.400> for

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
next stage in efficiency and savings for
