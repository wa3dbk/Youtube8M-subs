part of your hair that you're
straightening<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.570> I'm<00:01:58.720> going<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:58.960> use<00:01:59.260> a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
straightening and I'm going to use a

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.440 
straightening and I'm going to use a
Tresemme<00:02:00.760> heat<00:02:00.790> protectant<00:02:01.720> or<00:02:01.960> heat<00:02:02.230> defense

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
Tresemme heat protectant or heat defense

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.830 
Tresemme heat protectant or heat defense
okay<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.720> this<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.680> smooth<00:02:06.390> which<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.540> just<00:02:07.720> a

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
okay and this is smooth which is just a

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.430 
okay and this is smooth which is just a
natural<00:02:07.960> hold<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.590> think<00:02:08.830> that<00:02:09.070> just<00:02:09.430> means<00:02:09.610> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
natural hold I think that just means and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.610 
natural hold I think that just means and
it<00:02:11.440> says<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.770> helps<00:02:12.420> protect<00:02:13.420> from<00:02:13.690> ceramic

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
it says it helps protect from ceramic

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.190 
it says it helps protect from ceramic
strain<00:02:14.860> those<00:02:15.010> channels<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.700> dryers<00:02:16.200> reduces

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
strain those channels and dryers reduces

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.770 
strain those channels and dryers reduces
frizz<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.860> adds<00:02:18.040> shine<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.390> pretty<00:02:19.540> good

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
frizz and adds shine so it's pretty good

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.810 
frizz and adds shine so it's pretty good
and<00:02:20.710> one<00:02:20.890> way<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.340> I'm<00:02:21.430> gonna<00:02:21.520> hold<00:02:21.730> my

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
and one way to do is I'm gonna hold my

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.080 
and one way to do is I'm gonna hold my
hair<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.180> went<00:02:22.330> back<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:24.090> spray
