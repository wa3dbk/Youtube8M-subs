00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.700
 such 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.650
 grace mate, here we are 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.780
 with in the valence is still 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.700
 in ecuador waiting in the last 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.550
 details before the trip to join and the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.820
 west ham united 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.160
 yes waiting for detail and in sight nothing 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.170
 more to incorporate the core something that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.150
 you wonder a lot in Mexico who you 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.070
 did he play as fake 9 because your comedian 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 or like 9 in this case I would not give it because 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.450
 your beginnings in emblems are worth 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.050
 stuck to the sides profe gustavo 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.420
 quinteros and after reinaldo rolls it 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.590
 I just consolidated and eyes meza followed 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.570
 with that process if afterwards in the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.840
 selection with the teacher age as he says 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.449
 continue in that position out there since 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.420
 I put the quintero himself not me 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.100
 they changed more and in Mexico too 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.129
 effectively continued in that opposition 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.920
 that has allowed me out there to score 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.250
 many goals was all very fast because 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.260
 a year ago somewhere some people 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.540
 I discussed in emelec you had had a 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.370
 call to the selection and now a 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.470
 year later we are waiting for a visa 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.890
 to go to the premier league 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.700
 if everything very quickly I think they have been 78 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.500
 I have spent months and things 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.190
 to enjoy this with much 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.800
 responsibility and try to improve in 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.660
 things that fail how much I help you 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.390
 Mexican soccer in your career 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.690
 especially these last six months 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.740
 a lot of publishing is a very soccer 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.399
 dynamic out there very physical 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.790
 it's about learning very much about that 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.590
 it was a football very different from soccer 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.439
 Ecuadorian and that has learned many 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.450
 things there is a month that marked the pachuca to 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.479
 throughout your career 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.570
 if it has been important to have in my 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.250
 career out there gave me that 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.130
 opportunity to go to soccer 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.530
 international and decide there in the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.000
 selection there were other offers because it 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.770
 they speak of many names when they 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.390
 knew and when people said the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.160
 pachuca that it was almost impossible to retain 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.460
 you heard the names you know from 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.410
 some other offer that was given by you 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.010
 listen to judgment by the media 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.840
 many names many teams but as 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.330
 says the people of pachuca this was the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.920
 firm offer for which they decided 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.650
 the names in Mexican football is a 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.560
 catapult to get to europe 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.610
 it's like one like a university but 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.550
 this one that comes from this part of the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.880
 continent may be that if to me 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.990
 it served for sure that's a lot 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.540
 more will be the soccer link of a 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.880
 football going very well organized in 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.400
 very dynamic football as I said it 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.650
 I would like to come back one day if I am sure that 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.750
 if in a short time I was there in 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.660
 pachuca treated me very well promise 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.190
 someone knows a lot in a lot technician 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.620
 experience both the with your body 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.930
 technician out there are talking a lot with 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.750
 player 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.480
 I remember the words that he told me 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.269
 said you are going to be a scorer I had 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.329
 one goal and there was another from another team that 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.879
 I had like 5 and they choose 2 and already have 5 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.430
 better almost like the scorer and I 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.010
 I had eaten many goals he gave me that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.590
 word whenever I speak with the side of 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.739
 agreement we laughed and I learned a lot from him 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.569
 what balance do you take from the world both in 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.359
 Personally and collectively what 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.099
 what the Ecuadorian team could do 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:39.669
 well I think for me personally 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.639
 out there that was my first world try 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:46.329
 to dismantle a goal as I said 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.639
 before I started I made three and in what 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.139
 collective out there we stayed that with 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.299
 that succession of we could give a little 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.189
 more because to take to keep moving forward 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.819
 that was the dream to each one of us 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:59.560
 so we fought in each practice 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.290
 pitifully it did not happen but we know 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.329
 that we gave everything everything is what I had one 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.739
 within the playing field of the year of 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.620
 that we talked about in which played in 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.449
 another position until the date that 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.140
 is what makes self-criticism in the 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.760
 Valencia 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.140
 and feels that it was what changed that was 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.840
 that was the little details that was 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.440
 improving on the road 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.299
 if there I need a little more 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.460
 finish well he had a lot of situation of 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.310
 goal out there 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.840
 in the food and said good already happened but 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.819
 not now 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.310
 help I'm very sorry and I have to 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:34.620
 to follow another for another and what is it that 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.229
 it has improved a lot it was important 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.360
 go outside and be in the same 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.169
 team that walter ayoví a person that 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.120
 It has so many years and so much experience 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.949
 very important outside of me I think that 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.470
 It was the best thing I could do to have it 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.140
 to walter as a mate out there 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.360
 instead of much experience like all 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.750
 we know someone to talk a lot 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.630
 many tips and it was something very very 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.340
 very important for me to have them 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.980

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.290
