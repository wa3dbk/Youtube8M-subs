get slightly higher all right there's a
dropkick<00:01:11.180> now<00:01:11.570> if<00:01:11.630> your<00:01:11.840> wind<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.260> strong<00:01:12.290> wind

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
dropkick now if your wind a strong wind

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.100 
dropkick now if your wind a strong wind
is<00:01:12.890> coming<00:01:13.160> into<00:01:13.310> your<00:01:13.550> face<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.240> if<00:01:14.750> Ponte

has a tendency to get higher into the
sky<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:17.990> probably<00:01:18.470> going<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.680> get<00:01:18.830> caught<00:01:19.040> in

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
sky it's probably going to get caught in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.250 
sky it's probably going to get caught in
that<00:01:19.340> win<00:01:19.550> and<00:01:19.760> you'll<00:01:19.880> see<00:01:20.120> balls<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:20.960> come

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
that win and you'll see balls that come

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.750 
that win and you'll see balls that come
out<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:21.680> then<00:01:21.980> they<00:01:22.100> end<00:01:22.280> up<00:01:22.400> gonna<00:01:22.580> get

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
out and then they end up gonna get

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.950 
out and then they end up gonna get
caught<00:01:22.970> by<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.210> wind<00:01:23.300> they<00:01:23.570> ended<00:01:23.720> up<00:01:23.780> going

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
caught by the wind they ended up going

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.810 
caught by the wind they ended up going
straight<00:01:24.440> up<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.860> then<00:01:25.340> they're<00:01:25.550> coming

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
straight up and then they're coming

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.490 
straight up and then they're coming
straight<00:01:26.030> back<00:01:26.090> down<00:01:26.300> sometimes<00:01:27.080> I'll<00:01:27.260> end<00:01:27.440> up

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
straight back down sometimes I'll end up

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.810 
straight back down sometimes I'll end up
going<00:01:27.710> straight<00:01:28.010> up<00:01:28.160> and<00:01:28.340> actually<00:01:28.610> come<00:01:28.790> back

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
going straight up and actually come back

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.990 
going straight up and actually come back
to<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.510> alright<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.860> moments<00:01:31.280> like<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:31.460> a

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
to you alright the moments like that a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.520 
to you alright the moments like that a
drop<00:01:32.300> kick<00:01:32.510> is<00:01:32.690> probably<00:01:33.020> going<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.200> be<00:01:33.290> better

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
drop kick is probably going to be better

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.590 
drop kick is probably going to be better
because<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.340> trajectory<00:01:35.000> of<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.270> strike

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
because the trajectory of the strike

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.020 
because the trajectory of the strike
tends<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.380> be<00:01:36.500> flattened<00:01:37.010> it<00:01:37.220> doesn't<00:01:37.670> tend<00:01:37.880> to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
tends to be flattened it doesn't tend to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.480 
tends to be flattened it doesn't tend to
get<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:38.450> high<00:01:38.690> up<00:01:38.960> into<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.230> sky<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:40.160> tends<00:01:40.430> to

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
get so high up into the sky it tends to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.640 
get so high up into the sky it tends to
be<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.700> little<00:01:40.940> flatter<00:01:41.300> which<00:01:41.870> is<00:01:42.050> good<00:01:42.290> even

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
be a little flatter which is good even

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.070 
be a little flatter which is good even
with<00:01:42.830> your<00:01:42.950> punting<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:44.060> idea<00:01:44.510> when<00:01:44.960> you're

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
with your punting the idea when you're

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.960 
with your punting the idea when you're
punting<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.710> not<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:46.100> hit<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.400> million<00:01:46.760> miles

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
punting is not to hit it a million miles

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.300 
punting is not to hit it a million miles
hot<00:01:47.320> alright<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.560> looks<00:01:48.770> great<00:01:48.950> for<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
hot alright and looks great for the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.620 
hot alright and looks great for the
crowd<00:01:49.640> but<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.270> problem<00:01:50.690> is<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:51.020> gives<00:01:51.200> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
crowd but the problem is it gives the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.190 
crowd but the problem is it gives the
too<00:01:52.350> much<00:01:52.560> time<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.580> behind<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.330> ball<00:01:54.510> get

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
too much time to get behind the ball get

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
too much time to get behind the ball get
set<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.920> tight<00:01:56.190> getting<00:01:56.520> organized<00:01:57.030> before

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
set get tight getting organized before

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.360 
set get tight getting organized before
the<00:01:57.479> ball<00:01:57.690> comes<00:01:57.960> out<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.260> sky<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.070> even

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
the ball comes out of the sky so even

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.310 
the ball comes out of the sky so even
when<00:01:59.490> you're<00:01:59.640> punting<00:02:00.090> you'd<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.900> find<00:02:01.140> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
when you're punting you'd like to find a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.530 
when you're punting you'd like to find a
little<00:02:01.590> bit<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.860> flatter<00:02:02.160> trajectory

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
little bit of a flatter trajectory

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.820 
little bit of a flatter trajectory
alright<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.780> probably<00:02:04.140> won't<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.440> quite<00:02:04.800> as

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
alright it probably won't be quite as

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.980 
alright it probably won't be quite as
flat<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.550> dropkick<00:02:05.910> but<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:06.420> still<00:02:06.659> want<00:02:06.900> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
flat as a dropkick but you still want a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.710 
flat as a dropkick but you still want a
little<00:02:07.229> bit

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
little bit

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.260 
little bit
so<00:02:08.229> if<00:02:08.350> winds<00:02:08.770> coming<00:02:09.100> into<00:02:09.220> your<00:02:09.400> face<00:02:09.670> that

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
so if winds coming into your face that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.480 
so if winds coming into your face that
might<00:02:10.510> be<00:02:10.690> an<00:02:10.780> ideal<00:02:11.110> time<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.680> use<00:02:12.070> a<00:02:12.100> drop

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
might be an ideal time to use a drop

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.740 
might be an ideal time to use a drop
kick<00:02:12.730> over<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.150> putt

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
kick over a putt

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
kick over a putt
if<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.500> play<00:02:14.710> on<00:02:14.860> bumpy<00:02:15.280> surfaces<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.620> wear<00:02:17.620> the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
if you play on bumpy surfaces I wear the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.740 
if you play on bumpy surfaces I wear the
quality<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.430> can't<00:02:18.730> guarantee<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.600> quality

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
quality you can't guarantee the quality

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.960 
quality you can't guarantee the quality
of<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.290> bounce<00:02:20.530> coming<00:02:20.980> up<00:02:21.100> off<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.460> ground

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
of the bounce coming up off the ground

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.700 
of the bounce coming up off the ground
that<00:02:22.450> might<00:02:22.690> be<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> better<00:02:23.050> time<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.440> use<00:02:23.680> a

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
that might be a better time to use a

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.190 
that might be a better time to use a
putt<00:02:24.040> as<00:02:24.370> opposed<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:25.000> drop<00:02:25.270> kick<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.140> I

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
putt as opposed to a drop kick and I

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.230 
putt as opposed to a drop kick and I
look<00:02:26.410> at<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.740> surface<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.460> very<00:02:27.790> thick

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
look at this surface it's very thick

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.050 
look at this surface it's very thick
alright<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:29.470> flat<00:02:29.800> but<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.370> grass<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.850> very

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
alright it's flat but the grass is very

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.270 
alright it's flat but the grass is very
thick<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.570> heavy<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.680> surface<00:02:33.100> like

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
thick and heavy so on a surface like

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.160 
thick and heavy so on a surface like
this<00:02:33.520> because<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> grass<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:34.690> thick

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
this because the grass is so thick

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.560 
this because the grass is so thick
there's<00:02:35.740> not<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:35.980> whole<00:02:36.280> lot<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.520> return<00:02:36.970> energy

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
there's not a whole lot of return energy

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.450 
there's not a whole lot of return energy
off<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.080> ground<00:02:38.380> when<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.800> bounces<00:02:39.250> up

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
off the ground when it bounces up

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.850 
off the ground when it bounces up
alright<00:02:40.270> if<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.870> grass<00:02:41.140> tends<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.710> be<00:02:41.830> a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
alright if the grass tends to be a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.250 
alright if the grass tends to be a
little<00:02:42.070> shorter<00:02:42.700> alright<00:02:43.630> let's<00:02:43.870> say<00:02:44.080> if

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
little shorter alright let's say if

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.590 
little shorter alright let's say if
you're<00:02:44.380> playing<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:45.700> know<00:02:45.850> in<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.120> high<00:02:46.300> level

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
you're playing you know in a high level

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.240 
you're playing you know in a high level
stadium<00:02:47.110> but<00:02:47.200> our<00:02:47.290> high<00:02:47.440> level<00:02:47.770> surface<00:02:48.130> or

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
stadium but our high level surface or

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.150 
stadium but our high level surface or
even<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.520> nasty<00:02:48.910> turf<00:02:49.150> because<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.590> surface<00:02:51.010> is

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
even a nasty turf because the surface is

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.950 
even a nasty turf because the surface is
shorter<00:02:51.580> which<00:02:52.210> means<00:02:52.480> you're<00:02:52.630> going<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.810> get

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
shorter which means you're going to get

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.080 
shorter which means you're going to get
more<00:02:53.260> return<00:02:53.440> energy<00:02:54.040> off<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.460> bounce<00:02:54.760> which

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
more return energy off that bounce which

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.730 
more return energy off that bounce which
means<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.510> ball<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.900> going<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.110> come<00:02:56.350> up<00:02:56.500> a

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
means the ball is going to come up a

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.950 
means the ball is going to come up a
little<00:02:57.280> quicker<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:58.030> I'll<00:02:58.240> end<00:02:58.480> up<00:02:58.660> being

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
little quicker and I'll end up being

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.900 
little quicker and I'll end up being
able<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.200> hit<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.680> little<00:02:59.830> further<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.520> a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
able to hit it a little further and a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.540 
able to hit it a little further and a
little<00:03:01.180> smoother<00:03:01.690> if<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.710> surface<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.220> thick

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
little smoother if the surface is thick

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.940 
little smoother if the surface is thick
like<00:03:03.580> this<00:03:04.060> chances<00:03:04.840> are<00:03:05.290> it's<00:03:05.470> going<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.710> grab

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
like this chances are it's going to grab

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.860 
like this chances are it's going to grab
the<00:03:06.280> ball<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.700> energy<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.300> ball<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:07.690> not

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
the ball the energy of the ball it's not

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.750 
the ball the energy of the ball it's not
going<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.110> come<00:03:08.290> up<00:03:08.440> quite<00:03:08.770> as<00:03:08.950> much<00:03:09.160> quite<00:03:09.580> as

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
going to come up quite as much quite as

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.490 
going to come up quite as much quite as
fast<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.600> it's<00:03:10.810> going<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.020> affect<00:03:11.380> the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
fast and it's going to affect the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.830 
fast and it's going to affect the
quality<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:12.010> my<00:03:12.130> dropkick<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.330> something<00:03:13.810> like

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
quality of my dropkick so something like

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.340 
quality of my dropkick so something like
this<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.590> probably<00:03:15.520> more<00:03:15.730> apt<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.209> hit<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:17.020> pot

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
this I probably more apt to hit a pot

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.410 
this I probably more apt to hit a pot
out<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.650> my<00:03:17.890> hands<00:03:18.340> just<00:03:18.790> because<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.150> can

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
out of my hands just because I can

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.930 
out of my hands just because I can
guarantee<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.260> timing<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:20.980> all<00:03:21.250> right<00:03:21.730> so

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
guarantee the timing of it all right so

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.760 
guarantee the timing of it all right so
those<00:03:22.120> are<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.360> couple<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.810> issues<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:23.410> why

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
those are a couple of issues is that why

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.760 
those are a couple of issues is that why
you<00:03:23.830> might<00:03:24.160> hit<00:03:24.340> one<00:03:24.580> or<00:03:24.700> another<00:03:25.770> another

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
you might hit one or another another

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.530 
you might hit one or another another
issue<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.340> how<00:03:27.520> quickly<00:03:27.880> do<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.150> want<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.420> get

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
issue is how quickly do you want to get

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.790 
issue is how quickly do you want to get
the<00:03:28.630> ball<00:03:28.810> down<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.020> field<00:03:29.320> there<00:03:29.650> going<00:03:29.770> to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
the ball down the field there going to

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.880 
the ball down the field there going to
be<00:03:29.890> times<00:03:30.280> when<00:03:31.150> maybe<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.810> corner<00:03:32.410> kick<00:03:32.590> comes

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
be times when maybe a corner kick comes

to<00:04:05.620> hit<00:04:05.770> a<00:04:05.800> dropkick<00:04:06.220> because<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.240> dropkick

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
to hit a dropkick because the dropkick

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.680 
to hit a dropkick because the dropkick
is<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.960> flatter<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.920> gets<00:04:09.340> there<00:04:09.550> faster<00:04:10.180> it's

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
is a flatter it gets there faster it's

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.150 
is a flatter it gets there faster it's
not<00:04:10.990> going<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.230> give<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.530> opposing<00:04:11.740> team
