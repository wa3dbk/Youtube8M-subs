00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.130 
approach jazz walking bass line so let's
change<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.130> key<00:00:17.310> back<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.880> key<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.330> G<00:00:18.570> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
to play four notes because I'm playing

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.950 
to play four notes because I'm playing
four<00:00:38.610> beats<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.090> measure<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.660> I've<00:00:39.750> got<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
four beats to a measure so I've got to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
four beats to a measure so I've got to
play<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.500> two<00:00:41.510> three<00:00:42.530> four<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.010> then<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.700> soon

play one two three four and then as soon

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.660 
play one two three four and then as soon
as<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.239> land<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> sea<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.680> now<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.430> C

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
as I land on the sea I'm now in the C

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.750 
as I land on the sea I'm now in the C
chord<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.960> as<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> tell<00:00:50.250> that's<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> little

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
chord so as you can tell that's a little

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.029 
chord so as you can tell that's a little
bit<00:00:50.940> more<00:00:51.120> interesting<00:00:51.629> than<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:55.039> because

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
bit more interesting than going because

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:14.030 
bit more interesting than going because
we're<00:00:56.399> walking<00:00:56.789> up

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.170 

now<00:01:15.040> let<00:01:15.189> me<00:01:15.220> explain<00:01:15.280> what<00:01:15.700> I'm<00:01:15.790> doing<00:01:16.060> there

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
now let me explain what I'm doing there

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.700 
now let me explain what I'm doing there
I'm<00:01:16.299> kind<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.630> just<00:01:16.810> improvising<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:17.560> it's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
I'm kind of just improvising so it's

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.020 
I'm kind of just improvising so it's
going<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.890> be<00:01:17.979> kind<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.369> hard<00:01:18.640> for<00:01:18.880> me<00:01:18.939> to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
going to be kind of hard for me to

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.770 
going to be kind of hard for me to
explain

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
explain

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.840 
explain
I<00:01:19.840> didn't<00:01:20.290> pre<00:01:20.590> plan<00:01:20.979> this<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.549> can<00:01:21.670> know

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
I didn't pre plan this I can know

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.490 
I didn't pre plan this I can know
exactly<00:01:22.390> what<00:01:22.600> I'm<00:01:22.720> playing<00:01:22.960> that's<00:01:23.320> the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
exactly what I'm playing that's the

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.170 
exactly what I'm playing that's the
beauty<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:23.950> this<00:01:24.159> once<00:01:24.369> you<00:01:24.520> kind<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:24.790> get<00:01:24.940> this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
beauty of this once you kind of get this

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.660 
beauty of this once you kind of get this
technique<00:01:25.690> down<00:01:25.960> you<00:01:26.680> can<00:01:26.860> improvise<00:01:27.310> your

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
technique down you can improvise your

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.270 
technique down you can improvise your
baseline<00:01:28.119> so<00:01:28.390> one<00:01:29.110> way<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.320> get<00:01:29.770> used<00:01:30.190> to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
baseline so one way to get used to

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.420 
baseline so one way to get used to
improvising<00:01:31.270> is<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:32.140> practice<00:01:32.860> how<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.100> get

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
improvising is to practice how to get

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.719 
improvising is to practice how to get
from<00:01:33.640> chord<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:33.970> chord<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:36.250> we<00:01:36.490> did<00:01:36.670> that

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
from chord to chord so as we did that

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.370 
from chord to chord so as we did that
one<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.390> get<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.810> see<00:01:39.390> maybe<00:01:40.390> practice<00:01:40.869> how<00:01:41.350> to

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
one to get to see maybe practice how to

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.540 
one to get to see maybe practice how to
get<00:01:41.740> back<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.330> G<00:01:43.570> chord<00:01:43.810> again<00:01:44.550> so

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
get back to the to the G chord again so

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.620 
get back to the to the G chord again so
I'm<00:01:45.640> climbing<00:01:46.509> my<00:01:46.630> way<00:01:46.780> up<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.990> see

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.300 

maybe<00:01:50.630> I'll<00:01:50.840> do<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.500> get<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:52.010> G<00:01:52.280> chord

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
maybe I'll do that to get to a G chord

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.510 
maybe I'll do that to get to a G chord
and<00:01:52.790> I'm<00:01:53.120> playing<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.450> g9

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
and I'm playing a g9

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:05.830 
and I'm playing a g9
so<00:01:56.150> I'll<00:01:56.479> do<00:01:56.600> that<00:01:56.659> again<00:01:59.979> c9<00:02:01.270> climbing<00:02:02.270> up<00:02:04.840> now

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
so I'll do that again c9 climbing up now

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.870 
so I'll do that again c9 climbing up now
I'm<00:02:05.960> climbing<00:02:06.290> back<00:02:06.439> down<00:02:06.680> I<00:02:06.950> just<00:02:07.520> felt<00:02:07.729> that

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
I'm climbing back down I just felt that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.270 
I'm climbing back down I just felt that
I'm<00:02:08.330> going<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.569> go<00:02:08.660> back<00:02:08.869> down<00:02:08.899> now<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:12.250> back<00:02:13.250> to

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
I'm going to go back down now so back to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.399 
I'm going to go back down now so back to
the<00:02:13.489> sea

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:24.930 

back<00:02:19.409> to<00:02:19.590> G

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.039 

that<00:02:25.940> was<00:02:26.030> my<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.209> minor<00:02:26.629> chord<00:02:27.879> and<00:02:28.879> I'm<00:02:29.420> same

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
that was my a minor chord and I'm same

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.780 
that was my a minor chord and I'm same
approach<00:02:30.409> that<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.709> did<00:02:30.950> from<00:02:31.099> G<00:02:31.340> but<00:02:31.549> now<00:02:31.670> I'm

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
approach that I did from G but now I'm

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.670 
approach that I did from G but now I'm
doing<00:02:31.909> it<00:02:32.090> from<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.450> I'm<00:02:32.569> going<00:02:32.840> up<00:02:33.319> a<00:02:34.190> tone<00:02:34.849> a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
doing it from a I'm going up a tone a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.369 
doing it from a I'm going up a tone a
semitone<00:02:37.150> another<00:02:38.150> semitone<00:02:38.750> these<00:02:39.170> are

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
semitone another semitone these are

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:55.509
