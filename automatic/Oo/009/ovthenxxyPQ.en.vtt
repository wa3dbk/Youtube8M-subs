00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello I'm duke and the snap came out on Monday 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.410
 shot 13 43 he strangely came out of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.470
 Monday and the reason is that then yesterday is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.660
 release of the pre-release of the patch 1.7 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.480
 I repeat seed because the news does not 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.369
 they are many and we say that the novelties of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.070
 these two snap shots the pre release 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.050
 together they make more or less a video then 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.580
 here we are in siena 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.900
 the first novelty I want to talk about 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.750
 it's about horses 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.239
 now it is possible to sprint also above 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.510
 horses however the difference is really is 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.510
 I would say that there is very little to say 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.610
 I don't think it changes that much 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.649
 as soon as it goes a little faster it gives is 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.710
 maybe a little bit can be noticed though 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.100
 really a minimally is nothing 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.100
 special 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.989
 now I get off the horse for a moment 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.840
 because the same thing applies to the boat 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.360
 even in the boat you can sprint known 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.909
 break don't you break good boat e 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.000
 moreover, the way has also been changed 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.790
 with which you control the boat now not 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
 we need to say more 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.970
 mainly the mouse but rather 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.850
 we can use aedi to promote the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.280
 boat make it turn as we wish also 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.650
 the mouse and can still be used 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.079
 to rotate the boat when we 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.369
 But we are pressing you press forward 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.960
 a direction 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.970
 then the mouse direction comes 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.939
 completely ignored this may be 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.500
 useful because so we can look into 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.110
 points different from those where we have to 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.820
 where we need to go then 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.680
 I think it's positive they are doing a 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.770
 little later I enter with these changes 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.930
 honestly, it's not like that 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.530
 exciting so let's move on to something else 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.200
 the music of the juke boxes go loop then of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.409
 Network nothing special and you have 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.360
 reason to nothing special 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.179
 let's go to the main news there are 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.760
 of new types of wood and also there is 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.629
 It was also a re texturing of the old 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.750
 types of wood 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.620
 now first the upper part is 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.930
 own custom we have these 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.430
 two types of wood 1 this can darker 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.530
 it's called dark oak wood while 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.290
 this is very strange and acacia wood 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.900
 fair just turned this world 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.940
 I came from this side I saw 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.069
 this brodetto my god but what colors a 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.890
 and we think fuster new never because it was 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.660
 crazy I was almost checking the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.420
 color of the monitor and instead just like that 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.489
 and I wondered but I guess you did 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.470
 you are also asking yourself but hunting for it 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.010
 really colors and so weird in 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.069
 nature is good at this is a trunk of 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.470
 cut acacia and actually now 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.300
 which I see as the trunk in reality 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.239
 I can understand the effect they thought of 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.680
 give if we say that we are vaguely there is 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.739
 that kind of savanna trees we say 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.409
 by the lion kings where he lives as he is 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.810
 he called the monkey of so-called coconut 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.709
 small in a row for three x 3 per except 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.800
 those sweet cuddles anyway with these 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.379
 new woods you can make slides 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.299
 you can do the usual stairs in short is a 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.120
 new type of wood and there is also another 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.849
 what to say these leaf actually 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.209
 they are different leaves even if they look like 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.970
 equal because as codes in the game 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.470
 both of these two woods that form 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.909
 so two new tree types have a 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.620
 kind of leaves though 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.379
 aesthetically they are therefore identical 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.360
 although it may seem that they are the same 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.760
 actually know that technically they are 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.500
 different so it makes you even aware of it 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.180
 these little details 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.159
 there was a small change for 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.980
 as for the maps when they are 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.200
 applied to the frame they now have this 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.689
 nice wood edging that by the way 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.000
 very particular because when there 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.950
 let 's put the frame to these dimensions 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.110
 if we apply the map by magic yes 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.360
 it magnifies so we are demagin 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.840
 fantastic 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.120
 the texture of the fish that has not changed 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.880
 I find it where you go to that here the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.130
 po per fish the puffer fish changed the 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.500
 its texture and I don't understand why they have it 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.460
 changed I have a theory but maybe 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.290
 a stupid one 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.230
 then in my opinion it is a single change 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.100
 temporary because it sucks it was 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.900
 much better first 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.150
 the second is a temporary change for 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.940
 make it look like a ghost and it's a 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.650
 change done if the worker is, however, perhaps 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.840
 I'm crazy, it looks like a ghost to me 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.480
 this is my theory not based on su 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.419
 no completely speculative facts 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.080
 so take the as we have 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:02.090
 also a new set command 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:07.190
 ward fantastic spawn the script 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.990
 wrong if i am dyslexic set world 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.750
 phone 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.820
 here it is and I accepted the spawn in the 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.310
 point where I am what it means to sedate him 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.810
 sport means that now anyone or is 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.280
 raised a tree 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.050
 now anyone spawn here was there though 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.500
 sport setting made with i 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.000
 beds are not overwritten and to this 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.140
 command could also add the 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.300
 coordinates 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:40.729
 I do n't know 10110 and this will be yours 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.610
 shore in this world 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.830
 you can put the coordinates you want 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.229
 I do as I always do for these new ones 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.690
 commands from an idea that is a bit I think 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.060
 the most discounted one also for 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.190
 using this command is very useful 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.710
 for the check point in my opinion us 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.650
 we can activate or with three surprises with 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.120
 what you want a common bloc 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.310
 when we arrive at a certain point there 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.900
 change the spawn then as I don't know 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.540
 let's say a custom up and full of 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.790
 Dangers We Die Was I Exposed Into That 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.930
 precise point that therefore works from 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.770
 checkpoint 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.560
 besides this being this then there is 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.060
 permanently we can even maybe 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.490
 get out of the world come back e 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.810
 we respond to the last checkpoint you do not 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.470
 you shake st hit 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:32.130
 and fish you're good now go to the lava 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:35.550
 if you are not good but how to put it on 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.940
 head below our shark bay giu 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.940
 goes down 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.750
 here and I said so this is a 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.040
 possible use for this new one 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.990
 command 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.690
 that was all for this video 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:56.100
 novelties are over were the step shows 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.990
 13 43 a and the pre release of peace 1.7 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.240
 that should already come out in these 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.660
 week probably friday but it is not 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.360
 sure i've grown a myriad of 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:09.270
 crazy trees the last thing i wanted 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.740
 to show you right in the end is the tree 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:16.860
 from four rides pling sapling of 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.210
 dark rock of dark oak here they are 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.260
 growing from 4 beautiful handsome big 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.770
 fun to create houses on 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.600
 trees 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.100
 thank you for following this 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.790
 See you next video 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.790
 hello to all
