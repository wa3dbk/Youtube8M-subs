00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
how are we gonna scare hacker away we

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.070 
how are we gonna scare hacker away we
could<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.070> made<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> Madeleine<00:00:12.059> tasted<00:00:12.929> it

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
could have made a Madeleine tasted it

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.460 
could have made a Madeleine tasted it
like<00:00:13.320> before<00:00:13.889> wait<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> minute<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.750> did<00:00:16.109> test

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
like before wait a minute we did test

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.200 
like before wait a minute we did test
our<00:00:16.680> idea<00:00:17.130> remember<00:00:18.949> our<00:00:19.949> invention<00:00:20.730> waddles

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
our idea remember our invention waddles

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.480 
our idea remember our invention waddles
because<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> wheels<00:00:22.050> are<00:00:22.199> off<00:00:22.500> center<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> go

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
because the wheels are off center and go

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.980 
because the wheels are off center and go
up<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.939> down<00:00:24.090> right<00:00:24.510> right<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:26.630> well<00:00:27.630> we

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
up and down right right so well we

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.919 
up and down right right so well we
learned<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.560> from<00:00:28.890> our<00:00:29.070> mom<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:30.150> axle<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
learned that from our mom this axle is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.770 
learned that from our mom this axle is
right<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> center<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> wheel<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.780> bet

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
right in the center of the wheel I bet

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.510 
right in the center of the wheel I bet
if<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.050> change<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.710> wheel<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.370> it's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
if we change this wheel so it's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.819 
if we change this wheel so it's
off-center<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.960> stick<00:00:37.320> will<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:37.680> up

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
off-center to the stick will go up

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830 
off-center to the stick will go up
higher<00:00:38.129> when<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> turned<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.180> push<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
higher when it turned and push the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.049 
higher when it turned and push the
balloon<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.950> whole<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:42.120> switch<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:47.059> we

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
balloon out the whole like switch it we

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.110 
balloon out the whole like switch it we
did<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.170> pods<00:00:49.469> filling<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.039> fast<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
did it is the pods filling up fast the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:04.579 
did it is the pods filling up fast the
plan<00:00:51.449> works<00:00:51.809> perfectly<00:00:52.440> nobody<00:00:57.440> nobody

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589

trips just to take out the trash I have

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
trips just to take out the trash I have
an<00:04:10.940> idea<00:04:11.300> I<00:04:11.769> am<00:04:12.769> going<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.250> invent<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.819> faster

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
an idea I am going to invent a faster

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.250 
an idea I am going to invent a faster
way<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:14.989> take<00:04:15.320> out<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.650> trash<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:16.780> can<00:04:17.780> put<00:04:18.140> the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
way to take out the trash I can put the

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.540 
way to take out the trash I can put the
trash<00:04:18.560> can<00:04:18.950> here<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:20.720> then<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.739> can<00:04:22.160> make<00:04:22.310> a

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
trash can here and then I can make a

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.310 
trash can here and then I can make a
slide<00:04:22.910> which<00:04:23.210> uses<00:04:23.510> gravity<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:24.050> take<00:04:24.080> the

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
slide which uses gravity to take the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.620 
slide which uses gravity to take the
trash<00:04:24.620> from<00:04:25.220> my<00:04:25.340> window<00:04:25.640> down<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.419> trash

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
trash from my window down to the trash

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.850 
trash from my window down to the trash
can<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:29.240> be<00:04:29.360> sure<00:04:29.390> my<00:04:29.600> idea<00:04:29.960> works<00:04:30.229> I'm<00:04:30.650> gonna

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
can to be sure my idea works I'm gonna
