00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.920 
pretty special moment no it has and I
think<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.640> why<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:36.000> began<00:01:36.329> really<00:01:36.689> 12

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
think this is why it all began really 12

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.020 
think this is why it all began really 12
years<00:01:37.200> ago<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:37.650> when<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:38.159> 2003<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
years ago you know when in 2003 when I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.359 
years ago you know when in 2003 when I
won<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.210> junior<00:01:39.659> girls<00:01:40.220> title<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.340> Wimbledon

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
won that junior girls title at Wimbledon

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.179 
won that junior girls title at Wimbledon
is<00:01:42.030> extremely<00:01:42.540> special<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> think

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
is extremely special and but I think

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.130 
is extremely special and but I think
that's<00:01:44.520> where<00:01:44.700> who<00:01:45.180> would<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.509> known<00:01:45.689> you

the biggest insecurities of our lives to
just<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:35.150> on<00:03:35.420> that<00:03:35.600> court<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.050> those<00:03:36.200> two<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.470> a

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
just in on that court in those two and a

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.960 
just in on that court in those two and a
half<00:03:36.650> hours<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.280> have<00:03:37.460> to<00:03:37.580> be<00:03:37.670> able<00:03:37.760> to

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
half hours and you have to be able to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.630 
half hours and you have to be able to
trust<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.300> person<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:38.990> I<00:03:39.170> think<00:03:39.650> because<00:03:40.520> we

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
trust that person so I think because we

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.040 
trust that person so I think because we
get<00:03:40.820> along<00:03:41.000> off<00:03:41.210> the<00:03:41.390> court<00:03:41.600> pretty<00:03:41.780> well<00:03:42.020> I

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
get along off the court pretty well I

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.440 
get along off the court pretty well I
think<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.530> chemistry<00:03:42.950> kind<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.550> takes<00:03:44.270> us

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
think the chemistry kind of takes us

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.150 
think the chemistry kind of takes us
through<00:03:44.720> some<00:03:45.050> of<00:03:45.170> those<00:03:45.290> tough<00:03:45.500> moments<00:03:45.980> too
