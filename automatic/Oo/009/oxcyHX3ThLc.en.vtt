00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
like 20 seconds or so but all 24 to 25

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.760 
like 20 seconds or so but all 24 to 25
kills<00:02:13.260> are

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
kills are

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.350 
kills are
here<00:02:14.130> I'm<00:02:14.400> not<00:02:14.550> sure<00:02:14.610> if<00:02:14.850> he's<00:02:14.970> using<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.240> hard

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
here I'm not sure if he's using a hard

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.730 
here I'm not sure if he's using a hard
line<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.690> not<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.840> guess<00:02:16.110> we'll<00:02:16.260> find<00:02:16.470> out<00:02:16.590> at

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
line or not I guess we'll find out at

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.380 
line or not I guess we'll find out at
the<00:02:16.770> end<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.190> think<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.490> think<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.790> 24<00:02:18.150> kills

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
the end I think I think it's 24 kills

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.990

also guys this mathlete watching it's

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.640 
also guys this mathlete watching it's
its<00:03:03.150> containment<00:03:03.690> I'm<00:03:03.930> sure<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.200> guys<00:03:04.380> are
