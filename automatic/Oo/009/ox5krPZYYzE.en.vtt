for the pc because microsoft owns you

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.270 
for the pc because microsoft owns you
know<00:03:41.819> microsoft<00:03:42.269> windows<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:43.019> there's<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.829> lot

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
know microsoft windows and there's a lot

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.190 
know microsoft windows and there's a lot
it's<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.669> know<00:03:44.760> that's<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.970> true<00:03:45.180> statement<00:03:45.510> so

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
it's you know that's a true statement so

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.569 
it's you know that's a true statement so
I<00:03:46.230> hadn't<00:03:46.590> even<00:03:46.650> thought<00:03:46.799> about<00:03:46.919> that<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.459> now

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
I hadn't even thought about that and now

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.740 
I hadn't even thought about that and now
I'm<00:03:47.790> thinking<00:03:47.910> about<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.329> like<00:03:48.419> that<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.720> a

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
I'm thinking about it like that is a

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.520 
I'm thinking about it like that is a
really<00:03:49.169> really<00:03:49.200> good<00:03:49.769> point<00:03:50.099> so<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.530> basically

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
really really good point so I basically

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.920 
really really good point so I basically
want<00:03:53.519> I'm<00:03:53.760> going<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.150> stand<00:03:54.389> still<00:03:54.569> I<00:03:54.720> don't

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
want I'm going to stand still I don't

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.449 
want I'm going to stand still I don't
know<00:03:55.079> which<00:03:55.290> direction<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.709> want<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:55.889> go<00:03:55.950> that

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
know which direction I want to go that

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.390 
know which direction I want to go that
argument<00:03:56.669> is<00:03:57.209> very<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:58.769> know<00:03:58.799> it's<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.190> very

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
argument is very you know it's a very

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.369 
argument is very you know it's a very
good<00:03:59.639> point<00:03:59.879> as<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.239> why<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.599> ps4<00:04:00.959> would<00:04:01.260> be<00:04:01.349> a

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
good point as to why the ps4 would be a

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.680 
good point as to why the ps4 would be a
better<00:04:01.560> option<00:04:01.650> than<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.129> xbox<00:04:02.489> one<00:04:02.730> but<00:04:03.660> I

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
better option than the xbox one but I

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.479 
better option than the xbox one but I
want<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.900> know<00:04:04.019> from<00:04:04.200> those<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:04.530> guys<00:04:04.680> that
