00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.429
 everyone knows biomaterials get 

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:05.109
 find today for a new 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.240
 video and as you can see 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.310
 it's a first match and it will be 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.740
 too much unpacking so unpacking the 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.630
 unboxing of watchdog on ps4 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.700
 so we'll start you can see 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.209
 already that a good talent is there just 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.160
 huge 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.640
 she is super pretty donzelle quickly done 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.700
 I turn in a little closer all 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:31.650
 the angles earlier rather nice so we 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.650
 started nicely picking up well 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.170
 so 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:46.739
 already not so small badges I put 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:56.129
 a little bit more for you see so there is 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:58.530
 here is the little goat very nice too 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 it changes from box to box 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.850
 original with inside we go 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.060
 look at you have nothing there is not even 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.590
 the cd as you can see the style 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.850
 anyway not you did the same 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.000
 thing about the battlefield person 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.759
 four there so suddenly the game with at 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 internally logically successful editing 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:21.420
 collector ya what is it written just 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.759
 behind then there is a no signature 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.270
 so with a weapon packs for 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.369
 cars there are see resignation four 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.930
 Solo missions 60 minutes more seen 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.060
 that we are on playstation 4 as I 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.310
 wanted to say the white outfit and a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.570
 hacking bonus the palace pack the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.710
 total what a great thing so that's it 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.229
 for these here we have what to mac 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.420
 it seems to me the skid of nonsense I'm going 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.570
 open wide to show you had 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.880
 back because she's just 28 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.400
 thought that she would also be the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.229
 civets so I retreat a little I hope 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.920
 that you will see well so here is very 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:10.410
 great map superb quality and good 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:14.850
 nothing to say here for the bac the other 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.650
 side there is nothing these months we have a 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.410
 little cd but it's closer to the small 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.390
 cd with the songs that ensure the game 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.560
 so there are seven eight nine ten eleven twelve 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.380
 thirteen songs 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.450
 so here is the little super watchdog cd 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.520
 nice we have a little box she me 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.730
 you'll admit I do not know at all 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.200
 who is in so it's cards there 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.519
 I could not tell you what it is 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.489
 exactly it seems to me that with 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:52.010
 the application you can see in 3d a 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.010
 staff to check 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.900
 there is one two three three 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.010
 four years ago so it's quite nice 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.310
 to show you this closer I 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.310
 put in 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:16.640
 so here it is a little style does like 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.970
 a little door cards rather some 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:26.330
 see there and after that I think it's 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.330
 the nathan one more of his liberation 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.640
 you have the little artbook so I'm going 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.950
 not everything show you just show 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.260
 some pages 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.850
 because if not me there for a good 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.049
 moment I think because there is really 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.150
 many pages I thought I 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.170
 would have a lot less so with all the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.670
 characters that you will be able to 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.690
 to cross in the game very beautiful is 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.180
 super handsome super must so there for a 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.500
 collector's edition got used to 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.109
 buy the collector's edition but the one 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.000
 there if I think it's a it's a 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:10.410
 do not miss out on next gen the 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.480
 watchdog of 70 here I am going to put that 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:23.660
 next to 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:23.660
 so it's going to be practical and has it 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:38.820
 neatly the little one about 30 cm 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.120
 from haydn stone so I think you 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.570
 see it pretty well detailed and 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.570
 that the phone 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.539
 she is super nice is nothing to say so 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.310
 a collector's edition that I was waiting for 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:58.100
 no longer a moment I think of any 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.979
 watchdog cdd way to overcome the game 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.680
 i would say i mum would not be for not 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:08.360
 not too wet beaulieu already tried the 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.030
 game before you can talk about it 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.139
 so here you have pretty much the 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.660
 all of what is in the in 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.200
 edition 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:29.280
 here and there is the hand you put it to 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:31.200
 side there so it's a great thing 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.849
 beautiful collector edition so with everything 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.789
 that in there is the box is just 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.650
 beautiful so frankly if there is a 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.710
 related edition it's going to be this one 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.650
 so that's the dry debt for ps4 that's 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.240
 the biggest one that came out I think 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.320
 example or 10 years in France there have been 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.750
 other united states that's pretty much 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.979
 same but without the figurine 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.470
 so that's all for today 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.240
 for this little video I hope it 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.560
 you will have more than you liked it remember 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.030
 not to leave a little I like a 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.990
 comment and while waiting friends 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.990
 life for fans
