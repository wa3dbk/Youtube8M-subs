00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.420
 to these guys and welcome one more day 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.520
 of our channel in this video I 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.170
 I would like to share with you some 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.150
 ideas all those possibilities are going to go 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.949
 about decoration of the room all in 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.410
 some time we wanted to decorate 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.210
 our room but we have not had the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.890
 time nor enough money to 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 do it therefore what I'm going to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.499
 propose will be relatively simple 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.560
 to do and very very very very very cheap 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:33.570
 so look for some ideas and then 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.320
 get down to work with the matter 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.320
 we started 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.620
 The first thing you have to do is 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.449
 choose a piece of furniture that you want to change 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.579
 I have chosen this since it seemed to me 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.750
 too big for my room it 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.269
 find someone who helps you 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.269
 cut it if you do not know how is my case 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.250
 and make sure that the result is going to be 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.190
 well that will depend on the tools 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.930
 that you use and of the material of your furniture the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.680
 next step will be to paint your furniture 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.430
 for this you need a bowl for 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.850
 paint roller and paint brushes in my 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.130
 Acrylic matte acrylic enamel case covers 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.280
 Floors and a shirt that you do not care 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.500
 stain the first cap well the area 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.460
 where are you going to paint your furniture if it's 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.650
 best outdoors 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.210
 and your furniture was every test sanding 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.400
 a little earlier for the painting to 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.830
 Adhere better and faster to us 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.790
 it did not work much for us so we went 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 direct to paint 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.990
 It is important that you take the time 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.310
 you need and give you several layers to 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.310
 cover all the furniture 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.120
 when it is well dry with it in your 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.590
 fourth and start decorating I painted my 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.710
 furniture white since I wanted the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.560
 Room seemed more spacious but 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.270
 not only with that is worth some ideas 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.600
 cheap that will give a pretty touch 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.580
 different to your room are to use 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.500
 boxes to make it look like everything else 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.600
 ordered I have filled some black boxes 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.750
 with my things like this everything will be more 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.510
 uniform and in place 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.010
 another idea is to use plants the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.060
 I love plants because they give a touch 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.010
 I live in the room 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.930
 you can decorate them with small stones 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.320
 make it something more special if you buy 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.060
 cactus better because they will last longer 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.070
 another idea that is super super cheap and the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.709
 you can find anywhere is 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.330
 using candles seem silly but 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.850
 all together really give a touch 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.340
 very special at least in my opinion 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.430
 then you just have to order everything to your 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.430
 taste 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.930
 Y 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.180
 it's a brutal change of truth not os 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.220
 I can teach how I was before because 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.810
 I already had thought about recording this good video 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.939
 guys I hope you liked a 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.950
 heap the video do not forget to make a 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.140
 picture if you do it in our house and 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.549
 then send us not to our networks
