00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
I'm going to need to do some

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.900 
I'm going to need to do some
investigation<00:04:40.290> on<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.560> though<00:04:41.520> nos<00:04:41.700> is<00:04:41.880> a

investigation on that though nos is a

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.900 
investigation on that though nos is a
little<00:04:42.210> bit<00:04:42.330> noisy<00:04:42.510> but<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:44.280> be<00:04:44.400> expected<00:04:44.850> I

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
little bit noisy but to be expected I

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.850 
little bit noisy but to be expected I
guess<00:04:44.940> but<00:04:45.860> well<00:04:46.860> areare<00:04:47.220> take<00:04:47.970> two<00:04:48.770> after<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
guess but well areare take two after the

guess but well areare take two after the
initial<00:04:50.160> start<00:04:50.430> up<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:50.760> afternoon

initial start up this afternoon

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.480 
initial start up this afternoon
everything<00:04:51.570> sounded<00:04:52.200> like<00:04:52.320> okay<00:04:52.980> except<00:04:53.460> for

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
everything sounded like okay except for

everything sounded like okay except for
this<00:04:54.350> light<00:04:55.350> sort<00:04:55.710> of<00:04:55.740> knocking<00:04:55.980> noise<00:04:56.340> down

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
this light sort of knocking noise down

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.720 
this light sort of knocking noise down
the<00:04:56.790> bottom<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:57.240> didn't<00:04:57.570> sound<00:04:57.810> like<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.710> big<00:04:59.550> M

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
the bottom and didn't sound like a big M

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.330 
the bottom and didn't sound like a big M
baring<00:05:00.150> sounded<00:05:00.480> like<00:05:00.650> something<00:05:01.650> hitting

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
baring sounded like something hitting

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.270 
baring sounded like something hitting
something<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.820> shouldn't<00:05:03.060> be<00:05:03.150> hitting<00:05:03.330> and

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
something that shouldn't be hitting and

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.710 
something that shouldn't be hitting and
had<00:05:05.280> my<00:05:05.430> suspicions<00:05:05.940> that<00:05:06.060> it<00:05:06.180> was<00:05:06.450> probably

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
had my suspicions that it was probably

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.670 
had my suspicions that it was probably
the<00:05:07.500> windage<00:05:08.070> tray<00:05:08.100> because<00:05:08.639> I'm<00:05:08.880> using<00:05:09.090> the

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
the windage tray because I'm using the

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.650 
the windage tray because I'm using the
windage<00:05:10.680> tray<00:05:10.710> off<00:05:11.160> sit<00:05:11.370> off<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.700> s50<00:05:12.150> be<00:05:12.330> 30

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
and the s50 be 32 engine has a larger

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.070 
and the s50 be 32 engine has a larger
stroke<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:17.910> did<00:05:18.120> check<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.540> when<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.810> put<00:05:18.990> it

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
stroke and I did check it when I put it

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.230 
stroke and I did check it when I put it
together<00:05:19.200> but<00:05:19.890> obviously<00:05:20.520> not<00:05:20.790> well<00:05:21.000> enough

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
together but obviously not well enough

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:30.980 
together but obviously not well enough
and<00:05:22.100> here<00:05:23.100> is<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:24.419> culprit<00:05:26.510> right<00:05:27.510> there<00:05:29.990> just

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
and here is the culprit right there just

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.310 
and here is the culprit right there just
see<00:05:31.169> where<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:32.180> number<00:05:33.180> two<00:05:33.360> began<00:05:33.840> bearing

pull<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.729> some<00:05:38.910> prophet<00:05:40.520> put<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.580> all<00:05:41.640> back
