00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 how about nicolÃ¡s fishman de supra 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.790
 pixel and today we are going to do the unboxing 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.250
 of the apple watch 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.110
 thank you very much to the people very 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.910
 techno store that got us the ball 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.620
 before anyone else because if there was not 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.540
 been why we would be doing stand 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 boxing in June or in July probably 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.279
 and they even lent us an iphone 5 this 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.750
 as to be able to prove it so barbarian 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.460
 I clarify one thing 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.930
 this unboxing unfortunately not to do 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.080
 the best unboxing they saw in their life 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.660
 because by anxious good just do not 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 I knew how to operate the ball correctly 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.530
 rest assured that later 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.469
 I'm going to make a video showing how 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.140
 use but good the truth is that this way to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.719
 simple sight tearing off the factory 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.890
 it is not a thing that one can intuit how 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.200
 you use the touch and how you have to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.700
 learn so they train themselves more than 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.289
 nothing the unboxing how the box looks and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.910
 later later in another video les 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.649
 I'm good at how it's going to be used 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.570
 so we start are perfect 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.610
 let's start with the unboxing we have for 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.070
 Of course, we have the doctor 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.570
 38 watch export paper 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.280
 millimeters and unfortunately the maximum 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.809
 it's the biggest but hey it does not matter 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.710
 they work exactly the same so 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.900
 let's put 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 Careful to Mr. Scalpel out there 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.680
 down the side cut a little 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.000
 plastic 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.740
 to pluck the plastic and my memory 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
 is to have all the cost of the box 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.909
 because we all sincerely want to see 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 faster than what's inside nobody 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.869
 it matters to read it from the side at least 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.630
 in steam boxing in particular I calculate 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.520
 so we take out the castillito we throw 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.560
 this to the floor already ready here we have the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.390
 box and we're going to get the lord out of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.700
 history 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:38.360
 we do not have the hand and we are going to make a 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.360
 little game to see if it lacks country 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.600
 to see what is this more plastic shot here 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.360
 yes, logically it should be 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.850
 woman associated for back what's up 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.289
 presentation against the box 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.899
 plastic and everything but let's leave it 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:02:00.179
 side and already if I love you but let's 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.610
 see what's inside the good box 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:06.030
 manuals first good is charger 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.310
 classic the same as the iphone 6 that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.560
 it's the same and then the charger cable 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.580
 that if I remember correctly, it's magnetic 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.670
 so let's take out the cable what 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.830
 we do with the good cable very hard not 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.819
 matter if we can slide it well 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.310
 let's pretend that we are using 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.310
 and that everything comes out having a cable 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.580
 stop thinking if I did not like the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.830
 true that more or less but 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.180
 let's try the magnetic charger that 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.800
 then well let's see this because 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.840
 there are many cables now that we have 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.630
 here and look at paper manuals and in 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.850
 all those things papers later if 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.770
 he came to need some paper in 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.900
 particular here tells us how to put the 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.370
 bands and notice that we have the band 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.280
 which it is supposed to be a little 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.470
 longer calculation than the one that comes in the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.060
 little box is a little smaller because if 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.980
 we would not come another bandit so 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.010
 we are going to 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:14.150
 leave all this and finally we are 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:17.780
 with a kind of fake leather 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.390
 world sports worth reading a little there 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.099
 it tells us effectively works sport let's 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.370
 to talk a little bit back and we're going to 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.379
 see obviously the apple watch but let's go 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.310
 to the race here is let's leave it 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.050
 on the side we are going to take out this little film 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.630
 let's zoom in a bit to see 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.160
 if we see a little more details 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.460
 and it seems to me that this is not going to get me 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.460
 on the wrist 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.160
 now as a doll 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.850
 or it is the other way around 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.650
 the other way around it does not matter we're going to try 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.510
 embed what we will start with the button 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.780
 there is there, there was a very 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.250
 mild very soft manzanita go see there 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.350
 let's wait a little bit for you 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.000
 while we're going to see if I can get him out 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.280
 is if it seems that you have to press 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.530
 of this button here and this would be 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.190
 have cost there is and with this 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.940
 we would put the other good barbarians 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.340
 and it is well attached exits easy to 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.799
 see if it comes out look gentlemen and we squeeze 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.290
 it seems that it goes out to not once it 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.570
 it ensures it is well secure it does not come off 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.250
 I'm doing a lot of strength now 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.550
 I could connect it to the charger notice 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.680
 remember that it is magnetic only support 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.450
 click here and start 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.520
 load good low and let loose a little 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.560
 but they're going to be kind of small 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.170
 sound of ringing bell and we're going to 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.950
 connect it to the iphone we will boot to 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.170
 bluetooth 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.810
 there we are going to play english set 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:49.940
 warm up but lynn with playing here 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.340
 and what's the camera at last to this 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.590
 stage let's say if we connect 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.900
 with our apple aid and uncover 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.350
 personal mail address because they are going to 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.300
 raining pam pam pam so we wait for 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.150
 I finished checking and starting 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.669
 a good time and good let's see what 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.100
 asks us if we have here goes the 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.350
 location we say that I do not want to send 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.290
 no thing we are going to create a pass code 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.410
 and look here jon corzine mini tecladito here 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.090
 in the world there we can see it we are going to 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.280
 choose a number asks us if 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.500
 we want to unlock our apple watch 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.150
 with the iphone we say that if we have a 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.820
 cachito install all applications 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.740
 possible and then we wait for 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.960
 synchronize good has already finished 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.920
 synchronize so let's see what we 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.140
 it says the application ok ok and good 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.790
 we have several things here but we are going to 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.380
 Tell us more about apple watch 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.020
 because the truth that I do not know 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.150
 exactly how to operate it I do not know much 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.520
 honestly I really do not know much to see 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.410
 what's up we're going to put the pass code already 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.490
 it's like unlocked and see if 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.920
 we do for there 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.290
 we see the weather buenos aires- grades 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.850
 outside outside maps it seems like that 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.980
 we are changing applications and down there 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.569
 and some very small dots to see if 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.419
 injure see 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:11.409
 bring the camera closer and I will take the 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:14.679
 automatic focus if I want to leave that map 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.819
 your sector to me take configure 10 

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:17.679
 millions of things the truth that so 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.659
 boxing was coming out pretty ugly 

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:22.749
 excuse gentlemen but the truth is that 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:24.669
 I had thought that I would leave like this if 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.469
 we press back to the home and if we do not see 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.330
 this nothing now if we make one more floor 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:32.319
 backwards yes but the 10 mission 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.029
 many applications that not having 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:37.689
 there we have the applications resignation 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:41.740
 good the wheel is the dial is super 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:43.690
 sensitive but it does not work well 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.210
 I think it depends on the speed with the 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:50.410
 that we will choose, that is, it will turn slowly 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:52.270
 I do not know if it takes the turn of it 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.400
 way I do not know if I explain was of 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.860
 guys and if I did not connect but good to 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.000
 see how we move came and go 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.590
 he pressed harder 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.300
 air force touch 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.430
 good the truth not logically the lord 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.860
 sixth let's go just like this let's leave it here 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.750
 which is very short unboxing later 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.490
 I'm going to make a video of several first 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.770
 impressions and of course later 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.870
 the full review now that you tell us 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.819
 lie I'm not sure how to operate it well 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.409
 that I prefer to internalize myself first 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:20.819
 well on the subject of how it is used 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.039
 perfectly fine not to make them lose the 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.780
 time and later give them a video 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:26.610
 with much more information so I am 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.240
 nicolÃ¡s fishman and see you in the next 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.240
 videos 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:37.920
 you know why did not come nicolÃ¡s 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:43.200
 it's wrong you did not subscribe 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:45.530
 cynical is wrong we are all wrong the 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.530
 atheist
