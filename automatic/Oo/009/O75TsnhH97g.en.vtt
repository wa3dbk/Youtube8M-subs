00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hey, people on the channel tomorrow tomorrow. 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.819
 with a training tip today to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.820
 inflection indicating the tip to make 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.170
 bending at home to improve punch 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.519
 increase strength as well 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.309
 I'll pass and the top five 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:22.560
 Reflections did not come back for five 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.330
 pushups fixed time will want to hold 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.380
 pass on to you inflections to project 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.380
 things from his punch 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.659
 the first inflection of how to teach you 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.370
 it is the common reflection that you are already 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.579
 accustomed to seeing there that everyone does 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.620
 that the open bending but two streets 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.629
 parallel to the front 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.960
 remembering to mount it in line with the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.129
 shoulder and you go down until almost done 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 to the ground and rises doing this 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.700
 movement always look when to do 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.340
 this inflection does not spoon down 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.970
 always look forward to keep the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.009
 posture is something else when you 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.289
 doing the inflection sequence 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.740
 you should never go down until you 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.049
 body to relax and not go up until 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.909
 all that when you stretch you are 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.039
 force forcing into the muscle and 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.509
 is putting the force in the bones 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.420
 so you always keep a little 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:37.229
 flexed and so you make reflection by 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.850
 another angle the second reflection I 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.380
 I'll teach you, it 's the most 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.159
 closed, we'll do more to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.429
 to work 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.519
 the triceps and the chest that is in the same 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:51.060
 position but hands are a bit more 

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:54.000
 closed and the shoulder instead the elbow 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.209
 instead of going outside he's going to stay 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.250
 inwards leaving in that position 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.840
 it's just you guys will feel a little more 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.739
 weight because it is actually more difficult 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.739
 So 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.480
 without breathing a little 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.700
 the third flexion that we have now 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.560
 begins to get into the part of not only 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.780
 improve the quality of your arm more 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.790
 also the quality of his punch is the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.280
 closed-wrist flexion will make her 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.900
 an enclosed fist recommend you to use 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.090
 always place a place but the type 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.100
 grass or anything 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.260
 I do not recommend that you make birth 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.880
 At first you can get hurt more 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.070
 this reflection is very important for 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.130
 strengthen your wrist for when you 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.440
 for the show you have a support it 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.360
 is done in the same way as the first 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.500
 the only difference is that the fists 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.690
 closed and the second in forgiveness if well 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.459
 fourth bending is a bit more difficult 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.140
 but it will also greatly strengthen the 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.850
 your arm to increase the strength of 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.170
 its juice that was called in confuse 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.640
 dragon bending 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.250
 she is used with her hands in this 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:11.450
 position you place your hands in this 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:14.110
 on the floor and uses it this year 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.110
 thus 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.460
 the fifth and last flexion that I will pass 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.590
 For you, it's what I think it's going to 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.830
 increase more will give you more power 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.730
 juice more punch power because the punch 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.170
 it is nothing more than a movement 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.950
 explosive 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.900
 then this is the explosion reflection or 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.840
 How are you going to do it? Will you? 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.720
 flex one way only 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.500
 will make her jump off the floor if 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:04:02.870
 possible to hit a paul and 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:04:04.730
 This inflection is here, guys, this is it. 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.640
 is the push-up tip if you want to 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.680
 having the support falls killing always trains 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.540
 remembering to do sequences and each 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.970
 more and improving the speed that 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.350
 You do is the amount but it's also good. 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.049
 remember you 're doing it correctly 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.370
 you will make a wrong bending will not 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.280
 You can not go ahead of yourself. 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.440
 hurt then think well analyze if 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.390
 possible to call a friend of yours to see if 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.220
 Are you doing it right and let's go? 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.350
 with everything pro strange galera reminding 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.060

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.970
 not the only ones you should study 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.690
 more you find more supporters to 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.820
