about to plant some peas into into this
cover<00:00:19.289> crop<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.850> forage<00:00:21.210> rye

since that point the the sheep were

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.569 
since that point the the sheep were
removed<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> crop<00:00:34.980> has<00:00:35.130> had<00:00:35.309> no

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.080 
fertiliser no growth regulation and and
off<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.090> went<00:00:39.120> basically<00:00:40.370> fantastic<00:00:41.370> coverage

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
off it went basically fantastic coverage

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.540 
off it went basically fantastic coverage
of<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.570> soil<00:00:42.980> these<00:00:45.170> stems<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.440> plants<00:00:46.890> were

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
of the soil these stems and plants were

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
of the soil these stems and plants were
getting<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.450> somewhere<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> region

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
getting on for somewhere in the region

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.729 
getting on for somewhere in the region
of<00:00:50.809> anywhere<00:00:51.809> between<00:00:51.930> eight<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.289> twelve

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739

of anywhere between eight and twelve
feet<00:00:52.949> high<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.590> literally<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
feet high so we have literally got a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.720 
feet high so we have literally got a
blanket<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.840> soil<00:00:58.430> I'm<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.699> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
blanket over the soil I'm just going to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
blanket over the soil I'm just going to
stop<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.120> here<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> look<00:01:01.559> at

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
stop in here and just have a look at

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.000 
stop in here and just have a look at
what<00:01:02.129> we've<00:01:02.280> got<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.320> this

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
what we've got going on so this is this

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.630 
what we've got going on so this is this
is<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> soil<00:01:05.519> that's<00:01:05.790> left<00:01:08.720> which<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:10.340> it's<00:01:11.340> in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
is the soil that's left which is it's in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.960 
is the soil that's left which is it's in
relatively<00:01:12.150> good<00:01:12.360> condition<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.820> not

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
relatively good condition I think not

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.740 
relatively good condition I think not
had<00:01:15.210> any<00:01:15.570> traffic<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> loads<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.400> roots

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
had any traffic on it loads of roots

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.800 
had any traffic on it loads of roots
working<00:01:18.750> away<00:01:19.189> to<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.700> through<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> winter

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
working away to the through the winter

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.620 
working away to the through the winter
period<00:01:24.140> these<00:01:25.140> roots<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.650> gone<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:29.630> they've

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
period these roots have gone in they've

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
period these roots have gone in they've
very<00:01:31.500> very<00:01:31.770> well<00:01:31.979> anchored<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.340> couple<00:01:32.729> those

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
very very well anchored a couple those

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.929 
very very well anchored a couple those
out<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:35.250> we've<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:35.880> we've

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
out at all and and what we've what we've

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.109 
out at all and and what we've what we've
done<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.329> we've<00:01:36.450> actually<00:01:36.600> Cambridge<00:01:37.500> rolled

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
done is we've actually Cambridge rolled

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.630 
done is we've actually Cambridge rolled
the<00:01:39.119> field<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:40.229> 90<00:01:40.619> degrees<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.220> way<00:01:41.430> we're

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the field at 90 degrees to the way we're

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.280 
the field at 90 degrees to the way we're
going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> plant<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.610> plan<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
going to plant it and the plan is to

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
going to plant it and the plan is to
plant<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> cross<00:01:46.890> lot<00:01:47.100> drill<00:01:47.509> which

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
plant it with the cross lot drill which

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.280 
plant it with the cross lot drill which
will<00:01:48.720> hopefully<00:01:49.159> dissect<00:01:50.159> these<00:01:51.290> 12-foot

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
will hopefully dissect these 12-foot

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.270 
will hopefully dissect these 12-foot
long<00:01:52.530> stalks<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.369> plants<00:01:53.820> into<00:01:54.890> little<00:01:55.890> short

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
long stalks and plants into little short

long stalks and plants into little short
eight<00:01:56.549> inch<00:01:56.880> segments<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.719> haven't<00:01:57.990> put<00:01:58.110> any

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
eight inch segments we haven't put any

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.749 
eight inch segments we haven't put any
glyphosate<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> yet<00:01:59.960> I<00:02:01.369> think<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.490> probably

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
glyphosate on it yet I think we probably

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.609 
glyphosate on it yet I think we probably
will<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> pre-emergence<00:02:04.020> herbicide<00:02:04.500> on

will with the pre-emergence herbicide on

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.399 
will with the pre-emergence herbicide on
the<00:02:04.740> pins<00:02:04.979> which<00:02:05.969> I'm<00:02:06.180> slightly

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the pins which I'm slightly

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.080 
the pins which I'm slightly
in<00:02:07.890> two<00:02:08.160> minds<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> whether<00:02:08.850> we<00:02:08.940> actually

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
in two minds as to whether we actually

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.199 
in two minds as to whether we actually
need<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.600> do<00:02:10.340> bearing<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.430> mind<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.030> weed

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
need to do bearing in mind that the weed

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.760 
need to do bearing in mind that the weed
seeds<00:02:12.540> will<00:02:12.720> only<00:02:12.840> germinate<00:02:13.350> either<00:02:13.530> when
