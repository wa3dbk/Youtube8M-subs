00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.269
 that is the path a simple but 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.559
 really successful concept since 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.000
 last year where we got the concept 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.160
 we have a lot of people 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.029
 boats are selling this boat we call it 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.769
 sailboat is also here 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:24.380
 but let me tell you the feeling of one 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:26.360
 Keep kibbutz and the simple 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.119
 concept one takes something extreme 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.039
 successful and sexy is a 400 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.440
 currently the most successful super 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.719
 regatta became the world cup series and 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.120
 made it in seven meters so 23 feet 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.190
 It is very important to us that we do this 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.289
 bring boats to the clubs 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.120
 give young people the opportunity to 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.460
 to sail such a boat especially the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.079
 people may enter the target group 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.460
 Little lost the contact for sailing 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.159
 to have a nice light again 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.659
 sportive entry and are 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.209
 now also very excited about that 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.370
 our cooperation with the company of 

00:00:56.209 --> 00:01:01.010
