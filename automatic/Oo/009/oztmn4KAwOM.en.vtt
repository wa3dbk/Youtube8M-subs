 part of the login image and 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.199
 that these two parties are still here 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.910
 only in this location do we see that 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.259

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.229
 everything has changed we see that we have a 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.430
 new login screen in 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:00.110
 windows 10 in this new build called 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.960
 9926 then this is what I wanted them 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.120
 comment we see that the login 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.039
 it's different, it's located once we put 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.229
 in the password is located to that part 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.449
 left to login our 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.220
 windows 10 and then it's a login 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.520
 a little more stylish a little more 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.800
 visual for users this what 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.960
 we wanted to show you today in jg there you 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.460
 test in this video you know they can 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.740
 change again without 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.509
 problem what would this screen be if 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.889
 they did not like it, they can go back 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.680
 again to modify the password 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.840
 record and leave the value in 0 that 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.030
 I told them test force to be able 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.039
 go back to the old one if you have not 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.509
 It seemed interesting but it's very 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.699
 important because this one we're going to 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.220
 see in future versions in windows are 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.259
 issues that are are hidden in this 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.349
 new operating system and let's go 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.270
 pulling out as we go scrutinizing 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.130
 and we are checking what are these 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.990
 hidden options that we have in our 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.550
 windows 10 then I hope it's them 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.830
 very helpful , you know, do not forget
