00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
seconds as you know Ekans backwards

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.350 
seconds as you know Ekans backwards
spelled<00:01:59.170> backwards<00:01:59.619> and<00:01:59.800> snake<00:02:00.130> did<00:02:01.030> not<00:02:01.180> know

spelled backwards and snake did not know

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.240 
spelled backwards and snake did not know
then<00:02:01.660> you<00:02:01.810> probably<00:02:02.050> are<00:02:02.320> not<00:02:02.350> up<00:02:02.650> up<00:02:02.770> one<00:02:02.979> fan

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
then you probably are not up up one fan

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.969 
then you probably are not up up one fan
and<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.240> just<00:02:04.509> stumbled<00:02:04.720> on<00:02:05.080> this<00:02:05.290> video<00:02:05.649> or

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
no reason we drive evolution solution

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.890 
no reason we drive evolution solution
sure<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.399> guess<00:02:12.030> man<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.239> battle<00:02:13.540> took<00:02:13.720> some

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
sure I guess man that battle took some

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.190 
sure I guess man that battle took some
time<00:02:14.080> actually<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.850> let's<00:02:16.480> go<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.720> think<00:02:17.080> your
