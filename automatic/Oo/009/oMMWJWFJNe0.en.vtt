00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
guys welcome to another tutorial and in

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.740 
guys welcome to another tutorial and in
this<00:00:02.159> tutorial<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.790> will<00:00:02.850> show<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.179> how<00:00:03.419> I<00:00:03.449> did

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
this tutorial I will show you how I did

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.879 
this tutorial I will show you how I did
this<00:00:04.080> video<00:00:04.440> right<00:00:04.620> here<00:00:09.740> there<00:00:10.740> were<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
this video right here there were a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.600 
this video right here there were a
couple<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.370> guys<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.610> want<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.210> tutorial<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:12.929> I

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
couple of guys that want a tutorial so I

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.050 
couple of guys that want a tutorial so I
said<00:00:14.610> yeah<00:00:15.240> let's<00:00:15.480> make<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.770> yeah<00:00:17.609> so

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
said yeah let's make one here yeah so

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.960 
said yeah let's make one here yeah so
yeah<00:00:18.840> let's<00:00:19.529> get<00:00:19.680> started<00:00:19.800> open<00:00:20.609> up<00:00:20.880> your

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
yeah let's get started open up your

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.269 
yeah let's get started open up your
cinema<00:00:21.300> 4d<00:00:27.380> let's<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.650> take<00:00:28.859> render

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
cinema 4d let's just take render

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.500 
cinema 4d let's just take render
settings<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.939> Full<00:00:30.660> HD<00:00:31.700> 1920<00:00:32.700> by<00:00:33.620> 1080<00:00:35.510> just

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
settings to Full HD 1920 by 1080 just

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.270 
settings to Full HD 1920 by 1080 just
like<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.879> then<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.750> ahead<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.460> make<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.670> floor

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
like so then go ahead and make a floor

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.139 
like so then go ahead and make a floor
here<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:46.160> just<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:47.910> go

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
here we have it just like so and then go

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.130 
here we have it just like so and then go
to<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:49.379> simulation<00:00:49.950> tab<00:00:50.690> dynamics<00:00:51.690> create

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
to the simulation tab dynamics create

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.400 
to the simulation tab dynamics create
Collider<00:00:53.360> now<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.719> will<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.379> will

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
Collider now what this will do it will

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950 
Collider now what this will do it will
say<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> ground<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.660> where

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
say this is the ground this is where

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.910 
say this is the ground this is where
I'll<00:00:58.109> stop<00:00:58.500> bouncing<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.230> then<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.469> ahead<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
I'll stop bouncing so then go ahead and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.039 
I'll stop bouncing so then go ahead and
create<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.789> sphere<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.020> make<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
create a sphere just like so make it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.170 
create a sphere just like so make it
which<00:01:07.380> size<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.400> doesn't<00:01:09.060> really

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
which size you want it doesn't really

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.039 
which size you want it doesn't really
matter<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.880> then<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:12.270> ahead<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.450> into

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
matter and then go ahead and into

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.260 
matter and then go ahead and into
simulation<00:01:13.229> tab<00:01:13.710> again<00:01:13.909> dynamics<00:01:14.909> create

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
simulation tab again dynamics create

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.800 
simulation tab again dynamics create
rigidbody<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.299> will

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
rigidbody now what this will do it will

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.749 
rigidbody now what this will do it will
make<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.229> fall<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> go<00:01:20.460> ahead<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
make it fall now if you go ahead and

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.590 
make it fall now if you go ahead and
play<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.880> falls<00:01:24.180> right

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
play this as you can see it falls right

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.999 
play this as you can see it falls right
to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> ground<00:01:27.020> but<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.560> want<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.890> be

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to the ground but we don't want to be

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.999 
to the ground but we don't want to be
like<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.610> wanted<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> bounce<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.380> select

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
like that we wanted to bounce so select

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.819 
like that we wanted to bounce so select
the<00:01:32.159> rigidbody<00:01:32.549> tag<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.990> scroll

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the rigidbody tag right here and scroll

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.310 
the rigidbody tag right here and scroll
down<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.420> will<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.630> bounce

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
down and here you will see bounce

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.280 
down and here you will see bounce
friction<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:39.000> let's<00:01:39.509> take<00:01:39.720> bounce<00:01:39.990> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
friction now let's take bounce to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.719 
friction now let's take bounce to
something<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:41.450> 125<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.990> friction<00:01:43.670> 260<00:01:44.670> or

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
something like 125 and friction 260 or

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.840 
something like 125 and friction 260 or
something<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.450> let's<00:01:45.600> see<00:01:45.990> how<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.100> now

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
something so let's see how this is now

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.380 
something so let's see how this is now
it's<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> bit<00:01:49.110> more<00:01:49.470> bouncing<00:01:50.070> then<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.329> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's like a bit more bouncing then go to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.780 
it's like a bit more bouncing then go to
floor<00:01:52.170> tag<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> same<00:01:54.119> thing<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.689> about

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
floor tag and do the same thing to about

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.859 
floor tag and do the same thing to about
115<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:58.280> 102<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.880> looks<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.180> now

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
115 and 102 see what it looks like now

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.310 
115 and 102 see what it looks like now
it's<00:02:01.049> bouncing<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.280> no<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.000> much

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
it's bouncing it up so no not that much

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.460 
it's bouncing it up so no not that much
go<00:02:04.320> ahead<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.009> take<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> about<00:02:05.549> 70

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.929 

it's<00:02:09.470> still<00:02:09.709> bouncing<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.489> can<00:02:10.640> go<00:02:10.700> ahead<00:02:10.849> and

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
it's still bouncing you can go ahead and

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.960 
it's still bouncing you can go ahead and
play<00:02:11.120> around<00:02:11.360> with<00:02:11.599> this<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.700> just<00:02:13.700> make<00:02:13.939> it

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
play around with this and just make it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.080 
play around with this and just make it
whatever<00:02:14.599> you<00:02:14.930> think<00:02:15.620> looks<00:02:15.709> nice<00:02:16.129> so<00:02:16.430> there

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
whatever you think looks nice so there

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.440 
whatever you think looks nice so there
you<00:02:17.180> go

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
you go

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.559 
you go
here<00:02:17.599> we<00:02:17.720> have<00:02:17.870> some<00:02:18.230> good<00:02:18.500> bouncing<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:20.360> this

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
here we have some good bouncing in this

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.240 
here we have some good bouncing in this
story<00:02:20.780> all<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.019> have<00:02:21.170> just<00:02:21.409> like<00:02:21.590> two<00:02:21.860> bounds

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
story all we have just like two bounds

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.839 
story all we have just like two bounds
because<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:23.120> know<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:23.989> will<00:02:24.140> get<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.439> point

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
because you know it will get the point

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.009 
because you know it will get the point
now<00:02:25.849> what<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.120> want<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.329> do<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.629> go<00:02:26.810> ahead<00:02:26.900> and

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
now what you want to do is go ahead and

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.569 
now what you want to do is go ahead and
create<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.409> material<00:02:27.890> there<00:02:28.129> are<00:02:28.159> actually

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
create the material there are actually

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.270 
create the material there are actually
two<00:02:28.790> ways<00:02:29.030> how<00:02:29.659> you<00:02:29.689> can<00:02:29.840> do<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.769> color

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
two ways how you can do the color

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.960 
two ways how you can do the color
material<00:02:31.909> that<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.450> did<00:02:32.689> the<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:34.310> way<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.489> did<00:02:34.849> it

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
material that I did the the way I did it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.280 
material that I did the the way I did it
is<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.420> want<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:36.200> color<00:02:37.569> pick<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.780> color<00:02:38.989> you

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
is I want to color pick the color you

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.819 
is I want to color pick the color you
want<00:02:39.439> like<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.670> go<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.150> texture<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.019> choose

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
want like so go to texture and choose

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.520 
want like so go to texture and choose
gradient<00:02:43.720> click<00:02:44.720> on<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:45.019> gradient<00:02:45.319> right

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
gradient click on this gradient right

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.289 
gradient click on this gradient right
here<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.609> type<00:02:46.909> should<00:02:47.239> be<00:02:47.299> 2d<00:02:48.079> V<00:02:48.530> and

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
here and the type should be 2d V and

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.280 
here and the type should be 2d V and
then<00:02:50.829> let's<00:02:51.829> just<00:02:52.220> play<00:02:52.489> around<00:02:52.639> with<00:02:52.909> these

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:05.619 

just<00:02:57.290> like<00:02:57.530> so<00:03:02.409> don't<00:03:03.409> create<00:03:03.829> another<00:03:04.280> one<00:03:04.629> it

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
just like so don't create another one it

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.539 
just like so don't create another one it
should<00:03:05.810> be<00:03:05.889> black<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:09.069> create<00:03:10.069> another<00:03:10.310> one

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
should be black and create another one

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:17.140 
should be black and create another one
that<00:03:10.730> will<00:03:11.420> be<00:03:11.629> white<00:03:14.319> just<00:03:15.319> like<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.150> let's

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that will be white just like so let's

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.869 
that will be white just like so let's
make<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:21.099> you<00:03:22.099> can<00:03:22.250> go<00:03:22.370> ahead<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.669> play

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
make this you can go ahead and play

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.449 
make this you can go ahead and play
around<00:03:22.970> with<00:03:23.180> these<00:03:23.359> two<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.859> just<00:03:24.859> take

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
around with these two and just take

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.909 
around with these two and just take
whatever<00:03:25.669> you<00:03:25.970> think<00:03:26.329> looks<00:03:26.389> nice<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.109> there

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
whatever you think looks nice so there

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.439 
whatever you think looks nice so there
you<00:03:27.980> go<00:03:28.129> we<00:03:28.370> can<00:03:28.519> take<00:03:28.699> this<00:03:28.940> all<00:03:29.209> right<00:03:30.280> so

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
you go we can take this all right so

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.539 
you go we can take this all right so
then<00:03:32.449> go<00:03:33.079> ahead<00:03:33.169> and<00:03:33.440> instead<00:03:34.099> of<00:03:34.250> white

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
then go ahead and instead of white

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.189 
then go ahead and instead of white
choose<00:03:34.940> which<00:03:35.150> color<00:03:35.389> you<00:03:35.540> want<00:03:35.810> let's<00:03:35.989> take

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
choose which color you want let's take

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.920 
choose which color you want let's take
like<00:03:36.409> blue<00:03:36.769> so<00:03:37.699> here<00:03:37.940> we'll<00:03:38.090> take<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.299> darker

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
like blue so here we'll take a darker

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.039 
like blue so here we'll take a darker
blue<00:03:39.139> and<00:03:39.409> here<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.720> bit<00:03:41.720> lighter<00:03:43.599> just<00:03:44.599> like<00:03:44.870> so

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
blue and here a bit lighter just like so

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.969 
blue and here a bit lighter just like so
so<00:03:45.199> here<00:03:45.379> we<00:03:45.500> have<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.650> nice<00:03:45.859> gradient<00:03:46.479> then

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:47.979 
so here we have a nice gradient then

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.890 
so here we have a nice gradient then
choose<00:03:48.979> reflection<00:03:49.549> if<00:03:49.669> you<00:03:49.760> want<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.180> v

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
choose reflection if you want to v

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.500 
choose reflection if you want to v
texture<00:03:51.590> for<00:03:52.099> now<00:03:54.699> 35<00:03:55.699> or<00:03:55.940> something

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
texture for now 35 or something

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.300 
texture for now 35 or something
specular<00:03:57.790> with<00:03:58.790> 8<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.840> height<00:04:00.229> like<00:04:00.709> 88<00:04:01.220> or

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
specular with 8 and height like 88 or

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.869 
specular with 8 and height like 88 or
something<00:04:01.909> and<00:04:02.769> then<00:04:03.769> apply<00:04:04.340> this<00:04:04.400> material

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
something and then apply this material

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.050 
something and then apply this material
to<00:04:05.419> this<00:04:05.569> sphere<00:04:06.010> now<00:04:07.010> this<00:04:07.340> looks<00:04:07.760> pretty

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
to this sphere now this looks pretty

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.119 
to this sphere now this looks pretty
good<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.479> know<00:04:08.510> we<00:04:08.750> have<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.930> material<00:04:09.109> and<00:04:09.799> if

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
good you know we have a material and if

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.759 
good you know we have a material and if
you<00:04:10.220> go<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.609> play<00:04:10.849> it<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.239> will<00:04:11.419> bounce<00:04:11.690> but<00:04:12.590> we

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
you go and play it it will bounce but we

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.349 
you go and play it it will bounce but we
want<00:04:12.949> it<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.099> change<00:04:13.190> color<00:04:13.519> whenever<00:04:14.060> it

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
want it to change color whenever it

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.319 
want it to change color whenever it
bounced<00:04:14.680> so<00:04:15.680> now<00:04:15.919> go<00:04:16.579> ahead<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:16.880> choose<00:04:17.060> this

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
bounced so now go ahead and choose this

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.920 
bounced so now go ahead and choose this
sphere<00:04:17.840> rigid<00:04:18.380> body<00:04:18.590> tag<00:04:18.919> right<00:04:19.190> here<00:04:19.870> go<00:04:20.870> to

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
sphere rigid body tag right here go to

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.210 
sphere rigid body tag right here go to
this<00:04:21.229> tab<00:04:21.500> right<00:04:21.709> here

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
this tab right here

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.510 
this tab right here
and<00:04:22.580> click<00:04:23.210> on<00:04:23.360> bake<00:04:23.870> now<00:04:24.440> what<00:04:24.860> this<00:04:25.070> will<00:04:25.130> do

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
and click on bake now what this will do

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.640 
and click on bake now what this will do
as<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.330> can<00:04:26.420> see<00:04:26.570> if<00:04:26.630> we<00:04:26.690> take<00:04:26.780> this<00:04:27.170> and<00:04:27.470> like

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
as you can see if we take this and like

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.640 
as you can see if we take this and like
scroll<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:29.090> sphere<00:04:29.390> will<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:30.080> know<00:04:30.230> fall

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
scroll it the sphere will you know fall

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.460 
scroll it the sphere will you know fall
down<00:04:30.920> whenever<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.610> scroll<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.030> up<00:04:32.330> but<00:04:33.290> when

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
down whenever you scroll it up but when

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.640 
down whenever you scroll it up but when
scrolled<00:04:33.710> back<00:04:33.980> it<00:04:34.610> won't<00:04:34.880> do<00:04:35.090> anything<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:36.320> if

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
scrolled back it won't do anything so if

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.190 
scrolled back it won't do anything so if
you<00:04:36.770> click<00:04:36.980> on<00:04:37.130> bake<00:04:37.460> it<00:04:38.090> will<00:04:38.390> save<00:04:38.870> the

you click on bake it will save the

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.360 
you click on bake it will save the
animation<00:04:39.830> so<00:04:40.340> we<00:04:40.430> go<00:04:40.550> in<00:04:40.640> and<00:04:40.730> play<00:04:40.940> it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
animation so we go in and play it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.720 
animation so we go in and play it
forward<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:44.300> play<00:04:44.630> backwards<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:46.370> know<00:04:46.490> it's

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
forward and play backwards you know it's

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.210 
forward and play backwards you know it's
bouncing<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:47.960> that<00:04:48.410> way<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.710> will<00:04:48.860> be<00:04:49.010> much

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
bouncing so that way it will be much

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.790 
bouncing so that way it will be much
easier<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.730> do<00:04:49.960> when<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.140> change<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.620> color

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
easier to do when you change the color

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.190 
easier to do when you change the color
so<00:04:52.430> go<00:04:52.610> ahead<00:04:52.700> and<00:04:52.970> choose<00:04:53.090> front<00:04:53.660> camera

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
so go ahead and choose front camera

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.220 
so go ahead and choose front camera
right<00:04:54.410> here<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.060> let's<00:04:56.060> find<00:04:56.390> the<00:04:56.660> way<00:04:56.840> when

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
right here and let's find the way when

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.400 
right here and let's find the way when
it<00:04:57.380> bounced<00:04:57.680> right<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.310> ground<00:04:59.380> there

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
it bounced right to the ground there

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.130 
it bounced right to the ground there
this<00:05:00.890> looks<00:05:01.100> pretty<00:05:01.280> fine<00:05:01.580> then<00:05:02.480> double<00:05:03.080> click

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
this looks pretty fine then double click

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.820 
this looks pretty fine then double click
on<00:05:03.320> this<00:05:03.470> material<00:05:04.570> choose<00:05:05.570> gradient<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:08.830> as

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
on this material choose gradient and as

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
now what this will do it will create a

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.350 
now what this will do it will create a
keyframe<00:05:18.770> so<00:05:19.280> let's<00:05:19.850> move<00:05:20.060> it

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
keyframe so let's move it

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.710 
keyframe so let's move it
one<00:05:20.600> frame<00:05:20.960> forward<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:22.300> select<00:05:23.300> which<00:05:23.480> color

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
one frame forward and select which color

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.430 
one frame forward and select which color
you<00:05:23.810> want

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
you want

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:33.360 
you want
let's<00:05:24.890> take<00:05:25.160> like<00:05:26.860> yellow<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:30.070> here<00:05:31.070> oops

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
let's take like yellow and here oops

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.880 
let's take like yellow and here oops
and<00:05:34.690> here<00:05:35.690> a<00:05:35.900> bit<00:05:36.490> orange<00:05:37.490> or<00:05:37.670> something<00:05:38.060> and

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
and here a bit orange or something and

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.010 
and here a bit orange or something and
then<00:05:39.890> hold<00:05:40.370> ctrl<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:41.030> click<00:05:41.180> this<00:05:41.300> box<00:05:41.630> again

then hold ctrl and click this box again

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.530 
then hold ctrl and click this box again
so<00:05:42.560> now<00:05:42.740> if<00:05:43.040> we<00:05:43.070> go<00:05:43.220> back<00:05:43.370> to<00:05:43.580> our<00:05:43.850> perspective

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
so now if we go back to our perspective

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.830 
so now if we go back to our perspective
view<00:05:44.570> as<00:05:45.730> you<00:05:46.730> can<00:05:46.850> see<00:05:47.000> whenever<00:05:47.270> we<00:05:47.570> play

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
view as you can see whenever we play

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.430 
view as you can see whenever we play
this<00:05:48.140> when<00:05:48.890> it<00:05:49.010> bounced<00:05:49.220> to<00:05:49.430> change<00:05:49.670> the<00:05:49.820> color

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
this when it bounced to change the color

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.600 
this when it bounced to change the color
so<00:05:51.440> actually<00:05:51.800> this<00:05:51.890> is<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.100> way<00:05:52.190> I<00:05:52.220> did<00:05:52.430> the

whole video so let's go ahead and do it
on<00:05:55.730> other<00:05:55.940> bounce<00:05:56.240> too<00:05:57.160> so<00:05:58.160> same<00:05:58.730> thing<00:05:58.760> again

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
on other bounce too so same thing again

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.550

go to front view this is the frame wait

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.900 
go to front view this is the frame wait
oh<00:06:05.950> right<00:06:06.950> here<00:06:07.130> is<00:06:07.250> the<00:06:07.370> frame<00:06:07.550> would<00:06:07.700> touch
