00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
you a quick video of my Filofax doodle

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.310 
you a quick video of my Filofax doodle
and<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:09.780> here<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.700> and<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.059> my<00:00:12.240> design

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.900 

so<00:00:16.320> I've<00:00:16.440> started<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> bit<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.369> color<00:00:17.609> at

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
so I've started with a bit of color at

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.689 
so I've started with a bit of color at
the<00:00:18.270> corner<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.890> thought<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.430> it

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the corner and but I thought that it

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.060 
the corner and but I thought that it
looked<00:00:21.060> better<00:00:21.359> black<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.109> white<00:00:28.070> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
looked better black and white and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.679 
looked better black and white and
obviously<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.640> need<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.029> still<00:00:30.269> complete<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
obviously I need to still complete the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:39.889 
obviously I need to still complete the

pen holder so Dean what does but it
comes<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.890> parallel<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.520> mean

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
comes like this and the parallel I mean

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.950 
comes like this and the parallel I mean
thing<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:03.049> 92<00:01:04.049> million<00:01:04.260> 10<00:01:05.090> 5.6<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.390> medium

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
thing is the 92 million 10 5.6 in medium

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.410 
thing is the 92 million 10 5.6 in medium
and<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> special<00:01:09.659> drawing<00:01:10.650> pen<00:01:11.420> and

and that is a special drawing pen and
then<00:01:12.750> here's<00:01:12.990> another<00:01:13.200> design<00:01:13.650> loaded<00:01:14.540> and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
then here's another design loaded and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.760 
then here's another design loaded and
then<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.229> got<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.750> tabs<00:01:18.750> which<00:01:19.350> say<00:01:20.540> brief

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770
