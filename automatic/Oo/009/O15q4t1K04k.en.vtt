 death that he heard with great sorrow and 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.390
 impressed with my story and with the

 fears that he harbored because of the presence of 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.430
 wolves in the vicinity proposed me 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.890
 leave the field and go to the

 that we would find good shelter and 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.050
 great means of subsistence to which

 a few minutes later a dog feels 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.750
 work very energetically with that bark 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.630
 typical that fans define 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.729
 saying that the TV stop and 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.040
 then a well-marked rumble 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.290
 in the forest as if it were trampling 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.240
 of gunpowder to encourage the dogs and 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.259
 contribute to the network not becoming and
