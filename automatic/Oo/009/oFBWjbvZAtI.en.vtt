agreed<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.639> sign<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.719> protocol<00:05:28.680> which

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
agreed to sign the the protocol which

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.290 
agreed to sign the the protocol which
became<00:05:29.219> known<00:05:29.280> as<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.580> harken<00:05:29.969> angle

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
became known as the harken angle

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.689 
became known as the harken angle
protocol<00:05:30.870> but<00:05:31.259> they<00:05:31.409> do<00:05:32.190> you<00:05:32.310> think<00:05:32.550> now<00:05:32.669> that

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
protocol but they do you think now that

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.870 
protocol but they do you think now that
they<00:05:32.969> probably<00:05:33.360> agreed<00:05:33.780> to<00:05:34.020> just<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:34.979> get<00:05:35.789> it

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
they probably agreed to just to get it

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.629 
they probably agreed to just to get it
out<00:05:36.000> of<00:05:36.029> the<00:05:36.210> way<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:36.630> then<00:05:36.750> move<00:05:37.520> operate<00:05:38.520> the

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
out of the way and then move operate the

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.370 
out of the way and then move operate the
same<00:05:38.789> way<00:05:38.849> they<00:05:39.060> always<00:05:39.300> did<00:05:39.509> well<00:05:39.990> they<00:05:40.229> of

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380
