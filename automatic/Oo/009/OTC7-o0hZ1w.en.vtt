picture<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.260> obviously<00:00:50.300> this<00:00:51.300> could<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.899> um

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
picture and obviously this could be um

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that collects shoes but um I don't think

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.950 
that collects shoes but um I don't think
he'd<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:59.039> size<00:00:59.579> four<00:01:00.059> when<00:01:00.480> he's<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> size

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
he'd have a size four when he's a size

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.560 
he'd have a size four when he's a size
10<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.559> 11<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.699> want<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> make<00:01:03.059> sense<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
10 or 11 it just want to make sense and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.260 
10 or 11 it just want to make sense and
to<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.949> for<00:01:04.949> example<00:01:05.040> look<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.790> size<00:01:06.000> 10

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
to have for example look at the size 10

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.210 
to have for example look at the size 10
he<00:01:06.420> has<00:01:06.540> six<00:01:06.840> available<00:01:07.110> three<00:01:07.740> sold<00:01:08.040> already

mean in this picture I don't this could
definitely<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> different<00:01:52.170> box<00:01:52.350> but

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
definitely just be a different box but

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
definitely just be a different box but
I'm<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.250> looking<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.390> maybe<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
I'm just looking at it as if it maybe it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
I'm just looking at it as if it maybe it
could<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.829> got<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> shipment<00:01:56.549> in

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
could be he just got the shipment in

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.160 
could be he just got the shipment in
from<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.329> Nike<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:57.750> something<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.079> that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
on and on and now we're kind of going

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.830 
on and on and now we're kind of going
down<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.430> like<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.790> shoes<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.209> he<00:03:04.540> just<00:03:04.690> has

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
down to like the shoes that he just has

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.920 
down to like the shoes that he just has
like<00:03:04.870> one<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.610> I'm<00:03:06.700> guessing<00:03:06.880> nine<00:03:07.360> nine

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
like one of so I'm guessing nine nine

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.800 
like one of so I'm guessing nine nine
and<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.080> half<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.950> his<00:03:09.549> shoe<00:03:10.060> size<00:03:10.180> cuz<00:03:10.660> he<00:03:10.780> has

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
and a half is a his shoe size cuz he has

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.910 
and a half is a his shoe size cuz he has
a<00:03:10.900> lot<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.140> nine<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.769> half<00:03:11.799> stems<00:03:12.370> um<00:03:13.019> or<00:03:14.019> as

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
a lot of nine and a half stems um or as

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.500 
a lot of nine and a half stems um or as
you<00:03:15.160> can<00:03:15.280> see<00:03:15.430> he<00:03:15.609> has<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> lot<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.060> those<00:03:16.269> shoes

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
you can see he has a lot of those shoes

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.240 
you can see he has a lot of those shoes
so<00:03:16.720> I'm<00:03:16.780> guessing<00:03:16.989> he<00:03:17.230> fits<00:03:17.470> into<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.920> range

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
so I'm guessing he fits into that range

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.380 
so I'm guessing he fits into that range
of<00:03:19.150> shoes<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.730> what<00:03:21.850> do<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:21.970> guys<00:03:22.060> think<00:03:22.120> about

of shoes so what do you guys think about

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.569 
of shoes so what do you guys think about
this<00:03:22.690> do<00:03:23.410> disagree<00:03:23.709> with<00:03:23.950> this<00:03:24.070> do<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.489> agree

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
this do disagree with this do you agree

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.520 
this do disagree with this do you agree
with<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.269> like<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.600> perk<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.989> working<00:03:26.049> for
