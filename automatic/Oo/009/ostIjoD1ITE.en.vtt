00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.179
 this time we have the reviews of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.179
 alcatel export 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.779
 al Khater showed in the past his 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.850
 armament devices that will be 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.250
 distributing throughout 2013 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.050
 alcatel aims to be one of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.809
 the best manufacturers has started it 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.790
 well with your pop line basically these 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.680
 They have a good hardware devices to 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.540
 a price too tight what 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.000
 would lead to being sales top these 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.699
 devices on this occasion we have the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.829
 team 50 35 a device that barely 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.600
 achieves scratch the low-medium range in in 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.280
 as to specifications because in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.079
 reality is a team that achieves very well 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.089
 its purpose 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.070
 going into detail with the physical aspect 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.619
 of the construction material is plastic 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.439
 but with different textures ahead 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.580
 from behind as well as the sides 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.259
 starting from the front we have the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.930
 4.5 inch wide screen 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.850
 covered by dragon retail which is a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.130
 type of scratch-resistant cover but not 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.120
 manages to grant greater durability than a 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.100
 corning gorilla glass 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.260
 at the top we have a small 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.080
 gea quality camera as well as the 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.670
 Proximity sensors and lighting in 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.130
 the bottom part the three are observed 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.920
 typical capacitive buttons on android 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.350
 ice cream sandwich the sides are 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.870
 quite clean down there is only the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.490
 microusb entrance on the sides are 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.500
 the volume buttons and in the part 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.410
 top is the headphone jack 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.210
 standard 3.5 as well as the button 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.730
 lit on the back 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.400
 we found a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.930
 with flash led 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.460
 Alcatel has given us a big surprise the 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.130
 team is able to start in 6 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.780
 seconds to be used immediately for 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.670
 talk about the operating system we have to 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.730
 talk about hardware in your guts has 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.030
 a dual-core mediatek 65-77 processor 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.580
 running a gigahertz accompanied by 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.320
 512 megabytes of ram what will give 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.390
 as a result small lax in the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.490
 user interface however the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.360
 experience will not be seen totally 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.880
 Depleted by hardware 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.980
 the team bring manufactures android ice 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.780
 cream sanwich 4.0 to the layer of 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.430
 customization that Alcatel chose is not 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.350
 very intrusive in the bar 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.330
 notifications we find icons of 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.510
 shortcut for bluetooth wifi 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.430
 3g data gps rotation and profiles 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.370
 called on the other hand the applications 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.440
 that brings these are pretty clean at 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.540
 Android 4.0 kernel which is 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.430
 thanks a lot for saving ram 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.980
 As for the internal memory, it has 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.629
 for the user to 1.2 gigabytes so 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.150
 that we will have to choose cards 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.579
 microsd up to 32gb to mention 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.060
 our videos movies movies and 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.060
 other files 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.080
 The display is 4.5 inches resolution 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.940
 qhd 960 x 540 pixels this type 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.640
 5-point multi-touch capacitive 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.200
 It also incorporates a dragon protection 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.050
 retail that gives us a bit of 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.420
 durability 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.640
 the screen responds quite well and in 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.090
 no moment denoted suspender surprise 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.090
 in the display 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.770
 the 5 megapixel camera donates videos to 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.720
 640 p with a quality that leaves a lot 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.790
 wish in dark places the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.650
 photographs taken with the flash are 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.990
 decent and fulfill their role for the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.670
 target audience we know that in 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.260
 mexico we love uploading photos in 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.760
 social networks so we can 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.220
 edit them from your smartphone 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.600
 to upload them either on facebook twitter 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.820
 instagram 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.680
 etcetera the photographs taken in 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.850
 interiors have much more quality 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.850
 leaving a good taste 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.910
 This equipment is made for 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.130
 beginners of intermediate users 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.470
 who want an agile smartphone but without 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.240
 be expensive the games run so 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.380
 nice although I've noticed that there 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.690
 some as new that costs 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.700
 I work however for most of 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.250
 casual games do their job 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.050
 as for the web experience the truth 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.470
 do not expect great miracles it costs you 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.690
 I work by scrolling and tim your zoom the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.209
 camera is pretty standard and does not have 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.830
 extras but as I had repeated this 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.420
 Equipment is for beginners and users 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.380
 who like to take casual photographs 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.330
 for social networks 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.980
 something that I did not like anything about this 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.810
 team is oscar we close with your 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.240
 smartphone of its category already opt for 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.890
 a giga of rom memory needed for 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.810
 move android in a fluid way and without 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.730
 jams when we open more than three 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.470
 restarts applications in processes 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.870
 which causes us to lose time to 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.490
 have to restart the activity in the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.740
 that stays in the background 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.300
 I liked this team in general because 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.910
 It has a very affordable price for 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.410
 medium-low range however not all that 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.720
 the user interface is diminished 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.310
 due to the rom that chose alcatel 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.680
 however I also notice that the plastic 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.979
 It is very fragile and can be susceptible to 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.030
 lean when falling from very low height 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.490
 well that's all for now 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.590
 we appreciate having been tuning 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.310
 this new analysis of the alcatel one 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.729
 touch 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.310
 export follow us and remember to give me 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.520
