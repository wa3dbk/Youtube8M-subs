00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.099
 all beaver dear friends very often in 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.920
 to as well as in the comments they ask me 

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:08.220
 tell about two incomprehensible vonhwa fnaf 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.680
 3 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.019
 Firstly, these are sparkles about which I still 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.820
 telling considering trailer there 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.070
 was also his drawing but in bad 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.230
 quality and now he is in his office 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.510
 You can also look more closely 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.460
 asked to clarify the disappearance of the mask 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.830
 puppets at the entrance of springtrap in 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
 the eighth room since with the mask all 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.180
 quite simply and not i will tell in 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.279
 the end of the video and we start with Sparky 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.199
 First, yes briefly, remember that Sparky 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.050
 This is a fake animatronic who was 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.969
 first created during the time of fnaf1 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 and created it was so good 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.679
 qualities that he immediately liked many 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.199
 and there was a lot of controversy over that 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.569
 real or not, but it turned out 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.239
 that it is fake but it is possible that Scott decided 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:54.209
 add a little easter egg in honor 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.889
 this animatronic here he is handsome 

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:58.649
 the main question is that 

00:00:55.889 --> 00:01:01.170
 is it a drawing with a dog or is it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.269
 actually foxy well let's 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.060
 we will understand generally speaking on a dog 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.580
 It seems especially paunch if you look at 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.860
 Foxy then you can see that he is usually jerky at that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.280
 while with the park I will call for now 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.070
 him so 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.410
 It is not a weak tum, although 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.290
 maybe it's actually shorts 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.720
 but I tend to go further we 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.880
 we see a hook on his hand and I 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.790
 specially checked hook is on 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.380
 same hand as foxy on the right is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.380
 plus x money box what's really 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.750
 a foxy painted is possible that Sparky is similar 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.790
 by design with it and are peculiar 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.190
 foxy with a substitute or something like 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.650
 that is if foxy is suddenly broken 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.260
 then with the park fulfills its function 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.450
 look further clearly visible spot on 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.030
 his eye here she is me the most 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.490
 confused because it is obvious that the stain 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.980
 there is and she left with y foxy 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.170
 there is no such thing in the eye but there is 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.330
 on the right eye from the same side that their 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.240
 the hatch there is a bandage that closes 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.310
 eye usually 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.829
 unfortunately we do not see what's going on 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.960
 suspect sparky right maybe 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.759
 that just drawing from the child decided 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.190
 draw from noodle and here's such 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.590
 the pattern around the eye is for sure 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.230
 can not speak but we are judged by the facts 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.920
 so before the debate, plus a park 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.050
 because the whole forest line has 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.300
 armband and it is on the right with the same 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.150
 sides as the hook at the same time with 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.550
 the left side is no pattern and no on 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.890
 drawing is and continue to reversible 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.680
 attention to sticking out of your mouth 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.630
 more precisely on his absence the fact is that 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.450
 on fakie which depicted our 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.000
 dogs had a tongue sticking out of his mouth usually 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.030
 so do the dogs but in the picture on 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.100
 there is no wall of it though I see it 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.850
 like a certain business card of ours 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.010
 dogs 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.080
 so in theory if it were in the park 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.180
 then there was a language but it's just 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.250
 the assumption therefore it is not a minus in his 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.780
 box also look at the teeth 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.239
 our suspect 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.910
 he has four teeth on top and 2 on the bottom 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.260
 such clicks are peculiar to dogs but 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.870
 our foxy series 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.720
 teeth anymore they are almost continuous 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.519
 flow in the mouth but the children drew 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.799
 It is possible that drawing from a child 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.230
 just scored on the remaining teeth decided not 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.810
 to draw well, still worth mentioning 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.170
 head shape similar oblong 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.570
 the form is also peculiar to dogs however 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.630
 and for the sheet, the situation is the same. 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.209
 drying ears are similar to those of our 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.220
 scaffolding nothing to say for sure in this theory 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.530
 I will not, however, personally I was 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.660
 not enough facts to say that 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.420
 This Sparky essentially talks about it 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.600
 only three facts his teeth are eye pattern 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.940
 as well as his belly eye pattern is quite 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.260
 could be confusing scott when painting teeth 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.180
 most likely just not so 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.620
 steam your belly apparently 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.750
 are shorts 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.400
 But for the Foxy, we say the facts about 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.709
 that he has a spark of his mind about what he has 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.139
 it looks like muzzle ears nose 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.660
 also notice that he usually runs 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.000
 this way we have 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.160
 foxy moves so i think that 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.170
 drawn by foxy they are with park 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.020
 well now let's go to the mask and and 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.330
 mysterious disappearance of 8 rooms 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.700
 sometimes when a springtrap room comes in 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.710
 we do not see the mask and some players 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.810
 started to build a theory about what mask 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.269
 disappears because of the springtrap 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.250
 but there is not even a theory to build not 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.980
 no need and the mask is not lost here 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.720
 and and just closes the shadow goes like this 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.390
 what does springtrap get up on that 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 position closes the only one 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.440
 light source from the eye checks and therefore 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.750
 mask 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.640
 hiding in the shadow of a similar picture 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.250
 can see if see picture without 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.530
 included light and grease checks but 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.260
 only in this case nobody closes 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.750
 all the light passing to the mask and mask 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.120
 so we can see a little bit why not here 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.110
 no hoax guys basca just 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.270
 goes into the shadows 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.330
 they climb to Do at the ladder 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.730
 puppet or sparks or anyone 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.470
 I also do not know such options 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.360
 such are the cakes on it all expensive 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.340
 friends I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.560
 subscribe to the new video leave 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.560
 Good bye for now
