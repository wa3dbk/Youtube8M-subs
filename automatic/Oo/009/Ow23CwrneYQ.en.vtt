00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.370
 and today we will learn to communicate to the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.230
 copper pot the copper pot is here 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 that we can make dulce de leche in the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 wood stove in the normal stove even if 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.449
 always gives that flavor 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.210
 Special 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.060
 is sweet sweet is much smoother and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.010
 bright a sweet gets doughy then 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.150
 Can people clean coppi fee? 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.560
 what we need then these here 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.989
 these are the materials that we 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.219
 We'll need to be able to clean our 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.160
 copper pot 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:44.070
 so we're going to need the targets of the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.809
 soap and steel straw are 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.390
 these elements that people use that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.000
 will leave our dog pinpoo mind 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.710
 We'll warm the pot when he's already 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 it's warm 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.879
 We're going to start passing the salt and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.879
 after the lemon 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 and all of it because it is the shape of people 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.450
 then turned off the fire, huh? 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.280
 and we'll pass the lemon with the salt to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.210
 take it all so it opens that was 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.950
 pan 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.190
 This is a way for us to lose lifa. 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.630
 and he is very clean and profession 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.630
 to be able to make our rate 12 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.570
 Look, he's coming out all over Asia. 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.570
 pan 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.170
 bush 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.690
 you notice how easy it is to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.150
 lacking rain with lemon and targets 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.220
 I take a heated pot you can use 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.740
 the same technique for any piece 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.280
 that you have decoration that is well 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.810
 fast you do not require much effort 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.300
 ecological as you can see how it goes 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.310
 getting clean and bright all rate 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:11.400
 poor and now we're going to another 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.500
 which is precisely the other party and is 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.500
 to be able to wash the copper pot 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.530
 so we will not take a bunch and come back 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.800
 to go to power or we'll wash with 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.410
 enough water to take them all in April 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:33.180
 who stayed or can not wash with soap 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:36.060
 nor with sponge with steel wool before 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:42.690
 of all in April because otherwise he comes back 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:47.310
 all over again yesterday after he is 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:55.019
 all taken from us we will now see a 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:57.450
 soap and the 2012 opens only after 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.180
 We came with soap and straw. 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.940
 steel that is precisely to take all in 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.459
 the fact that he remembered that we did not 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:12.720
 You can take put a copper pan 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:16.049
 clean with soap and a 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.930
 Steel before taking lemon and salt 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.670
 see how it's getting bright 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.670
 Ready now, take all the doubts. 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.310
 notice how they are treading and now the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.829
 Our cash is ready for us. 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.680
 do our hoofs and let's do 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.680
 he shows the limits but the goalkeeper 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.829
 ready to see just as is our 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.319
 clean and bright stage 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:51.010
 You can do it at home and it's okay. 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.189
 It is easy to have a whole 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.189
 copper 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.689
 thanks
