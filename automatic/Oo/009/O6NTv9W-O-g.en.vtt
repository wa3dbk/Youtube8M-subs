00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
opinion in my mind this isn't a stove

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.549 
opinion in my mind this isn't a stove
but<00:00:56.649> rather<00:00:56.859> a<00:00:57.039> burner<00:00:57.640> in<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:59.079> of<00:00:59.109> my<00:00:59.260> older

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
but rather a burner in one of my older

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.719 
but rather a burner in one of my older
videos<00:00:59.589> I<00:01:00.129> explained<00:01:00.699> my<00:01:00.819> thoughts<00:01:01.210> on<00:01:01.479> that

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
videos I explained my thoughts on that

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.300 
videos I explained my thoughts on that
for<00:01:03.729> something<00:01:03.969> to<00:01:04.180> be<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.330> stove<00:01:04.920> there<00:01:05.920> has<00:01:06.130> to

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
for something to be a stove there has to

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.330 
for something to be a stove there has to
be<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.490> built-in<00:01:07.000> pot<00:01:07.360> stand<00:01:07.780> with<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.290> if<00:01:08.979> you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
be a built-in pot stand with it if you

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.450 
be a built-in pot stand with it if you
have<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.580> add<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:11.650> isn't<00:01:12.010> knocking

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
have to add and that this isn't knocking

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.310 
have to add and that this isn't knocking
this<00:01:12.670> that's<00:01:13.270> just<00:01:13.480> that<00:01:13.660> in<00:01:13.750> my<00:01:13.960> mind<00:01:14.170> I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
this that's just that in my mind I

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.200 
this that's just that in my mind I
consider<00:01:14.860> this<00:01:15.040> a<00:01:15.100> burner<00:01:15.490> rather<00:01:15.820> than<00:01:16.090> a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
consider this a burner rather than a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.410 
consider this a burner rather than a
stove<00:01:16.510> for<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.650> to<00:01:17.860> work<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.460> have<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.150> add<00:01:19.390> a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
stove for this to work you have to add a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
stove for this to work you have to add a
pot<00:01:19.780> stand<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:21.190> if<00:01:21.340> this<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.700> pot<00:01:22.030> stand

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
pot stand so if this is the pot stand

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.410 
pot stand so if this is the pot stand
this<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.040> burner<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.640> both<00:01:25.120> of<00:01:25.150> them

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
this is the burner and both of them

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
this is the burner and both of them
together<00:01:25.630> make<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> stove<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:28.090> just<00:01:28.510> just

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
together make a stove it's just just

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.640 
together make a stove it's just just
names<00:01:29.710> but<00:01:30.640> anyway<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:32.200> I'll<00:01:32.290> do<00:01:32.440> now<00:01:32.620> is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
names but anyway what I'll do now is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.890 
up to 120 degrees as you can see this is
a<00:02:32.760> fairly<00:02:33.150> wide<00:02:33.600> flame<00:02:35.030> about<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.150> wide<00:02:36.390> as<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
a fairly wide flame about as wide as the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.340 
a fairly wide flame about as wide as the
burner<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.530> now<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> width<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.459> burner<00:02:38.700> is

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
burner is now the width of the burner is

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.080 
burner is now the width of the burner is
two<00:02:40.350> point<00:02:40.739> seven<00:02:41.040> eight<00:02:41.310> inches<00:02:41.700> or<00:02:41.910> about

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
two point seven eight inches or about

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.890 
two point seven eight inches or about
two<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.510> three-quarter<00:02:43.050> inches<00:02:43.440> wide<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
two and three-quarter inches wide so it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.600 
two and three-quarter inches wide so it
looks<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.380> flames<00:02:46.650> go<00:02:46.950> pretty<00:02:47.190> much<00:02:47.400> to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
looks like the flames go pretty much to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.990 
looks like the flames go pretty much to
the<00:02:47.730> outside<00:02:48.120> edge<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.510> burner<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:50.550> let's

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
the outside edge of the burner so let's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.110 
the outside edge of the burner so let's
let<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.390> go<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.870> see<00:02:52.110> where<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.380> ends<00:02:52.500> up

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.830 

there<00:02:57.120> we<00:02:57.269> have<00:02:57.420> 210

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.320 

211

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.090 

come<00:03:10.080> on

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.300 

to<00:03:15.090> 12<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.750> seven<00:03:16.200> minutes<00:03:16.500> 12<00:03:17.490> seconds<00:03:18.090> I

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
to 12 and seven minutes 12 seconds I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.600 
to 12 and seven minutes 12 seconds I
really<00:03:20.310> put<00:03:20.460> a<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.940> would<00:03:21.200> go<00:03:22.200> faster

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
really put a that would go faster

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.760 
really put a that would go faster
okay<00:03:23.610> now<00:03:23.790> what<00:03:23.880> I'm<00:03:24.000> going<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.180> do<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.770> take

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
okay now what I'm going to do is take

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.760 
okay now what I'm going to do is take
this<00:03:26.010> off<00:03:27.230> put<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:29.870> simmering<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.200> see<00:03:31.530> how<00:03:31.560> it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
this off put the simmering on see how it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.330 
this off put the simmering on see how it
changes<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.310> fling<00:03:32.900> put<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.080> back<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:35.190> what

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
changes the fling put this back and what

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.650 
changes the fling put this back and what
if<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.550> might<00:03:35.820> not<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.690> need<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.080> taller<00:03:38.660> pot

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
if this might not you need a taller pot

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.040 
if this might not you need a taller pot
stand<00:03:40.760> okay<00:03:41.760> what<00:03:41.940> I'll<00:03:42.030> do<00:03:42.180> now<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.570> let<00:03:42.810> this

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
stand okay what I'll do now is let this

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.140 
stand okay what I'll do now is let this
go<00:03:43.320> remember<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.770> put<00:03:44.100> one<00:03:44.370> fluid<00:03:44.640> ounce<00:03:44.850> of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
go remember I put one fluid ounce of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.320 
go remember I put one fluid ounce of
methanol<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.350> there<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.940> we'll<00:03:47.940> just<00:03:48.150> let

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
methanol in there and we'll just let

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.180 
methanol in there and we'll just let
this<00:03:48.480> go<00:03:48.540> until<00:03:48.900> run<00:03:49.320> out<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.650> see<00:03:49.830> how<00:03:49.860> long

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
this go until run out and see how long

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.140 
this go until run out and see how long
the<00:03:50.340> simmer<00:03:50.610> ring<00:03:50.820> will<00:03:50.970> last<00:03:52.940> now<00:03:53.940> one<00:03:54.120> thing

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
the simmer ring will last now one thing

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.820 
the simmer ring will last now one thing
John<00:03:55.110> over<00:03:55.410> flat<00:03:55.770> cat<00:03:56.070> gear<00:03:56.430> did<00:03:56.820> say<00:03:57.120> was<00:03:57.420> that

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
John over flat cat gear did say was that

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.830 
John over flat cat gear did say was that
when<00:03:58.830> you<00:03:58.920> put<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.220> simmering<00:03:59.550> on<00:03:59.820> you<00:04:00.720> have

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
when you put the simmering on you have

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.440 
when you put the simmering on you have
to<00:04:00.990> let<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:01.290> set<00:04:01.560> for<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.830> little<00:04:01.980> bit<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.420> that

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
to let it set for a little bit so that

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.930 
to let it set for a little bit so that
the<00:04:03.810> simmer<00:04:04.110> goes<00:04:04.380> down<00:04:04.740> I<00:04:05.010> think<00:04:05.490> you<00:04:05.580> can<00:04:05.730> see

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
the simmer goes down I think you can see

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.690 
the simmer goes down I think you can see
now<00:04:06.150> it's<00:04:06.360> up<00:04:06.540> it's<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.680> much<00:04:07.860> smaller<00:04:08.190> flame

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
now it's up it's a much smaller flame

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.490 
now it's up it's a much smaller flame
but<00:04:09.030> when<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.210> first<00:04:09.540> put<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:09.960> on<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.200> should

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
but when I first put this on I should

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.800 
but when I first put this on I should
have<00:04:10.620> stuck<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.860> camera<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.570> because<00:04:12.570> it<00:04:12.690> was

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
have stuck to camera on because it was

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.980 
have stuck to camera on because it was
still<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.140> very<00:04:13.590> wide<00:04:14.010> flame<00:04:14.780> right<00:04:15.780> in<00:04:15.930> the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
still a very wide flame right in the

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.930 
still a very wide flame right in the
beginning<00:04:16.110> of<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.530> simmering<00:04:17.480> so<00:04:18.530> let's<00:04:19.940> not

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
beginning of the simmering so let's not

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.170 
beginning of the simmering so let's not
if<00:04:21.120> this<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.420> simmered<00:04:21.780> simmer<00:04:22.410> down<00:04:22.530> sorry

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
if this is simmered simmer down sorry

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.960 
if this is simmered simmer down sorry
settle<00:04:24.180> down<00:04:24.210> some<00:04:25.220> let's<00:04:26.220> see<00:04:26.400> how<00:04:26.520> long<00:04:26.580> this

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
settle down some let's see how long this

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.920 
settle down some let's see how long this
fluid<00:04:27.420> ounce<00:04:27.570> lasts<00:04:29.240> okay<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.420> test<00:04:30.690> is

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
fluid ounce lasts okay the test is

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.550 
fluid ounce lasts okay the test is
running<00:04:31.350> at<00:04:31.470> about<00:04:31.530> 18<00:04:32.160> minutes<00:04:32.460> now<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.560> I

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
running at about 18 minutes now and I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.470 
running at about 18 minutes now and I
don't<00:04:34.740> know<00:04:34.950> if<00:04:35.040> its<00:04:35.190> thermal<00:04:35.520> feedback<00:04:36.210> from

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
don't know if its thermal feedback from

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.540 
don't know if its thermal feedback from
the<00:04:36.630> bottom<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.110> pot<00:04:37.380> or<00:04:37.740> what<00:04:38.040> but<00:04:38.340> the

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
the bottom of the pot or what but the

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.730 
the bottom of the pot or what but the
simmer<00:04:39.330> flames<00:04:39.750> have<00:04:40.020> gone<00:04:40.260> wide<00:04:40.680> again<00:04:41.130> I

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
simmer flames have gone wide again I

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.320 
simmer flames have gone wide again I
have<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.770> feeling<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.370> should<00:04:44.400> try<00:04:44.820> this<00:04:44.880> with<00:04:45.300> a

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
have a feeling I should try this with a

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.170 
have a feeling I should try this with a
little<00:04:45.660> bit<00:04:45.840> taller<00:04:45.870> pot<00:04:46.650> stand<00:04:47.180> maybe

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
little bit taller pot stand maybe

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.110 
little bit taller pot stand maybe
that'll<00:04:48.570> be<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:48.960> next<00:04:49.260> test<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.680> do<00:04:49.740> but<00:04:50.190> it

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
that'll be the next test I do but it

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.760 
that'll be the next test I do but it
still<00:04:51.510> seems<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.870> be<00:04:52.020> going<00:04:52.140> fairly<00:04:52.440> strong

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
still seems to be going fairly strong

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.930 
still seems to be going fairly strong
now<00:04:52.950> it's<00:04:53.160> going<00:04:53.340> narrow<00:04:53.730> again<00:04:54.240> a<00:04:54.450> little<00:04:55.080> bit

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
now it's going narrow again a little bit

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.430 
now it's going narrow again a little bit
so<00:04:56.940> I'm<00:04:57.150> not<00:04:57.330> sure<00:04:57.390> what's<00:04:57.750> happening<00:04:57.810> here

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
so I'm not sure what's happening here

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.410 
so I'm not sure what's happening here
but<00:04:59.160> let's<00:04:59.460> let<00:04:59.700> the<00:04:59.850> test<00:05:00.090> go<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:02.760> flames<00:05:03.240> are

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
but let's let the test go the flames are

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.130 
but let's let the test go the flames are
just<00:05:03.660> about<00:05:03.780> ready<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:04.110> go<00:05:04.260> out<00:05:05.870> looks<00:05:06.870> like

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
just about ready to go out looks like

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.860 
just about ready to go out looks like
going<00:05:08.330> looks<00:05:09.330> like<00:05:09.570> gone<00:05:10.280> at<00:05:11.280> 24<00:05:11.940> minutes<00:05:12.180> 32

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
going looks like gone at 24 minutes 32

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:20.379 
going looks like gone at 24 minutes 32
seconds<00:05:15.590> 24<00:05:16.590> 32

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:29.419 

interesting<00:05:24.769> yep<00:05:26.179> ballout<00:05:28.039> ok<00:05:29.039> so<00:05:29.099> that<00:05:29.399> was

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:29.429 
interesting yep ballout ok so that was

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:32.329 
interesting yep ballout ok so that was
two<00:05:30.329> cups<00:05:30.569> of<00:05:30.689> water<00:05:30.899> starting<00:05:31.319> at<00:05:31.439> 60<00:05:31.889> 61

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:32.339 
two cups of water starting at 60 61

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.569 
two cups of water starting at 60 61
degrees<00:05:33.289> came<00:05:34.289> to<00:05:34.439> a<00:05:34.469> full<00:05:34.679> boil<00:05:34.949> in<00:05:35.189> seven

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:35.579 
degrees came to a full boil in seven

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:38.839 
degrees came to a full boil in seven
minutes<00:05:35.759> and<00:05:35.969> 12<00:05:36.269> seconds<00:05:36.839> I<00:05:37.699> really<00:05:38.699> thought

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
minutes and 12 seconds I really thought

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.559 
minutes and 12 seconds I really thought
that<00:05:39.119> would<00:05:39.329> be<00:05:39.569> a<00:05:39.719> little<00:05:39.959> bit<00:05:40.110> faster<00:05:40.679> I<00:05:41.569> have

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
that would be a little bit faster I have

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.989 
that would be a little bit faster I have
a<00:05:42.599> feeling<00:05:42.869> this<00:05:43.259> now<00:05:44.009> like<00:05:44.159> I<00:05:44.309> said<00:05:44.339> Jon<00:05:44.789> had

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:44.999 
a feeling this now like I said Jon had

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.779 
a feeling this now like I said Jon had
said<00:05:45.269> that<00:05:45.299> it<00:05:45.629> should<00:05:45.929> be<00:05:45.959> a<00:05:46.110> pot<00:05:46.409> stand<00:05:46.799> one

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
said that it should be a pot stand one

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.999 
said that it should be a pot stand one
point<00:05:48.089> eight<00:05:48.360> inches<00:05:48.779> off<00:05:48.989> the<00:05:49.049> ground<00:05:49.409> so

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
point eight inches off the ground so

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.850 
point eight inches off the ground so
that's<00:05:50.429> about<00:05:50.549> what<00:05:50.849> this<00:05:50.999> is<00:05:52.099> but<00:05:53.099> I<00:05:54.860> don't

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
that's about what this is but I don't

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.679 
that's about what this is but I don't
know<00:05:55.949> i<00:05:56.219> think<00:05:56.729> i'm<00:05:57.029> going<00:05:57.149> to<00:05:57.269> try<00:05:57.389> another

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
know i think i'm going to try another

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.659 
know i think i'm going to try another
test<00:05:58.049> with<00:05:58.199> a<00:05:58.319> little<00:05:58.679> bit<00:05:58.769> higher<00:05:59.009> pot<00:05:59.339> stand

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
test with a little bit higher pot stand

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.329 
test with a little bit higher pot stand
this<00:05:59.999> is<00:06:00.179> one<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:00.509> three-quarter<00:06:01.169> this<00:06:02.099> is

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:02.339 
this is one and three-quarter this is

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.719 
this is one and three-quarter this is
two<00:06:02.549> and<00:06:02.699> a<00:06:02.759> quarter<00:06:03.949> just<00:06:04.949> to<00:06:05.069> see<00:06:05.249> what<00:06:05.489> if

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
two and a quarter just to see what if

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.979 
two and a quarter just to see what if
the<00:06:06.029> height<00:06:06.239> makes<00:06:06.599> any<00:06:06.779> difference<00:06:08.269> but<00:06:09.269> that

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:09.989 
the height makes any difference but that

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:11.779 
the height makes any difference but that
was<00:06:10.139> two<00:06:10.289> cups<00:06:10.499> of<00:06:10.589> water<00:06:10.799> starting<00:06:11.189> at<00:06:11.279> 61

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
was two cups of water starting at 61

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.909 
was two cups of water starting at 61
degrees<00:06:11.939> came<00:06:12.449> to<00:06:12.629> a<00:06:12.659> boil<00:06:13.110> in<00:06:13.349> seven<00:06:13.769> minutes

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
degrees came to a boil in seven minutes

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.850 
degrees came to a boil in seven minutes
and<00:06:14.189> 12<00:06:14.399> seconds<00:06:14.909> I<00:06:15.259> put<00:06:16.259> the<00:06:16.409> simmering<00:06:16.919> on

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
and 12 seconds I put the simmering on

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.489 
and 12 seconds I put the simmering on
which<00:06:19.860> is<00:06:20.069> more<00:06:20.369> and<00:06:21.800> that<00:06:22.879> simmered<00:06:23.879> for<00:06:24.499> up

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:25.499 
which is more and that simmered for up

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:29.389 
which is more and that simmered for up
to<00:06:25.860> 24<00:06:26.399> minutes<00:06:26.639> and<00:06:26.939> 32<00:06:27.360> seconds<00:06:28.219> now<00:06:29.219> there

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:29.399 
to 24 minutes and 32 seconds now there

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:32.659 
to 24 minutes and 32 seconds now there
was<00:06:29.489> a<00:06:29.550> difference<00:06:30.059> here<00:06:31.309> sometimes<00:06:32.309> the

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
was a difference here sometimes the

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.679 
was a difference here sometimes the
flame<00:06:33.449> was<00:06:33.719> only<00:06:34.019> about<00:06:34.169> as<00:06:34.319> wide<00:06:34.589> as<00:06:34.860> the<00:06:35.039> hole

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:35.689 
flame was only about as wide as the hole

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.779 
flame was only about as wide as the hole
but<00:06:36.689> then<00:06:36.839> other<00:06:37.019> times<00:06:37.139> it<00:06:37.949> like<00:06:38.159> alternated

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
but then other times it like alternated

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.639 
but then other times it like alternated
back<00:06:38.969> and<00:06:39.209> forth<00:06:39.479> sometimes<00:06:40.079> it<00:06:40.229> was<00:06:40.349> just<00:06:40.529> a

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:40.649 
back and forth sometimes it was just a

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:42.979 
back and forth sometimes it was just a
narrow<00:06:40.919> flame<00:06:41.219> coming<00:06:41.519> up<00:06:41.729> other<00:06:42.360> times<00:06:42.779> it

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:42.989 
narrow flame coming up other times it

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:46.100 
narrow flame coming up other times it
was<00:06:43.079> out<00:06:43.259> to<00:06:43.499> the<00:06:43.619> edge<00:06:43.800> of<00:06:44.209> the<00:06:45.209> simmering<00:06:45.749> and

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
was out to the edge of the simmering and

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.799 
was out to the edge of the simmering and
it<00:06:46.199> was<00:06:46.319> a<00:06:46.349> wide<00:06:46.679> flame<00:06:47.329> then<00:06:48.329> it<00:06:48.449> would<00:06:48.569> dry

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:48.809 
it was a wide flame then it would dry

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:51.409 
it was a wide flame then it would dry
die<00:06:49.469> down<00:06:49.799> a<00:06:49.829> little<00:06:49.979> bit<00:06:50.249> just<00:06:50.999> become<00:06:51.269> the

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
die down a little bit just become the

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.279 
die down a little bit just become the
inside<00:06:51.779> hole<00:06:52.110> and<00:06:52.379> then<00:06:52.979> get<00:06:53.219> larger<00:06:53.699> again<00:06:54.289> so

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
inside hole and then get larger again so

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.759 
inside hole and then get larger again so
I'm<00:06:55.379> not<00:06:55.529> sure<00:06:55.709> what<00:06:55.860> that<00:06:55.889> was<00:06:56.189> about<00:06:57.769> again

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:58.769 
I'm not sure what that was about again

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:00.469 
I'm not sure what that was about again
it<00:06:58.889> might<00:06:59.009> have<00:06:59.159> been<00:06:59.219> thermal<00:06:59.639> feedback<00:07:00.089> heat

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 
it might have been thermal feedback heat

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.399 
it might have been thermal feedback heat
from<00:07:00.809> the<00:07:01.139> pot<00:07:02.360> with<00:07:03.360> feeding<00:07:03.689> back<00:07:03.959> into<00:07:04.259> this

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
from the pot with feeding back into this

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:07.519 
from the pot with feeding back into this
making<00:07:04.889> more<00:07:05.069> vapors<00:07:05.779> maybe<00:07:06.779> a<00:07:06.899> pot<00:07:07.199> stand

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:07.529 
making more vapors maybe a pot stand

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:09.679 
making more vapors maybe a pot stand
it's<00:07:07.739> a<00:07:07.829> little<00:07:08.069> bit<00:07:08.159> taller<00:07:08.479> might<00:07:09.479> make<00:07:09.659> a

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:09.689 
it's a little bit taller might make a

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:13.759 
it's a little bit taller might make a
difference<00:07:11.149> so<00:07:12.149> that's<00:07:12.539> my<00:07:12.779> first<00:07:12.809> boil<00:07:13.349> test

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:13.769 
difference so that's my first boil test

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:17.389 
difference so that's my first boil test
on<00:07:13.979> flat<00:07:14.309> cat<00:07:14.610> dear<00:07:14.969> standard<00:07:15.689> stove<00:07:16.369> with<00:07:17.369> the
