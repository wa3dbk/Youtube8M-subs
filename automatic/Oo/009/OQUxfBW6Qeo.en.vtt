00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.710
 how about welcome friends we have a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 galaxy s3 mini and let's see with him how 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.380
 restore it to factory mode 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 It's worth as they gave it to us in the box 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.960
 when we take it out in case we have some 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.780
 problem with the galaxy s3 mini that that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.180
 go slow to show errors 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.559
 constantly that does not open well 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.870
 applications and others and when the 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.350
 phone gets foolish as his thing 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.030
 is to reset in factory mode and with 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.429
 this we clean and we leave just like 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.780
 we say from the box see how we can 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.929
 do this because we can do it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.140
 through the menu if we can access the 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:56.039
 menu to the screen menus 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.440
 we go to menus we go to adjustments and 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.600
 in adjustments we are going to ask that is 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.449
 here all the menu in backup 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.089
 and restoration worth 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.850
 and here 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.520
 we already see factory data reset 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.710
 so clicking here shows us that 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.079
 delete all memory data blah 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.539
 blah blah blah and the only thing we have to 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.090
 press is to reset the device 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.819
 ok this is one of the ways when 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.459
 you stop us from accessing menus that do not 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.250
 is totally blocked and good 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:31.219
 we can handle a little what is the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.530
 menus and icons is good if the 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.979
 samsung galaxy s 3000 and it does not stop us from 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.140
 access the on-screen menus to 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.939
 icons and other adjustment and so on 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.069
 reset the factory modes by 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.200
 the voucher buttons we have to press to 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.049
 the time having hold the button 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.179
 to increase volume and the start is worth more 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.360
 we press them we keep pressed if 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.920
 at that moment we press the on 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.890
 off and we keep it pressed until 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.350
 who lives from has vibrated 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.350
 and let's go to this and hope 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.930
 to leave the menu 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.930
 right now he's already here presenting the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.930
 android 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.410
 and we hope that the menu of 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.040
 to download recovery and other soles 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.820
 here we have it here 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.040
 we have to do several things is what 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.200
 what we have to look for is with the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.910
 power button I say with the buttons 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.500
 to go up lower volume go up and down 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.569
 volume then we go down to our 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.989
 more key with the wild datafactory reset 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.440
 once we are over we press to 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.250
 confirm 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.250
 we use 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.400
 to confirm it is but wrong with the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.260
 restart string we press to 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.870
 confirm the power button off 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:07.319
 Okay , we are already there and we press 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.420
 you see that we went to another menu in the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.650
 we see many of us to be sure 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.080
 What we're going to do is what we're going 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.950
 to do is to give it all it's be 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.280
 data vale we put on top and press 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.940
 the power button turned off to 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.610
 confirm the moment we press it 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.810
 the mobile is reset is now reset to 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.280
 factory mode and it will remain as 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.550
 we find 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.130
 when we take them out to the box, it's worth 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.310
 it is assumed that the problem I had if 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.060
 was constantly blocking or staying 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.510
 It was slow and others assumed that 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.480
 problem will have happened if not then that 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.580
 have a bigger problem and probably 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.220
 have some hardware failure or 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.110
 hardware and good with this because we have already 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.060
 seen how to reset to factory mode 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.880
 through menus, icons, settings and so on and 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.870
 using the buttons on the buttons 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.820
 start and turn volume is good and good 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.450
 friends I hope it was useful come 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.450
 until next time
