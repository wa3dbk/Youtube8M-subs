you're<00:02:04.790> probably<00:02:04.940> wondering<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:06.200> what<00:02:06.320> does

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
you're probably wondering but what does

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.350 
you're probably wondering but what does
this<00:02:06.590> matter<00:02:06.830> there's<00:02:07.520> no<00:02:07.670> benefit<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.209> having

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
this matter there's no benefit to having

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.779 
this matter there's no benefit to having
goosebumps<00:02:08.950> well<00:02:09.950> maybe<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.369> wasn't<00:02:10.670> always

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
goosebumps well maybe it wasn't always

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.339 
goosebumps well maybe it wasn't always
that<00:02:11.060> way

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
that way

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.930 
that way
to<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.470> present<00:02:12.769> day<00:02:12.860> man<00:02:13.069> goosebumps<00:02:13.760> don't

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
to the present day man goosebumps don't

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.059 
to the present day man goosebumps don't
serve<00:02:14.209> much<00:02:14.420> purpose<00:02:14.620> however<00:02:15.620> if<00:02:15.950> we

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
serve much purpose however if we

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.490 
serve much purpose however if we
consider<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.670> prehistoric<00:02:17.269> man<00:02:17.480> let's<00:02:18.409> just

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
consider the prehistoric man let's just

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.400 
consider the prehistoric man let's just
say<00:02:18.709> we<00:02:18.830> had<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> lot<00:02:19.190> more<00:02:19.220> hair<00:02:20.140> back<00:02:21.140> then

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
say we had a lot more hair back then

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.440 
say we had a lot more hair back then
