00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.370 
know because it's just it's almost like
it's<00:03:28.650> not<00:03:28.769> fragile<00:03:29.069> but<00:03:29.690> he<00:03:30.690> doesn't<00:03:30.959> need<00:03:31.200> to

this<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.269> remember<00:03:33.690> some<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.049> cards<00:03:34.470> that

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
this to remember some of the cards that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.960 
this to remember some of the cards that
we've<00:03:34.769> looked<00:03:35.010> at<00:03:35.220> through<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.609> pentacle

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
we've looked at through the pentacle

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.400 
we've looked at through the pentacle
series<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.389> they've<00:03:36.480> been<00:03:36.600> kind<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.780> holding

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
series and they've been kind of holding

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.949 
series and they've been kind of holding
things<00:03:37.680> close<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.310> their<00:03:38.670> chest<00:03:39.000> or<00:03:39.389> been

things close to their chest or been
giving<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.410> receiving<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.310> think<00:03:41.489> the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
giving and receiving and I think the

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.530 
giving and receiving and I think the
whole<00:03:41.700> way<00:03:41.790> through<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:42.090> Pentacles<00:03:42.450> we're

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
whole way through the Pentacles we're

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.120 
whole way through the Pentacles we're
looking<00:03:42.720> at<00:03:42.810> characters<00:03:43.680> are<00:03:43.799> looking<00:03:44.010> for

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
looking at characters are looking for

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.729 
looking at characters are looking for
balance<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.880> having<00:03:45.660> too<00:03:46.019> much<00:03:46.170> not<00:03:46.440> having

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
kind of situation where you need to be

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.180 
kind of situation where you need to be
able<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.049> strike<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.319> balance<00:04:04.560> between<00:04:04.769> all

able to strike a balance between all

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.860 
able to strike a balance between all
things<00:04:05.519> we<00:04:05.700> need<00:04:05.849> to<00:04:05.880> draw<00:04:06.180> from<00:04:06.810> your

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
things we need to draw from your

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.960 
things we need to draw from your
inspiration<00:04:07.709> from<00:04:07.889> your<00:04:08.040> emotion<00:04:08.549> from<00:04:08.760> your

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
inspiration from your emotion from your

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.180 
inspiration from your emotion from your
your<00:04:09.510> ideas<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.200> your<00:04:10.290> mental<00:04:10.650> energy<00:04:10.739> and

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
your ideas and your mental energy and

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.270 
your ideas and your mental energy and
then<00:04:11.400> pull<00:04:11.609> these<00:04:11.849> together<00:04:12.650> into<00:04:13.650> action<00:04:14.130> so

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
then pull these together into action so

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.470 
then pull these together into action so
I<00:04:14.549> think<00:04:14.639> when<00:04:14.790> we<00:04:14.849> see<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.150> page<00:04:15.299> of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
I think when we see the page of

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.539 
I think when we see the page of
Pentacles<00:04:15.599> we're<00:04:16.349> looking<00:04:16.680> at<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.220> sign<00:04:17.519> that

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
Pentacles we're looking at a sign that

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.089 
Pentacles we're looking at a sign that
action<00:04:18.239> is<00:04:18.419> about<00:04:19.229> to<00:04:19.470> take<00:04:19.560> place<00:04:19.769> it's<00:04:20.039> time

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
action is about to take place it's time

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.640 
action is about to take place it's time
to<00:04:20.459> act<00:04:20.700> now<00:04:21.060> you've<00:04:21.630> had<00:04:21.720> all<00:04:22.049> these<00:04:22.260> kind<00:04:22.560> of

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
to act now you've had all these kind of

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.170 
to act now you've had all these kind of
ideas<00:04:22.770> you've<00:04:23.370> put<00:04:23.610> all<00:04:23.789> these<00:04:23.909> things

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
ideas you've put all these things

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.940 
ideas you've put all these things
together<00:04:24.360> but<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.140> need<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:25.380> take<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.710> step

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
together but you need to take that step

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.580 
together but you need to take that step
where<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.430> actually<00:04:26.789> put<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:26.970> into

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
where you actually put it into

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.020 
where you actually put it into
practice<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:28.250> when<00:04:28.400> we<00:04:28.490> see<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:28.820> page

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
practice and so when we see the page

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.580 
practice and so when we see the page
here<00:04:29.300> we're<00:04:29.690> looking<00:04:29.780> at<00:04:30.080> somebody<00:04:30.380> who's<00:04:30.560> a

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.950 
here we're looking at somebody who's a
doer<00:04:30.860> someone<00:04:31.760> that<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:32.000> can<00:04:32.300> depend<00:04:32.630> upon

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
doer someone that you can depend upon

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.540 
doer someone that you can depend upon
somebody<00:04:33.320> who<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.740> actually<00:04:34.100> going<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.430> not

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
somebody who is actually going to not

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.980 
somebody who is actually going to not
just<00:04:34.610> sit<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:34.940> talk<00:04:35.120> about<00:04:35.330> things<00:04:35.630> I'll<00:04:35.840> sit

going<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.750> take<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.110> step<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.410> transition<00:04:39.949> to

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
going to take that step to transition to

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.850 
going to take that step to transition to
actually<00:04:40.460> take<00:04:41.120> action<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:42.320> do<00:04:42.590> those

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
actually take action and to do those

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.860 
actually take action and to do those
things<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:43.610> he's<00:04:44.150> standing<00:04:44.300> it's<00:04:44.540> very<00:04:44.720> kind

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
things and he's standing it's very kind

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.080 
things and he's standing it's very kind
of<00:04:44.930> lush<00:04:45.229> ground<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:46.550> can't<00:04:46.790> see<00:04:46.880> very

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
of lush ground and you can't see very

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.730 
of lush ground and you can't see very
well<00:04:47.150> here<00:04:47.300> but<00:04:47.449> it's<00:04:47.600> like<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.720> tiny<00:04:48.050> square<00:04:48.470> of

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
well here but it's like a tiny square of

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.040 
well here but it's like a tiny square of
a<00:04:49.070> field<00:04:49.550> that's<00:04:49.729> been<00:04:49.940> plowed<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:50.720> it's<00:04:50.840> ready

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
a field that's been plowed so it's ready

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.930 
a field that's been plowed so it's ready
for<00:04:51.110> clamping<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.740> seed<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.520> here<00:04:52.850> he<00:04:52.910> is

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
for clamping a seed and here he is

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.480 
for clamping a seed and here he is
