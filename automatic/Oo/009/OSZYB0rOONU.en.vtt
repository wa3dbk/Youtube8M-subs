00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.590
 video of this of this machine 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.060
 really of this car particularly 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.160
 special because special I did not find 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.559
 no videos on youtube and in Italian 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.610
 as for this car and it's for 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.980
 this I decided to do this 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.379
 video is a almost reddit drift io como 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.040

 seal we see together what the offers us 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:02.089
 pack because I decided to take 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.400
 this car because especially in 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.960
 winter or especially for those people 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.390
 who do not have a track available 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.420
 weekly as in my case can 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.420
 to be 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.850
 we say interesting to have it to turn 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:25.590
 in interior ok we see booklet of 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:31.899
 warranty instructions 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.390
 etc. etcetera etc. and so on is 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:39.369
 an exhibition of turan fess then wants to 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.539
 say that electronics is missing we see 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:53.229
 together 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:54.390
 we open the box here we are 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.860
 almost 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:14.680
 below we have a small tube for 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:16.860
 the antenna here it is and I see some parts 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.860
 spare 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:35.010
 there are o ring straps I don't know for what 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:38.880
 let's still find out something about it 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.370
 unknown yet then very cute joe 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.160
 as for these things she is always a teacher 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.280
 I have to say a screwdriver 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:59.310
 let's see if I can get it out or 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:03:01.610
 better a multipurpose tool I believe almost 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.610
 fallen 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:17.459
 here it is very nice perceived cross 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.980
 we take everything away and go and see it done 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.250
 you can see the bodywork 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:29.190
 I must say really well made of silvia 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:32.870
 s15 already decimated and colored is painted but 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.870
 let's see what's underneath 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.570
 wait for the zoom 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.200
 the body is in abs is not the nec 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:53.640
 healthy pvc interior glass already mounted 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.150
 very pretty really well done this 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.329
 is the frame as you can see there is the 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.190
 the engine is already there, even if I do 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:07.769
 I think I'll put the brushless version 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:10.500
 but no battery servo desk ok 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.350
 the wheels are thrift so hard 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.049
 although as you can see there are 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.030
 of the rings and on the wheels because still 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.370
 I failed I see they are gods 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.200
 rings that make smooth and wheels 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.860
 this is not really the best though 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.759
 not 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.520
 it is easy to find wheels one by one 16 1 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:36.090
 18 of drifting really from drifting 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.930
 I mean hard non-soft non-rubbery ok 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.129
 elected network of shock absorbers you see 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:49.289
 many sectors are obviously in 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:51.330
 plastic cost is less than 200 euros per 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.250
 which you do not expect, however, who knows what it is 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.439
 very pretty is a particular product 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.780
 that is not found in our part of the 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:04.020
 he makes the floor as the only one made 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.479
 alternative 1 16 and the transas model 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.319
 of the fiesta, however, which has a cost 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.900
 really unapproachable I will make you 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:15.449
 see the electronics in the next video 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.930
 mounted and one is a first try on 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.819
