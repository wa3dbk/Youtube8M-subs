yourself<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.840> nice<00:02:01.140> flush<00:02:01.799> finish<00:02:02.340> at

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
yourself a really nice flush finish at

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.179 
yourself a really nice flush finish at
the<00:02:02.909> top<00:02:03.119> there<00:02:03.950> okay

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the top there okay

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.310 
the top there okay
so<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> threading<00:02:06.840> hole<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.200> we're

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so into the threading hole so we're

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.460 
so into the threading hole so we're
actually<00:02:07.409> coming<00:02:08.009> down<00:02:08.360> one<00:02:09.360> side<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:10.080> our<00:02:10.200> bar

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
actually coming down one side of our bar

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.470 
actually coming down one side of our bar
and<00:02:10.769> I<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.220> come<00:02:11.400> down<00:02:11.580> first<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.150> all<00:02:12.269> on

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
and I like to come down first of all on

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.360 
and I like to come down first of all on
the<00:02:12.840> side<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:13.049> doesn't<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.860> hole<00:02:14.069> and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the side that doesn't have the hole and

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.559 
the side that doesn't have the hole and
you'll<00:02:14.459> see<00:02:14.700> why<00:02:14.909> in<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.150> minute<00:02:15.269> because

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you'll see why in a minute because

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.210 
you'll see why in a minute because
actually<00:02:16.049> it<00:02:16.110> just<00:02:16.170> makes<00:02:16.439> it<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> lot<00:02:16.769> easier

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
actually it just makes it a lot easier

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.640 
actually it just makes it a lot easier
so<00:02:17.909> your<00:02:18.000> needle<00:02:18.360> will<00:02:18.480> come<00:02:18.689> up<00:02:18.870> through<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
so your needle will come up through the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.030 
so your needle will come up through the
bottom<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.450> then<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:21.659> need<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.989> go<00:02:22.200> up<00:02:22.469> through

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
bottom and then we need to go up through

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.370 
bottom and then we need to go up through
the<00:02:23.279> other<00:02:23.459> side

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
the other side

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.040 
the other side
so<00:02:25.100> my<00:02:25.250> needle<00:02:25.610> will<00:02:25.730> now<00:02:25.910> come<00:02:26.210> back<00:02:26.720> up

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
so my needle will now come back up

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.190 
so my needle will now come back up
through<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.560> hole<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.690> we<00:02:29.690> want<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.020> make

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
through the hole and we want to make

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.140 
through the hole and we want to make
sure<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.709> our<00:02:30.830> thread<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.550> on<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.910> other

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
sure that our thread is on the other

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.970 
sure that our thread is on the other
side<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.900> bar<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.530> see<00:02:33.709> why<00:02:33.860> it's

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
side of the bar so you see why it's

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.230 
side of the bar so you see why it's
easier<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.370> start<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.880> other<00:02:35.000> side

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
easier to start on the other side

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.300 
easier to start on the other side
because<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.050> makes<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.410> final<00:02:36.800> step<00:02:36.950> easier

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
because it makes that final step easier

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.949 
because it makes that final step easier
that<00:02:37.850> way<00:02:38.060> my<00:02:38.300> thread<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.870> now<00:02:39.670> comfortably

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
that way my thread is now comfortably

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.050 
that way my thread is now comfortably
underneath<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.830> little<00:02:42.950> bar<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.640> that's

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
underneath that little bar and that's

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.510 
underneath that little bar and that's
going<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.330> act<00:02:44.510> as<00:02:44.690> my<00:02:44.870> stopper<00:02:45.220> now<00:02:46.220> tie<00:02:46.280> an

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
going to act as my stopper now tie an

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.120 
going to act as my stopper now tie an
overhand<00:02:46.670> knot<00:02:47.030> little<00:02:47.900> drop<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.290> glue<00:02:48.709> as

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
overhand knot little drop of glue as

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.750 
overhand knot little drop of glue as
well<00:02:49.190> I'm<00:02:49.880> actually<00:02:50.030> going<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.480> do<00:02:51.550> two<00:02:52.550> knots

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
well I'm actually going to do two knots

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.570 
well I'm actually going to do two knots
on<00:02:52.970> here<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.330> it's<00:02:53.450> really<00:02:53.510> secure<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.680> then

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
on here so it's really secure and then

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.300 
on here so it's really secure and then
either<00:02:55.910> using<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.810> needle<00:02:57.290> or<00:02:57.709> perhaps<00:02:58.040> even

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
either using a needle or perhaps even

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.040 
either using a needle or perhaps even
your<00:02:58.520> pliers<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:59.000> little<00:02:59.420> bit<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.600> glue<00:02:59.810> and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
your pliers a little bit of glue and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.780 
your pliers a little bit of glue and
then<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.320> just<00:03:00.500> want<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.770> make<00:03:01.310> sure<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.670> you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
then you just want to make sure that you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.259 
then you just want to make sure that you
push<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.420> knot<00:03:03.040> underneath<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.820> bar<00:03:05.000> and

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
push that knot underneath the bar and

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.330 
push that knot underneath the bar and
that's<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:05.989> our<00:03:06.230> pearl<00:03:06.500> will<00:03:06.890> sit<00:03:07.100> really

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
that's so that our pearl will sit really

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.780 
that's so that our pearl will sit really
nice<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.850> flush<00:03:08.120> on<00:03:08.450> top<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:10.130> I'm<00:03:10.430> gonna<00:03:10.610> add

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
nice and flush on top so I'm gonna add

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.509 
nice and flush on top so I'm gonna add
my<00:03:10.820> pearl<00:03:11.390> as<00:03:11.750> my<00:03:11.989> first<00:03:12.260> bead<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.950> then<00:03:13.400> I'm

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
my pearl as my first bead and then I'm

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.920 
my pearl as my first bead and then I'm
going<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.730> alternate<00:03:14.180> between<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.690> pearls

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
going to alternate between the pearls

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.509 
going to alternate between the pearls
and<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.350> crystals<00:03:15.830> but<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.100> course<00:03:16.280> if<00:03:16.400> you

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
and the crystals but of course if you

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.670 
and the crystals but of course if you
want<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.820> change<00:03:17.090> your<00:03:17.269> design<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:18.380> could

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
want to change your design you could

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.350 
want to change your design you could
have<00:03:18.860> little<00:03:19.040> clusters<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:19.640> pearls<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.180> could

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
have little clusters of pearls you could

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.150 
have little clusters of pearls you could
have<00:03:20.450> clusters<00:03:20.840> of<00:03:20.930> your<00:03:21.050> crystals<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.010> can

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
have clusters of your crystals so can

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.400 
have clusters of your crystals so can
you<00:03:22.250> see<00:03:22.489> how<00:03:22.670> now<00:03:22.940> my<00:03:23.269> pearl<00:03:23.570> is<00:03:23.900> going<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.230> sit

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
you see how now my pearl is going to sit

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.670 
you see how now my pearl is going to sit
really<00:03:24.830> nice<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.340> flush<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.360> top<00:03:27.110> of<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:27.440> end

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
really nice and flush on top of that end

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.710 
really nice and flush on top of that end
cap<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.190> now<00:03:28.280> we're<00:03:28.880> ready<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.150> create<00:03:29.450> our

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
cap and now we're ready to create our

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.210 
cap and now we're ready to create our
knot<00:03:30.549> so<00:03:31.549> we<00:03:32.239> want<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.540> tie<00:03:32.750> an<00:03:33.140> overhand<00:03:33.769> knot

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
knot so we want to tie an overhand knot

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.890 
knot so we want to tie an overhand knot
now<00:03:34.579> for<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.850> purpose<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.329> getting<00:03:35.630> this<00:03:35.690> out

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
now for the purpose of getting this out

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.720 
now for the purpose of getting this out
of<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.079> way<00:03:36.200> for<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.440> video<00:03:36.709> I'm<00:03:37.400> just<00:03:37.459> going

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
of the way for the video I'm just going

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.280 
of the way for the video I'm just going
to<00:03:37.820> cut<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:38.180> piece<00:03:38.420> here<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.019> we<00:03:39.110> don't

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
to cut this piece here so that we don't

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.900 
to cut this piece here so that we don't
have<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.680> look<00:03:39.829> at<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.070> obviously<00:03:40.700> you'll<00:03:40.880> have

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
have to look at it obviously you'll have

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.430 
have to look at it obviously you'll have
glue<00:03:41.299> on<00:03:41.329> here<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:41.810> you'll<00:03:41.959> be<00:03:42.049> able<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.290> cut

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440

index finger and my middle finger and I
pull<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.530> cord<00:03:54.769> through<00:03:55.010> now<00:03:55.549> you<00:03:55.610> could<00:03:55.910> pull

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
pull the cord through now you could pull

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.970 
pull the cord through now you could pull
the<00:03:56.299> pearls<00:03:56.510> through<00:03:56.900> it's<00:03:57.170> whatever's<00:03:57.769> going

and tight to your bead rotate the Nauta

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.770 
and tight to your bead rotate the Nauta
and<00:04:09.769> my<00:04:10.400> strand<00:04:10.820> comes<00:04:11.239> through<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:11.540> little

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
and my strand comes through that little

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.680 
and my strand comes through that little
V<00:04:12.140> hook<00:04:12.440> at<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:13.130> bottom<00:04:13.489> there<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:13.970> then<00:04:14.090> I'm

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
V hook at the bottom there and then I'm

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.390 
V hook at the bottom there and then I'm
going<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.900> slide<00:04:15.290> so<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.709> see<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.100> there's<00:04:16.340> a

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
going to slide so you see that there's a

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.150 
going to slide so you see that there's a
little<00:04:16.729> slider<00:04:17.150> ball<00:04:17.450> thumb<00:04:18.410> section<00:04:18.919> here

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
little slider ball thumb section here

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.340 
little slider ball thumb section here
put<00:04:19.400> your<00:04:19.430> thumb<00:04:19.700> under<00:04:19.910> there<00:04:20.120> move<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:21.200> up

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
put your thumb under there move that up

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.710 
put your thumb under there move that up
to<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.530> top<00:04:21.890> and<00:04:22.640> you<00:04:22.850> actually<00:04:23.240> then<00:04:23.390> get

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
to the top and you actually then get

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.920 
to the top and you actually then get
your<00:04:24.640> not-dead<00:04:25.640> up<00:04:25.820> close<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.330> flush<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.870> your

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
your not-dead up close and flush to your

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.140 
your not-dead up close and flush to your
bead<00:04:27.229> so<00:04:27.890> let's<00:04:28.070> add<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.250> crystal<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.000> can

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
bead so let's add a crystal so you can

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.920 
bead so let's add a crystal so you can
see<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.510> again<00:04:31.150> I'm<00:04:32.150> going<00:04:32.390> to<00:04:32.479> add<00:04:32.599> one<00:04:32.810> of

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
see that again I'm going to add one of

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.650 
see that again I'm going to add one of
my<00:04:33.080> rondell<00:04:33.620> crystals

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
my rondell crystals

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.220 
my rondell crystals
move<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.740> right<00:04:36.980> up<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:38.570> next<00:04:38.840> workable

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
move it right up to the next workable

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.780 
move it right up to the next workable
part<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.680> your<00:04:39.890> chain<00:04:41.260> over<00:04:42.260> my<00:04:42.560> fingers<00:04:43.070> and

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
part of your chain over my fingers and

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.910 
part of your chain over my fingers and
through<00:04:44.390> so<00:04:44.600> that's<00:04:44.720> just<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.380> beginning<00:04:45.830> of

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
through so that's just the beginning of

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.390 
through so that's just the beginning of
a<00:04:46.040> normal<00:04:46.460> knot<00:04:46.730> I<00:04:47.170> put<00:04:48.170> the<00:04:48.560> needle<00:04:48.980> through

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
a normal knot I put the needle through

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.120 
a normal knot I put the needle through
the<00:04:49.790> hole<00:04:50.260> pull<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.440> beads<00:04:51.620> up<00:04:51.800> nice<00:04:52.100> and

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
the hole pull the beads up nice and

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.070 
the hole pull the beads up nice and
close<00:04:52.430> you'll<00:04:52.820> see<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.090> my<00:04:53.270> crystal<00:04:53.840> is<00:04:53.930> now

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
close you'll see that my crystal is now

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.800 
close you'll see that my crystal is now
flush<00:04:54.500> up<00:04:54.710> to<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:54.950> needle<00:04:55.480> rotate<00:04:56.480> so<00:04:56.780> that

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
flush up to that needle rotate so that

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.260 
flush up to that needle rotate so that
my<00:04:57.080> thumb<00:04:57.470> offers<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:58.130> under<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.550> slider<00:04:58.910> and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
my thumb offers it under the slider and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.930 
my thumb offers it under the slider and
the<00:04:59.330> main<00:05:00.230> thread<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:00.830> I'm<00:05:01.010> pulling<00:05:01.610> this

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
the main thread and I'm pulling this

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.480 
the main thread and I'm pulling this
with<00:05:02.180> quite<00:05:02.510> a<00:05:02.540> bit<00:05:02.720> of<00:05:03.050> tension<00:05:03.310> because<00:05:04.310> it's

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
with quite a bit of tension because it's

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.200 
with quite a bit of tension because it's
the<00:05:04.640> tension<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.510> will<00:05:05.690> then<00:05:05.990> keep<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.880> knot

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
the tension that will then keep the knot

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.440 
the tension that will then keep the knot
right<00:05:09.020> up<00:05:09.320> close<00:05:09.530> to<00:05:09.860> your<00:05:09.980> bead<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:11.150> look<00:05:11.330> at

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
right up close to your bead and look at

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.410 
right up close to your bead and look at
how<00:05:11.980> beautiful<00:05:12.980> that<00:05:13.010> is<00:05:13.190> now<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.150> whole

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
how beautiful that is now the whole

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.330 
how beautiful that is now the whole
point<00:05:14.690> of<00:05:14.810> knotting<00:05:15.230> in<00:05:15.350> between<00:05:15.740> each<00:05:16.010> bead

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
point of knotting in between each bead

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.940 
point of knotting in between each bead
of<00:05:16.670> course<00:05:17.030> because<00:05:17.450> they're<00:05:18.110> beautiful

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
of course because they're beautiful

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.010 
of course because they're beautiful
beads<00:05:19.160> if<00:05:19.340> your<00:05:19.550> necklace<00:05:19.940> were<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.300> break<00:05:20.570> of

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
beads if your necklace were to break of

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.410 
beads if your necklace were to break of
course<00:05:21.290> you'd<00:05:21.410> only<00:05:21.560> ever<00:05:21.680> lose<00:05:22.040> one<00:05:22.400> bead<00:05:23.390> at

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
course you'd only ever lose one bead at

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.690 
course you'd only ever lose one bead at
a<00:05:23.630> time<00:05:23.660> but<00:05:24.290> look<00:05:24.470> at<00:05:24.590> how<00:05:24.710> fluid<00:05:25.190> it<00:05:25.340> is<00:05:25.460> you

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
a time but look at how fluid it is you

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.270 
a time but look at how fluid it is you
get<00:05:25.880> so<00:05:26.300> much<00:05:26.570> movement<00:05:27.040> when<00:05:28.040> you're

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
get so much movement when you're

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.340 
get so much movement when you're
actually<00:05:28.430> not<00:05:28.910> in<00:05:29.120> between<00:05:29.300> them<00:05:29.750> as<00:05:29.990> opposed

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
actually not in between them as opposed

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.520 
actually not in between them as opposed
to<00:05:30.530> having<00:05:30.740> a<00:05:31.040> strong<00:05:31.730> piece<00:05:32.210> so<00:05:33.170> you'll<00:05:33.410> be

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
to having a strong piece so you'll be

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.410 
to having a strong piece so you'll be
able<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.830> go<00:05:33.980> all<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.670> way<00:05:34.820> through<00:05:35.210> your

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
able to go all the way through your
