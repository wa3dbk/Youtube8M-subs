 zelda the game the console includes in 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.040
 digital format obviously downloadable 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 through a code that still owes me 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.200

 give a damn about what they had fencing 90 for 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.160
 a hundred percent larger than normal which is not 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.950
 including the power supply, however, he fucks us 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.390
 the fuck because they will have sent me 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.590

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.030

 part of the handbooks buy and here it comes 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.739
 still remembered that the power supply does not 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:06.450
 it's included so now we're going to proceed 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:15.150
 with a scalpel incision on ours 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:23.239
 box and trying not to destroy the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.239
 and change to unpack the bastard 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:34.470
 I always do a brothel to open 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:36.900
 these boxes ok so here's the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.359
 manual that you wait a moment 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.480

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.129
 1,000 million handbooks go 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:11.060
 respected but damned give me the 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:17.180
 my console and here we find the very cool 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:20.329
 nintendo 3ds xl gentlemen in this gold 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.479
 competing black gold 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:27.419
 you can really see I do it 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:32.940
 see a little well I don't know if mine 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:38.880
 super mega webcam focuses four 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:45.300
 we will come chain should there be one 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:47.389
 sd slot that I had to be included 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.389
 sd 4 gb 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.389
 exactly 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:59.360
 then what else is the volume is mine 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.910
 first nintendo 3ds ever had a 3ds life 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.880
 not even a ds and not even a cube e 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:10.000
 even a nintendo is my last 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:14.650
 was the infamous super nintendo and here 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.780
 I imagine that the slot goes inside 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.780
 for game cards 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.840
 let's see if I doubt it's loaded 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:32.090
 but we prove which side lights up 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:33.830
 I'm so power and load it works 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:41.170
 I do and I am the reflection of inside 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:41.170
 I work and even load 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:50.349
 you who do you if all Italian and then 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.860
 resumed in the three gods 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.749

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.749

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:36.130
 this very special console in the 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.650
 design that really impressed me 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.610
 immediately evolved design and I decided to 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:46.660
 take it so nothing i thought of 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.550
 recover some super mario some ho 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.800

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.140

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.170
 played in pokémon then watch del 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.670
 gameplay and make them are really different 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.490
 I don't mind gameplay though 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.590
 oh well I'll have to see a little like how 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.760

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:10.540
 turn off the fantastic 3d and therefore nothing 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.600
