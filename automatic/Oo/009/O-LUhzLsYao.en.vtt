 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.190
 skins 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.190
 today we are going to learn to fish bottles 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.620
 how would you do to fish a bottle with 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.809
 a match 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.850
 to use a video moment and go to more 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.500
 with the comments and tell us how 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.690
 would you do to fish this bottle 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.700
 yes with a match 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.710
 you have already put it, so let's see 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.910
 how it is done we simply have to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.910
 cut a piece of wool 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.850
 and we tie it in the match 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.250
 it is important that we leave it right 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.559
 in the center good we already have our 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.129
 town for bottles so now we're going 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.820
 Let's see if we put fishing and give it 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.820
 a shot 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.620
 Y 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.339
 but how is it possible that with a simple 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.949
 thread and a match we are able to 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.589
 fish bottles, even if it looks like 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.229
 incredible we have made a kind of hook 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.850
 that was used thousands of years ago in 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 prehistory and it consisted simply 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.979
 in tying a bit of bone to strips 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.020
 leather the bag is easily worked 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.180
 in the mouth of the fish but when pulling it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.399
 it got stuck like in the bottle and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.320
 that's how they got to fish fish in 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.670
 the prehistory so nothing we hope 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.070
 that as you see at home to fish a 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.080
 bunch of bottles and you know dalai 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.340
 favorites follow us in our networks 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.810
 social issues that we leave below in the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.429
 description and if you do not have to tell your 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.869
 parents who do and we already see in the 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.869
 next video until next time 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.110
 fish fish 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.760
 I have my pet 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.140
 love with that method
