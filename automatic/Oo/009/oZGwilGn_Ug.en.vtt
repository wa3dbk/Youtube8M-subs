00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.020 
difficult period has has actually helped
because<00:05:44.480> I<00:05:45.230> think<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:45.830> perspective<00:05:46.220> that

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
because I think the perspective that

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.620 
because I think the perspective that
says<00:05:47.360> look<00:05:48.580> yeah<00:05:49.580> things<00:05:50.030> are<00:05:50.240> tough<00:05:50.510> right

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
says look yeah things are tough right

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.200 
says look yeah things are tough right
now<00:05:50.780> but<00:05:51.170> it<00:05:51.770> doesn't<00:05:52.190> change<00:05:52.460> our<00:05:52.850> chance

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
now but it doesn't change our chance

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.840 
now but it doesn't change our chance
doesn't<00:05:53.870> change<00:05:54.080> our<00:05:54.260> opportunity<00:05:54.950> so<00:05:55.580> far<00:05:55.820> I

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
doesn't change our opportunity so far I

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.730 
doesn't change our opportunity so far I

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740
