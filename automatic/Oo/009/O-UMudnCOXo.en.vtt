00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
I'm sure if we're going to do a part for

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.910 
I'm sure if we're going to do a part for
in<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.430> back<00:00:39.140> then<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.260> course<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
in the back then of course we have a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:51.390 
in the back then of course we have a
galaxy<00:00:41.430> s3

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.060 

of<00:00:51.760> course<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.180> black<00:00:52.420> isn't<00:00:52.660> or<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.740> back<00:00:53.890> is

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
of course the black isn't or the back is

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.420 
of course the black isn't or the back is
back<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:54.670> omega-3<00:00:55.540> synthetic<00:00:56.170> so<00:00:56.380> you<00:00:56.830> easily

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
back in omega-3 synthetic so you easily

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.830 
back in omega-3 synthetic so you easily
be<00:00:57.610> able<00:00:57.700> to<00:00:58.090> swap<00:00:58.540> that<00:00:59.580> okay<00:01:00.580> so<00:01:00.720> let's<00:01:01.720> just

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
be able to swap that okay so let's just

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.510 
be able to swap that okay so let's just
go<00:01:01.960> ahead<00:01:01.990> and<00:01:02.230> do<00:01:02.470> this<00:01:02.650> should<00:01:03.160> we<00:01:03.250> go<00:01:03.340> ahead

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
go ahead and do this should we go ahead

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.030 
go ahead and do this should we go ahead
song<00:01:03.880> like<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:04.350> let's<00:01:05.350> go<00:01:05.530> ahead<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.770> swim

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
song like this let's go ahead and swim

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:31.430 
song like this let's go ahead and swim
in

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:40.680 

here<00:01:32.440> we<00:01:32.740> go<00:01:35.220> say<00:01:38.940> I'm<00:01:39.940> sure<00:01:40.180> if<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.330> did<00:01:40.509> the

ahead and do the same thing on the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:26.050 
ahead and do the same thing on the
galaxy<00:01:53.710> s3<00:01:55.140> let's<00:01:56.140> go<00:01:56.320> ahead

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
this on any of these screens but they

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
this on any of these screens but they

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
seems to be handling that pretty good

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.630 
seems to be handling that pretty good
both<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.150> them<00:03:52.280> that's<00:03:53.280> kind<00:03:53.490> of<00:03:53.520> nice<00:03:54.920> see<00:03:55.920> pop

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
both of them that's kind of nice see pop

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.380 
both of them that's kind of nice see pop
up<00:03:56.820> or<00:03:57.410> galaxy<00:03:58.410> phone<00:03:58.650> up<00:03:58.890> here<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:03.090> course

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
up or galaxy phone up here of course

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.770 
up or galaxy phone up here of course
this<00:04:03.690> one's<00:04:03.990> rocking<00:04:04.410> real<00:04:04.620> last<00:04:04.950> two<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:06.450> I

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
this one's rocking real last two so I

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.040 
this one's rocking real last two so I
think<00:04:07.020> it<00:04:07.200> should<00:04:07.350> be<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.530> little<00:04:07.800> stronger<00:04:09.050> but

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
think it should be a little stronger but

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.539 
think it should be a little stronger but
I<00:04:10.080> mean<00:04:10.320> who<00:04:10.530> knows<00:04:12.770> let's<00:04:13.770> go<00:04:13.950> ahead<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.340> do<00:04:14.700> a

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
I mean who knows let's go ahead and do a

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:24.530 
I mean who knows let's go ahead and do a
see<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.880> one
