00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you here as you see I'm using small

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
you here as you see I'm using small
scissors<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.700> first<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.210> start<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.750> very

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
scissors and first I start with a very

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.889 
scissors and first I start with a very
small<00:00:46.140> opening<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.820> push<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> icing

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
through and I determined whether I need

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.889 
through and I determined whether I need
the<00:00:51.180> bigger<00:00:51.360> hole<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:51.870> smaller<00:00:52.489> so<00:00:53.539> that's<00:00:54.539> how

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the bigger hole or smaller so that's how

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.130 
the bigger hole or smaller so that's how
that's<00:00:55.110> done<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.149> start<00:00:57.510> with

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that's done and then you can start with

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590 
that's done and then you can start with
