00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
creativity into it I mean I should be

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.480 
creativity into it I mean I should be
experimenting<00:00:13.259> wildly<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:13.980> that's<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.400> I'm

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
something that really think I could make

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.390 
something that really think I could make
my<00:00:21.779> niche<00:00:21.960> because<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.470> won't<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
my niche because I won't what in the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
pretty limited first I didn't really

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.720 
pretty limited first I didn't really
think<00:00:27.349> like<00:00:28.349> there<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.740> there<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.519> much<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
creative aspect of photography but then

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.139 
creative aspect of photography but then
I<00:00:31.679> saw<00:00:31.920> some<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.219> pictures<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.910> some

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
I saw some of the pictures of like some

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.600 
I saw some of the pictures of like some

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
like that but um well easily simply put

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.850 
like that but um well easily simply put
I<00:00:41.480> couldn't<00:00:42.480> draw<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> camera<00:00:43.440> could

towards that goal you keep on going and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.720 
towards that goal you keep on going and
when<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> reach<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.980> may<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.550> been<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
when you reach it it may have been a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.910 
when you reach it it may have been a
long<00:00:53.969> path<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.199> do<00:00:55.350> end<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.680> at

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
long path but you you do end up at

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.130 
long path but you you do end up at
something<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> piece<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> art

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
something and think it is a piece of art

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.540 
something and think it is a piece of art
what<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.500> create<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> end<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
what you create at the end because you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.040 
what you create at the end because you
are<00:00:59.699> manipulating<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.510> lot<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> things<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
are manipulating a lot of things that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.770 
are manipulating a lot of things that
you<00:01:01.079> are<00:01:01.289> pouring<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.949> lot<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.579> creativity<00:01:03.059> into

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you are pouring a lot of creativity into

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.929 
you are pouring a lot of creativity into
it

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.389 

art<00:01:09.939> isn't<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.840> motion<00:01:11.200> felt<00:01:11.680> by<00:01:11.860> someone<00:01:12.250> but

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
art isn't a motion felt by someone but

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.819 
art isn't a motion felt by someone but
it's<00:01:12.729> turned<00:01:12.939> into<00:01:13.119> either<00:01:13.840> an<00:01:14.049> object<00:01:14.530> or<00:01:14.710> an

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
it's turned into either an object or an

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.840 
it's turned into either an object or an
image<00:01:15.100> or<00:01:15.340> a<00:01:15.369> sound<00:01:15.640> something<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.360> can<00:01:16.539> be

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
image or a sound something that can be

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.730 
image or a sound something that can be
observed<00:01:18.850> with<00:01:19.420> your<00:01:19.600> five<00:01:19.810> senses<00:01:20.049> well<00:01:20.710> I

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
observed with your five senses well I

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
it I mean exposure it's no different

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.260 
it I mean exposure it's no different
