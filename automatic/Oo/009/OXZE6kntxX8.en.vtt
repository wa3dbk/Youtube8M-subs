for facil second i think that the mesut
ozil<00:05:13.110> is<00:05:13.169> a<00:05:13.320> very<00:05:13.590> good<00:05:13.770> player<00:05:13.979> was<00:05:14.310> very

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
ozil is a very good player was very

in<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:19.340> position<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:20.370> place<00:05:20.729> or<00:05:21.180> seal<00:05:21.419> I

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
in the position that place or seal I

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.210 
in the position that place or seal I
think<00:05:21.750> we<00:05:21.870> have<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.229> debate<00:05:22.590> we<00:05:22.919> need<00:05:23.070> we

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
think we have the debate we need we

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.100 
think we have the debate we need we
don't<00:05:23.250> need<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:24.060> that<00:05:24.270> position<00:05:24.450> more<00:05:24.840> players

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.510 
don't need in that position more players
that's<00:05:25.740> why<00:05:25.860> we<00:05:26.039> didn't<00:05:26.250> brink<00:05:26.490> another<00:05:26.760> play

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
that's why we didn't brink another play

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.410 
that's why we didn't brink another play
