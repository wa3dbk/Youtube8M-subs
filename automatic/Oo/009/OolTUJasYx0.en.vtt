not<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.869> only<00:00:25.019> solar<00:00:25.380> panel<00:00:25.800> there<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.789> it

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
not my only solar panel there but it

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.439 
not my only solar panel there but it
helps<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.480> charge<00:00:27.750> my<00:00:27.930> phone
