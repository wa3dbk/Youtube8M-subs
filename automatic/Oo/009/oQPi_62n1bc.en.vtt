instincts and if they were absolutely
right<00:04:40.330> I've<00:04:41.330> never<00:04:41.539> ever<00:04:41.870> seen<00:04:42.020> kings<00:04:42.560> folded

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
right I've never ever seen kings folded

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.090 
right I've never ever seen kings folded
preflop<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.550> this<00:04:43.639> format<00:04:44.030> before<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.199> mean

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
preflop in this format before and I mean

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.770 
preflop in this format before and I mean
that's<00:04:46.850> one<00:04:47.030> of<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.180> greatest<00:04:47.360> laydowns

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
that's one of the greatest laydowns

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.590 
that's one of the greatest laydowns
we've<00:04:47.930> ever<00:04:48.020> seen<00:04:48.320> yeah<00:04:48.770> one<00:04:49.039> of<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.160> worst<00:04:49.600> it

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
we've ever seen yeah one of the worst it

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.050 
we've ever seen yeah one of the worst it
was<00:04:50.780> a<00:04:50.810> great<00:04:51.020> lay<00:04:51.260> down<00:04:51.470> he<00:04:52.400> had<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.610> instinct

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
was a great lay down he had the instinct

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.850 
was a great lay down he had the instinct
that<00:04:53.150> collect<00:04:53.750> his<00:04:53.870> had<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.080> hand<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:54.530> he<00:04:54.680> did

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
that collect his had a hand and he did

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.100 
that collect his had a hand and he did
so<00:04:55.130> he<00:04:55.160> was<00:04:55.430> right<00:04:55.669> you<00:04:56.389> can't<00:04:56.690> take<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:57.050> away

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
so he was right you can't take that away

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.969 
so he was right you can't take that away
from<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.620> guy<00:04:58.090> 98<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.389> 99<00:05:00.050> times<00:05:00.349> it's<00:05:00.710> the

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
from the guy 98 that a 99 times it's the

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.770 
from the guy 98 that a 99 times it's the
great<00:05:01.820> move<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.060> put<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.360> chips<00:05:02.599> in<00:05:02.720> the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
great move to put the chips in the

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.150 
great move to put the chips in the
middle<00:05:02.810> but<00:05:03.139> this<00:05:03.289> time<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.620> was<00:05:03.710> correct<00:05:04.039> to

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
middle but this time it was correct to

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.279 
middle but this time it was correct to
fold<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.580> he<00:05:04.669> founded<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.360> great<00:05:05.750> play<00:05:06.020> and

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
fold and he founded the great play and

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.719 
fold and he founded the great play and
he<00:05:06.400> gives<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.669> trouble<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.150> hickman<00:05:08.300> instead

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
he gives the trouble to hickman instead

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.710 
he gives the trouble to hickman instead
hickman<00:05:10.729> would<00:05:10.880> have<00:05:10.970> found<00:05:11.090> it<00:05:11.210> much<00:05:11.479> easier

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
hickman would have found it much easier

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.100 
hickman would have found it much easier
