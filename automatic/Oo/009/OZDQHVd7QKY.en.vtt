00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.859
 when you tried to describe the basic machine of the world 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.559
 the question of Iran will naturally arise 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.239
 where to start 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.239
 Isaac Newton began with three fundamental principles 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.560
 the laws of the child 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.570
 with the incredible speed and elegance of an unleashed genius 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.919
 He explained the movement of almost everything 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.919
 and on the surface of the earth 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.210
 the three newton laws professional in their essence as published action 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.800
 enormously powerful 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 equal the mass concertation 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.570
 understand you came passion what you want to say and how to use it 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.320
 is the only thing that makes it possible to understand the mechanical universe 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.350
 At the same time understanding is enormous complexity 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 it may reside in that it seems pure and simple 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.640
 for example 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.770
 if you look at 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.280
 equal to m by a 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 immediately revealed complications 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.290
 as for jaime for a is a vector equation 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.390
 both strength and acceleration 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.170
 they are vectors 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.440
 in other words 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.800
 they have certain projections 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.150
 in tc the same there improving 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
 they must have the same address 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.720
 according to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.830
 presumed complication arises with the symbol 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.520
 for the celebration 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.490
 remember 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.230
 the acceleration is not the eave position 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.620
 nor the speed with which something changes position 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.990
 acceleration is how quickly the speed of aug 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.110
 the acceleration is the derivative of a drift 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.950
 and the simple equation denim ton efe equal to m by ap 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.709
 is a trial equation on the derivation of a derivative 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.839
 When a body is a massacre gravity exerts a force 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.499
 down of course 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:23.729
 And the result 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.729
 6 the celebration 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.989
 guil 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.199
 for iniesta 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.769
 The same admitted 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.499
 accelerates with strength 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.329
 in the same direction 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.789
 we will still see although complicated in its simplicity 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.219
 this is the well-known one in france 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.079
 now in the case of the fall of a body 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.079
 which is known as acceleration 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.849
 is constant for one thing and for another 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.059
 it's the same 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.039
 for all bodies are left 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.039
 /// 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.409
 I think it's more 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.459
 it's called efe
