00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.809 
be democratic government you cannot deal
with<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.349> regime<00:02:24.470> regime<00:02:24.800> will<00:02:25.099> never<00:02:25.310> be<00:02:25.790> a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.340 
good trade partner
I<00:02:28.770> think<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.820> if<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.180> European<00:02:30.870> Union<00:02:31.230> is

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
I think that if we European Union is

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.090 
I think that if we European Union is
really<00:02:31.980> wants<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.910> work<00:02:33.450> with

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
really wants to to work with
