00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
are all kind of approximate years you

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.780 
are all kind of approximate years you
know<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:02.890> you'll<00:02:03.010> different<00:02:03.520> books<00:02:03.640> will

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
know that you'll different books will

know that you'll different books will
give<00:02:03.820> them<00:02:04.240> there<00:02:04.600> they'll<00:02:04.810> differ<00:02:05.110> by<00:02:05.230> five

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
give them there they'll differ by five

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.200 
give them there they'll differ by five
years<00:02:05.740> one<00:02:05.950> way<00:02:06.070> or<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.310> other<00:02:06.340> but<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:06.730> our

years one way or the other but it's our

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.729 
years one way or the other but it's our
best<00:02:07.270> effort<00:02:07.780> at<00:02:07.870> reconstructing<00:02:08.530> things

based<00:02:09.039> on<00:02:09.249> some<00:02:09.519> of<00:02:09.549> these<00:02:09.700> outside<00:02:10.239> extra

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
based on some of these outside extra

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.720 
based on some of these outside extra
biblical<00:02:10.929> references<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.099> give<00:02:12.310> us<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.519> firm

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

and<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:13.490> we<00:02:13.550> can<00:02:13.700> kind<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.910> work<00:02:14.090> around

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
and then we can kind of work around

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.559 
and then we can kind of work around
those<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.709> army<00:02:15.980> general<00:02:16.130> J<00:02:16.520> who<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:17.330> about
