the time as I said very boring blades
are<00:01:14.179> made<00:01:14.360> up<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.350> exactly<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.770> same<00:01:15.950> base

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
are made up of the exactly the same base

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.089 
are made up of the exactly the same base
mix<00:01:16.520> as<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:18.110> anchovy<00:01:20.080> I've<00:01:21.080> just<00:01:21.709> added<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.069> few

little bits in there to toughen them up

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.350 
little bits in there to toughen them up
because<00:01:24.830> obviously<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.610> won't<00:01:25.789> do<00:01:25.910> ability

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
because obviously you won't do ability
