00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.029
 audience leader and I want to receive 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.490
 level that since after everything good 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.010
 welcome cattle teach us more 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.429
 once and aniela rasa that these critters 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.800
 cloth and Easter already invades our 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.480
 our studio our classes 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.220
 these jobs and who does to sell 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.880
 have to start more on promises of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.699
 now 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.640
 already in the middle of the morning make yourself a bunny 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.580
 not even that style that most uncles 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.520
 this was inspired by something 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.100
 It always changes right explains you give 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.620
 your touch your personality on this level 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.300
 but keep this style tilda as the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.520
 The dolls that we teach here seem 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.510
 Let's sign Let's start first. 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.629
 guidelines 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.930
 so as always is to prepare the mold right 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.329
 I really like the strong acetate , right? 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 It 's easier to work there. 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.620
 cut according to the indications 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.660
 has step by step is that already 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.940
 available to place this light 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.800
 of your jet, thank you already 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.159
 then put a point then the first 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.189
 thing will catch the fabric that is what the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.680
 body of the bunny is not going to 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.500
 that saying that you use 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 to make this museum unite flock uniformly 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.890
 But I put it there step by step 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.600
 also several other suggestions for 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 done that they do not think so 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.340
 can use the software has another one that 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.290
 good veil flame is also up to the filter 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.659
 even in the tone you can go to class using 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.430
 and this is what sometimes does not find 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.020
 easy that uniform 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 that's why its unifor Chi 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.450
 Cute texture, right? 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.540
 Can you play the child play a nap? 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.350
 cool to put it with him for this 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.479
 yourself and that's already a blanket 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.310
 antiallergic in there the tissue also 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.060
 help a lot, huh? 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.119
 they then go first 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.399
 pick up the fabric and donate flock there are the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.020
 statements what is once what is two 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.099
 Sometimes in comfort once 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.390
 There, it will scratch all around right. 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:15.530
 all molds as indicated right 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.120
 so this one of the body 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.720
 then you will cut out what you 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.170
 scratched and it will stay like this or I did not cut it 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:31.290
 once the little body and it is here that 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.390
 back twice remembering that 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.700
 this part or you fold fabric to 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.290
 become adult or else you by mold 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.580
 When you're doing a body, it's fine. 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.540
 right 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.200
 First we'll have everyone cut 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.170
 huh 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.209
 otto the stately 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.640
 the arms to head to ear 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.640
 in fact we put fabric once 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.739
 cotton and once this other focus of the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.050
 a charm too, right? 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.420
 and if then the body part would be 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.680
 these little things here we go to 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.680
 Sewing machine 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.200
 first we will sew this one 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.900
 in the template has a z 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.840
 I put a little card here so I go 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.400
 put me to know one as far as I 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.950
 I use it first 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.290
 I did not vote for a brochure and here I go 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.720
 let a space treat untapped 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.720
 then it did not come on my machine 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.260
 denies whistle wedge tilda first tip of 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.260
 art is wednesday 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:54.270
 this retrocesso alexandre short space 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.270
 from space and the seamstress 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.290
 it's process 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.200
 that's how it's going to look like the back 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.500
 of the dinha 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.970
 I'll join with the front 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.070
 then the fabric right with the right 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.489
 the back I'm going to fit right 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.489
 on here 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.210
 pin had 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:35.840
 It will all fit together. 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.719
 and now I used it on the sewing machine 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.639
 Every turn is how long we go. 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:42.620
 culturally but mine and I go to a 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.699
 pause and then back to give 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.789
 missing sequence 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:49.240
 the ending here of our old west 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.240
