00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
one of the most noticeable changes is

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.019 
one of the most noticeable changes is
the<00:00:18.420> size<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.869> cabinet<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:20.220> responded<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
the size of the cabinet we responded to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.810 
the size of the cabinet we responded to
the<00:00:21.240> feedback<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:23.039> online

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the feedback that we see on online

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.269 
the feedback that we see on online
forums<00:00:24.529> regarding<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> size<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460 
forums regarding the size of the
original<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.510> was<00:00:27.630> perhaps<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.199> little<00:00:28.289> too

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
original it was perhaps a little too

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.189 
original it was perhaps a little too
large<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.189> comfortably<00:00:29.849> fit<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.420> lots<00:00:31.019> of

large to comfortably fit in lots of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.880 
large to comfortably fit in lots of
furniture<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> our<00:00:33.059> challenge<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.600> how<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
furniture so our challenge was how to

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.319 
furniture so our challenge was how to
meet<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> performance<00:00:35.640> level<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.149> had

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
meet the performance level that we had

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.790 
meet the performance level that we had
with<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.719> c21

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
with the c21

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.450 
with the c21
but<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.460> smaller<00:00:39.090> cabinet<00:00:40.129> one<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> ways

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
but in a smaller cabinet one of the ways

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.569 
but in a smaller cabinet one of the ways
we've<00:00:41.640> done<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.590> change<00:00:43.590> from<00:00:43.770> five

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
we've done that is to change from five

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.529 
we've done that is to change from five
inch<00:00:44.760> drivers<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.600> four<00:00:45.899> inch<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.920> although

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
inch drivers to four inch now although

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
inch drivers to four inch now although
normally<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.719> would<00:00:48.960> compromise<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
normally this would compromise the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.189 
normally this would compromise the
performance<00:00:50.250> by<00:00:51.000> reengineering<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> four

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
performance by reengineering the four

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.490 
performance by reengineering the four
inch<00:00:52.320> driver<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.850> larger<00:00:54.629> excursion<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
inch driver to have larger excursion and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.090 
inch driver to have larger excursion and
better<00:00:56.399> linearity<00:00:57.410> low-frequencies<00:00:58.440> we've

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
better linearity low-frequencies we've

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
better linearity low-frequencies we've
been<00:00:59.219> able<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.489> retain<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.989> performance

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
been able to retain the performance
