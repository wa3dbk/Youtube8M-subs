00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.160

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.960
 practically is another yellow 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.920
 a touch of lack of it she was 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 can be considered one tuba green which 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.800
 here is presented but 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.050
 mixtures of yellow and ocher will be good to us 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.520
 help find interesting shades 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.739
 green pink dark interesting color but 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.840
 use it carefully because 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:11.729
 that he is very bright and intense only 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:16.179
 mixes i'll set this side aside and 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.229

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:21.299
 acrylic paints 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.420
 Neva palette set of identical 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.709
 the previous 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.880
 but only presented ten tight not 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:36.759
 there is no larger size 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:40.539
 another shade of ocher and lemon yellow you 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:44.520
 can choose sets according to your tasks 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:48.069
 for a longer and painstaking 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.569
 work is better to take large sets 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.569
 and for club student classes 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:58.200
 small sets will do 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:01.200
 this set is another manufacturer he me 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.350
 already started but it clearly shows what 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.409
 colors are used most often 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.920
 of course shades of yellow which 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.650
 involved writing light in the pictures but 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.769
 for this there are pipes that 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.550
 sold separately if some color y 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.209
 you are spent most intensively 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.310
 you can buy more 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:32.430
 individual teeth the colors that you 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:35.180
 need separately I want to say in whites then 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:40.980
 what is presented in any of these sets 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.260
 not enough for long work beat 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.540
 ends very quickly so i 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.540
 I use buy too 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:59.130
 jars of whites breed them in a container and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.680
 dipping wide brush work all over 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.230
 surface paintings 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.410
 if you are writing student work and not 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.060
 going to sell your painting 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:15.600
 Suitable acrylic white paint 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.819
 it is important that there always was 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.709
 marking or moisture resistant 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:25.769
 or washable paint paint with great 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:30.620
 the content of the chalk will not work it will 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:35.660
 eat up the color and the pictures will be faded and 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:39.650
 uninteresting after work 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.599
 it is better to cover the picture with acrylic varnish 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.109
 in stores it is represented by different 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:49.920
 manufacturers and better to take matte 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:54.959
 lacquer to 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.190
 hide already finished work on it all 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.190
 Thank you for your attention
