00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.520 
on it put on the lid but you're off the
cipro<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.580> mole<00:01:42.270> lighter<00:01:42.510> but<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.020> recommend

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
cipro on a mole lighter but I recommend

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.850 
cipro on a mole lighter but I recommend
a<00:01:43.620> Zippo<00:01:43.860> lighter<00:01:44.930> for<00:01:45.930> personal<00:01:46.350> reasons<00:01:46.500> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
a Zippo lighter for personal reasons of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.620 
a Zippo lighter for personal reasons of
course<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:49.550> one<00:01:50.750> two<00:01:52.070> three<00:01:53.300> four<00:01:54.500> five<00:01:55.520> six

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
course but one two three four five six

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:06.730 
course but one two three four five six
seven<00:01:57.630> eight<00:01:59.720> I<00:02:03.530> think<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:05.460> will<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.729> enough

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
seven eight I think this will be enough

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.090 
seven eight I think this will be enough
so<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.800> have<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:09.259> use<00:02:10.259> your<00:02:10.410> sticker<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
so you have to use your sticker on the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.830 
so you have to use your sticker on the
lid<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.600> indicate<00:02:12.600> if<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.050> hot<00:02:13.500> or<00:02:13.530> not<00:02:13.770> one

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
lid to indicate if it's hot or not one

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:24.020 
lid to indicate if it's hot or not one
two<00:02:16.040> three<00:02:18.200> five<00:02:19.250> six<00:02:20.250> seven<00:02:21.080> eight<00:02:22.080> nine<00:02:22.820> ten

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
two three five six seven eight nine ten

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.690 
two three five six seven eight nine ten
and<00:02:24.870> yes<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.620> sticker<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.070> red<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:28.110> means

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
and yes the sticker is red so that means

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.210 
and yes the sticker is red so that means
your<00:02:29.700> zippered<00:02:30.510> hand<00:02:30.660> warmer<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:31.019> warm<00:02:31.230> or<00:02:31.830> is

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
activated yes and it is very hot so you

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.199 
activated yes and it is very hot so you

you<00:03:09.880> know<00:03:10.530> also<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.590> cannot<00:03:12.270> really<00:03:15.150> guess

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
you know also you cannot really guess

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.940 
you know also you cannot really guess
how<00:03:16.630> long<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.930> says<00:03:17.230> warm<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.620> know<00:03:17.740> with

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
how long it says warm you know with

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.600 
how long it says warm you know with
amount<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.340> fluid<00:03:18.730> depends<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.810> what<00:03:19.990> Bernie

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
amount of fluid depends on what Bernie

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.040 
amount of fluid depends on what Bernie
on<00:03:21.610> what<00:03:21.820> quality<00:03:22.210> the<00:03:22.300> burn<00:03:22.480> areas<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:22.930> what

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
on what quality the burn areas and what

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.230 
on what quality the burn areas and what
quality<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:24.010> are<00:03:24.040> cutting<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.640> on<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.880> inside

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
quality you are cutting is on the inside

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.670 
quality you are cutting is on the inside
so<00:03:25.740> it's<00:03:26.740> getting<00:03:26.950> pretty<00:03:27.460> warm

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
so it's getting pretty warm

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.140 
so it's getting pretty warm
yes<00:03:29.680> it's<00:03:29.860> get<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.100> pretty<00:03:30.280> well<00:03:30.550> it's<00:03:30.790> very
