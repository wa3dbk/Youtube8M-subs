00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.590
 first of all to make this tutorial there 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.979
 you need any device between 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.689
 ios 5.0 and 7.0 points 6 because currently 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.909
 the software that will allow us to do 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.189
 cleaning supports that these versions 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.080
 and as it evolves and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.360
 will support other versions by the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.650
 next you need the software to be mirrored 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.810
 store which is available in the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.180
 description a usb cable to connect 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.950
 your device and finally I invite you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.650
 strongly to look at the little text link 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.600
 up in the description that sums up what 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.310
 is told on the official website not to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.540
 regret what you are going to do a 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.370
 once you own all these 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.890
 conditions you can restore your 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.720
 idevice thanks to the tutorial that will follow 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.740
 so you have the software to undergo 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.080
 story you just downloaded 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.909
 in the description on your computer 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.640
 which will allow you to restore your 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.690
 device without losing your jailbreak on 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.490
 the screen you can see currently 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.680
 my ipod touch with a few 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.930
 applications and global break stadium 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.790
 yesterday cydia and other apps that 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.200
 I installed afterwards you click 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.820
 so on this software 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.440
 do not forget about the crafted as 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.149
 as an administrator for not having 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.519
 problem and if you encounter any 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.860
 problems with this one test this 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.920
 first you click right on then 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.560
 you go into property 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.930
 then you go into compatibility and 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.060
 then put it in windows xp mode and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.290
 apply however for those who 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.400
 have no problem open the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.469
 normally 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.450
 connect your device to your 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.569
 computer and wait for the software 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.670
 recognize it 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.670
 most importantly we have nothing to report 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.249
 with apple for example itunes next 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.549
 as soon as your device is recognized it's 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:44.709
 simple you press semi restores the 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.299
 several stages will take place it can be 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.469
 that it takes a lot of time so 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.420
