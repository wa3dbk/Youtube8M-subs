rocket the whole way to the target which
gives<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> versatility<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.670> become

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
gives it the versatility to become

it<00:00:55.559> takes<00:00:55.920> quite<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> bit<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.489> practice<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.180> get

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it takes quite a bit of practice to get

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.120 
it takes quite a bit of practice to get
to<00:00:57.540> a<00:00:57.570> competent<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.410> proficient<00:00:59.070> level

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
against air vehicles with the S raw but

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.799 
against air vehicles with the S raw but
that's<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.399> why<00:01:02.790> we<00:01:03.000> play<00:01:03.149> video<00:01:03.510> games

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that's really why we play video games

like<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.259> to<00:01:04.470> practice<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.489> better

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
like this to practice and to get better

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.570 
like this to practice and to get better
to<00:01:06.960> become<00:01:07.259> experts<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.009> something<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
to become experts at something so it

challenge to the game and you'll see a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.630 
challenge to the game and you'll see a
lot<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> veteran<00:01:13.650> players<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.280> using

lot of veteran players out there using

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.430 
lot of veteran players out there using
the<00:01:14.790> estero<00:01:15.210> already<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
the estero already because they like the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.160 
the estero already because they like the
challenge<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.920> brings<00:01:17.159> compared<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
challenge it brings compared to a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.899 
challenge it brings compared to a
stinger<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.200> igloo<00:01:19.710> against<00:01:20.190> terror<00:01:20.430> vehicles

stinger or igloo against terror vehicles

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.850 
stinger or igloo against terror vehicles
it's<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> same<00:01:21.930> reason<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.440> battlefield<00:01:22.830> 3

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
it's the same reason in battlefield 3

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.399 
it's the same reason in battlefield 3
everyone<00:01:23.340> loved<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.729> RPG<00:01:24.330> helicopters<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.290> was

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
everyone loved to RPG helicopters it was

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.010 
everyone loved to RPG helicopters it was
one<00:01:25.650> hit<00:01:25.860> kill<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.390> improved<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.510> lot<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.780> skill

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
one hit kill and improved a lot of skill

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.890 
one hit kill and improved a lot of skill
because<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.380> RPG<00:01:28.770> travel<00:01:29.189> slow<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.720> has

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
because the RPG travel slow and it has

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.010 
because the RPG travel slow and it has
an<00:01:31.170> arc<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.520> very<00:01:33.030> similar<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
an arc so it's very similar to that the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.660 
an arc so it's very similar to that the
era<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.799> little<00:01:34.920> bit<00:01:35.100> easier<00:01:35.580> in

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
era is actually a little bit easier in

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.730 
era is actually a little bit easier in
my<00:01:35.729> opinion<00:01:35.850> hit<00:01:36.450> air<00:01:36.630> B<00:01:36.780> goes<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> long<00:01:37.260> range

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
my opinion hit air B goes a long range

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.429 
my opinion hit air B goes a long range
width<00:01:38.420> here<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.659> see<00:01:39.810> its<00:01:39.930> versatility

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
width here you can see its versatility

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.380 
width here you can see its versatility

they<00:02:31.040> balance<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.700> air<00:02:31.850> out<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:33.410> it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
they balance the air out is that it

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.740 
they balance the air out is that it
doesn't<00:02:34.370> do<00:02:34.460> quite<00:02:34.670> as<00:02:34.970> much<00:02:35.120> damage<00:02:35.420> as<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
doesn't do quite as much damage as the

doesn't do quite as much damage as the
RPG<00:02:36.350> which<00:02:36.560> i<00:02:36.740> don't<00:02:36.860> think<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.490> big<00:02:37.760> deal

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
RPG which i don't think is a big deal

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.720 
RPG which i don't think is a big deal
because<00:02:38.210> it's<00:02:38.600> still<00:02:38.870> very<00:02:39.050> effective<00:02:39.800> but

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
because it's still very effective but

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.000 
because it's still very effective but
you're<00:02:40.940> completely<00:02:41.840> vulnerable<00:02:42.320> while<00:02:42.860> you

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
you're completely vulnerable while you

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.890 
you're completely vulnerable while you
fired<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:43.640> here<00:02:43.850> I'm<00:02:44.030> standing<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.630> have<00:02:44.750> to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
fired so here I'm standing I have to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.770

transit<00:02:50.390> there<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:52.010> don't<00:02:52.250> like<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:52.580> part

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030

transit there so I don't like that part
of<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.270> it's<00:02:53.510> unlike<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.970> S<00:02:55.970> raw<00:02:56.300> or<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.410> I'm

launchers<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:04.370> estero<00:03:05.030> leaves<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.510> very

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
launchers the estero leaves you very

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.280 
launchers the estero leaves you very
vulnerable<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:07.040> that's<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:08.050> disadvantage<00:03:09.050> to

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
vulnerable so that's a disadvantage to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.050 
vulnerable so that's a disadvantage to
it<00:03:09.380> but<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.680> makes<00:03:09.860> up<00:03:10.040> for<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.310> because<00:03:10.460> I<00:03:10.910> mean

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
it but it makes up for it because I mean

it but it makes up for it because I mean
look<00:03:11.240> at<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.390> shot<00:03:11.600> on<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:11.900> boat<00:03:12.400> while<00:03:13.400> that

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
look at the shot on this boat while that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.920 
look at the shot on this boat while that
shot<00:03:13.940> wouldn't<00:03:14.330> have<00:03:14.420> been<00:03:14.540> too<00:03:14.660> difficult

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
shot wouldn't have been too difficult

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.740 
shot wouldn't have been too difficult
with<00:03:15.320> an<00:03:15.410> RPG<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.010> lot<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.250> practice<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:17.600> can

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
with an RPG in a lot of practice you can

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.870 
with an RPG in a lot of practice you can
see<00:03:17.990> the<00:03:18.620> waves<00:03:18.890> make<00:03:19.220> these<00:03:19.400> follow-up<00:03:19.790> shots

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
see the waves make these follow-up shots

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.260 
see the waves make these follow-up shots
very<00:03:20.420> difficult<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:22.340> estero<00:03:22.700> makes<00:03:23.000> it

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
very difficult and the estero makes it

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.850 
very difficult and the estero makes it
possible<00:03:23.510> for<00:03:23.780> me<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.080> actually<00:03:24.320> take<00:03:24.710> this

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
possible for me to actually take this

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.610 
possible for me to actually take this
boat<00:03:25.130> out<00:03:25.160> from<00:03:25.670> this<00:03:25.970> distance<00:03:26.480> while<00:03:27.410> it's

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
boat out from this distance while it's

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.110 
boat out from this distance while it's
moving<00:03:27.860> around<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.460> being<00:03:28.580> pushed<00:03:28.850> up<00:03:29.000> and

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
moving around and being pushed up and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.700 
moving around and being pushed up and
down<00:03:29.330> by<00:03:29.540> these<00:03:29.720> waves<00:03:30.020> so<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.350> can<00:03:30.470> see<00:03:30.680> I

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
down by these waves so you can see I

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.260 
down by these waves so you can see I
kind<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.190> learned<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.550> I<00:03:31.580> gotta<00:03:31.850> just<00:03:31.940> guide

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
kind of learned that I gotta just guide

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.760 
kind of learned that I gotta just guide
it<00:03:32.300> in<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.630> little<00:03:32.840> high<00:03:32.960> let<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.320> waves<00:03:33.530> carry

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
it in a little high let the waves carry

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.220 
it in a little high let the waves carry
the<00:03:33.950> boat<00:03:34.130> up<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.300> get<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.510> good<00:03:35.690> hit<00:03:35.870> on<00:03:35.930> it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
the boat up and I get a good hit on it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.440 
the boat up and I get a good hit on it
so<00:03:37.390> it's<00:03:38.710> very<00:03:39.710> very<00:03:40.000> versatile<00:03:41.000> in<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.240> way<00:03:41.390> it

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
so it's very very versatile in a way it

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.250 
so it's very very versatile in a way it
can<00:03:41.690> kill<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.320> many<00:03:42.350> different<00:03:42.860> things<00:03:43.340> and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
can kill so many different things and

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.810 
can kill so many different things and
again<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.440> really<00:03:45.710> kind<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.370> one<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.730> those

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
again it really kind of is one of those

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.520 
again it really kind of is one of those
fun<00:03:47.030> weapons<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.660> let<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:48.050> show<00:03:48.290> off<00:03:48.320> some

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
fun weapons that let you show off some

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.000 
fun weapons that let you show off some
skill<00:03:49.330> practicing<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.450> really<00:03:50.870> good<00:03:51.080> with<00:03:51.290> but

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
skill practicing it really good with but

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.040 
skill practicing it really good with but
I<00:03:52.040> find<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.610> really<00:03:52.790> excels<00:03:53.270> at<00:03:53.450> range<00:03:53.750> as<00:03:54.020> well

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
I find it really excels at range as well

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.630 
I find it really excels at range as well
I<00:03:54.230> think<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.740> lot<00:03:54.770> of<00:03:54.920> these<00:03:55.040> shots<00:03:55.340> would<00:03:55.490> be

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
I think a lot of these shots would be

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.260 
I think a lot of these shots would be
very<00:03:55.790> difficult<00:03:56.090> with<00:03:56.570> an<00:03:56.690> RPG<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.880> RPGs

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
very difficult with an RPG and the RPGs

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.670 
very difficult with an RPG and the RPGs
got<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.450> lot<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.660> drop<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.140> it's<00:04:00.350> got<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.530> pretty

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
got a lot of drop and it's got a pretty

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.020 
got a lot of drop and it's got a pretty
slow<00:04:00.890> travel<00:04:01.130> time<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.580> don't<00:04:01.730> know<00:04:01.790> how<00:04:01.880> they

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
slow travel time I don't know how they

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.600 
slow travel time I don't know how they
stack<00:04:02.270> up<00:04:02.300> on<00:04:02.630> paper<00:04:02.900> necessarily<00:04:03.709> I<00:04:03.890> don't

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
stack up on paper necessarily I don't

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.280 
stack up on paper necessarily I don't
really<00:04:04.760> look<00:04:04.940> at<00:04:05.060> paper<00:04:05.300> stats<00:04:05.690> too<00:04:05.930> much<00:04:06.110> when

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
really look at paper stats too much when

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.520 
really look at paper stats too much when
I<00:04:06.320> play<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.910> just<00:04:07.910> like<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.480> use<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.080> weapon<00:04:09.380> and

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
I play I just like to use the weapon and

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.860 
I play I just like to use the weapon and
see<00:04:09.709> how<00:04:09.860> it<00:04:10.010> handles<00:04:10.160> in<00:04:10.430> my<00:04:10.550> hands<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.030> I've

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
see how it handles in my hands and I've

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.690 
see how it handles in my hands and I've
been<00:04:11.990> using<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.350> S<00:04:12.500> raw<00:04:12.770> and<00:04:12.980> absolutely

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
been using the S raw and absolutely

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.730 
been using the S raw and absolutely
loving<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.630> also<00:04:14.959> has<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.350> advantage<00:04:15.680> of

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
loving it it also has the advantage of

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.050 
loving it it also has the advantage of
being<00:04:15.800> lock-on<00:04:16.790> capable<00:04:17.390> so<00:04:17.540> someone<00:04:17.870> gets<00:04:18.049> a

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
being lock-on capable so someone gets a

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.849 
being lock-on capable so someone gets a
designation<00:04:20.060> on<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.600> lav<00:04:21.109> there<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.380> fire

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.380 
over the top of the building from safety
and<00:04:24.170> get<00:04:24.920> a<00:04:24.950> really<00:04:25.400> nice<00:04:25.580> hit<00:04:25.820> on<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.150> and
