hi<00:00:05.970> guys<00:00:06.210> I'm<00:00:06.480> Taj<00:00:06.660> Burrow<00:00:06.870> I'm<00:00:07.350> here<00:00:07.590> to

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
hi guys I'm Taj Burrow I'm here to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.350 
hi guys I'm Taj Burrow I'm here to
demonstrate<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.400> super<00:00:08.730> hydrophobic

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
demonstrate the super hydrophobic

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.230 
demonstrate the super hydrophobic
qualities<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.139> nano<00:00:10.440> tune<00:00:11.000> just<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.150> I've

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
qualities of nano tune just here I've

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.240 
qualities of nano tune just here I've
got<00:00:12.270> two<00:00:12.690> little<00:00:12.809> water<00:00:13.050> bottles<00:00:13.349> there's<00:00:14.010> on

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
got two little water bottles there's on

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.010 
got two little water bottles there's on
there's<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:14.730> water<00:00:14.969> with<00:00:15.300> red<00:00:15.480> dye<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.870> each

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
there's just water with red dye and each

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.190 
there's just water with red dye and each
and<00:00:16.259> one's<00:00:17.009> been<00:00:17.220> treated<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:18.090> hasn't<00:00:18.330> so

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
and one's been treated and one hasn't so

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.769 
and one's been treated and one hasn't so
as<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.340> give<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:20.670> shake<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
as you see I give it all shake up the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.859 
as you see I give it all shake up the
the<00:00:22.500> untreated<00:00:23.010> bottle<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.520> quite<00:00:24.510> coded

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the untreated bottle is a quite coded

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.510 
the untreated bottle is a quite coded
mortem<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> guess<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:26.010> did<00:00:26.130> create<00:00:26.340> quite

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
mortem so I guess they did create quite

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.960 
mortem so I guess they did create quite
a<00:00:26.580> bit<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.789> drag<00:00:27.000> first<00:00:27.539> step<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.850> just<00:00:29.850> hit

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
a bit of drag first step is a just hit

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.790 
a bit of drag first step is a just hit
it<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.180> pre<00:00:30.449> tuna<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.529> one's

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
it with the pre tuna this one's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.880 
it with the pre tuna this one's
basically<00:00:32.519> just<00:00:32.699> cleans<00:00:32.970> it<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.269> little

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
basically just cleans it up a little

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.639 
basically just cleans it up a little
still<00:00:34.890> even<00:00:35.129> spray<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.960> kind<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.200> clean<00:00:37.469> up

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
still even spray is to kind of clean up

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.670 
still even spray is to kind of clean up
the<00:00:37.770> surface<00:00:40.910> just<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:45.590> it's<00:00:46.590> looking

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the surface just like that it's looking

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
the surface just like that it's looking
pretty<00:00:46.980> shiny<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.670> then<00:00:48.090> I'll<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.360> ready<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
pretty shiny and then I'll be ready to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.580 
pretty shiny and then I'll be ready to
stage<00:00:48.960> two<00:00:50.660> what's<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.780> boards<00:00:52.020> cleaned<00:00:52.379> up

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
stage two what's your boards cleaned up

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.580 
stage two what's your boards cleaned up
with<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> pretty<00:00:53.370> tune<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:54.870> go<00:00:54.989> stage<00:00:55.260> two

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
with the pretty tune you go stage two

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.100 
with the pretty tune you go stage two
which<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.460> speed<00:00:56.910> Tony<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.870> give<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
which is the speed Tony they give it a

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.889 
which is the speed Tony they give it a
good<00:00:58.199> shake<00:00:58.399> that's<00:00:59.399> important<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> nano

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
good shake that's important get the nano

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.770 
good shake that's important get the nano
particles<00:01:01.469> moving<00:01:01.680> around<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:03.090> yeah

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
particles moving around and then yeah

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
particles moving around and then yeah
just<00:01:04.140> apply<00:01:06.200> quick<00:01:07.200> process<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.070> takes<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
just apply quick process and it takes a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.370 
just apply quick process and it takes a
couple<00:01:08.430> minutes<00:01:10.250> even<00:01:11.450> application<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.290> then

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
couple minutes even application and then

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.450 
couple minutes even application and then
yeah<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.890> give<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.460> little<00:01:14.580> rub<00:01:14.820> around

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
yeah just give it a little rub around

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.890 
yeah just give it a little rub around
not<00:01:17.460> trying<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.760> rub<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> off<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.390> rub<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
not trying to rub it off but rub it in

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.609 
not trying to rub it off but rub it in
just<00:01:19.970> spread<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.000> evenly<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
just spread it evenly and you can do the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.899 
just spread it evenly and you can do the
fins<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> writers<00:01:28.909> just

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
fins and I like to do the writers just

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.140 
fins and I like to do the writers just
anything<00:01:30.210> hits<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> water<00:01:31.170> basically<00:01:33.799> and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
anything hits the water basically and

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.429 
anything hits the water basically and
there<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.450> couple<00:01:36.780> minutes<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> you're

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
there you go a couple minutes and you're

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.969 
there you go a couple minutes and you're
ready<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.770> play<00:01:39.200> xq<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.439> board<00:01:40.710> has<00:01:40.829> been

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
ready to play xq if your board has been

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.830 
ready to play xq if your board has been
nano<00:01:41.220> tuned<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:42.240> you're<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> buy<00:01:42.659> on

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
nano tuned if you're going to buy on

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.240 
nano tuned if you're going to buy on
your<00:01:42.990> board<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.680> want<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> look<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
your board you want to look for this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.969 
your board you want to look for this
