00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.940
 Hello friends mid week up 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.130
 the next review of the map is still far away 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.889
 but not to be bored, I suggest you 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.949
 today talk a little about balance in 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.050
 heroes of the storm recently nature 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.480
 told how they balance this group 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.910
 different approaches and ways of changing 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.670
 balance and although one of their past 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.189
 releases called imbalance so cool 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.320
 or that which caused a lot of coco 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.690
 buying and negatively minded 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.510
 individuals on different forms 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.910
 I am my whole even you are a boy 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.739
 You can be sure that the heroes 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.219
 Storms is handled by its professionals 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.500
 affairs on her account so much multiplayer 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.200
 games with the need to maintain a balance 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.800
 for healthy competition players that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.620
 they know exactly what to do but 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.410
 storm heroes of these people 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 it becomes complicated why yes because gram 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.899
 balance leveling 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.030
 character bearers of each other 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.070
 there is a need to balance 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 heroes are still relative to themselves 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.409
 Now I will explain what I mean 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.689
 balance the characters relative to others 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.010
 I think everything is clear necessary 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.840
 changes are made taking into account 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.570
 the effectiveness of this hero against 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.520
 other heroes in various stages and on 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.490
 different stages of the game on different 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.740
 maps 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.829
 so on and so forth this is that type 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.720
 balance which is present in many 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.240
 multiplayer games but as for 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.670
 second type namely balancing 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.009
 regarding the character itself, there are many 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.140
 will ask more for nonsense bears 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.360
 this guy on the video is just a matter of 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.729
 the fact that before our neighbor is the task 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.310
 do not the same hero spray 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.899
 with obvious priority in talent selection 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.060
 because then the idea disappears 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.740
 hero customization through the system 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.140
 talents in this case could 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.179
 just snap receipt 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.670
 additional abilities with level and 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.440
 I refuse to choose 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.600
 I think that yes really difficult 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.090
 task but judge for yourself for how many 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.729
 heroes you use a variety 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.100
 buildup of talents according to the card 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.380
 or enemy heroes or just 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.989
 play the hero in an unusual way 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.120
 I am sure that there are few such heroes for 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.670
 most characters exist like this 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.890
 called the main swing of talent 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.950
 simply because it is more efficient than others 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.200
 options one of the examples kick brought 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.660
 everything is clear enough and obvious on 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.130
 my opinion or selected talents 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.380
 are entering 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.450
 synergy with each other up by 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.430
 apart they don't seem so 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.260
 effective compared to other 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.390
 available at a certain level but 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.130
 together they give amazingly healthy 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.340
 effect for example you can notice it 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.140
 when i swing the shaft through w 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.240
 doesn't argue you can of course go for 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.890
 principles swing don't use talents with 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.110
 maximum efficiency but then 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.820
 What's the point of this 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.430
 Of course a lot is said about atalanka 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.130
 applicable to abilities in particular when 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.560
 Timati inside them but here is still more interesting 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.630
 other than efficiency factors which 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.390
 determines the peak profusion of the hero in 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.670
 many things like nazibo who would take it 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.830
 if not for his ulta doo but question i 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.290
 I think rhetorically except efficiency 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.800
 ability to go to the arena of balance 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.530
 which are differently valued in the pub and in 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.990
 teams yes what's the ability there 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.540
 such that heroes who bend women 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.790
 practically and completely unplayable in 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.220
 team games and vice versa will not 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.490
 go far take a leg and or given 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.980
 many thunderstorm pubs Illidan practically not 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.740
 stub in any team game this 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.380
 sheer headache balance everything 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.360
 it is for such work needed damn 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.390
 his not and his business and something to me 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.450
 suggests that blizzard have such 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.720
 what can be said at the end of the balance move 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.510
 has a layered structure and something 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.180
 it reminds me of a film started there only 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.340
 there was a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream and here 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.970
 this such levels of balance and unlike 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.459
 ate i hope the blizzards will get their oscar but 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.709
