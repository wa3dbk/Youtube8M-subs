is mr. g-man once again today I'm going
to<00:00:06.420> demonstrate<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:07.200> modularity<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
to demonstrate the modularity of the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.620 
to demonstrate the modularity of the
Malkoff<00:00:09.000> MD<00:00:09.480> 2<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.110> MD<00:00:10.440> 4<00:00:11.059> systems<00:00:12.059> how<00:00:12.599> they

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
Malkoff MD 2 and MD 4 systems how they

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.770 
Malkoff MD 2 and MD 4 systems how they
interchange<00:00:13.139> parts<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.160> also<00:00:14.519> how<00:00:14.730> they<00:00:15.599> go

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
interchange parts and also how they go

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320 
interchange parts and also how they go
together<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.500> first<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.340> MD<00:00:17.670> 2<00:00:17.970> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and the little contact tip I don't know

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.450 
and the little contact tip I don't know
if<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> camera<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.469> catch<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
if the camera can catch it but the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.700 
if the camera can catch it but the
little<00:01:02.699> contact<00:01:03.270> tip<00:01:03.769> right<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:06.500> faces<00:01:07.500> out

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
little contact tip right there faces out

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.490 
little contact tip right there faces out
because<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> change<00:01:09.750> modes<00:01:10.110> by

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
because that's going to change modes by

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.160 
because that's going to change modes by
making<00:01:10.920> contact<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.030> okay<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.930> zoom

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
making contact on this okay you can zoom

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.859 
making contact on this okay you can zoom
back<00:01:13.200> out<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.770> bit<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.750> with<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
back out a little bit so with the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.179 
back out a little bit so with the
resistor<00:01:16.350> faced<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:18.290> we're<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.439> fit<00:01:19.979> that

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
resistor faced in we're gonna fit that

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.609 
resistor faced in we're gonna fit that
in<00:01:20.430> there<00:01:20.670> until<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.420> feel<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.259> turning

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
in there until we feel that it's turning

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.249 
in there until we feel that it's turning
we<00:01:23.340> don't<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> cross<00:01:23.970> thread<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.390> any

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
we don't want to cross thread it any

on the long side that you can fit in and
I'll<00:01:32.970> turn<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.600> face<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> camera<00:01:34.380> once<00:01:34.560> I

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
I'll turn this to face the camera once I

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.069 
I'll turn this to face the camera once I
get<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:38.030> right<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.840> fit

get it in there right that you can fit

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.280 
get it in there right that you can fit
in<00:01:40.229> there<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:42.750> use<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
in there like this just use that to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.010 
in there like this just use that to
tighten<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.399> make<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.759> snug<00:01:45.180> you're

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
tighten it up you make it snug you're

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.770 
tighten it up you make it snug you're
not<00:01:46.200> torquing<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.799> down<00:01:47.119> with<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> lot<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
not torquing it down with a lot of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.240 
not torquing it down with a lot of
torque<00:01:50.030> but<00:01:51.030> you're<00:01:51.270> making<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.750> snug<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:53.130> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
torque but you're making it snug when it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.330 
torque but you're making it snug when it
warms<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.820> it'll<00:01:54.149> tighten<00:01:54.390> up<00:01:54.630> somewhat<00:01:55.340> if

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
warms up it'll tighten up somewhat if

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.959 
warms up it'll tighten up somewhat if
you're<00:01:56.579> making<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.090> snug<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.020> there<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:59.670> hold

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you're making that snug in there to hold

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.429 
you're making that snug in there to hold
the<00:02:00.860> module<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.009> place<00:02:02.960> provide<00:02:03.960> continuity

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the module in place provide continuity

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.080 
the module in place provide continuity
through<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> ring<00:02:06.439> all<00:02:07.439> right<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.789> cheat

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
through the ring all right I can cheat

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.860 
through the ring all right I can cheat
and<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.280 

so<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.409> by<00:02:13.560> feel<00:02:14.420> but<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:15.599> in<00:02:15.780> there

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
so you do it by feel but it's in there

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.250 
so you do it by feel but it's in there
it's<00:02:16.560> snug<00:02:17.840> right<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.290> rattling<00:02:19.799> loose

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
it's snug right it's not rattling loose

if I had an MC II module in here which
is<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.329> high<00:03:48.900> power<00:03:49.199> module<00:03:49.769> draws<00:03:50.069> about<00:03:50.370> 10

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
is a high power module draws about 10

is a high power module draws about 10
watts<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.120> power<00:03:51.299> I<00:03:51.660> could<00:03:52.199> run<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.560> off<00:03:52.769> the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
watts of power I could run it off the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.559 
watts of power I could run it off the
bigger<00:03:53.160> md4<00:03:53.879> with<00:03:54.150> -<00:03:54.329> 18<00:03:54.750> 650<00:03:55.260> batteries

bigger md4 with - 18 650 batteries

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.319 
bigger md4 with - 18 650 batteries
alright<00:03:57.569> I'm<00:03:57.720> going<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:57.959> switch<00:03:58.230> these<00:03:58.470> back

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
alright I'm going to switch these back

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:14.720 
alright I'm going to switch these back
I'm<00:04:00.329> gonna<00:04:00.480> try<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.810> be<00:04:00.989> quick<00:04:01.169> about<00:04:01.349> it

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.640 

and<00:04:15.730> there<00:04:16.540> we<00:04:16.660> go<00:04:16.870> -<00:04:19.050> fully<00:04:20.050> functional

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
and there we go - fully functional

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.520 
and there we go - fully functional
flashlights<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.810> concludes<00:04:23.260> this

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
flashlights and that concludes this

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.090 
flashlights and that concludes this
portion<00:04:23.830> of<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.670> testing
