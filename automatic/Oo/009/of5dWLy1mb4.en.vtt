okay<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:02.010> kind<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.340> further<00:00:02.520> explains<00:00:02.939> how

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay this kind of further explains how

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.889 
okay this kind of further explains how
the<00:00:03.149> anti-rattle<00:00:03.750> cone<00:00:05.000> kit<00:00:06.000> works<00:00:06.299> why<00:00:06.870> it

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
the anti-rattle cone kit works why it

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.900 
the anti-rattle cone kit works why it
works<00:00:07.519> what<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.639> does<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.480> c2<00:00:09.840> jet<00:00:10.080> pumps<00:00:10.380> from

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
works what it does the c2 jet pumps from

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.029 
works what it does the c2 jet pumps from
1989<00:00:12.740> early<00:00:13.740> 88<00:00:14.070> 89<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.969> 1997<00:00:15.839> did<00:00:16.619> not<00:00:16.800> come

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
1989 early 88 89 to 1997 did not come

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.769 
1989 early 88 89 to 1997 did not come
with<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.279> component<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:17.910> there<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.449> there's

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
with this component on there so there's

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.480 
with this component on there so there's
hundreds<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.470> thousands<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.890> Units<00:00:20.220> out<00:00:20.279> there

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
hundreds of thousands of Units out there

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.310 
hundreds of thousands of Units out there
that<00:00:20.640> don't<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.869> reason<00:00:22.020> why<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
that don't have this the reason why the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.900 
that don't have this the reason why the
jet<00:00:22.590> pumps<00:00:22.890> make<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> noise<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> back<00:00:23.760> is

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
jet pumps make a noise in the back is

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.710 
jet pumps make a noise in the back is
because<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.390> floating<00:00:24.660> bearing<00:00:25.650> system

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
because it's a floating bearing system

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.640 
because it's a floating bearing system
I'll<00:00:27.720> take<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.050> apart<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.529> can

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
I'll take this apart so you can

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.080 
I'll take this apart so you can
understand<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.310> yours<00:00:29.460> will<00:00:29.609> not<00:00:29.760> come<00:00:29.970> apart

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
understand but yours will not come apart

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.550 
understand but yours will not come apart
because<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> props<00:00:30.750> off<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.199> other<00:00:31.349> side

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
because the props off on the other side

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
because the props off on the other side
on<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> reason<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> makes<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
on this but the reason it makes the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
on this but the reason it makes the
noise<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.200> got<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.469> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
noise is because it's got this this

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.540 
noise is because it's got this this
thrust<00:00:35.670> bearing<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.380> there's<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.739> thrust

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
thrust bearing and there's a thrust

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.639 
thrust bearing and there's a thrust
washer<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.600> couples<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.050> against<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
washer that this couples up against and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.790 
washer that this couples up against and
it's<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.640> floating<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.719> there

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it's actually floating in there

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.410 
it's actually floating in there
it<00:00:44.070> does<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.430> oil<00:00:44.730> inside<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> cone

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it does have oil inside the cone

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.420 
it does have oil inside the cone
obviously<00:00:45.920> but<00:00:46.920> once<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.760> together

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
obviously but once this is all together

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.420 
obviously but once this is all together
it<00:00:50.430> makes<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:51.180> moves<00:00:51.570> back<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.930> forth<00:00:52.430> just

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it makes it moves back and forth just

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.340 
it makes it moves back and forth just
ever<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.820> slightly<00:00:53.850> creating<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.780> rattle

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
ever so slightly creating that rattle

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.540 
ever so slightly creating that rattle
noise<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.649> hear<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:55.920> jet<00:00:56.160> pump<00:00:56.340> that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
noise you hear in your jet pump that

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.700 
noise you hear in your jet pump that
knocking<00:00:57.030> noise<00:00:57.059> which<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> very

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
knocking noise which is at the very

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.830 
knocking noise which is at the very
least<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> terrible<00:01:00.270> noise<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.750> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
least just a terrible noise to have to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
least just a terrible noise to have to
listen<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.620> does<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.039> this

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
listen to and what this does is this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.660 
listen to and what this does is this
completely<00:01:03.300> alleviates<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:05.309> knocking

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
completely alleviates that that knocking

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.100 
completely alleviates that that knocking
noise<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> reason<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.750> does<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
noise and the reason it does that is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.280 
noise and the reason it does that is
because<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.830> spring<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> Teflon

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
because it's got a spring with a Teflon

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.160 
because it's got a spring with a Teflon
flat<00:01:10.290> pusher<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.710> preloads<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:12.170> internal

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
flat pusher that preloads the internal

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.320 
flat pusher that preloads the internal
bearing<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.010> thrust<00:01:14.400> washer<00:01:14.580> truss<00:01:15.000> bearing

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
bearing the thrust washer truss bearing

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
bearing the thrust washer truss bearing
it<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.780> preloads<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.590> bit<00:01:16.770> puts<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it just preloads it a little bit puts a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.039 
it just preloads it a little bit puts a
little<00:01:17.189> bit<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.430> pressure<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
little bit of pressure on it so it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.330 
little bit of pressure on it so it
doesn't<00:01:19.320> make<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> knocking<00:01:19.920> noise<00:01:19.950> it's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
doesn't make that knocking noise it's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.149 
doesn't make that knocking noise it's
also<00:01:20.490> better<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.119> bearing<00:01:21.479> life<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.530> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
also better for the bearing life but it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
also better for the bearing life but it
comes<00:01:23.430> completely<00:01:23.790> assembled<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.780> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
comes completely assembled this is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.179 
comes completely assembled this is
exactly<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> cone

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
exactly what you get you get the cone

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.130 
exactly what you get you get the cone

the thrust the pusher spring already

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.399 
the thrust the pusher spring already
assembled<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.430> moves<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.880> down<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
assembled and it moves up and down and a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.620 
assembled and it moves up and down and a
new<00:01:34.530> o-ring<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.070> take<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> 3/16<00:01:36.000> hex<00:01:36.240> plug

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
new o-ring you take the 3/16 hex plug

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.649 
new o-ring you take the 3/16 hex plug
out<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.140> old<00:01:37.320> cone<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
out of your old cone and if you have a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.480 
out of your old cone and if you have a
metal<00:01:39.930> cone<00:01:40.110> heat<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.680> area<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
metal cone heat this area up with a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.600 
metal cone heat this area up with a
propane<00:01:42.270> torch<00:01:42.619> get<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> nice<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:43.920> warm<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
propane torch get it nice and warm and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.740 
propane torch get it nice and warm and
then<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.420> extract<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.960> 3/16<00:01:46.890> hex

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
then you can extract that 3/16 hex

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.179 
then you can extract that 3/16 hex
without<00:01:48.750> any<00:01:49.020> difficulty<00:01:49.619> usually<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
without any difficulty usually if you

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.440 
without any difficulty usually if you
don't<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:51.030> probably<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
don't do that you're probably going to

use the bolts to it to drive it down you
need<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.489> make<00:02:53.639> sure<00:02:53.669> that<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:53.969> rotate<00:02:54.359> it

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
need to make sure that you rotate it

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.920 
need to make sure that you rotate it
otherwise<00:02:55.919> you<00:02:56.489> know<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:56.849> may<00:02:57.569> have<00:02:57.599> pinched

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
otherwise you know you may have pinched

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.449 
otherwise you know you may have pinched
the<00:02:58.019> o-ring<00:02:58.349> so<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.680> can't<00:02:58.889> rotate<00:02:59.099> it

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
the o-ring so if you can't rotate it

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.909 
the o-ring so if you can't rotate it
like<00:02:59.819> that<00:03:00.090> then<00:03:01.019> you've<00:03:01.230> pinched<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.650> o-ring

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
like that then you've pinched the o-ring

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.129 
like that then you've pinched the o-ring
and<00:03:01.949> you<00:03:02.069> need<00:03:02.219> to<00:03:02.310> do<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.519> again<00:03:03.049> put<00:03:04.049> the
