00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
here it is right here so I got these

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150 
here it is right here so I got these
three<00:02:06.810> right<00:02:07.380> here

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
three right here

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.139 
three right here
and<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
and this one this one and

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.199 
and this one this one and
course<00:02:10.330> drift<00:02:11.200> from<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.799> from<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.700> United

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
course drift from the from the United

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.289 
course drift from the from the United
line<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.480> course<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.049> I<00:02:14.950> think<00:02:15.370> it's<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.790> this

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
line of course and I think it's the this

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.960 
line of course and I think it's the this
is<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.599> generations<00:02:17.440> line<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:18.250> has<00:02:18.459> drift<00:02:18.790> I

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
is the generations line that has drift I

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.270 
is the generations line that has drift I
