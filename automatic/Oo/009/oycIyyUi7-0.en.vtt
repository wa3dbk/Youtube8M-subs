00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.789 
see the action takes the league from
across<00:01:51.210> very<00:01:51.840> frustrating<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.710> know

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
across very frustrating to you know

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.200 
across very frustrating to you know
concede<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.310> across<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> looked<00:01:54.030> at<00:01:54.119> his

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
concede from across but I looked at his

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.310 
concede from across but I looked at his
goalkeeper<00:01:54.689> he's<00:01:54.810> got<00:01:54.899> an<00:01:54.990> informed

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
goalkeeper he's got an informed

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
goalkeeper he's got an informed
goalkeeper<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.399> thought<00:01:56.640> maybe<00:01:57.030> he

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
goalkeeper in and I thought maybe he

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.490 
goalkeeper in and I thought maybe he
isn't<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> strong<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> wanted<00:01:58.380> to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
isn't all that strong and I wanted to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
isn't all that strong and I wanted to
test<00:01:58.740> him<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.009> as<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.340> we<00:01:59.969> scored<00:02:00.509> a

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
unfortunately that was one of them so

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.850 
unfortunately that was one of them so
that<00:05:35.940> means<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.360> titles<00:05:36.750> out<00:05:36.900> of<00:05:37.110> reach<00:05:37.320> but

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
that means the titles out of reach but

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.680 
that means the titles out of reach but
