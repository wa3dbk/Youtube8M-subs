00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.970 

you<00:00:10.840> may<00:00:10.960> have<00:00:11.050> noticed<00:00:11.230> that<00:00:11.559> whenever<00:00:11.680> you

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
you may have noticed that whenever you

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.930 
you may have noticed that whenever you
print<00:00:12.280> your<00:00:12.430> images<00:00:12.790> to<00:00:13.000> just<00:00:13.360> about<00:00:13.480> any

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
print your images to just about any

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.599 
print your images to just about any
device<00:00:14.299> they<00:00:15.259> very<00:00:15.559> often<00:00:15.769> print<00:00:16.160> darker<00:00:16.460> than

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
device they very often print darker than

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.220 
device they very often print darker than
you<00:00:16.670> expect<00:00:17.000> them<00:00:17.150> to<00:00:17.180> and<00:00:17.449> sometimes<00:00:17.810> a<00:00:17.990> lot

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
you expect them to and sometimes a lot

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.560 
you expect them to and sometimes a lot
darker<00:00:18.640> one<00:00:19.640> of<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:19.789> reason<00:00:20.119> for<00:00:20.210> this<00:00:20.330> is

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
darker one of the reason for this is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.720 
darker one of the reason for this is
something<00:00:20.750> called<00:00:21.050> dot<00:00:21.439> game<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:21.950> unless

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
something called dot game and unless

this dot gang-related darkening of your

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.060 
this dot gang-related darkening of your
images<00:00:29.270> if<00:00:29.960> you<00:00:30.020> remember<00:00:30.410> earlier<00:00:30.619> in<00:00:30.950> the

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
images if you remember earlier in the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.369 
images if you remember earlier in the
course<00:00:31.160> we<00:00:31.880> talked<00:00:32.090> about<00:00:32.210> how<00:00:32.599> printed

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
course we talked about how printed

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.930 
course we talked about how printed
images<00:00:33.710> are<00:00:33.829> constructed<00:00:34.340> out<00:00:34.460> of<00:00:34.489> halftone

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
images are constructed out of halftone

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.569 
images are constructed out of halftone
dots<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:36.290> tonality<00:00:36.620> that<00:00:36.920> you<00:00:37.190> see<00:00:37.370> in<00:00:37.460> an

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
dots and the tonality that you see in an

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.040 
dots and the tonality that you see in an
image<00:00:37.820> that<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:38.000> how<00:00:38.239> dark<00:00:38.510> it<00:00:38.629> is<00:00:38.750> what<00:00:38.960> the

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
image that is how dark it is what the

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.990 
image that is how dark it is what the
tonal<00:00:39.350> range<00:00:39.379> of<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.710> images<00:00:40.039> is<00:00:40.489> determined

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
tonal range of the images is determined

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.430 
tonal range of the images is determined
by<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.149> size<00:00:41.450> of<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.809> half<00:00:41.930> turned<00:00:42.170> out<00:00:42.289> as

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
by the size of the half turned out as

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.840 
by the size of the half turned out as
well<00:00:42.469> as<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.829> spacing<00:00:43.100> depend<00:00:43.520> upon<00:00:43.730> the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
well as the spacing depend upon the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.239 
well as the spacing depend upon the
screening<00:00:44.180> technology<00:00:44.750> well<00:00:45.590> if<00:00:45.829> you<00:00:45.980> create

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
screening technology well if you create

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.220 
screening technology well if you create
a<00:00:46.280> halftone<00:00:46.699> dot<00:00:46.879> at<00:00:47.030> one<00:00:47.179> size<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.749> then<00:00:48.109> when

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
a halftone dot at one size and then when

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.750 
a halftone dot at one size and then when
you<00:00:48.289> place<00:00:48.559> it<00:00:48.589> on<00:00:48.800> your<00:00:48.829> printing<00:00:49.249> substrate

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
you place it on your printing substrate

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.729 
you place it on your printing substrate
and<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.059> gets<00:00:50.239> larger<00:00:50.480> then<00:00:51.260> your<00:00:51.379> image<00:00:51.620> is

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
and it gets larger then your image is

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.919 
and it gets larger then your image is
going<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:52.010> appear<00:00:52.309> to<00:00:52.339> be<00:00:52.640> darker<00:00:53.569> and<00:00:53.690> print

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
going to appear to be darker and print

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.450 
going to appear to be darker and print
darker<00:00:54.289> let<00:00:54.620> me<00:00:54.710> show<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:54.920> how<00:00:55.039> this<00:00:55.159> works

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
darker let me show you how this works

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.209 
darker let me show you how this works
let's<00:00:55.760> take<00:00:56.600> a<00:00:56.629> look<00:00:56.809> at<00:00:56.929> this<00:00:57.079> here<00:00:57.469> I've<00:00:58.010> got

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
let's take a look at this here I've got

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.680 
let's take a look at this here I've got
a<00:00:58.249> little<00:00:58.460> eyedropper<00:00:58.670> with<00:00:59.120> some<00:00:59.269> ink<00:00:59.449> in<00:00:59.600> it

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
a little eyedropper with some ink in it

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.599 
a little eyedropper with some ink in it
and<00:00:59.870> I've<00:01:00.260> got<00:01:00.289> two<00:01:00.559> kinds<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:00.979> paper<00:01:01.159> here<00:01:01.460> on

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
and I've got two kinds of paper here on

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.700 
and I've got two kinds of paper here on
the<00:01:02.149> left<00:01:02.359> a<00:01:02.510> really<00:01:02.719> absorbent<00:01:03.199> paper<00:01:03.350> and

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
the left a really absorbent paper and

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.680 
the left a really absorbent paper and
then<00:01:04.190> on<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.430> right<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.820> less<00:01:05.059> absorbent<00:01:05.570> paper

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
then on the right a less absorbent paper

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.719 
then on the right a less absorbent paper
this<00:01:06.290> might<00:01:06.530> represent<00:01:06.710> on<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.280> left<00:01:07.520> hand

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
this might represent on the left hand

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.460 
this might represent on the left hand
side<00:01:07.909> may<00:01:08.120> be<00:01:08.150> newsprint<00:01:08.720> let's<00:01:08.960> say<00:01:09.080> or<00:01:09.290> a

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
side may be newsprint let's say or a

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.530 
side may be newsprint let's say or a
very<00:01:09.740> very<00:01:09.979> poor<00:01:10.190> quality<00:01:10.340> uncoated<00:01:11.120> stock

very very poor quality uncoated stock
and<00:01:11.900> notice<00:01:12.560> what<00:01:12.710> happens<00:01:12.740> I'm<00:01:13.159> gonna<00:01:13.250> take

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
and notice what happens I'm gonna take

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.010 
and notice what happens I'm gonna take
this<00:01:13.610> little<00:01:13.670> eyedropper<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:14.570> notice<00:01:14.960> a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
this little eyedropper and notice a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.690 
this little eyedropper and notice a
little<00:01:15.200> just<00:01:15.500> drop<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.250> I'm<00:01:16.310> gonna<00:01:16.400> put<00:01:16.610> it

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
little just drop and I'm gonna put it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.340 
little just drop and I'm gonna put it
right<00:01:16.729> on<00:01:16.909> that<00:01:17.030> paper<00:01:17.270> see<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.960> size<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.260> that

right on that paper see the size of that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.350 
right on that paper see the size of that
halftone<00:01:18.770> dot<00:01:19.010> boom<00:01:19.550> as<00:01:19.730> soon<00:01:19.940> as<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.090> hits<00:01:20.240> the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
halftone dot boom as soon as it hits the

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.740 
halftone dot boom as soon as it hits the
paper<00:01:20.570> it<00:01:20.990> spreads<00:01:21.350> up<00:01:21.530> that's<00:01:22.130> dot<00:01:22.520> gain<00:01:22.820> if

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
paper it spreads up that's dot gain if

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.300 
paper it spreads up that's dot gain if
you<00:01:23.840> can<00:01:23.960> imagine<00:01:24.190> thousands<00:01:25.190> of<00:01:25.250> these

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
you can imagine thousands of these

you can imagine thousands of these
little<00:01:25.370> halftone<00:01:25.940> dots<00:01:26.000> all<00:01:26.390> side<00:01:27.140> by<00:01:27.320> each

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
right next to each other and they're all

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.910 
right next to each other and they're all
growing<00:01:29.450> like<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.050> can<00:01:30.200> imagine<00:01:30.590> how

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
growing like this you can imagine how

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.060 
growing like this you can imagine how
much<00:01:31.040> darker<00:01:31.460> your<00:01:31.550> image<00:01:31.820> will<00:01:32.000> look<00:01:32.330> now

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
much darker your image will look now

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.830 
much darker your image will look now
what<00:01:34.070> effects<00:01:34.340> dot<00:01:34.550> gain<00:01:34.820> is<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.570> kind<00:01:35.780> of

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
what effects dot gain is the kind of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.750 
what effects dot gain is the kind of
paper<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.410> have<00:01:36.440> notice<00:01:37.190> with<00:01:37.340> very

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
paper that you have notice with very

paper that you have notice with very
absorbent<00:01:38.210> paper<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.570> end<00:01:38.720> up<00:01:38.810> with<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:38.960> lot<00:01:39.170> of

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
absorbent paper you end up with a lot of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.200 
absorbent paper you end up with a lot of
dot<00:01:39.470> gain<00:01:39.740> whereas<00:01:40.400> with<00:01:40.550> less<00:01:40.760> absorbent

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
dot gain whereas with less absorbent

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.550 
dot gain whereas with less absorbent
paper<00:01:41.390> like<00:01:41.690> this<00:01:41.840> one<00:01:42.020> on<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.200> right<00:01:42.350> hand

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
paper like this one on the right hand

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.260 
paper like this one on the right hand
side<00:01:42.680> maybe<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.430> is<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.610> piece<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.850> coated

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
side maybe this is a piece of coated

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.910 
side maybe this is a piece of coated
stock<00:01:44.510> or<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.780> very<00:01:44.930> high-quality<00:01:45.170> piece<00:01:45.710> of

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
stock or a very high-quality piece of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.100 
stock or a very high-quality piece of
uncoated<00:01:46.550> stock<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:47.180> here<00:01:47.690> when<00:01:47.840> we<00:01:47.960> take

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
uncoated stock and here when we take

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.810 
uncoated stock and here when we take
that<00:01:48.230> same<00:01:48.440> halftone<00:01:48.860> dot<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.280> we<00:01:49.400> drop<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:49.730> on

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
that same halftone dot and we drop it on

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.550 
that same halftone dot and we drop it on
there<00:01:50.060> notice<00:01:50.570> that<00:01:50.750> doesn't<00:01:51.020> gain<00:01:51.170> very<00:01:51.410> much

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
there notice that doesn't gain very much

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.030 
there notice that doesn't gain very much
at<00:01:51.710> all<00:01:52.000> all<00:01:53.000> right<00:01:53.120> so<00:01:53.330> dot<00:01:53.990> gain<00:01:54.290> means<00:01:54.860> that

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
at all all right so dot gain means that

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.920 
at all all right so dot gain means that
your<00:01:55.160> images<00:01:55.520> will<00:01:55.670> print<00:01:55.910> darker<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.420> the

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
your images will print darker in the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.060 
your images will print darker in the
amount<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.200> dot<00:01:57.410> gain<00:01:57.620> you<00:01:57.740> have<00:01:57.770> is

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
amount of dot gain you have is

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.010 
amount of dot gain you have is
determined<00:01:58.610> by<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:59.300> quality<00:01:59.540> of<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.870> paper

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
determined by the quality of the paper

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.960 
determined by the quality of the paper
that<00:02:00.260> you<00:02:00.380> have<00:02:00.560> let's<00:02:01.400> take<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.610> look<00:02:01.790> at<00:02:01.880> the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
that you have let's take a look at the

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.360 
that you have let's take a look at the
consequences<00:02:02.720> of<00:02:02.870> this<00:02:03.740> in<00:02:03.950> terms<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.250> an

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
consequences of this in terms of an

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.210 
consequences of this in terms of an
actual<00:02:04.610> printed<00:02:05.000> image<00:02:05.740> here<00:02:06.740> we<00:02:06.860> have<00:02:07.040> two

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
actual printed image here we have two

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.990 
actual printed image here we have two
images<00:02:07.640> on<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.569> Left<00:02:09.159> we<00:02:10.159> have<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.489> dot<00:02:10.789> gain

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
images on the Left we have a dot gain

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.850 
images on the Left we have a dot gain
corrected<00:02:11.480> image<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.349> right<00:02:12.470> you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
corrected image and on the right you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.559 
corrected image and on the right you
have<00:02:13.010> an<00:02:13.129> image<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.819> is<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:13.970> dot<00:02:14.360> gain

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
have an image that is not dot gain

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.869 
have an image that is not dot gain
corrected<00:02:15.019> now<00:02:15.800> just<00:02:16.159> a<00:02:16.280> cursory<00:02:16.819> examination

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
corrected now just a cursory examination

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.940 
corrected now just a cursory examination
of<00:02:17.569> these<00:02:17.690> two<00:02:17.840> images<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.379> can<00:02:18.530> see<00:02:18.680> how<00:02:18.800> this

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
of these two images you can see how this

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.369 
of these two images you can see how this
is<00:02:19.099> darker<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.640> lower<00:02:20.150> contrast<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.019> that's

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
is darker and lower contrast and that's

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.200 
is darker and lower contrast and that's
because<00:02:21.709> all<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.010> halftone<00:02:22.610> dots<00:02:22.670> are<00:02:23.030> much

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
because all the halftone dots are much

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.450 
because all the halftone dots are much
larger<00:02:23.390> than<00:02:23.780> they<00:02:24.110> normally<00:02:24.260> would<00:02:24.560> be<00:02:24.860> here

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
larger than they normally would be here

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.530 
larger than they normally would be here
in<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
in the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.940 
in the
corrected<00:02:26.900> images<00:02:27.200> everything<00:02:27.469> is<00:02:27.709> brighter

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
corrected images everything is brighter

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.339 
corrected images everything is brighter
you<00:02:28.099> can<00:02:28.250> see<00:02:28.400> more<00:02:28.610> detail<00:02:28.969> when<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.840> take<00:02:30.319> a

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
you can see more detail when you take a

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.899 
you can see more detail when you take a
look<00:02:30.590> at<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.769> details<00:02:31.189> this<00:02:31.400> image<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.760> can

natural sky and you can see there's a

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.849 
natural sky and you can see there's a
good<00:02:41.510> deal<00:02:41.689> of<00:02:41.719> contrast<00:02:42.230> between<00:02:42.409> the<00:02:42.709> two

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
good deal of contrast between the two

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.860 
good deal of contrast between the two
