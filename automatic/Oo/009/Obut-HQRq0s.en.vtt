Android devices have different

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.590 
Android devices have different
connectors<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.600> invented<00:02:05.390> connector<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
connectors so we invented connector that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.870 
connectors so we invented connector that
can<00:02:06.930> turn<00:02:07.260> around<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.040> kill<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.700> different

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
can turn around and kill it in different

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.030 
can turn around and kill it in different
positions<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.380> want<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.679> have<00:02:10.860> your
