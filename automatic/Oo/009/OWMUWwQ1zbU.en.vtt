00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.090
 ah 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.649
 a snow survival situation 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.510
 we always have to try to descend 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.969
 the mountain may be that we find 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.389
 hard snow and be easy it can not be that 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.929
 we find soft snow and we sink 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.030
 you always have to try in 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.660
 survival save energy and time 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.830
 the quick way to do it is 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.300
 improvising snowshoes for 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.820
 increase our footprint and not sink 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.070
 in the snow to cut a branch with a 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.990
 knife we have to generate a point of 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.689
 tension on the branch so that the knife 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.960
 between well then simply tension 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.420
 We put the knife and cut 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.309
 we had selected the branch now what 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.890
 What we are going to do is clean the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.620
 remember when you work with a knife 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.840
 you can never work towards you 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.900
 always out to avoid doing 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.530
 the damage with the blade 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.260
 really 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.789
 we told you that the branch had to do 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.579
 approximately four times the size 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.530
 from our foot another direct branch very 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.530
 long me that I have the time 46 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.900
 also that we had to have a branch 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.570
 green because because now we will have to 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.690
 flex the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.210
 to make our rackets if this 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.420
 branch outside dry it would break us by the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.420
 half 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.290
 to make rackets a resource that 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.170
 we always have on hand would be the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.970
 shoe laces but in our 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.730
 equipment to save us the knots issue 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.800
 and others we should always carry 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.460
 American tape and with this we are going to do 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.460
 now the rackets 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.719
 and here we finished the first racket 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.049
 we need to manufacture the other one we can 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.049
 to March
