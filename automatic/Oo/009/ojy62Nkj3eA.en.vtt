00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
this is this is what I think is really

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.890 
this is this is what I think is really
important<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:01.700> a<00:05:01.820> lot<00:05:01.970> of<00:05:02.000> other<00:05:02.210> schools<00:05:02.450> a

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
important in a lot of other schools a

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.380 
important in a lot of other schools a
curriculum<00:05:03.350> is<00:05:03.500> given<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:04.010> like<00:05:04.820> this<00:05:05.240> is

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
curriculum is given to you like this is

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.230 
curriculum is given to you like this is
the<00:05:05.480> curriculum<00:05:05.810> for<00:05:06.050> global<00:05:06.740> studies<00:05:07.240> and

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
the curriculum for global studies and

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.820 
the curriculum for global studies and
there<00:05:08.690> are<00:05:08.810> many<00:05:08.840> good<00:05:09.200> things<00:05:09.350> about<00:05:09.560> that

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
there are many good things about that

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.830 
there are many good things about that
but<00:05:10.160> one<00:05:10.490> thing<00:05:10.670> that<00:05:10.700> we<00:05:11.000> see<00:05:11.210> is<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:11.630> lot

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
but one thing that we see is that a lot

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.200 
but one thing that we see is that a lot
of<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.080> curriculum<00:05:12.290> that's<00:05:12.650> made<00:05:13.010> it<00:05:13.790> is<00:05:13.940> not

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
of the curriculum that's made it is not

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.200 
of the curriculum that's made it is not
really<00:05:14.660> good<00:05:14.690> for<00:05:15.160> english<00:05:16.160> language<00:05:16.520> so<00:05:17.180> you

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
really good for english language so you

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.300 
really good for english language so you
have<00:05:17.450> to<00:05:17.600> adapt<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.050> anyway<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:18.980> it's<00:05:19.160> like

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
have to adapt it anyway so it's like

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.860 
have to adapt it anyway so it's like
well<00:05:19.520> why<00:05:20.030> don't<00:05:20.150> you<00:05:20.240> use<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.419> time<00:05:20.840> to

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
well why don't you use that time to

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.470 
well why don't you use that time to
really<00:05:21.320> make<00:05:21.590> a<00:05:21.620> curriculum<00:05:22.100> that<00:05:22.330> starts<00:05:23.330> off

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
really make a curriculum that starts off
