eight<00:00:00.120> square<00:00:00.750> meters<00:00:01.370> you<00:00:02.370> can<00:00:02.550> always

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
eight square meters you can always

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.059 
eight square meters you can always
change<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.689> unit<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.259> mean<00:00:04.470> if<00:00:04.589> you<00:00:04.680> want<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.920> go

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
change the unit I mean if you want to go

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.960 
change the unit I mean if you want to go
two<00:00:05.879> inches<00:00:06.509> or<00:00:06.810> meters<00:00:07.379> or<00:00:07.830> millimeters<00:00:08.429> now

this will be in the next release which
we<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.650> soon<00:00:15.080> let's<00:00:16.080> stay<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.440> centimeters

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
we can soon let's stay in centimeters

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.840 
we can soon let's stay in centimeters
anyway<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.300> let's<00:00:18.630> go<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.580> let's<00:00:20.580> give<00:00:20.820> a

anyway so let's go for let's give a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.849 
anyway so let's go for let's give a
title<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.570> project<00:00:21.810> since<00:00:22.170> I'm<00:00:22.410> here<00:00:22.650> I

title to this project since I'm here I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.920 
title to this project since I'm here I
want<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> call<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.850> sitting<00:00:24.119> room<00:00:25.430> okay

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
want to call it the sitting room okay

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.430 
want to call it the sitting room okay
finally<00:00:29.420> city<00:00:30.679> okay<00:00:32.480> yeah<00:00:33.480> when<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.320> out

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
finally city okay yeah when you get out

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.530 
finally city okay yeah when you get out
the<00:00:35.130> menu<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.730> update<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the menu in just update you the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.790 
the menu in just update you the
situation<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.829> scale<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:39.170> one<00:00:40.170> pixel<00:00:40.500> one

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
situation the scale is one pixel one

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.990 
situation the scale is one pixel one
centimeter<00:00:42.320> okay<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.980> said<00:00:44.190> very<00:00:44.460> point<00:00:44.820> moon

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
centimeter okay we said very point moon

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.209 
centimeter okay we said very point moon
now<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.539> arrange<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.289> real<00:00:46.739> distance

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
now we can arrange the real distance

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.680 
now we can arrange the real distance
from<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.670> point<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> other<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.510> let's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
from one point to the other so let's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
from one point to the other so let's
start<00:00:48.899> from<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> second<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.730> tells

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
start from the second one here it tells

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.650 
start from the second one here it tells
you<00:00:52.430> gives<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> opportunity<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.270> align

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you gives you the opportunity to align

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.869 
you gives you the opportunity to align
it<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:56.960> previous<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> next<00:00:59.340> with

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it with the previous with the next with

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.479 
it with the previous with the next with
a<00:00:59.910> reference<00:01:00.359> point<00:01:00.559> or<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.890> move<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> step<00:01:02.460> by

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
a reference point or to move it step by

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.980 
a reference point or to move it step by
step<00:01:03.049> okay<00:01:06.140> just<00:01:07.140> push<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.710> slightly<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.990> move

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
step okay just push it slightly and move

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.060 
step okay just push it slightly and move
pornstar<00:01:10.710> business<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.820> step<00:01:12.780> 10<00:01:13.500> by<00:01:13.770> 10

distance<00:01:22.470> anyway<00:01:25.250> let's<00:01:26.250> say<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.390> real

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
distance anyway let's say the real

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630 
distance anyway let's say the real
distance<00:01:28.110> between<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.950> point<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.520> the

distance between this point and the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.490 
distance between this point and the
previous<00:01:30.229> is<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.770> 69<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.200> 470<00:01:34.200> let's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
previous is not for 69 what is 470 let's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.819 
previous is not for 69 what is 470 let's
assume<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.430> 70<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> will<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
assume it's for 70 so it will be a

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
assume it's for 70 so it will be a
horizontal<00:01:37.829> align<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> previous<00:01:39.630> one

horizontal align with the previous one

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.620 
horizontal align with the previous one
head<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.979> 70<00:01:43.970> when<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> dismiss<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
head for 70 when you dismiss the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.120 
head for 70 when you dismiss the
keyboard<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.799> point<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.259> just<00:01:49.259> point

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
keyboard the point just just point

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.219 
keyboard the point just just point
outside<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.729> pop<00:01:50.939> over<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
outside the pop over this is the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.980 
outside the pop over this is the
distance<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.880> about<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.270> next<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
distance so what about the next one the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.139 
distance so what about the next one the
next<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.710> vertically<00:01:56.610> aligned<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
next one is vertically aligned with the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.490 
next one is vertically aligned with the
previews<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:59.219> distance<00:01:59.490> is<00:02:00.170> going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.320> be

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
previews but the distance is going to be

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.109 
previews but the distance is going to be
1<00:02:02.250> meter<00:02:02.490> exactly<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.770> 1077<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.369> let's<00:02:05.850> line

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
1 meter exactly not 1077 so let's line

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.230 
1 meter exactly not 1077 so let's line
vertically<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.960> switch<00:02:07.740> at<00:02:08.390> oops

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
vertically and switch at oops

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:19.380 
vertically and switch at oops
add<00:02:12.540> 100<00:02:13.540> centimeters<00:02:15.600> okay<00:02:17.220> here<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.460> this

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
add 100 centimeters okay here it is this

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.130 
add 100 centimeters okay here it is this
one<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:20.430> horizontally<00:02:21.430> aligned<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
one is horizontally aligned at a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.030 
one is horizontally aligned at a
distance<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:24.360> let's<00:02:25.360> say<00:02:25.770> current<00:02:26.770> distance

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
distance of let's say current distance

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.790 
distance of let's say current distance
is<00:02:27.220> 49<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.360> very<00:02:28.570> very<00:02:28.900> little<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.650> my

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
is 49 but that is very very little in my

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.520 
is 49 but that is very very little in my
room<00:02:30.040> would<00:02:30.760> be<00:02:30.820> 20<00:02:31.300> centimeters<00:02:32.490> okay<00:02:34.530> let's

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
room would be 20 centimeters okay let's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.130 
room would be 20 centimeters okay let's
run<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:36.070> one<00:02:36.310> now<00:02:36.810> vertically<00:02:37.810> with<00:02:38.050> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
run this one now vertically with the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.120 
run this one now vertically with the
previous<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:40.150> not<00:02:40.620> 383<00:02:41.620> but<00:02:41.920> it's<00:02:43.710> 385<00:02:44.710> let's

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
previous is not 383 but it's 385 let's

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:54.000 
previous is not 383 but it's 385 let's
assume<00:02:48.900> okay<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.490> then<00:02:52.710> now<00:02:53.710> we<00:02:53.770> have<00:02:53.980> a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
assume okay and then now we have a

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.610 
assume okay and then now we have a
problem<00:02:54.340> because<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:55.360> have<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.900> place<00:02:56.080> this<00:02:56.350> one

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
problem because I have to place this one

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.460 
problem because I have to place this one
but<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.460> don't<00:02:57.790> know<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.090> angle<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.260> good

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
but I don't know the angle so a good

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.120 
but I don't know the angle so a good
choice<00:02:59.770> be<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.940> focus<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.390> this<00:03:01.540> point

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
choice be just to focus on this point

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.560 
choice be just to focus on this point
create<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.280> point<00:03:03.820> right<00:03:05.520> after<00:03:06.520> it<00:03:06.550> that<00:03:07.300> means

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
create a point right after it that means

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.930 
create a point right after it that means
you<00:03:08.440> see<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.650> want<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.890> show<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.280> colors<00:03:09.580> so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
you see I want to show you the colors so

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.030 
you see I want to show you the colors so
this<00:03:10.570> is<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.840> current<00:03:11.170> point<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:11.740> is<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
this is the current point this is the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.250 
this is the current point this is the
previous<00:03:12.250> point<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.720> both<00:03:13.990> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
previous point and this is both the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.620 
previous point and this is both the
reference<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.850> next<00:03:16.030> point<00:03:16.270> in<00:03:16.480> this

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
reference and the next point in this

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.690 
reference and the next point in this
case<00:03:16.900> because<00:03:17.290> we<00:03:17.470> put<00:03:17.680> we<00:03:18.190> place<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
case because we put we place the

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.570 
case because we put we place the
reference<00:03:19.090> point<00:03:19.360> here<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:20.200> let's<00:03:20.580> assume

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
reference point here so let's assume

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.120 
reference point here so let's assume
that<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.090> reference<00:03:22.390> point<00:03:22.750> moved<00:03:23.500> here

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
that the reference point moved here

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.510 
that the reference point moved here
frequently<00:03:24.780> right<00:03:25.780> now<00:03:25.960> okay<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.130> can<00:03:27.310> see

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
frequently right now okay so you can see

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.450 
frequently right now okay so you can see
the<00:03:27.780> magenta<00:03:28.780> color<00:03:28.990> let's<00:03:29.650> go<00:03:29.950> back<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.160> this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
the magenta color let's go back to this

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.940 
the magenta color let's go back to this
see<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.630> can<00:03:31.780> add<00:03:31.960> a<00:03:32.020> point<00:03:32.380> between<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
see you can add a point between the

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.320 
see you can add a point between the
current<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.600> magenta<00:03:34.920> 130<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.460> then

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
current and the magenta 130 is and then

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.220 
current and the magenta 130 is and then
what<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.750> want<00:03:37.990> to<00:03:38.140> do<00:03:38.320> is<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:39.520> align<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.870> point

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
what I want to do is to align this point

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.110 
what I want to do is to align this point
to<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.470> because<00:03:41.830> what<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.340> have<00:03:42.490> is<00:03:42.910> the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
to this because what I have is the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.580 
to this because what I have is the
distance<00:03:43.450> between<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:43.990> point<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.470> this

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
distance between this point and this

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.870 
distance between this point and this
wall<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:46.740> let's<00:03:47.740> place<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.250> reference<00:03:48.610> point

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
wall so let's place the reference point

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.060 
wall so let's place the reference point
over<00:03:49.120> here<00:03:50.580> okay<00:03:51.630> let's<00:03:52.630> focus<00:03:53.110> on<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.890> new

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
over here okay let's focus on the new

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.840 
over here okay let's focus on the new
point<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.610> let's<00:03:55.270> say<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.570> want<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.290> be

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
point and let's say you want it to be

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.100 
point and let's say you want it to be
vertically<00:03:57.850> aligned<00:03:58.150> with<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.780> reference

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
vertically aligned with the reference

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.050 
vertically aligned with the reference
see<00:03:59.980> what<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.490> can<00:04:00.520> align<00:04:00.790> with<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
see what you can align with the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.280 
see what you can align with the
reference<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:02.340> also<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.370> want<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:04.090> be<00:04:04.330> at<00:04:05.140> a

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
reference and also I want it to be at a

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.830 
reference and also I want it to be at a
distance<00:04:05.860> because<00:04:06.520> I<00:04:06.850> no<00:04:06.910> wait<00:04:07.240> it's<00:04:08.070> 120<00:04:10.950> ok

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
distance because I no wait it's 120 ok

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.380 
distance because I no wait it's 120 ok
now<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:14.080> point<00:04:14.410> is<00:04:14.680> 120<00:04:15.550> far<00:04:15.760> away<00:04:15.970> from<00:04:16.030> this

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
now this point is 120 far away from this

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.310 
now this point is 120 far away from this
vertically<00:04:17.049> aligned<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:19.390> next<00:04:19.630> step<00:04:19.870> that's

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
vertically aligned the next step that's

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.920 
vertically aligned the next step that's
not<00:04:20.650> enough<00:04:20.799> because<00:04:21.180> I

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
not enough because I

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.409 
not enough because I
actually<00:04:23.169> now<00:04:23.320> know<00:04:23.680> where<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.430> will<00:04:24.699> is<00:04:24.940> so

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
actually now know where this will is so

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.420 
actually now know where this will is so
what<00:04:25.630> what<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:26.020> can<00:04:26.199> do<00:04:26.350> is<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.710> place<00:04:26.949> this<00:04:27.130> for

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
what what I can do is to place this for

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.490 
what what I can do is to place this for
example<00:04:27.669> I<00:04:27.970> want<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.479> be<00:04:28.630> horizontally

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
example I want you to be horizontally

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.450 
example I want you to be horizontally
aligned<00:04:29.710> with<00:04:30.009> the<00:04:30.070> previous<00:04:33.990> okay<00:04:35.460> and

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
aligned with the previous okay and

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.450 
aligned with the previous okay and
that's<00:04:36.669> fine<00:04:36.990> but<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.350> don't<00:04:38.830> know<00:04:38.949> now<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.250> have

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
that's fine but I don't know now I have

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.460 
that's fine but I don't know now I have
to<00:04:39.789> since<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.449> don't<00:04:40.630> know<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.930> angle<00:04:41.050> i<00:04:41.350> have

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
to since I don't know the angle i have

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.960 
to since I don't know the angle i have
to<00:04:41.620> focus<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:42.009> distance<00:04:42.460> between<00:04:42.610> this<00:04:42.910> and

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
to focus the distance between this and

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.460 
to focus the distance between this and
this<00:04:43.240> it's<00:04:44.050> quite<00:04:44.289> easy<00:04:44.500> because<00:04:45.389> here<00:04:46.470> you

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
this it's quite easy because here you

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.100 
this it's quite easy because here you
see<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.680> distance<00:04:48.160> is<00:04:48.400> 106<00:04:49.060> let's<00:04:49.810> suppose

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
see the distance is 106 let's suppose

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.620 
see the distance is 106 let's suppose
it's<00:04:51.180> 110<00:04:52.199> low<00:04:53.199> so<00:04:53.710> let's<00:04:54.220> focus<00:04:54.550> on<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.120> on

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
it's 110 low so let's focus on the on

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.159 
it's 110 low so let's focus on the on
this<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.620> reference<00:04:56.979> is<00:04:57.220> the<00:04:57.490> magenta

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
this the reference is the magenta

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.920 
this the reference is the magenta
horizontally<00:04:59.169> aligned<00:04:59.500> at<00:05:00.460> one<00:05:01.210> time<00:05:03.810> here<00:05:04.810> we

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
horizontally aligned at one time here we

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.629 
horizontally aligned at one time here we
are<00:05:05.669> so<00:05:06.669> now<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.690> point<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.530> points<00:05:09.430> which

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
are so now the point the points which

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.820 
are so now the point the points which
the<00:05:09.910> vertex<00:05:10.330> of<00:05:10.509> the<00:05:10.660> shapes<00:05:10.930> are<00:05:11.110> perfectly

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
the vertex of the shapes are perfectly

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.409 
the vertex of the shapes are perfectly
placed<00:05:13.020> let's<00:05:14.020> go<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.680> next<00:05:14.830> step<00:05:15.099> which

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
placed let's go to the next step which

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.550 
placed let's go to the next step which
is<00:05:16.419> shape<00:05:17.169> step<00:05:17.560> step<00:05:18.039> so<00:05:19.020> let's<00:05:20.020> start<00:05:20.320> with

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
is shape step step so let's start with

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.640 
is shape step step so let's start with
some<00:05:21.099> attributes<00:05:21.940> now<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.840> current<00:05:23.289> you<00:05:23.470> see

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
some attributes now the current you see

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.189 
some attributes now the current you see
the<00:05:23.770> current<00:05:23.949> areas<00:05:24.400> now<00:05:24.580> it's<00:05:24.789> 28.0<00:05:25.750> this<00:05:26.020> is

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
the current areas now it's 28.0 this is

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.689 
the current areas now it's 28.0 this is
the<00:05:26.560> exact<00:05:26.979> measure<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:28.030> surface<00:05:28.270> of<00:05:28.599> my<00:05:28.810> room

let's give a name to it let's call it

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:42.510 
let's give a name to it let's call it
floor<00:05:33.520> plan<00:05:37.830> okay<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:40.349> here<00:05:41.349> we<00:05:41.470> are<00:05:41.560> now

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
floor plan okay and here we are now

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.560 
floor plan okay and here we are now
we've<00:05:42.699> got<00:05:42.909> the<00:05:43.030> floor<00:05:43.210> plan<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:45.389> now<00:05:46.389> we're

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
we've got the floor plan and now we're

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.830 
we've got the floor plan and now we're
ready<00:05:46.599> for<00:05:47.820> adding<00:05:48.820> some<00:05:49.090> more<00:05:49.300> features

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
ready for adding some more features

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.860 
ready for adding some more features
first<00:05:50.409> of<00:05:50.560> all<00:05:50.680> I<00:05:53.130> want<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.430> add<00:05:55.060> a<00:05:55.330> door<00:05:55.570> in

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
first of all I want you to add a door in

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.540 
first of all I want you to add a door in
between<00:05:56.320> here<00:05:56.680> because<00:05:56.949> I<00:05:57.130> know<00:05:57.250> there<00:05:57.430> is<00:05:57.490> a

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
between here because I know there is a

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.060 
between here because I know there is a
door<00:05:57.820> here<00:05:58.229> which<00:05:59.229> is<00:06:01.289> 10<00:06:02.289> centimeters<00:06:02.949> apart

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
door here which is 10 centimeters apart

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.260 
door here which is 10 centimeters apart
from<00:06:03.430> this<00:06:03.580> vertex<00:06:04.210> and<00:06:04.690> is<00:06:04.900> 80<00:06:05.699> its<00:06:06.699> length<00:06:07.030> is

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
from this vertex and is 80 its length is

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.460 
from this vertex and is 80 its length is
80<00:06:07.740> centimeters<00:06:08.740> so<00:06:09.250> let's<00:06:09.520> do<00:06:09.699> it<00:06:09.930> we<00:06:10.930> go<00:06:11.139> here

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
80 centimeters so let's do it we go here

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.980 
80 centimeters so let's do it we go here
we<00:06:11.699> just<00:06:12.699> say<00:06:12.849> want<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.240> add<00:06:13.330> another<00:06:13.360> point

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
we just say want to add another point

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.320 
we just say want to add another point
between<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:15.009> black<00:06:15.310> one<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:15.669> the<00:06:15.880> magenta

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
between the black one and the magenta

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.350 
between the black one and the magenta
one<00:06:16.590> here<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:17.710> is<00:06:17.740> and<00:06:18.190> then<00:06:18.820> we<00:06:19.030> want<00:06:19.210> this

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
one here it is and then we want this

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.230 
one here it is and then we want this
point<00:06:19.659> B<00:06:20.039> in<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:22.479> indie<00:06:22.930> add<00:06:23.639> 10<00:06:24.639> centimeters

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
point B in the indie add 10 centimeters

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.570 
point B in the indie add 10 centimeters
far<00:06:25.570> from<00:06:25.870> the<00:06:25.990> previous<00:06:26.409> along<00:06:27.039> the<00:06:27.370> path

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
far from the previous along the path

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.629 
far from the previous along the path
that<00:06:27.940> means<00:06:28.870> it<00:06:29.169> has<00:06:29.409> not<00:06:29.590> to<00:06:30.099> be<00:06:30.220> neither

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
that means it has not to be neither

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.730 
that means it has not to be neither
vertical<00:06:31.360> line<00:06:31.539> or<00:06:31.750> horizontally<00:06:32.409> line<00:06:32.560> but

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
vertical line or horizontally line but

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.250 
vertical line or horizontally line but
it<00:06:32.830> has<00:06:33.010> to<00:06:33.159> stay<00:06:33.400> along

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
it has to stay along

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.480 
it has to stay along
so<00:06:35.090> let's<00:06:36.090> point<00:06:36.330> on<00:06:36.510> this<00:06:36.660> let's<00:06:37.380> say<00:06:37.560> this<00:06:38.310> is

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
so let's point on this let's say this is

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.820 
so let's point on this let's say this is
the<00:06:38.520> along<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:39.000> path<00:06:39.180> distance<00:06:39.780> and<00:06:40.650> let's

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
the along the path distance and let's

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.410 
the along the path distance and let's
place<00:06:41.100> it<00:06:41.130> 10<00:06:41.700> centimeters<00:06:42.770> yeah<00:06:43.770> you<00:06:43.830> are<00:06:44.420> see

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
place it 10 centimeters yeah you are see

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.900 
place it 10 centimeters yeah you are see
just<00:06:45.810> stay<00:06:46.020> is<00:06:46.080> a<00:06:46.290> long<00:06:46.440> path<00:06:46.710> then<00:06:47.640> we<00:06:47.790> have<00:06:47.880> to

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
just stay is a long path then we have to

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.730 
just stay is a long path then we have to
add<00:06:48.090> another<00:06:48.240> point<00:06:48.750> here<00:06:50.060> it<00:06:51.060> is<00:06:51.270> and<00:06:51.740> this

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
add another point here it is and this

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.340 
add another point here it is and this
has<00:06:53.010> to<00:06:53.190> be<00:06:53.310> 80<00:06:53.580> centimeters<00:06:54.330> far<00:06:54.840> from<00:06:55.230> the

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
has to be 80 centimeters far from the

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:01.630 
has to be 80 centimeters far from the
previous<00:06:55.740> one<00:06:55.940> same<00:06:57.140> along<00:06:58.140> along<00:06:58.620> paths

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.640 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.240 

1830s<00:07:02.640> here<00:07:03.390> there's<00:07:04.290> our<00:07:04.560> door<00:07:05.480> okay<00:07:07.040> if<00:07:08.040> we

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
1830s here there's our door okay if we

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.190 
1830s here there's our door okay if we
don't<00:07:08.460> need<00:07:08.610> this<00:07:08.820> anymore<00:07:08.880> we<00:07:09.570> just<00:07:09.780> go<00:07:10.020> over

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
don't need this anymore we just go over

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.410 
don't need this anymore we just go over
it<00:07:10.440> and<00:07:10.920> delete<00:07:11.280> it<00:07:13.400> so<00:07:14.400> these<00:07:14.610> are<00:07:14.820> the<00:07:15.060> key

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420 
it and delete it so these are the key

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.010 
it and delete it so these are the key
vertexes<00:07:15.990> of<00:07:16.230> this<00:07:16.500> room<00:07:17.750> actually<00:07:18.750> I<00:07:18.780> have

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 
vertexes of this room actually I have

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.350 
vertexes of this room actually I have
another<00:07:19.050> door<00:07:19.590> here<00:07:19.620> knock<00:07:20.490> adult<00:07:20.790> here<00:07:21.090> so

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
another door here knock adult here so

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:29.690 
another door here knock adult here so
let's<00:07:21.750> place<00:07:22.080> it<00:07:22.110> very<00:07:22.710> quickly<00:07:25.670> it's<00:07:27.260> is<00:07:28.700> it

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700 
let's place it very quickly it's is it

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:35.950 
let's place it very quickly it's is it
is<00:07:30.560> then<00:07:31.560> this<00:07:31.980> has<00:07:32.250> to<00:07:32.460> be<00:07:33.980> horizontal<00:07:34.980> align

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 
is then this has to be horizontal align

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:46.850 
is then this has to be horizontal align
that's<00:07:37.430> at<00:07:38.430> a<00:07:38.490> distance<00:07:39.090> of<00:07:40.850> let's<00:07:41.850> say<00:07:45.170> 85<00:07:46.170> as

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 
that's at a distance of let's say 85 as

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.840 
that's at a distance of let's say 85 as
the<00:07:46.980> door<00:07:47.160> is<00:07:47.190> right<00:07:47.550> in<00:07:47.760> the<00:07:47.850> corner<00:07:48.800> okay<00:07:49.850> so

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:50.850 
the door is right in the corner okay so

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.840 
the door is right in the corner okay so
yeah<00:07:51.030> I<00:07:51.470> think<00:07:52.470> the<00:07:52.920> good<00:07:53.070> thing<00:07:53.130> is<00:07:53.370> to<00:07:53.610> save

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:53.850 
yeah I think the good thing is to save

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.920 
yeah I think the good thing is to save
the<00:07:54.000> shape<00:07:54.830> so<00:07:55.830> let's<00:07:56.160> say<00:07:56.310> we're<00:07:56.640> done<00:07:56.930> save

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:57.930 
the shape so let's say we're done save

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.010 
the shape so let's say we're done save
the<00:07:58.050> shape<00:07:58.260> and<00:07:58.470> here<00:07:58.710> we<00:07:58.800> are<00:07:58.890> sitting<00:07:59.580> room

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:00.020 
the shape and here we are sitting room

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.500 
the shape and here we are sitting room
here<00:08:01.020> is<00:08:01.140> the<00:08:01.260> city
