00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and I just basically mix it in with

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.190 
and I just basically mix it in with
water<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.119> two<00:02:06.329> minutes<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.020> want

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
to make sure that it's kind of mixed in

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.020 
to make sure that it's kind of mixed in
and<00:02:09.300> then<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.110> drink<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.790> says

smaller<00:02:50.580> version<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.209> bubble<00:02:51.450> tea<00:02:51.750> once<00:02:52.019> it

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
smaller version of bubble tea once it

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.630 
smaller version of bubble tea once it
balloons<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> little<00:02:53.160> bit<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:54.980> I've<00:02:55.980> really

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
balloons up a little bit so I've really

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.910 
balloons up a little bit so I've really
been<00:02:56.760> enjoying<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.450> my<00:02:57.599> hair<00:02:57.840> feels<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:58.739> a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
been enjoying it my hair feels just a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.339 
been enjoying it my hair feels just a
lot<00:02:59.250> thicker<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.030> healthier<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.780> softer

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
lot thicker and and healthier and softer

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.289 
lot thicker and and healthier and softer
but<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.650> could<00:03:01.830> just<00:03:01.860> be<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> combination<00:03:02.790> of

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
but it could just be a combination of

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.330 
but it could just be a combination of
everything<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.260> I'm<00:03:04.349> doing<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:05.069> just

this<00:03:05.580> but<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:07.140> immediate<00:03:07.890> result<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.519> I

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
this but the immediate result that I

this but the immediate result that I
noticed<00:03:09.000> with<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.299> um<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:10.370> don't<00:03:11.370> know<00:03:11.489> if<00:03:11.640> I
