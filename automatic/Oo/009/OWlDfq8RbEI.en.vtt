00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
entire time but kind of as long as he's

following it and trying and I try to
bridge<00:01:12.560> in<00:01:12.770> those<00:01:12.920> situations<00:01:13.610> where<00:01:13.790> he<00:01:13.820> is

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
bridge in those situations where he is

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.090 
bridge in those situations where he is
actually<00:01:14.630> touching<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:15.170> but<00:01:15.650> as<00:01:15.710> long<00:01:15.890> as<00:01:15.950> I

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
actually touching it but as long as I

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.280 
actually touching it but as long as I
feel<00:01:16.310> like<00:01:16.460> he's<00:01:16.670> following<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.240> target<00:01:17.570> that

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
feel like he's following the target that

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.960 
feel like he's following the target that
is<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.560> way<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.040> can<00:01:19.220> build<00:01:19.430> up<00:01:19.550> his<00:01:19.700> time

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
is a way that you can build up his time

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.970 
is a way that you can build up his time
holding<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:20.720> focusing<00:01:21.320> on<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.530> target

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
holding and focusing on the target

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.030 
holding and focusing on the target
sometimes<00:01:22.520> if<00:01:22.970> they<00:01:23.090> just<00:01:23.330> hold<00:01:23.650> see<00:01:24.650> he<00:01:24.800> wants

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
sometimes if they just hold see he wants

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.620 
sometimes if they just hold see he wants
to<00:01:25.160> come<00:01:25.340> off<00:01:25.490> as<00:01:25.700> well<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.150> if<00:01:26.240> it's<00:01:26.390> moving

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
to come off as well but if it's moving

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.480 
to come off as well but if it's moving
he<00:01:26.990> seem<00:01:27.200> tends<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.830> stay<00:01:28.010> with<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.400> little

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
he seem tends to stay with it a little

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.000 
he seem tends to stay with it a little
bit<00:01:28.670> longer<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:29.450> those<00:01:29.930> are<00:01:30.170> one<00:01:30.710> thing<00:01:30.890> you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
bit longer so those are one thing you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.440 
bit longer so those are one thing you
can<00:01:31.190> do<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.430> help<00:01:31.550> him<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:31.940> stay<00:01:32.150> with<00:01:32.300> the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
click he has his little eye on me but

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.140 
click he has his little eye on me but
his<00:01:51.950> head<00:01:52.159> isn't<00:01:52.340> touching<00:01:52.820> me

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
his head isn't touching me

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.600 
his head isn't touching me
but<00:01:53.900> anyway<00:01:54.230> so<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.560> help<00:01:54.890> make<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:55.400> clear

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
but anyway so to help make it clear

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.580 
but anyway so to help make it clear
because<00:01:55.640> then<00:01:56.450> bugs<00:01:56.810> didn't<00:01:57.170> know<00:01:57.230> what<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.470> do

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
because then bugs didn't know what to do

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.020 
because then bugs didn't know what to do
with<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.800> target<00:01:58.190> when<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.400> was<00:01:58.520> backing<00:01:58.909> up

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
with the target when it was backing up

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.180 
with the target when it was backing up
and<00:01:59.300> Dave<00:01:59.900> didn't<00:02:00.229> exactly<00:02:00.500> know<00:02:00.770> what<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.040> do

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
and Dave didn't exactly know what to do

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.700 
and Dave didn't exactly know what to do
and<00:02:01.490> his<00:02:01.700> bugs<00:02:02.659> would<00:02:02.930> not<00:02:03.110> be<00:02:03.290> responding

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
and his bugs would not be responding

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.710 
and his bugs would not be responding
well<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.280> day<00:02:04.490> would<00:02:04.670> get<00:02:04.790> apprehensive<00:02:05.510> then

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
well the day would get apprehensive then

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.850 
well the day would get apprehensive then
meet<00:02:05.960> well<00:02:06.080> then<00:02:06.380> bugs<00:02:06.590> would<00:02:06.770> get

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
meet well then bugs would get

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.859 
meet well then bugs would get
apprehensive<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:07.970> decided<00:02:08.479> what<00:02:08.659> I'm<00:02:08.750> gonna

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
apprehensive so I decided what I'm gonna

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.619 
apprehensive so I decided what I'm gonna
do<00:02:09.080> is<00:02:09.319> give<00:02:09.560> him<00:02:09.739> help<00:02:10.369> him<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:11.000> back<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.420> with

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
do is give him help him to back up with

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.539 
do is give him help him to back up with
the<00:02:11.780> target<00:02:11.989> on<00:02:12.290> my<00:02:12.499> own<00:02:12.709> first<00:02:13.129> before<00:02:13.340> we

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
the target on my own first before we

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.479 
the target on my own first before we
introduce<00:02:14.120> Dave<00:02:14.389> again<00:02:14.599> so<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.590> would<00:02:16.069> look<00:02:16.249> for

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
introduce Dave again so I would look for

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.230 
introduce Dave again so I would look for
him<00:02:16.609> first

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
him first

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.900 
him first
just<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.050> simple<00:02:18.440> step<00:02:18.710> now<00:02:19.250> helps<00:02:19.700> him<00:02:19.820> a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
just it's a simple step now helps him a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.880 
just it's a simple step now helps him a
little<00:02:20.180> bit<00:02:20.330> because<00:02:20.540> I'm<00:02:21.050> moving<00:02:21.320> with<00:02:21.680> him

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
little bit because I'm moving with him

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.440 
little bit because I'm moving with him
and<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.100> know<00:02:22.190> he's<00:02:22.520> aware<00:02:22.820> of<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.240> whole

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
and I know he's aware of the whole

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.930 
and I know he's aware of the whole
environment<00:02:23.810> there<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:24.860> then<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.340> can<00:02:25.670> just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
environment there so then I can just

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.870 
environment there so then I can just
look<00:02:26.060> for<00:02:26.240> him<00:02:26.390> too<00:02:29.440> good<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.460> kind<00:02:31.760> of

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
look for him too good and just kind of

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.600 
look for him too good and just kind of
trying<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.590> balance<00:02:33.590> between<00:02:33.920> bridging<00:02:34.490> the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
trying to balance between bridging the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.120 
trying to balance between bridging the
motion<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.270> moving<00:02:35.480> his<00:02:35.780> legs<00:02:36.020> back<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.440> his

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
motion of moving his legs back and his

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.070 
motion of moving his legs back and his
focus<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.820> his<00:02:37.910> eyes<00:02:38.180> looking<00:02:38.660> at<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.810> target

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
focus and his eyes looking at the target

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.320 
focus and his eyes looking at the target
let's<00:02:39.710> come<00:02:39.890> up<00:02:39.950> here<00:02:40.010> bugs<00:02:42.670> now<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:43.880> can<00:02:44.090> even

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
let's come up here bugs now I can even

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.500 
let's come up here bugs now I can even
start<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.690> go<00:02:44.810> back<00:02:45.380> up<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.640> he<00:02:46.820> sees<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.270> he

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
start and go back up so he sees that he

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.790 
start and go back up so he sees that he
doesn't<00:02:47.780> know<00:02:47.840> what<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.080> means<00:02:48.260> yet<00:02:48.560> he's

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
doesn't know what it means yet he's

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.490 
doesn't know what it means yet he's
really<00:02:49.070> following<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.550> target<00:02:50.030> back<00:02:52.300> good<00:02:53.500> so

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
really following the target back good so

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.800 
really following the target back good so
as<00:02:54.800> we<00:02:55.010> get<00:02:55.190> him<00:02:55.460> kind<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.910> more<00:02:56.090> solid<00:02:56.600> about

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
as we get him kind of more solid about

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.350 
as we get him kind of more solid about
that<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.350> that<00:02:57.380> target<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.280> reintroduced<00:02:59.150> with

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
that is that target is reintroduced with

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.050 
that is that target is reintroduced with
Dave<00:02:59.660> he'll<00:03:00.440> be<00:03:00.710> mugs<00:03:01.370> will<00:03:01.610> know<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.790> little

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
Dave he'll be mugs will know a little

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.910 
Dave he'll be mugs will know a little
bit<00:03:02.240> more<00:03:02.540> what<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.930> do<00:03:03.110> with<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.380> target<00:03:03.800> even

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
bit more what to do with the target even

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.620 
bit more what to do with the target even
though<00:03:04.130> hopefully<00:03:04.580> that's<00:03:05.090> my<00:03:05.300> thinking

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
though hopefully that's my thinking

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.890 
though hopefully that's my thinking
anyway<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.380> haven't<00:03:07.250> had<00:03:07.520> new<00:03:07.760> target<00:03:08.510> person

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
anyway I haven't had new target person

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.930 
anyway I haven't had new target person
and<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.320> new<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.830> new<00:03:12.980> horse<00:03:13.220> as<00:03:13.430> well<00:03:13.460> both

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
and a new and the new horse as well both

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:27.480 
and a new and the new horse as well both
of<00:03:14.120> them<00:03:14.210> going<00:03:14.330> back<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:20.560> back<00:03:21.560> up<00:03:21.970> but

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.700 

good<00:03:28.490> and<00:03:29.090> again<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.510> tried<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:29.960> look<00:03:30.320> for<00:03:30.590> him

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
good and again I tried to look for him

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.580 
good and again I tried to look for him
as<00:03:30.860> he<00:03:31.160> kind<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:31.850> went<00:03:32.600> kind<00:03:32.960> of<00:03:33.080> a<00:03:33.170> long<00:03:33.380> way

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
as he kind of I went kind of a long way

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.200 
as he kind of I went kind of a long way
I<00:03:33.830> want<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.190> teach<00:03:34.370> him<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.640> there's<00:03:35.000> some

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
I want to teach him that there's some

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.590 
I want to teach him that there's some
duration<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.990> it<00:03:36.170> but<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.770> could<00:03:36.920> see<00:03:37.130> he<00:03:37.280> kind

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
duration to it but you could see he kind

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.330 
duration to it but you could see he kind
so<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:38.900> look<00:03:39.140> for<00:03:39.320> times<00:03:39.530> when<00:03:39.770> he<00:03:39.860> picked<00:03:40.160> back

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
so I look for times when he picked back

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.520 
so I look for times when he picked back
up<00:03:40.400> let's<00:03:41.180> move<00:03:41.360> up<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:41.690> he<00:03:41.780> has<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.020> place<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.350> go

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
up let's move up so he has a place to go

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
up let's move up so he has a place to go
again<00:03:44.410> good<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:46.010> like<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.430> he's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
again good and I like that he's

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.220 
again good and I like that he's
following<00:03:46.790> with<00:03:47.240> me<00:03:47.450> even<00:03:47.810> though<00:03:47.900> it's<00:03:48.050> not

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
following with me even though it's not

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.410 
following with me even though it's not
backing<00:03:48.500> up<00:03:48.830> it<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.250> part<00:03:49.580> of<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.820> behavior<00:03:50.270> is

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
backing up it is part of the behavior is

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.510

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
there I use the target to kind of give

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.510 
there I use the target to kind of give
him<00:04:11.870> something<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.500> focus<00:04:12.680> on<00:04:13.070> and<00:04:13.310> get<00:04:13.400> him

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
him something to focus on and get him

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.710 
him something to focus on and get him
back<00:04:13.670> on<00:04:13.940> on<00:04:14.300> track<00:04:15.160> all<00:04:16.160> right<00:04:16.370> back<00:04:16.850> up<00:04:18.580> bugs

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
back on on track all right back up bugs

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.430 
back on on track all right back up bugs
back<00:04:20.720> up

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.680 

yeah

and<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:30.980> a<00:04:31.010> little<00:04:31.250> repetition<00:04:31.970> here<00:04:32.210> is<00:04:32.360> going

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
and so a little repetition here is going

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.380 
and so a little repetition here is going
to<00:04:32.720> be<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.960> best<00:04:33.170> thing<00:04:33.410> good<00:04:34.100> backup<00:04:37.390> bugs

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
a little bit of repetition to remind

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:12.469 
a little bit of repetition to remind
them<00:06:11.849> what<00:06:11.939> to<00:06:12.120> do

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479

so as we put Dave back in the picture

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.279 
so as we put Dave back in the picture
bugs<00:06:15.389> will<00:06:15.569> know<00:06:15.719> what<00:06:15.839> to<00:06:15.960> do<00:06:16.050> with<00:06:16.169> the

bugs will know what to do with the

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:17.570 
bugs will know what to do with the

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
target and the two of them will probably

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.159 
target and the two of them will probably
have<00:06:17.909> a<00:06:17.939> little<00:06:18.180> bit<00:06:18.300> more<00:06:18.509> success<00:06:18.930> with<00:06:19.139> that

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
have a little bit more success with that

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.800 
have a little bit more success with that
next<00:06:19.529> time<00:06:19.710> so<00:06:20.250> that's<00:06:20.789> bugs<00:06:21.120> in<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.419> backup

next time so that's bugs in the backup
for<00:06:22.020> now<00:06:22.139> and<00:06:22.469> we'll<00:06:23.069> see<00:06:23.339> you<00:06:23.490> tomorrow
