actually have to use that much if you
can<00:00:43.600> tell<00:00:43.989> you<00:00:44.289> probably<00:00:44.590> won't<00:00:44.800> be<00:00:44.920> able<00:00:45.010> to

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
can tell you probably won't be able to

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.189 
can tell you probably won't be able to
see<00:00:45.309> but<00:00:45.520> um<00:00:45.730> I<00:00:46.030> haven't<00:00:46.510> used<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:46.809> much<00:00:47.050> of

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
see but um I haven't used that much of

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.840 
see but um I haven't used that much of
mine<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.590> I've<00:00:47.649> used<00:00:47.829> it<00:00:48.010> for<00:00:48.070> like<00:00:48.460> a<00:00:48.489> week<00:00:48.730> or

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
mine and I've used it for like a week or

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
mine and I've used it for like a week or
two<00:00:48.910> straight<00:00:49.359> now

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
two straight now

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.040 
two straight now
so<00:00:50.350> that's<00:00:50.829> cool<00:00:51.430> I<00:00:51.460> guess<00:00:51.699> um<00:00:52.120> by<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.780> way<00:00:52.930> the

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
so that's cool I guess um by the way the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.830 
so that's cool I guess um by the way the
texture<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:54.190> feels<00:00:54.460> basically<00:00:55.090> like<00:00:55.660> you<00:00:55.809> a

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
texture it feels basically like you a

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.599 
texture it feels basically like you a
pale<00:00:56.109> Yoplait<00:00:56.980> yogurt<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:59.379> cannot<00:00:59.800> talk<00:01:00.190> at<00:01:00.429> all

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
pale Yoplait yogurt I cannot talk at all

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.310 
pale Yoplait yogurt I cannot talk at all
today<00:01:00.789> that<00:01:01.329> you'll<00:01:01.480> play<00:01:01.600> whipped<00:01:02.109> yogurt

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
today that you'll play whipped yogurt

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.619 
today that you'll play whipped yogurt
have<00:01:02.769> you<00:01:02.890> ever<00:01:03.010> felt<00:01:03.250> that<00:01:03.489> it's<00:01:03.699> like<00:01:03.910> really

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
have you ever felt that it's like really

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.500 
have you ever felt that it's like really
just<00:01:04.900> like<00:01:05.080> whipped<00:01:06.010> feeling<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:07.180> this<00:01:07.360> is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
just like whipped feeling and so this is

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.660 
just like whipped feeling and so this is
called<00:01:07.720> souffle<00:01:08.500> so<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:08.950> would<00:01:09.250> imagine<00:01:09.340> that

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
called souffle so I would imagine that

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.460 
called souffle so I would imagine that
it<00:01:09.880> would<00:01:09.940> feel<00:01:10.210> like<00:01:10.360> that<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:11.110> feels

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
it would feel like that and it feels

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.010 
it would feel like that and it feels
basically<00:01:12.130> exactly<00:01:12.610> how<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:12.850> would<00:01:13.120> expect

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
basically exactly how you would expect

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.480 
basically exactly how you would expect
it<00:01:14.230> to<00:01:14.260> feel<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.590> guess<00:01:14.860> I<00:01:15.010> don't<00:01:15.190> really<00:01:15.310> know

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
it to feel I guess I don't really know

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.820 
it to feel I guess I don't really know
um<00:01:15.790> yeah<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:16.900> like<00:01:17.020> I<00:01:17.110> said<00:01:17.170> I've<00:01:17.380> had<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.650> for
