00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.009
 Well 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.079
 today in our comparison 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.849
 The government advised 20 animals to be on European roads in 2009 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.939
 and the 4 2 2 he was first launched in late 2009 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.780
 The convinced especially with its rich safety equipment 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.629
 even in the basic version, seven airbags and ESP are on board 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.510
 The Dresden equipment we drive also includes 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 Fog lights with cornering light included 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.410
 Evo is the short form of evolution 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.210
 his predecessor the Grande Punto was not fundamentally revised 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.010
 but rather 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.010
 carefully formulated 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 the front, however, was completely redesigned the daytime running lights in the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.140
 Integrated headlamp 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 the roof spoiler for 150 euros gives the Punto Evo even more dynamism 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.600
 But now we come to the competitor Exodus Korea the Hyundai i20 has to 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.580
 by no means hide from the consequences Italians with his design he is indeed 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.580
 not quite as athletic but by no means boring 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.900
 Orhan creates a very positive impression as the fourth is for 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 all variants PSP, however, still six airbags 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.670
 the noise level in the interior is clear compared to its predecessor Getz 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.590
 reduced thanks to special insulating materials and Kurer sheets 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 critical 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.129
 In Europe, Jung 3 wants to sell 110000 copies of the small 20 per year 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.269
 to help a thoroughly pro-European party to vote 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.569
 and engines developed in Europe many new 1 5-liter cl-win the in ours 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.329
 test car 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.530
 this makes 90 hp and replaces the previously offered one comma 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.529
 6-liter diesel 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.869
 in many ways a 1 2 times 3 liter Multicheck this second generation 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:37.489
 With 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.489
 95 hp used 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.289
 Unfortunately, he is by far not as willing to spin as the devious nature 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.220
 from zero to one hundred, it's about 0 7 seconds 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.650
 The end is at 178 Karin h 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.349
 the specified 4 Thomas 2 liters consumption are however under normal 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.349
 Conditions barely reachable 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.909
 on paper i20 took longer to reach 100 km / h in practice 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.109
 but he takes on his fleet 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.479
 the engine responds directly to the gas pedal but here are the specified 4 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.479
 2 times 2 liters of consumption he optimistic 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.819
 Clarity is just in small cars on the city traffic 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.779
 are used an important aspect because it follows how well the 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.779
 Have vehicles packed 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.639
 a sinister line makes reversing into the 20's 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.689
 Guessing game thanks to its small external dimensions but also fit easily 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.689
 in tight parking spaces 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:17.930
 whether the twelve centimeters longer Punto Evo just as well in the parking space 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.930
 maneuver 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:27.259
 a distributed fourth is this sees the button with which the power steering is still 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.080
 Smooth adjustment also allows the window line is quite high 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.680
 but 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.160
 The headrests are lowered further when not in use 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
 you still want a parking aid 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.659
 when parking so there is a tie between the two 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.659
 Visits in the trunk off 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:08.589
 275 to 00 30 liters at 4 1 295 to a thousand 60 then Jung 3 and that despite 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.589
 smaller external dimensions scarce advantage for the i20 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.259
 the track 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:28.599
 but the Punto Evo is better for them and pleasant 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.599
 Provided materials 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:37.710
 Unfortunately, there is only a five-speed gearbox 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.670
 but a start-stop automatic height-adjustable good are the 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.669
 Italians but no 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.680
 not so with the g-20 here, the boats in the front seats depending on 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 Adjust body size and six gears are also available 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.860
 the radio has no own display but a common display with the 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.479
 On-board computer, however, consists of comfort equipment only from 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.300
 a part of the kilometer counter 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.320
 the material could be a bit higher quality overall 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:21.159
 Both vehicles are in the basic outfit a little over 11 000 in 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:22.710
 Germany 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.789
 Motorization and equipment are as often the duty 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:30.430
 Naumann the Fiat Punto Evo 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.770
 Overall, the slightly more adult car is with the better workmanship especially 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.300
 As far as the interior materials are concerned, however, it only has five gears 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.280
 he compensates by his start-stop automatic but the engine 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.240
 is not really powerful and DRI happy with the Hyundai i20 the different 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.449
 new 1 chamber 4 liter diesel engine which is really very tree happy and it 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.490
 is a lot of fun to drive this car unfortunately is the processing 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.180
 and the material in the interior is not quite as high as the Fiat Punto 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.720
 Evo, however, he does that through the price back way 16 episodes 990 euros 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.039
 For that you get a pretty complete car of the Fiat Punto we 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:15.849
 It costs about 21 000 euros and that's why my choice today is the young 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:16.560
 World into the 20th
