00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
a little more complicated and we almost

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.000 
a little more complicated and we almost
made<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.930> out<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> door<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:28.859> got

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
made it out the door but then we got

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.370 
made it out the door but then we got
sidetracked<00:00:29.310> by<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.880> Linda<00:00:30.359> workshop<00:00:30.900> here

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that people aren't used to seeing so I'm

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.520 
that people aren't used to seeing so I'm
gonna<00:01:48.240> talk<00:01:48.390> real<00:01:48.570> quick<00:01:48.780> about<00:01:48.810> how<00:01:49.320> I'm

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
gonna talk real quick about how I'm

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.830 
gonna talk real quick about how I'm
shooting<00:01:49.950> I've<00:01:50.280> got<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:50.790> monopod<00:01:51.299> because

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
shooting I've got my monopod because

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.499 
shooting I've got my monopod because
it's<00:01:52.259> pretty<00:01:52.530> low<00:01:52.680> light<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:54.000> didn't

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
it's pretty low light in here it didn't

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.630 
it's pretty low light in here it didn't
look<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.840> way<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.170> me<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.500> first<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.250> macro

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
look that way to me at first but macro

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.130 
look that way to me at first but macro
is<00:01:56.759> always<00:01:57.090> gonna<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.570> darker<00:01:57.990> than

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
is always gonna be a little darker than

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.359 
is always gonna be a little darker than
you're<00:01:58.259> expecting<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:58.920> you're<00:01:59.100> getting

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
you're expecting because you're getting

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.830 
you're expecting because you're getting
into<00:01:59.490> areas<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.180> get<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.659> light

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
into areas that don't get a little light

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.270 
into areas that don't get a little light
obviously<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.530> were<00:02:01.619> seeing<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
obviously we were seeing that in the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.399 
obviously we were seeing that in the
studio<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.719> were<00:02:03.810> shooting<00:02:03.930> very<00:02:04.229> very

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
studio but we were shooting very very

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.130 
studio but we were shooting very very
close<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:04.979> I'm<00:02:05.130> I'm<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> pretty<00:02:06.140> easy

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
close here I'm I'm at a pretty easy

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.779 
close here I'm I'm at a pretty easy
macro<00:02:07.740> level<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.099> still<00:02:08.310> having<00:02:08.550> trouble

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
macro level and still having trouble

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.369 
macro level and still having trouble
with<00:02:08.879> light<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.330> brought<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.569> monopod<00:02:10.140> I

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
with light so I brought my monopod I

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.010 
with light so I brought my monopod I
have<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> choice<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.550> macro<00:02:11.879> lenses<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.510> still

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
have a choice in macro lenses I still

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.460 
have a choice in macro lenses I still
even

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
even

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.370 
even
without<00:02:13.650> decided<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> 100<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.840> 180

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
without decided to go with a 100 the 180

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.650 
without decided to go with a 100 the 180
would<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.800> let<00:02:17.040> me<00:02:17.070> have<00:02:17.790> an<00:02:17.910> easier<00:02:18.360> time

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
would have let me have an easier time

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.390 
would have let me have an easier time
with<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.230> position<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.800> my<00:02:19.920> camera<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.280> my

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
with the position of my camera in my

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.160 
with the position of my camera in my
body<00:02:20.610> while<00:02:20.940> trying<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.300> shoot<00:02:21.420> back<00:02:21.840> into<00:02:22.080> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
body while trying to shoot back into the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.990 
body while trying to shoot back into the
nooks<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.440> crannies<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.950> places<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.880> it's

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
nooks and crannies of places but it's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.250 
nooks and crannies of places but it's
dark<00:02:24.150> enough<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.450> here<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> really<00:02:25.080> want

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
dark enough in here that I really want

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.140 
dark enough in here that I really want
the<00:02:25.350> stabilization<00:02:26.100> that's<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.460> real<00:02:26.790> winning

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the stabilization that's a real winning

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.360 
the stabilization that's a real winning
feature<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.410> canon<00:02:28.740> hundred<00:02:29.010> millimeter

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
feature of this canon hundred millimeter

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.230 
feature of this canon hundred millimeter
macro<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.940> stabilization<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:32.000> put<00:02:33.000> my

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
macro is the stabilization so I put my

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.810 
macro is the stabilization so I put my
ball<00:02:33.720> head<00:02:33.990> on<00:02:34.260> my<00:02:34.500> monopod<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.430> gives<00:02:35.670> me<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
ball head on my monopod it gives me a

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.460 
ball head on my monopod it gives me a
lot<00:02:36.060> more<00:02:36.090> flexibility<00:02:36.810> than<00:02:37.020> mounting<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
lot more flexibility than mounting the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.890 
lot more flexibility than mounting the
camera<00:02:37.500> directly<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.520> monopod<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.210> also

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
camera directly to the monopod I also

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.980 
camera directly to the monopod I also
have<00:02:40.970> had<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.090> play<00:02:42.240> with<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> height<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
have had to play with the height of the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.210 
have had to play with the height of the
monopod<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.410> lot<00:02:43.620> now<00:02:43.830> when<00:02:43.980> you're<00:02:44.130> adjusting

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
monopod a lot now when you're adjusting

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.640 
monopod a lot now when you're adjusting
your<00:02:44.580> monopod<00:02:44.850> it's<00:02:45.240> best<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:46.050> much<00:02:46.500> as

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
your monopod it's best to as much as

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.220 
your monopod it's best to as much as
possible<00:02:46.860> work<00:02:47.370> with<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.760> higher<00:02:48.230> releases

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
possible work with the higher releases

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.260 
possible work with the higher releases
before<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.830> lower<00:02:50.010> ones<00:02:50.280> because<00:02:50.610> those<00:02:51.120> are

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
before the lower ones because those are

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.660 
before the lower ones because those are
the<00:02:51.300> ones<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.570> have<00:02:51.720> easy<00:02:51.930> access<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:53.430> if<00:02:53.580> I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
the ones you have easy access to so if I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.160 
the ones you have easy access to so if I
want<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.910> make<00:02:54.030> an<00:02:54.150> adjustment<00:02:54.240> I'm<00:02:54.780> making<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
want to make an adjustment I'm making it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.080 
want to make an adjustment I'm making it
to<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.380> top<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.920> monopod<00:02:56.310> not<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.730> bottom

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
to the top of the monopod not the bottom

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.120 
to the top of the monopod not the bottom
that<00:02:57.660> gives<00:02:57.900> me<00:02:58.020> a<00:02:58.080> little<00:02:58.260> more<00:02:58.410> flexibility

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
that gives me a little more flexibility

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.210 
that gives me a little more flexibility
and<00:02:59.370> it's<00:03:00.300> not<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.750> put<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.890> camera<00:03:02.070> on

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
and it's not that I put the camera on

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.590 
and it's not that I put the camera on
here<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.670> hold<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.180> particular

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
here and hold it in a particular

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.510 
here and hold it in a particular
position<00:03:03.750> I'll<00:03:04.200> lean<00:03:04.500> with<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.800> monopod<00:03:05.220> I'll

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
position I'll lean with the monopod I'll

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.670 
position I'll lean with the monopod I'll
tilt<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.940> around<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.690> point<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.320> gives<00:03:07.530> me

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
tilt it around the point is it gives me

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.920 
tilt it around the point is it gives me
at<00:03:07.860> least<00:03:08.040> one<00:03:08.310> axis<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.970> steady<00:03:09.480> shooting

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
at least one axis of steady shooting

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.780 
at least one axis of steady shooting
it's<00:03:10.320> also<00:03:10.500> something<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:10.920> can<00:03:11.070> push<00:03:11.310> against

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
it's also something I can push against

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.910 
it's also something I can push against
once<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.390> lock<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.750> head<00:03:12.900> down<00:03:13.050> no<00:03:13.590> matter<00:03:13.740> what

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
once I lock the head down no matter what

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.740 
once I lock the head down no matter what
position<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.520> in<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.360> gives<00:03:15.390> me<00:03:15.630> a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
position it's in and that gives me a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.330 
position it's in and that gives me a
little<00:03:15.840> more<00:03:16.080> flexibility<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.160> I'm<00:03:17.220> just

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
little more flexibility so I'm just

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.759 
little more flexibility so I'm just
gonna<00:03:17.430> frame<00:03:17.760> up<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.060> shot<00:03:18.330> here<00:03:18.690> on<00:03:18.870> these

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
gonna frame up a shot here on these

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.120 
gonna frame up a shot here on these
screws<00:03:20.640> now<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:22.260> course<00:03:22.380> I've<00:03:22.620> still<00:03:22.860> got<00:03:23.010> my

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
screws now of course I've still got my

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.440 
screws now of course I've still got my
depth<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.489> field<00:03:23.670> issues<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.150> I'm<00:03:24.239> dealing

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
depth of field issues that I'm dealing

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.479 
depth of field issues that I'm dealing
with<00:03:24.600> I'm<00:03:25.260> at<00:03:25.440> ISO<00:03:25.920> 1600<00:03:26.400> at<00:03:27.200> f28<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.680> here<00:03:29.010> I'm

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
with I'm at ISO 1600 at f28 in here I'm

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.790 
with I'm at ISO 1600 at f28 in here I'm
at<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> thirtieth<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.540> second<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.140> even<00:03:31.680> with

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
at a thirtieth of a second so even with

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.800 
at a thirtieth of a second so even with
stabilization<00:03:32.459> at<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.610> monopod<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.150> need<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.660> be

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
stabilization at a monopod I need to be

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.170 
stabilization at a monopod I need to be
careful<00:03:34.019> about<00:03:36.170> camera<00:03:37.170> shake<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:38.030> what<00:03:39.030> I'm

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
careful about camera shake and what I'm

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.479 
careful about camera shake and what I'm
doing<00:03:39.510> in<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.660> situation<00:03:40.290> like<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.980> even

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
doing in a situation like this is even

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.590 
doing in a situation like this is even
though<00:03:41.730> I'm<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:41.880> shooting<00:03:42.180> something

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
though I'm just shooting something

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.380 
though I'm just shooting something
that's<00:03:42.750> ultimately<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.680> texture<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.489> still

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
that's ultimately just a texture I still

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.560 
that's ultimately just a texture I still
want<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.720> have<00:03:46.340> some<00:03:47.340> possible<00:03:48.120> point<00:03:48.450> of

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
want to have some possible point of

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.930 
want to have some possible point of
focus<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.350> in<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:50.010> image<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.640> I'm<00:03:50.790> just

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
focus so in that image and I'm just

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.190 
focus so in that image and I'm just
getting<00:03:51.120> started<00:03:51.630> here<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.930> don't<00:03:52.080> really

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
getting started here so I don't really

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.539 
getting started here so I don't really
know<00:03:52.320> what<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.560> final<00:03:52.739> shot<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.070> yet<00:03:53.370> or<00:03:53.489> if

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
know what the final shot is yet or if

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.520 
know what the final shot is yet or if
there<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.850> even<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.330> good<00:03:54.450> shot<00:03:54.690> here<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.080> that

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
there is even a good shot here in that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.380 
there is even a good shot here in that
image<00:03:55.709> there's<00:03:56.010> one<00:03:56.190> screw<00:03:56.640> that's<00:03:56.820> poking<00:03:57.269> up

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
image there's one screw that's poking up

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.330 
image there's one screw that's poking up
and<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.600> focused<00:03:57.989> on<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.230> end<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.709> I've

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
and I focused on the end of that I've

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.530 
and I focused on the end of that I've
got<00:03:59.370> very<00:03:59.610> shallow<00:03:59.850> depth<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.209> field<00:04:00.269> I'm

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
got very shallow depth of field I'm

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.180 
got very shallow depth of field I'm
hoping<00:04:00.810> maybe<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.410> serve<00:04:01.680> as<00:04:01.860> some<00:04:02.010> kind

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
hoping maybe that can serve as some kind

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.940 
hoping maybe that can serve as some kind
of<00:04:02.280> compositional<00:04:02.970> anchor<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:04.170> very<00:04:04.590> very

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
of compositional anchor it's very very

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.009 
of compositional anchor it's very very
difficult<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.640> tell<00:04:05.970> what<00:04:06.269> these<00:04:06.450> shots<00:04:06.810> are

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
difficult to tell what these shots are

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.410 
difficult to tell what these shots are
really<00:04:07.049> gonna<00:04:07.410> look<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.920> because<00:04:08.610> of<00:04:08.910> the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
really gonna look like because of the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.789 
really gonna look like because of the
depth<00:04:09.600> of<00:04:09.750> field<00:04:09.930> issues<00:04:10.230> just<00:04:10.410> like<00:04:10.530> we<00:04:10.709> were

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
depth of field issues just like we were

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.190 
depth of field issues just like we were
finding<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.280> studio<00:04:11.610> so<00:04:12.180> you've<00:04:12.660> got<00:04:12.930> to

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
finding in the studio so you've got to

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.800 
finding in the studio so you've got to
work<00:04:13.440> them<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.739> lot<00:04:13.950> even<00:04:14.850> trying<00:04:15.299> to<00:04:15.450> review

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
work them a lot even trying to review

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.150 
work them a lot even trying to review
them<00:04:16.080> on<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.410> back<00:04:16.590> of<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:18.000> camera<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.810> not

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
them on the back of the camera is not

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.020 
them on the back of the camera is not
real<00:04:20.160> telling<00:04:20.900> because<00:04:22.729> even<00:04:23.729> there<00:04:23.880> you're

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
real telling because even there you're

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.890 
real telling because even there you're
not<00:04:24.180> getting<00:04:24.510> necessarily<00:04:25.110> an<00:04:25.260> accurate

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
not getting necessarily an accurate

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.680 
not getting necessarily an accurate
view<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.650> your<00:04:26.949> depth<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.340> field<00:04:27.639> notice<00:04:28.540> I'm

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
view of your depth of field notice I'm

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.749 
view of your depth of field notice I'm
working<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.290> handle<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.160> ball<00:04:30.340> had<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> lot

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
working the handle of the ball had a lot

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.189 
working the handle of the ball had a lot
I'm<00:04:30.940> really<00:04:31.210> moving<00:04:31.509> the<00:04:31.570> camera<00:04:31.780> around<00:04:31.930> a

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
I'm really moving the camera around a

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.780 
I'm really moving the camera around a
lot<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.830> other<00:04:32.949> thing<00:04:33.160> I'm<00:04:33.250> going<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.430> do<00:04:33.550> is

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
lot the other thing I'm going to do is

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.580 
lot the other thing I'm going to do is
bracket<00:04:34.479> my<00:04:34.690> depth<00:04:35.020> of<00:04:35.199> field<00:04:37.410> because<00:04:38.410> I'm

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
bracket my depth of field because I'm

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.249 
bracket my depth of field because I'm
not<00:04:38.770> sure<00:04:40.289> if<00:04:41.289> I<00:04:41.590> can<00:04:41.650> really<00:04:41.979> get<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:44.020> deep

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
not sure if I can really get the deep

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.939 
not sure if I can really get the deep
focus<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:44.919> want<00:04:45.310> or<00:04:45.580> where<00:04:46.530> that<00:04:47.530> focus

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
focus that I want or where that focus

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.920 
focus that I want or where that focus
should<00:04:48.130> be<00:04:48.340> I'm<00:04:48.789> shooting<00:04:49.120> summit<00:04:49.389> to<00:04:49.539> 8<00:04:49.720> and

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
should be I'm shooting summit to 8 and

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.129 
should be I'm shooting summit to 8 and
now<00:04:50.020> I'm<00:04:50.110> going<00:04:50.229> to<00:04:50.289> stop<00:04:50.500> down<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.880> 5<00:04:52.539> which

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
now I'm going to stop down to 5 which

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.810 
now I'm going to stop down to 5 which
gets<00:04:53.500> me<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> shutter<00:04:53.949> speed<00:04:54.070> of<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.370> fifth<00:04:54.610> of<00:04:54.729> a

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
gets me a shutter speed of a fifth of a

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.480 
gets me a shutter speed of a fifth of a
second<00:04:55.180> which<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.419> awfully<00:04:55.870> slow<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.340> think

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
second which is awfully slow so I think

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.590 
second which is awfully slow so I think
I'm<00:04:57.639> actually<00:04:57.759> gonna<00:04:57.970> even<00:04:58.210> tell<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.510> to

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
I'm actually gonna even tell it to

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.990 
I'm actually gonna even tell it to
underexpose<00:04:58.930> by<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.620> stop<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.220> speed<00:05:00.520> things<00:05:00.729> up

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
underexpose by a stop to speed things up

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.150 
underexpose by a stop to speed things up
that<00:05:01.840> gets<00:05:01.930> me<00:05:02.110> up<00:05:02.139> to<00:05:02.350> a<00:05:02.380> tenth<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.860> second

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
that gets me up to a tenth of a second

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.600 
that gets me up to a tenth of a second
and<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:07.330> can<00:05:07.510> hear<00:05:07.870> there<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.470> slow<00:05:09.340> shutter

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
and you can hear there the slow shutter

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.360 
and you can hear there the slow shutter
I'm<00:05:09.910> far<00:05:10.210> enough<00:05:10.360> out<00:05:10.539> that<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.720> can<00:05:10.930> work<00:05:11.080> the

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
I'm far enough out that I can work the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.080 
I'm far enough out that I can work the
focus<00:05:12.370> ring<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:13.180> even<00:05:13.360> autofocus<00:05:14.289> and<00:05:15.090> still

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
focus ring and even autofocus and still

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.960 
focus ring and even autofocus and still
get<00:05:16.240> some<00:05:16.830> some<00:05:17.830> control<00:05:18.310> in<00:05:18.490> my<00:05:18.610> focus

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
get some some control in my focus

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
get some some control in my focus
without<00:05:19.120> having<00:05:19.449> to<00:05:19.510> worry<00:05:19.660> about<00:05:19.720> just

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
without having to worry about just

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.339 
without having to worry about just
moving<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.289> camera<00:05:20.530> in<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:20.919> out<00:05:22.080> but<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.169> have

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
moving the camera in and out but I have

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:24.990 
moving the camera in and out but I have
a<00:05:23.380> feeling<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:24.009> lot<00:05:24.370> of<00:05:24.430> these<00:05:24.580> are<00:05:24.729> gonna<00:05:24.820> be

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
a feeling a lot of these are gonna be

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.290 
a feeling a lot of these are gonna be
blurry<00:05:25.380> so<00:05:26.639> something<00:05:27.639> I<00:05:27.759> might<00:05:27.910> do<00:05:28.090> if<00:05:28.180> I'm

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
blurry so something I might do if I'm

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.379 
blurry so something I might do if I'm
not<00:05:28.449> sure<00:05:28.509> if<00:05:29.080> I<00:05:29.289> can<00:05:29.349> get<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.910> focus<00:05:30.910> straight

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
not sure if I can get the focus straight

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.779 
not sure if I can get the focus straight
is<00:05:31.720> start<00:05:32.349> to<00:05:32.470> use<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.860> burst<00:05:33.070> feature<00:05:33.430> on<00:05:33.639> my

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
is start to use the burst feature on my

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.000 
is start to use the burst feature on my
camera<00:05:34.030> I'm<00:05:34.270> gonna<00:05:34.360> take<00:05:34.660> it<00:05:34.840> off<00:05:35.080> of<00:05:35.440> the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
camera I'm gonna take it off of the

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.129 
camera I'm gonna take it off of the
monopod<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.729> I'm<00:05:37.090> gonna<00:05:37.240> switch<00:05:37.479> really<00:05:37.990> to

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
monopod and I'm gonna switch really to

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.750 
monopod and I'm gonna switch really to
just<00:05:38.169> focusing<00:05:38.740> by<00:05:38.860> moving<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.310> camera<00:05:39.460> in

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
just focusing by moving the camera in

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.120 
just focusing by moving the camera in
and<00:05:39.880> out<00:05:39.970> I'm<00:05:40.270> also<00:05:40.510> putting<00:05:40.840> my<00:05:40.960> camera<00:05:41.470> into

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
and out I'm also putting my camera into

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.159 
and out I'm also putting my camera into
high-speed<00:05:42.580> drive<00:05:42.849> mode<00:05:43.150> so<00:05:43.720> as<00:05:43.810> long<00:05:43.930> as<00:05:43.990> I

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
high-speed drive mode so as long as I

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.620 
high-speed drive mode so as long as I
hold<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.380> shutter<00:05:44.590> button<00:05:44.650> down<00:05:44.889> I<00:05:45.630> get

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
hold the shutter button down I get

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.260 
hold the shutter button down I get
bursts<00:05:47.139> of<00:05:47.260> images<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:48.039> what<00:05:48.909> I'm<00:05:49.000> gonna<00:05:49.090> do

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
bursts of images and what I'm gonna do

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.089 
bursts of images and what I'm gonna do
now<00:05:49.479> is<00:05:49.750> pick<00:05:50.199> a<00:05:50.260> point<00:05:50.590> of<00:05:50.800> focus<00:05:51.039> and<00:05:53.099> push

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
now is pick a point of focus and push

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.129 
now is pick a point of focus and push
the<00:05:54.250> button<00:05:54.490> down<00:05:54.639> and<00:05:54.849> push<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:55.449> camera

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
the button down and push the camera

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.800 
the button down and push the camera
through<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.650> scene<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:57.940> with<00:05:58.510> the<00:05:58.630> hope<00:05:58.780> that

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
through the scene and with the hope that

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.750 
through the scene and with the hope that
something<00:05:59.440> in<00:05:59.590> there<00:05:59.800> will<00:06:00.639> be<00:06:02.280> good<00:06:03.280> focused

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
something in there will be good focused

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.189 
something in there will be good focused
this<00:06:03.880> camera<00:06:04.180> doesn't<00:06:04.330> have<00:06:04.449> a<00:06:04.570> super<00:06:04.990> fast

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
this camera doesn't have a super fast

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.980 
this camera doesn't have a super fast
burst<00:06:05.620> mode<00:06:05.970> I'm<00:06:06.970> shooting<00:06:07.330> with<00:06:07.449> the<00:06:07.539> mark<00:06:07.750> 2

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
burst mode I'm shooting with the mark 2

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.600 
burst mode I'm shooting with the mark 2
now<00:06:08.169> I<00:06:08.199> kind<00:06:08.500> of<00:06:08.530> wish<00:06:08.620> I<00:06:08.740> brought<00:06:08.800> my<00:06:09.099> mark<00:06:09.340> 3

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
now I kind of wish I brought my mark 3

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.649 
now I kind of wish I brought my mark 3
because<00:06:09.789> it's<00:06:09.940> a<00:06:10.030> little<00:06:10.240> bit<00:06:10.360> faster<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:12.659> so

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
because it's a little bit faster and so

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.050 
because it's a little bit faster and so
this<00:06:13.840> is<00:06:13.990> very<00:06:14.020> often<00:06:14.349> a<00:06:14.560> way<00:06:14.710> of<00:06:15.010> if<00:06:15.849> you're

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
this is very often a way of if you're

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.610 
this is very often a way of if you're
not<00:06:16.180> sure<00:06:16.449> that<00:06:16.479> you<00:06:16.750> can<00:06:16.900> hold<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.260> camera<00:06:17.409> on

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
not sure that you can hold the camera on

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.770 
not sure that you can hold the camera on
the<00:06:17.710> point<00:06:17.949> of<00:06:18.039> focus<00:06:18.190> in<00:06:18.639> drive<00:06:19.240> mode<00:06:19.270> you're

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
the point of focus in drive mode you're

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.390 
the point of focus in drive mode you're
knocking<00:06:20.289> off<00:06:20.409> a<00:06:20.440> bunch<00:06:20.800> of<00:06:20.889> images<00:06:21.280> around

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
knocking off a bunch of images around

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.189 
knocking off a bunch of images around
that<00:06:21.880> point<00:06:22.180> of<00:06:22.270> focus<00:06:22.360> and<00:06:22.690> hopefully<00:06:23.020> one<00:06:23.169> of

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
that point of focus and hopefully one of

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.740 
that point of focus and hopefully one of
them<00:06:23.289> is<00:06:23.380> gonna<00:06:23.470> be<00:06:23.650> sharp<00:06:23.940> so<00:06:24.940> all<00:06:25.300> of<00:06:25.599> these

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
them is gonna be sharp so all of these

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.450 
them is gonna be sharp so all of these
are<00:06:25.960> things<00:06:25.990> that<00:06:26.289> I'm<00:06:26.440> going<00:06:26.590> to<00:06:26.800> employ<00:06:27.159> as<00:06:27.430> I

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
are things that I'm going to employ as I

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.180 
are things that I'm going to employ as I
hopefully<00:06:28.120> one<00:06:28.570> day<00:06:28.720> make<00:06:28.900> it<00:06:29.050> back<00:06:29.260> outside<00:06:29.530> I

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
hopefully one day make it back outside I

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.159 
hopefully one day make it back outside I
don't<00:06:30.880> have<00:06:31.000> to<00:06:31.120> worry<00:06:31.270> about<00:06:31.389> wind<00:06:31.720> in<00:06:31.930> here

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
don't have to worry about wind in here

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.140 
don't have to worry about wind in here
so<00:06:32.409> this<00:06:32.620> is<00:06:32.800> a<00:06:32.830> nice<00:06:33.070> way<00:06:33.430> for<00:06:33.460> me<00:06:33.789> to<00:06:33.909> start

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
so this is a nice way for me to start

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.000 
so this is a nice way for me to start
practice<00:06:34.630> with<00:06:34.870> hand-holding<00:06:35.770> and<00:06:35.830> my

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
practice with hand-holding and my

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.459 
practice with hand-holding and my
monopod<00:06:36.490> and<00:06:36.520> some<00:06:36.909> found<00:06:37.120> objects<00:06:37.630> I'm

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
monopod and some found objects I'm

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:39.090 
monopod and some found objects I'm
trying

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 
trying

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.650 
trying
different<00:06:39.460> distances<00:06:39.970> because<00:06:40.270> with<00:06:40.540> this

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
different distances because with this

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.320 
different distances because with this
lens<00:06:41.140> unlike<00:06:41.710> the<00:06:41.830> 65<00:06:42.280> I<00:06:42.310> can<00:06:42.640> really<00:06:42.880> move<00:06:43.060> to

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
lens unlike the 65 I can really move to

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.870 
lens unlike the 65 I can really move to
different<00:06:43.480> focus<00:06:43.960> distances<00:06:44.530> I'm<00:06:45.010> got<00:06:45.700> my

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
different focus distances I'm got my

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.170 
different focus distances I'm got my
hand<00:06:46.210> always<00:06:47.700> understanding<00:06:48.700> where<00:06:48.940> this

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
hand always understanding where this

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.910 
hand always understanding where this
focus<00:06:49.630> switch<00:06:49.870> is<00:06:50.050> because<00:06:50.320> I'm<00:06:50.440> also<00:06:50.590> doing

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:50.920 
focus switch is because I'm also doing

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.980 
focus switch is because I'm also doing
just<00:06:51.130> some<00:06:51.250> close-up<00:06:51.700> shooting<00:06:52.180> so<00:06:52.690> being

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
just some close-up shooting so being

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.570 
just some close-up shooting so being
able<00:06:53.080> to<00:06:53.260> switch<00:06:53.470> to<00:06:53.650> the<00:06:53.770> deeper<00:06:54.010> focus<00:06:54.340> modes

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
able to switch to the deeper focus modes
