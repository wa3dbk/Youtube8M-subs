 good morning friends and welcome back to rc da 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.650
 ten years 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.320
 today I am here to present you a product 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:23.140
 very interesting the new radio control 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:30.939
 di casa samp a lyme xv f hss 2.4 gb with 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:32.710
 waterproof receivers we go to 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.809
 discover the contents of the box of 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.820
 this radio moment we have the 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:44.620
 cover and we find manuals of 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:49.030
 instructions in Italian English the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:56.499
 radio when a box for four batteries 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:01:04.960
 dual stylus a switch and the 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:07.090
 receiving 3 internet channel and let's go to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.370
 see this new radio more closely 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.380
 produced by the home know how we can 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.110
 see we have a radio in our hands 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.970
 extremely modern three-channel display 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.950
 lcd 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.810
 this is a full range radio control that 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.050
 what does this remote control mean? 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.560
 allows to have an excellent quality of 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.409
 signal up to 2 300 m 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.299
 ensuring the use and safety of 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.329
 go and shoot on any kind of 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.460
 tracing very important novelty in the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.700
 the world of radio controls is the possibility 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.280
 to feed this product with various 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.140
 types of bacteria that is, of series comes 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.390
 given within this radio control 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.640
 a blitz that contains four batteries 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.950
 double stylus so we have a voltage 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.899
 of about 43 produced perhaps though 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.909
 simply by changing a connector 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.409
 within the theory panorama we could 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.130
 power this remote control 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.619
 fight online provided type 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.789
 we also find a receiver quater cruz 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.679
 the new samp arx 37 v completely 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.739
 waterproof suitable for those who use it 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.620
 models on mud or on very land 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.390
 trivial and now let's see more in the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.340
 detail this new home radio 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.380
 saba 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.080
 let's see from extremely close 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.420
 this new samb home radio has like 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.209
 first thing we can see that this is 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.329
 a very ergonomic radio to a beautiful one 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.709
 handle and in the resting phase of the 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.209
 pilot this radio can be 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.160
 positioned or in this manner 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.190
 or even in this way guaranteeing 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.470
 extreme stability without ruining anyone 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.500
 radio coverage 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.630
 we have several buttons including these 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.819
 four that allow you to enter the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.180
 change and increase menu e 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.910
 decrease the values 3 buttons back 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.410
 the flyer which are two for the trim 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.500
 is one for the two networks the button for the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.519
 third channel and in the back 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.200
 we have the power button 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.880
 let's turn on this radio control 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.420
 first of all 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.250
 we remove the cover of the battery compartment 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.380
 and insert four AA batteries 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.739
 double I chose batteries not 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.739
 rechargeable 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.370
 and through the motor unit placed in the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.930
 rear 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.140
 let's go to hundreds of command the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.730
 LCD display allows us to view 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.370
 all parameters and settings 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.160
 that the pilot needs first 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.360
 we can see the instantaneous voltage 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.220
 of the battery 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.310
 we are going to discover all the functions of 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.680
 this command we find the possibility 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.530
 to adjust the 2 steering nets 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.870
 we can adjust the stops for everyone 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.750
 and three channels for steering for the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.060
 gas and for the third channel 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.310
 a very important thing that is a lot 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.330
 rare to find in the radio controls of 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.770
 economic band and exponential 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.640
 the exponential is the possibility of 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.930
 manage the sensitivity on the channels of the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.560
 steering and gas 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.600
 so if a driver is very nervous and 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.140
 moves the controls extremely 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.630
 rapid can decrease the sensitivity of the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:31.690
 appropriate channel to have a guide of 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:34.720
 the most precise model we find the 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.140
 abs function that can be set in 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.100
 mode loosen normal mode one 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.950
 fast lay or mode is up 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.040
 we can view the trim for it 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.600
 steering and gas 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.240
 we have the possibility to be able to 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.840
 choose from ten model memories 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.090
 so if a person has multiple models 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.160
 just buy different cements 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.520
 to always have on the same 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:08.290
 radio control settings saved for 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.990
 every model you own we find 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:15.640
 the possibility of managing sub- dreams 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:18.490
 for steering and gas and a lot of it 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.340
 important reverse for all channels 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.040
 so it doesn't matter what type and 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.240
 how many types of servo commands or 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.830
 accessories we use 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.630
 but the radio control allows us to 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.630
 reverse on all channels 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.009
 we can choose the name to be approved 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.319
 to each model in such a way as to 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:42.220
 find it extremely well 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:45.130
 fast in the radio control 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.080
 and in the end we return to the 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.050
 display of instantaneous voltage 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.569
 of the battery this important thing 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.639
 radio control with the receiver there 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.860
 offers fail safe on the gas 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.050
 so we can keep the 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.590
 our model in case of loss of 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.259
 signal 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.919
 or in case of power failure 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:08.800
 the receiver and with regards to 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:11.319
 the radio control power supply we have 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.419
 the battery alarm in case 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.659
 the tension of the 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:19.720
 remote control the radio control itself 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:22.150
 will sound an alarm and voltage sound 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.520
 will start to flash on the display 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.349
 giving us time to get the model back 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.009
 close to us and change AA batteries 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.009
 radio 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:48.659
 friends with this is all I showed you 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.309
 just a few details of this new one
