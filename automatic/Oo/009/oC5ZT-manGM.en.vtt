00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.690
 of the time I went to cover a rebellion that 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.970
 was having in house foundation in unit 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.250
 from itaquera 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.900
 When I got there I had apparently already 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.359
 the rebellion is over, right? 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:34.260
 and I went to the fungus of the unit 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.969
 I saw a boy at the foot of a tree and a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.120
 hanging on a tree 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.550
 I looked like that, you know when I was late 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 to process that it was smaller running away 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.930
 Saturday and then I was hung up and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.820
 played and the other debate is taking place 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.910
 He also ran out, Paul, I 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.149
 I took a look there when I gave myself 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.809
 I gave by myself that I was smaller running away fresh 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.370
 I lost pictures of a boy running away and such 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.340
 the team so early arrived a 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.010
 cameraman of a tv station 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.080
 he spoke with such agent 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.900
 approached the tree and how many people 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.710
 begins to listen to conversation from the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.890
 inside the world of the wall some 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.970
 one minute to play a hose 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.880
 fire outside the wall clothes will 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.520
 something else happens there, beginning 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.659
 People got crouched from one night 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.270
 so d'ale 20 minutes appears one 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.299
 head up yes looking 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.640
 there it was both tense and kind that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.590
 funny and had never been through a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.950
 this situation 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.100
 The boy did not even climb the wall if he 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.970
 hung on the tree and came down only there 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.310
 When I started this one came 15 more ago. 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.439
 so this photo is one of the main 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.730
 was the coolest so is it has with 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.090
 two boys upstairs 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.030
 the wall and has a pure 'duno twig 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.720
 tree so knows is the cover photo of 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.060
 newspaper that day and I even did a 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.980
 video because they were so stupid 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.140
 fleeing there came an hour that the damage 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.820
 already had changed caption had done 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.880
 everything is kind of big lens 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.040
 vertical horizontal skin angular 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.150
 I said, I'm going to record a password with 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.710
 camera, right? 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.270
 I ended up recording half of one is and the other 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.510
 whole from the time he was in 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.640
 up the wall, picking up the tree canopy and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.740
 going down and holding a place 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.340
 then running gandu and running away and 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.110
 passing from my side so to them is 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.690
 as if we had not encouraged 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.670
 important for them was to run away 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.790
 none of them tried to do anything with the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.060
 people instead went and left 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.060
 running 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.250
 to
