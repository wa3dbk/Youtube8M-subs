00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
now this is a feature packed HQ Billy

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.390 
now this is a feature packed HQ Billy
and<00:00:18.320> before<00:00:18.560> I<00:00:18.590> show<00:00:18.770> you<00:00:18.800> how<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:18.950> set<00:00:19.220> it<00:00:19.250> up

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.620 

one<00:00:25.160> of<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.369> most<00:00:25.550> important<00:00:26.180> features<00:00:26.330> on

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
one of the most important features on

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.500 
one of the most important features on
this<00:00:26.750> building<00:00:27.020> is<00:00:27.170> that<00:00:27.230> it's<00:00:27.529> twin<00:00:27.830> scheme

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
this building is that it's twin scheme

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.790 
this building is that it's twin scheme
there<00:00:29.510> is<00:00:29.539> actually<00:00:29.990> another<00:00:30.019> layer<00:00:30.500> under

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
there is actually another layer under

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.170 
there is actually another layer under
here<00:00:30.949> that's<00:00:31.160> attached<00:00:31.490> simply<00:00:31.970> by<00:00:32.119> this

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
here that's attached simply by this

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.390 
here that's attached simply by this
couple<00:00:32.540> a<00:00:32.720> couple<00:00:32.989> of<00:00:33.050> toggles<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:33.920> clip<00:00:34.129> it<00:00:34.250> in

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
couple a couple of toggles it clip it in

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.729 
couple a couple of toggles it clip it in
it's<00:00:34.879> a<00:00:35.030> permanent<00:00:35.330> twin<00:00:35.840> scheme<00:00:36.199> this

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
it's a permanent twin scheme this

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.100 
it's a permanent twin scheme this
prevents<00:00:37.280> condensation<00:00:38.059> keeping<00:00:38.750> your<00:00:38.870> warm

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
prevents condensation keeping your warm

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.510 
prevents condensation keeping your warm
in<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.320> winter<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:39.770> it<00:00:39.890> actually<00:00:40.070> keeps<00:00:40.340> you

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
in the winter and it actually keeps you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.880 
in the winter and it actually keeps you
cool<00:00:40.820> in<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.149> summer

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
cool in the summer

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.170 
cool in the summer
it<00:00:42.890> also<00:00:43.040> changed<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:43.579> pegging<00:00:43.879> points<00:00:44.090> on

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
it also changed the pegging points on

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.639 
it also changed the pegging points on
this<00:00:44.270> particular<00:00:44.570> building<00:00:45.020> where<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:45.500> need

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
this particular building where you need

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
to do grab the loop pull it air stick

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.549 
to do grab the loop pull it air stick
the<00:00:49.340> pegging<00:00:49.730> it's<00:00:50.120> that<00:00:50.360> easy<00:00:50.510> with<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.350> vent

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
the pegging it's that easy with the vent

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.529
