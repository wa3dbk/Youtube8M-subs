all<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> parts<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.790> building

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
all the parts I'm going to be building

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.790 
all the parts I'm going to be building
it<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.450> think<00:00:39.840> once<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> parts<00:00:40.680> i'll

it I think once I get the parts i'll
probably<00:00:41.040> vlog<00:00:41.430> maybe<00:00:41.820> show<00:00:42.059> me<00:00:42.090> building<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
probably vlog maybe show me building and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.020 
probably vlog maybe show me building and
I<00:00:42.899> don't<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.230> might<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.410> kind<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> cool

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
we're gonna do a Q&amp;A will do a lot of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000 
we're gonna do a Q&amp;A will do a lot of
stuff<00:01:00.600> will<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.050> much<00:01:01.199> fun<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.800> video

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
stuff will be so much fun in this video

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
stuff will be so much fun in this video
i<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> talk<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:02.609> something<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> i've

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
i want to talk about something that i've

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.179 
i want to talk about something that i've
been<00:01:03.840> thinking<00:01:04.199> about<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> while<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.830> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
been thinking about for a while that I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.070 
been thinking about for a while that I
that<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> always<00:01:06.119> see<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.390> youtube<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.930> that's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that I always see on youtube and that's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.890 
that I always see on youtube and that's
gamma<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.860> chances<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> guys<00:01:09.180> watch<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
gamma so chances are if you guys watch a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.420 
gamma so chances are if you guys watch a
lot<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.049> YouTube<00:01:10.380> videos<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> lot<00:01:11.400> of

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
lot of YouTube videos you see a lot of

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.149 
lot of YouTube videos you see a lot of
youtubers<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.000> hey<00:01:12.780> use<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.140> code<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.950> ten

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
youtubers like hey use this code for ten

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
youtubers like hey use this code for ten
percent<00:01:14.549> off<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:15.930> I've<00:01:16.200> never

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
percent off and you know I've never

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.740 
percent off and you know I've never
tried<00:01:16.830> gamma<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:17.580> I've<00:01:18.210> contemplated

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
tried gamma and I'm I've contemplated

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.899 
tried gamma and I'm I've contemplated
actually<00:01:19.530> trying<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.759> basically

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
actually trying it and I basically

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.670 
actually trying it and I basically
wanted<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> ask<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.810> all<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.380> thoughts

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
onyx I've looked up reviews on gamma and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.420 
onyx I've looked up reviews on gamma and
I've<00:01:24.780> seen<00:01:25.020> mixed<00:01:25.290> things<00:01:25.530> some<00:01:26.009> people<00:01:26.280> like

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.210 
it's all like a mental thing if you guys
know<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.570> made<00:01:43.229> those<00:01:43.259> wristbands<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.070> while

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
know they made those wristbands a while

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
know they made those wristbands a while
ago<00:01:44.460> called<00:01:44.820> power<00:01:45.119> bands<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.840> basically<00:01:46.229> put

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
ago called power bands and basically put

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.139 
ago called power bands and basically put
them<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.860> your<00:01:46.979> arm<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.670> could<00:01:47.850> balance

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
them on your arm and you could balance

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.999 
them on your arm and you could balance
better<00:01:48.659> when<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.079> wore<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.740> bracelet

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
better when you wore them the bracelet

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
better when you wore them the bracelet
had<00:01:50.220> nothing<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.790> with<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
had nothing to do with it it was all the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.210 
had nothing to do with it it was all the
fact<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.320> were<00:01:52.439> wearing<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.829> bracelet

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
fact that you were wearing the bracelet

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
fact that you were wearing the bracelet
and<00:01:53.250> mentally<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.060> made<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.479> tricks<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.049> mind

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
and mentally it made it tricks your mind

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.289 
and mentally it made it tricks your mind
into<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.130> actually<00:01:56.549> balancing<00:01:57.030> something

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
into like actually balancing something

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.719 
into like actually balancing something
like<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.960> maybe<00:01:58.560> gamma<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.460> does

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
like that so maybe gamma actually does

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.609 
like that so maybe gamma actually does
help<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> feel<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.780> lot<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.409> is

there<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.460> actually<00:02:30.970> like<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.150> fifty<00:02:31.810> percent

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
there is actually like a fifty percent

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.840 
there is actually like a fifty percent
off<00:02:32.500> thing<00:02:32.830> going<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.220> right<00:02:33.430> now<00:02:33.460> on<00:02:33.700> their

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
website so that might that's the bigger

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.770
