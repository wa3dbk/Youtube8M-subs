child sees how the top design will look
when<00:01:53.520> folded<00:01:54.030> she<00:01:54.780> must<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.229> decide<00:01:55.259> what

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
when folded she must then decide what

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.800 
when folded she must then decide what
the<00:01:56.340> bottom<00:01:56.729> design<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:57.240> look<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.600> when

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the bottom design will look like when

folded the same way the answer to this

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.530 
folded the same way the answer to this
one<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.079> e<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:02.520> older<00:02:02.969> children<00:02:03.240> these

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
one is e for older children these

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.420 
one is e for older children these
questions<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.200> much<00:02:04.409> harder<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:05.189> kids

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
questions are much harder because kids

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.340 
questions are much harder because kids
need<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.820> figure<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.149> what<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> design<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
need to figure out what a design on the

need to figure out what a design on the
bottom<00:02:07.530> will<00:02:08.310> look<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.729> when<00:02:08.940> folded<00:02:09.599> and
