00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:24.200
 hello to all today we get 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.240
 found for a small unique video on 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.640
 certain aspects of call of duty goal 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.419
 com you have a strong title in the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.239
 background is going to talk 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.460
 the sound only for studio mode but 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.930
 ask for a long time at the beginning in 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.670
 the background as youtube hours it's 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.410
 really practical do not have to 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.960
 ric would always say what we do 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.430
 so that's why I was wondering 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.320
 so I rule posed the gameplay 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.530
 firstly we find ourselves in scrum 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:55.160
 general as usual with the s 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:01:00.019
 at 805 700 805 with the front handle and 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.179
 a laser sight then gameplay I you 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.250
 go rescue is not at all my 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.390
 bigger show than the majority of 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.520
 they have already made more gains 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.970
 impressive but it will be fair to me 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.680
 as visual support to explain to you 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.300
 of children what I had today 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.880
 So why not studio month 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.340
 done by the multi is simply 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.770
 because of the new new console and 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.970
 I'll be able to give it to us 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.470
 allow in the background everyone 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.960
 thought he knew everything about the next 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.590
 consoles so you have to hook up 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.020
 your 3d screen live from platforms 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.000
 as twitter ivy 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.180
 i also think about youtube directly 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.759
 because even though we can do it on 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.170
 youtube it's really a shot of 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.610
 change of system he studies in 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.320
 the scale of a dryer a rumor like 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.770
 what practices would be more beautiful 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.090
 on ps4 xbox one in the background for call 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.400
 of left duty 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:02.820
 death problem that would be at the level of 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.070
 the fluidity of child's play so it's 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.380
 this taste then I will really I want 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.000
 play to call of duty head it would be good 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.290
 to go on 13 cac 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.590
 then in my opinion does it precisely 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.880
 let 's talk youtube again except that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.490
 it'll be super accessible 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.180
 it'll make a little bit of how to handle 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.190
 it 's really worth it too easy to 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.140
 all over I think you're going to me 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.060
 to understand in the background is that for 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.980
 be the sport still it changes 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.210
 looters 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.280
 still have a minimum of talent 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.320
 call of duty you have to be able to express yourself 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.750
 still appropriately to have 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.730
 ideas to express the concepts and the other 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.680
 the concepts point to saturate the kid 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.370
 it's going to be everybody sees like everything 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.800
 do and we'll see hundreds and 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.370
 hundreds of any kind of concept that's 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.650
 is going to be for 520 kg can alone and 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.000
 it's going to be difficult especially for 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.580
 victories that me who barely have 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.850
 nascent 130 to beaune such a thing 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.920
 kind tried to fend off 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.370
 games I already have a lot of 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.690
 competitions on dansons on youtube 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.480
 to do this a place 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.950
 2 it's going to give the hand allows the child 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.330
 that's what it's just a 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.960
 little video mode because it is not 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.960
 necessary 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.220
 but cries for children abandoned by 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.830
 report to his consultants in the corner 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.040
 long gone out on his advice in 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.800
 explaining that money is live 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.960
 really game is suitable skin and others 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.030
 no children reality of a new 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.020
 console is also the maps are adapted 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.780
 for nineteen containers 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.350
 so if he is however his weight rup 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.420
 all this normal he allows our girl 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.900
 it's really just because it's a 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.720
 pure content happiness like for example I 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.550
 think of the fact in dominance if all 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.050
 we teams are at point 6 and then everything 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.030
 danger is taking the point to another 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.380
 all alone their children are not going 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.680
 change like in the old ones because the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.540
 viewty will really stayed classified as 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.190
 only name that they will take in the 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.380
 tray that go of the deceased shown so much 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.540
 seduced by rather flat 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.760
 at this level to save him from death more one 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.200
 face nine competitions took 6% 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.230
 for sure it's flat when I get up 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:24.680
 while still regretting blah blah blah the 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.810
 second his part so that's the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.250
 combination of the crazy juggernaut with the 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.960
 chi it really hurts a lot in these 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.270
 parts skeptics see cash effect 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:38.540
 and the quiet uss 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.040
 we do the big juggernaut who have 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.500
 otherwise I had others to you 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.210
 count the child is the first two 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.000
 month you see in the bottom st paul and 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.980
 new jean and syria are machine that 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.610
 the regulars of the machines seem 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.950
 to appreciate 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.050
 so I really like this proposal 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.220
 in this package in his present game 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.740
 each of the body weapons to be broadcast 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.480
 to the young people my class how I 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.510
 the know is typing and why then a little 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.000
 nice gameplay game then we talk 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.560
 together we interact it will be the famous 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.920
 it allows me to talk to you enough 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.820
 often without having a big fat 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.610
 idea behind the head in the make that a 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.340
 so it's here we come soon to the 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.540
 end of the gameplay there is still 23 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.150
 that he in the background that the mastodon 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.680
 know quickly enough mercy the juice when 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.510
 even a lot of damage it should 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.700
 rather long ago that we are 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.210
 gone as a model and that's it 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.400
 completed 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:36.140
 so that's basically it was just a 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.580
 it's about making the information the most 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.800
 accessible possible of why there is 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.340
 not the name of the studio on call of duty 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.650
 kid 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.690
 then he felt the community 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.180
 present my is pretty good I find 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.740
 for the game we really criticize 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.080
 long I'm dark or city one 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:56.270
 could really say long pre 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.550
 debate long but I have enough 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.310
 this day I think it brings the 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.720
 freshness to the series 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.390
 even his breast more serene because the 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.980
 virus is not a great point according to 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:13.130
 I should really be healthy 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:15.830
 4 other ten were very important 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.200
 that short he is supposed to have a pack 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.880
 competitive to go out I wait for him with 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.280
 impatience we'll see what's going to be 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.470
 obviously polishes it all because 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.150
 that on the bio is we were really 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.100
 still solidarity is there they have 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.230
 played anyway a lot in league get 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.550
 then it really went down in the 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.920
 background have faith everybody 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.410
 disappears encrypts everything we 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.600
 stopped playing in competition 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.220
 these chips to the kids and Africa 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.780
 scholars so on this site is at 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.550
 orders I wish you a good ending 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.650
 of day a good late evening then 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.030
 we are very close for a 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.030
 new video was going to end
