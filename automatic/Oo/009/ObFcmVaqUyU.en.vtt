hear him speak about poverty and the

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.740 
hear him speak about poverty and the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
question is what's what's with that so

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.360 
question is what's what's with that so
there's<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.989> little<00:03:00.139> bit<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.500> political<00:03:00.829> tin

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
ear going on here and I think that's

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.949 
ear going on here and I think that's
where<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.519> Edwards<00:03:05.000> campaign<00:03:05.450> has<00:03:05.599> really

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959
