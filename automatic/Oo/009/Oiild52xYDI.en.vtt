00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 good girls today I want to tell you 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.500
 what are my favorite products 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.029
 you are always asking me and today I 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.470
 I will tell you about the last months 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.470
 which I use the most every day 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.910
 the first is this colony of tous that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.670
 It's super sweet I'm a lot of perfumes 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.310
 sweet and smells super good is new to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.200
 that you try it for facial cleansing 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.570
 I really loved these two 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.950
 products a mask that in a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.349
 minute 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.779
 the super white skin is super well 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.759
 and super clean and the soap cited that is in 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.160
 foam that I like very much not foam 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.140
 to clean the brushes that I always 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.450
 you ask the one of jon blogs it seems to me 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.969
 fantastic because it does not leave them oily 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.670
 and then it evaporates then we are 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.969
 working is super simple also the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.190
 new sun cream that was like going to 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.600
 the beach to second of my indispensable 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.879
 it's super good it's protection 45 and it's 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.129
 super light then for the contour of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.429
 eyes I really like that of pons that in 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.739
 reality is not new but for me yes 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.170
 then it is very good because it makes a difference 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.120
 the bottom part with the one on top and I 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.730
 very much like wrinkles that are already 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.070
 technique thinks to worry a bit later 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.260
 for the nails I love the prebase of 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.380
 sally hansen I think 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.380
 because if you're in a hurry you have a color 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.510
 very beautiful skin and it protects you and then 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.240
 I'm in love with the new opi de 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.430
 cocacola which is the one I have right now 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.700
 the mascara that has come out 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.010
 new from lan with great that is good 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.460
 the truth is the packaging is beautiful I do not know 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.370
 if you see it well that has the little flower and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.260
 then what has different is how 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.850
 apply it because you get everywhere 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.980
 the truth is that it's great for that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.220
 because both the eyelashes here and 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.870
 those below is perfect then the new 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.680
 format that also has benefit 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.360
 as a prebase of eyes I like it much more 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
 that the one that was before he was a batcher 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.970
 this is applied as the same as a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.860
 corrector but for the area above 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.200
 I liked this form a lot 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.690
 I also liked Ian a lot 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.880
 the new lip gloss that I'm not from 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.290
 light colors as you always give 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.840
 account but the truth is that it has 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.990
 much liked the tone nothing and also of 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.970
 lancÃ´me 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.980
 the eyebrow pincer that this the truth 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.490
 almost always lately you see him because 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.400
 I like it very much it is illuminator and it is also 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.550
 for the little things there are in various shades 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.130
 and the green eyeliner cited 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.400
 the truth seems to me a color too 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.500
 for this winter super nice and so 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.810
 these have been my favorites of these 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.370
 months the truth I would like to know which 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.590
