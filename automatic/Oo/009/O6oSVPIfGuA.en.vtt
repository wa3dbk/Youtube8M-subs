answer<00:01:53.940> is<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.300> need<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.660> find<00:01:54.900> ways<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.500> build

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
answer is we need to find ways to build

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.490 
answer is we need to find ways to build
collective<00:01:56.720> collectives<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:57.869> coalition's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
collective collectives and coalition's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.650 
collective collectives and coalition's

and the clear analysis of racism and
that's<00:02:00.990> gonna<00:02:01.200> make<00:02:01.410> us<00:02:01.560> much<00:02:01.770> more<00:02:01.979> effective

a short time of explaining the concept

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.280 
a short time of explaining the concept
of<00:02:41.580> white<00:02:41.730> privilege<00:02:41.880> because<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.570> can<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
of white privilege because it can be a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.949 
of white privilege because it can be a
scary<00:02:43.860> concept<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.670> concept<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:46.850> causes

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
scary concept and a concept that causes

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.009

anger and frustration and I think we

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.280 
anger and frustration and I think we
presented<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.840> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290

anger which is important because

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.839 
anger which is important because
