so<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.289> case<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.100> spend<00:01:02.609> more<00:01:02.760> time

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
so in that case if you spend more time

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.359 
so in that case if you spend more time
on<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> 360<00:01:03.840> version<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.470> Minecraft<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> want

maybe<00:03:33.450> some<00:03:33.690> voice<00:03:33.870> commands<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.800> same

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
maybe some voice commands but the same

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.500 
maybe some voice commands but the same

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
4 camera which can do that essentially

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.950 
4 camera which can do that essentially
the<00:03:38.400> same<00:03:38.550> thing<00:03:38.790> as<00:03:38.820> voice<00:03:39.090> command<00:03:39.480> also

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
the same thing as voice command also

what<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.230> PlayStation<00:03:40.830> 4<00:03:40.860> maybe<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.640> dual

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
what the PlayStation 4 maybe the dual

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.790 
what the PlayStation 4 maybe the dual
path<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.690> has<00:03:42.840> on<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.320> PlayStation<00:03:43.770> 4

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110
