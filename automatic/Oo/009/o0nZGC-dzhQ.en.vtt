never<00:01:08.860> looked<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:09.160> realistic<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:11.380> say<00:01:11.560> this

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
never looked so realistic and I say this

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.880 
never looked so realistic and I say this
in<00:01:11.920> jest<00:01:12.190> but<00:01:12.429> it's<00:01:12.610> actually<00:01:12.970> kind<00:01:13.479> of<00:01:13.539> true

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
in jest but it's actually kind of true

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.430 
in jest but it's actually kind of true
this<00:01:14.890> was<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.130> very<00:01:15.880> realistic<00:01:16.300> looking<00:01:16.810> for<00:01:17.410> a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
this was a very realistic looking for a

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.999 
this was a very realistic looking for a
sports<00:01:17.770> game<00:01:18.009> for<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.340> Atari<00:01:18.610> 2600<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.830> was

sports game for the Atari 2600 it was

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.570 
the tennis game released for the Atari
2600<00:01:24.909> might<00:01:25.600> look<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:25.869> lot<00:01:26.050> like<00:01:26.259> pong<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.920> fact

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
2600 might look a lot like pong in fact

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.940 
2600 might look a lot like pong in fact
it<00:01:27.729> might<00:01:27.819> look<00:01:28.000> identical<00:01:28.179> to<00:01:28.539> pong<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.830> it

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
it might look identical to pong and it

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.180 
it might look identical to pong and it
might<00:01:30.099> just<00:01:30.220> be<00:01:30.369> labeled<00:01:30.759> tennis<00:01:32.069> but<00:01:33.069> this

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
might just be labeled tennis but this

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.279 
might just be labeled tennis but this
game<00:01:33.369> really<00:01:33.550> actually<00:01:33.819> sent<00:01:34.209> the<00:01:34.270> bar<00:01:34.479> for<00:01:35.229> a

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
game really actually sent the bar for a

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:45.389 
game really actually sent the bar for a
little<00:01:35.440> more<00:01:35.679> realistic<00:01:36.130> gameplay<00:01:44.220> now<00:01:45.220> let

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
little more realistic gameplay now let

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.680 
little more realistic gameplay now let
me<00:01:45.429> talk<00:01:45.610> about<00:01:45.670> gameplay<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.539> player

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
me talk about gameplay and player

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.779 
me talk about gameplay and player
control<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.410> I'm<00:01:48.160> not<00:01:48.340> going<00:01:48.459> to<00:01:48.520> get<00:01:48.670> into

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
control and I'm not going to get into

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.089 
control and I'm not going to get into
the<00:01:49.030> rules<00:01:49.270> because<00:01:49.660> it's<00:01:50.080> tennis<00:01:50.530> if

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
the rules because it's tennis if

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:52.499 
the rules because it's tennis if
you<00:01:51.190> don't<00:01:51.369> know<00:01:51.489> the<00:01:51.580> rules<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.880> tennis<00:01:51.970> look

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
you don't know the rules of tennis look

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.010 
you don't know the rules of tennis look
it<00:01:52.629> up<00:01:53.580> but<00:01:54.580> there<00:01:54.759> is<00:01:54.789> one<00:01:54.910> curious<00:01:55.420> note<00:01:55.810> in

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
it up but there is one curious note in

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.990 
it up but there is one curious note in
addition<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.590> rules<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.129> then<00:01:57.580> it's<00:01:57.849> not

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
addition to the rules and then it's not

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.710 
addition to the rules and then it's not
possible<00:01:58.239> to<00:01:58.569> hit<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.869> ball<00:01:59.050> out<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.349> bounds

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
possible to hit the ball out of bounds

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.930 
possible to hit the ball out of bounds
so<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:01.869> tennis<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:02.440> control<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.129> pink<00:02:03.670> player

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
so in tennis you control the pink player

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.119 
so in tennis you control the pink player
or<00:02:04.179> peach<00:02:05.020> colored<00:02:05.410> player<00:02:05.649> or<00:02:05.860> whatever

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.129 
or peach colored player or whatever

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:10.919 
or peach colored player or whatever
color<00:02:06.789> that<00:02:07.229> light<00:02:08.229> color<00:02:08.500> player<00:02:09.069> is<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.929> you

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
color that light color player is and you

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.540 
color that light color player is and you
move<00:02:11.080> them<00:02:11.260> about<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.709> screen<00:02:12.040> with<00:02:12.520> the

move them about the screen with the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.080 
move them about the screen with the
joystick<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.860> automatically<00:02:15.580> hit<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.910> ball

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
joystick you automatically hit the ball

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.619

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.190 
play there's a regular one and two
player<00:02:33.370> game<00:02:33.780> you're<00:02:34.780> looking<00:02:35.020> at<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
player game you're looking at the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.930 
player game you're looking at the
regular<00:02:35.350> one<00:02:35.680> player<00:02:35.890> now<00:02:36.070> there's<00:02:36.670> also<00:02:36.820> a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
regular one player now there's also a

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.680 
regular one player now there's also a
slow

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
slow

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.380 
slow
one<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.410> two<00:02:38.500> player<00:02:38.710> game<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:39.970> tested<00:02:40.330> out

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
one and two player game and I tested out

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.450 
one and two player game and I tested out
the<00:02:40.450> slow<00:02:40.750> motion<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.380> it's<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.950> same<00:02:42.130> exact

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
the slow motion and it's the same exact

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.450 
the slow motion and it's the same exact
game<00:02:42.640> except<00:02:43.060> for<00:02:43.210> it<00:02:43.300> runs<00:02:43.480> about<00:02:43.600> half<00:02:43.930> speed

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
game except for it runs about half speed

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.310 
game except for it runs about half speed
so<00:02:45.460> I<00:02:45.490> can't<00:02:46.240> imagine<00:02:46.330> why<00:02:46.600> you'd<00:02:47.020> want<00:02:47.230> to

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
so I can't imagine why you'd want to

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:57.450 
so I can't imagine why you'd want to
slow<00:02:47.770> this<00:02:47.950> down<00:02:48.010> any<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:56.460> found

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
slow this down any but you can I found

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.580 
slow this down any but you can I found
the<00:02:57.610> computer<00:02:57.970> opponent<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.590> Activision

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
the computer opponent in Activision

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.730 
the computer opponent in Activision
tennis<00:02:59.950> quite<00:03:00.490> difficult<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:01.090> beat<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:02.200> fact<00:03:02.440> I

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
tennis quite difficult to beat in fact I

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.550 
tennis quite difficult to beat in fact I
couldn't<00:03:03.670> beat<00:03:03.850> him<00:03:03.970> at<00:03:04.060> all<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.420> was<00:03:05.200> lucky<00:03:05.350> if

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
couldn't beat him at all I was lucky if

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.820 
couldn't beat him at all I was lucky if
I<00:03:05.650> scored<00:03:06.040> once<00:03:06.850> or<00:03:07.030> twice<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.390> them<00:03:07.800> it's<00:03:08.800> a

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
I scored once or twice on them it's a

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.900 
I scored once or twice on them it's a
very<00:03:09.340> difficult<00:03:09.610> very<00:03:09.970> aggressive<00:03:10.540> opponent

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
very difficult very aggressive opponent

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.730 
very difficult very aggressive opponent
but<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:12.940> think<00:03:13.240> Activision<00:03:13.870> tennis<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.350> strong

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
but I think Activision tennis is strong

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.280 
but I think Activision tennis is strong
suit<00:03:15.070> is<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.730> two-player<00:03:16.210> mode<00:03:16.290> it's

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
suit is the two-player mode it's

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.240 
suit is the two-player mode it's
actually<00:03:17.650> quite<00:03:17.800> fun<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.100> play<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> friend<00:03:18.760> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
actually quite fun to play a friend I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.680 
actually quite fun to play a friend I
found<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.400> graphics<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:21.850> animations<00:03:22.450> of

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
found the graphics and animations of

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.280 
found the graphics and animations of
Activision's<00:03:23.290> tennis<00:03:23.760> quite<00:03:24.760> effective

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
Activision's tennis quite effective

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.260 
Activision's tennis quite effective
especially<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.710> Atari<00:03:26.980> 2600<00:03:27.520> they

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
especially for the Atari 2600 they

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.500 
especially for the Atari 2600 they
attempted<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.750> render<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.230> game<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.620> 3d<00:03:30.070> and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
attempted to render this game in 3d and

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.500 
attempted to render this game in 3d and
it<00:03:31.510> actually<00:03:31.690> worked<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:33.820> my<00:03:34.270> biggest

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
it actually worked but my biggest

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.560 
it actually worked but my biggest
complaint<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.400> how<00:03:36.400> they<00:03:36.670> decided<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.240> render

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
complaint is how they decided to render

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.920 
complaint is how they decided to render
the<00:03:37.690> court<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:37.990> 3d<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.340> look<00:03:39.490> closely<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
the court in 3d if you look closely the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.010 
the court in 3d if you look closely the
court<00:03:41.650> outline<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.340> trapezoid<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.300> not<00:03:43.989> a

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
court outline is a trapezoid and not a

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.880 
court outline is a trapezoid and not a
parallelogram<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:46.030> whatever<00:03:46.270> opponent<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.080> on

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
parallelogram so whatever opponent is on

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.280 
parallelogram so whatever opponent is on
the<00:03:48.070> upper<00:03:48.370> portion<00:03:48.550> of<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.880> screen<00:03:49.200> has<00:03:50.200> a

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
the upper portion of the screen has a

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.620 
the upper portion of the screen has a
smaller<00:03:50.860> play<00:03:51.220> area<00:03:51.610> than<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.330> bottom

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
smaller play area than the bottom

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.550 
smaller play area than the bottom
portion<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.480> this<00:03:55.660> effectively<00:03:56.140> gives<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.470> an

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
portion so this effectively gives you an

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.900 
portion so this effectively gives you an
advantage<00:03:56.650> if<00:03:57.130> you're<00:03:57.280> on<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.430> top<00:03:57.670> portion

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
advantage if you're on the top portion

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.190 
advantage if you're on the top portion
of<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.209> screen<00:03:58.300> because<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.780> have<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.900> smaller

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
of the screen because you have a smaller

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.540 
of the screen because you have a smaller
area<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.770> cover<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:02.800> did<00:04:02.980> find<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.430> this

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
area to cover and I did find that this

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.460 
area to cover and I did find that this
minor<00:04:03.850> difference<00:04:04.300> did<00:04:04.510> affect<00:04:04.810> gameplay<00:04:04.930> it

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
minor difference did affect gameplay it

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.680 
minor difference did affect gameplay it
was<00:04:05.920> in<00:04:06.130> fact<00:04:06.310> easier<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.880> score<00:04:07.180> when<00:04:07.570> you're

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
was in fact easier to score when you're

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.670 
was in fact easier to score when you're
in<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.870> top<00:04:08.050> portion<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.590> screen<00:04:09.090> as<00:04:10.680> for

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
in the top portion of the screen as for

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.440 
in the top portion of the screen as for
sound<00:04:11.920> there's<00:04:12.340> only<00:04:12.489> two<00:04:12.790> notes<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.300> this

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
sound there's only two notes in this

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.610 
sound there's only two notes in this
game<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.860> sound<00:04:15.640> of<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.820> ball<00:04:15.940> bouncing<00:04:16.390> and

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
game the sound of the ball bouncing and

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.849 
game the sound of the ball bouncing and
the<00:04:17.620> sound<00:04:17.890> of<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.310> point<00:04:18.549> being<00:04:18.760> scored<00:04:19.859> but

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
the sound of a point being scored but

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.980 
the sound of a point being scored but
it's<00:04:21.340> effective<00:04:21.609> sometimes<00:04:22.300> less<00:04:22.780> is<00:04:22.810> more

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
it's effective sometimes less is more

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.480 
it's effective sometimes less is more
and<00:04:24.600> there<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:25.750> have<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:26.220> tennis<00:04:27.220> by

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
and there you have it tennis by

and there you have it tennis by
Activision<00:04:29.760> certainly<00:04:30.760> not<00:04:31.150> Activision's
