00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi friends you on the channel and Timlin 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.160
 today we look samsung with you 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.010
 galaxy s3 mini 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.200
 let's get here like this today with you 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.590
 I will unpack it, I will show you what's inside 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.660
 so let's start removing the box here 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.810
 our phone itself 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.510
 so here we have s3 mini is very similar to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.230
 IS-3 is only smaller 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.330
 I understand some tracks on the colors so 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.610
 let's put it aside and see what 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.239
 we have in the box so 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.680
 in the box we have a folder with 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.540
 documents if you can call it that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.370
 we have a guide on two different 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.890
 languages â€‹â€‹in Ukrainian and Russian 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.809
 some papers and warranty card 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.230
 but we don't need it let's postpone and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.910
 let's see what else we have here 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.520
 here we have more nasadochka on 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.820
 vacuum headphones we do n't need them either 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.050
 let's look at the headphones themselves 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.460
 This is how it looks and we have headphones 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.000
 headset I will not them yet 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.330
 unpack these remove so then u 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.990
 Us usb cable cable like 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.570
 normal durable in general no matter what 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.310
 I can not say about the strength of charging 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 look at this wire he's just 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 will break 2 days after 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.119
 somehow using samsung can't 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.340
 ok to do at all 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.650
 wires from all its okay damn okay 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.930
 never mind so more is needed still in the box 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.680
 we did not let us lie down and 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:37.470
 look at the phone itself 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.049
 we have 4 diagonal here resolution 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.530
 screen in my 800 by 480 if i don't 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.950
 am wrong 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.479
 phone weight 120 grams 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.630
 I think it is 7 grams less than y 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.659
 iphone let's compare the size and 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.719
 with the fifth iphone i'm here so here they are 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.340
 About the screen looks like I'm 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.000
 I see 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.930
 slightly smaller in length but at Samsung 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.009
 more wide 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.549
 Here in the hand he sits well tight I 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.620
 I think it will not fall out 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.239
 further honestly he weighs more like a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.239
 I feel like he even weighs 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.099
 less than the fund itself okay not important 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.709
 let's try it now 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.780
 enable and tell you more about 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:31.680
 characteristics so let's take off 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:35.700
 lunoch careful so so let's 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.379
 turn on while the phone turns on I 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.780
 tell you what we have here inside 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.900
 so the first is the processor 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.780
 we have a processor here 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.189
 dual core one not hertz here as well 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.400
 here is an impressive amount 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:53.609
 RAM in size 1 gigabyte 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.620
 as for the battery, the battery 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.449
 we have one and a half thousand milliamps here 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.480
 an hour i think for such a phone it 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:02.909
 must be long enough to be on 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.590
 camera camera we have back 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:09.870
 goes 5 megapixel autofocus 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.939
 flash and record video with 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.250
 720p resolution 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.900
 not destined to care 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.090
 front camera front camera with us 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.340
 just 0 3 megapixels but with 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.819
 this she can record video with 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.949
 720p resolution too, strangely enough 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.400
 Well, we actually have already loaded 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:32.310
 let's go see whether 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.180
 to put in the interface let's go into the menu 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.709
 and then what we look through them so well maybe 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.900
 at the first flipping there will be some 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.479
 podlagivaniya and then basically all this 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.069
 sort of smooth and nothing lags 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.540
 also present on screen 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.729
 small grit on i think those who 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.769
 they know nothing they won't even notice 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:54.419
 let's go to valyria to see what 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:57.870
 it is here well, so let's see this 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:04:01.769
 it seems to be scrolling all smoothly all 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.299
 beautiful everything is good well let's talk 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.909
 about the budget of this phone and in general 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.739
 how much it costs, I think more precisely not 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.480
 I think this phone can be attributed to 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.450
 class budget 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.949
 since it is about twice worth 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:20.280
 less than samsung galaxy s3 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:22.889
 Now the phone is suitable for those who want Me 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.750
 have everything in the phone but strongly 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.820
 I do not overpay, I think such a phone 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.740
 will be especially for you also I forgot 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.620
 say present is present 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.680
 we still have with vois this is an analogue of siri 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.290
 on android 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.040
 Well, on this all with you were Alexander and 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.040
 Kirill bye
