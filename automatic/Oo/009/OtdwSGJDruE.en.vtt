developed<00:01:02.440> by<00:01:02.530> third-party<00:01:03.329> companies<00:01:04.329> so

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
developed by third-party companies so

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.200 
developed by third-party companies so
far<00:01:05.110> there<00:01:05.530> aren't<00:01:05.799> too<00:01:06.070> many<00:01:06.100> but<00:01:07.000> if<00:01:07.090> it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
far there aren't too many but if it

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.170 
far there aren't too many but if it
grows<00:01:07.479> it<00:01:07.780> could<00:01:08.110> be<00:01:08.260> pretty<00:01:08.530> interesting

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
grows it could be pretty interesting

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.520 
grows it could be pretty interesting
some<00:01:10.180> of<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.330> top<00:01:10.600> functions<00:01:11.049> that<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.200> found

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
some of the top functions that I found

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.800 
some of the top functions that I found
for<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.770> device<00:01:11.979> were<00:01:12.190> making<00:01:12.549> calls<00:01:12.820> sending

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
for the device were making calls sending

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.840 
for the device were making calls sending
and<00:01:13.900> receiving<00:01:13.930> text<00:01:14.290> messages<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:15.190> also

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
and receiving text messages and also

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.780 
and receiving text messages and also
taking<00:01:16.210> pictures<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:17.770> manage<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.430> device

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
taking pictures to manage the device

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.550 
taking pictures to manage the device
though<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.150> can<00:01:19.450> use<00:01:19.659> your<00:01:19.840> hands<00:01:20.170> but<00:01:20.380> it's<00:01:20.500> a

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
though you can use your hands but it's a

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.770 
though you can use your hands but it's a
pretty<00:01:20.799> small<00:01:20.950> screen<00:01:21.549> it's<00:01:21.729> only<00:01:21.820> about<00:01:21.940> 1.6

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
pretty small screen it's only about 1.6

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.750 
pretty small screen it's only about 1.6
inches<00:01:22.990> so<00:01:23.890> really<00:01:24.280> what<00:01:24.430> you're<00:01:24.490> going<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.670> be

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
inches so really what you're going to be

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.149 
inches so really what you're going to be
doing<00:01:24.909> is<00:01:25.180> using<00:01:25.450> s<00:01:25.780> voice<00:01:25.950> which<00:01:26.950> is

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
doing is using s voice which is

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.130 
doing is using s voice which is
essentially<00:01:27.670> Samsung's<00:01:28.270> version<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.840> Siri

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
essentially Samsung's version of Siri

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.070 
essentially Samsung's version of Siri
you<00:01:29.619> can<00:01:29.770> tell<00:01:29.979> s<00:01:30.220> voice<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.820> text<00:01:31.390> somebody<00:01:31.630> or

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
you can tell s voice to text somebody or

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.469 
you can tell s voice to text somebody or
you<00:01:32.170> can<00:01:32.350> give<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:32.680> number<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.070> dial<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:34.360> was

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
you can give it a number to dial it was

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.179 
you can give it a number to dial it was
pretty<00:01:34.689> convenient<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.380> make<00:01:35.619> calls<00:01:35.950> with

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
pretty convenient to make calls with

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.070 
pretty convenient to make calls with
this<00:01:36.310> device<00:01:36.610> especially<00:01:37.240> while<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:37.869> was

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
this device especially while I was

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.810 
this device especially while I was
driving<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.590> know<00:01:38.799> I<00:01:38.830> have<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.549> microphone

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
driving you know I have the microphone

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.880 
driving you know I have the microphone
right<00:01:40.390> there<00:01:40.420> facing<00:01:41.260> my<00:01:41.380> way<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.770> the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
right there facing my way and the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.490 
right there facing my way and the
speaker<00:01:42.280> as<00:01:42.430> well<00:01:42.670> but<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.900> quality<00:01:44.260> was<00:01:44.290> not

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
speaker as well but the quality was not

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.920 
speaker as well but the quality was not
too<00:01:45.159> perfect<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.850> definitely<00:01:46.330> sounded<00:01:46.689> very

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
too perfect it definitely sounded very

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.960 
too perfect it definitely sounded very
tinny<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:48.009> was<00:01:48.130> kind<00:01:48.369> of<00:01:48.430> hard<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.700> hear

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
tinny and it was kind of hard to hear

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.270 
tinny and it was kind of hard to hear
even<00:01:49.360> when<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.570> was<00:01:49.689> alone<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.140> my<00:01:50.380> vehicle<00:01:50.619> so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
even when I was alone in my vehicle so

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.679

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
this device there are some critical

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.449 
this device there are some critical
flaws<00:03:37.269> for<00:03:37.600> example<00:03:38.139> I<00:03:38.350> really<00:03:39.100> couldn't<00:03:39.400> find

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
flaws for example I really couldn't find

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.550 
flaws for example I really couldn't find
a<00:03:39.940> single<00:03:40.299> third-party<00:03:41.019> app<00:03:41.170> worth

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
a single third-party app worth

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.759 
a single third-party app worth
installing<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.370> here<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:43.200> there<00:03:44.200> was<00:03:44.319> one<00:03:44.350> app

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
installing on here so there was one app

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.910 
installing on here so there was one app
that<00:03:45.010> will<00:03:45.220> take<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.519> picture<00:03:46.329> of<00:03:46.660> wine<00:03:47.410> labels

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
that will take a picture of wine labels

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.500 
that will take a picture of wine labels
and<00:03:48.069> tell<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.430> kind<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.790> wine<00:03:48.970> but<00:03:49.359> it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
and tell you the kind of wine but it

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.599 
and tell you the kind of wine but it
really<00:03:49.720> didn't<00:03:50.139> seem<00:03:50.350> too<00:03:50.560> useful<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:51.280> that's

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
really didn't seem too useful and that's

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.039 
really didn't seem too useful and that's
kind<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.060> case<00:03:52.269> here<00:03:52.569> so<00:03:52.600> you're<00:03:52.870> really

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049
