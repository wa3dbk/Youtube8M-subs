00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 very good everyone welcome again 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.609
 to destin and in this video we will see a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.470
 guide to kill acro is in the root 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.269
 the end of chalk let's see the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.160
 strategy that we will follow the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.330
 positions that we have to take the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.309
 small details those little details 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.230
 that can make us lose in the fight 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.210
 let's see when the enemy enters 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.130
 We will see it all the time 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.100
 we have everything all well explained to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.930
 try to make it as easy as possible 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 then we have to start eliminating 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.750
 the enemies of the right and of the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.060
 left 3 to the right and 3 to the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.830
 left and we will come out the first one 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.300
 leave then you will have to go pick up the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 CÃ¡diz is worth 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.129
 and we will have to leave all and come to 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.110
 the central part to the part of here of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.300
 here we will have to come here 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 everything and search the portal to start 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 shoot the portal for the fastest 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.579
 possible since it opens will be out there in 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.520
 we will have to shoot him half 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.730
 eliminating the street eliminating everything 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.320
 once we have eliminated it 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.390
 here will be a player to eliminate 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.520
 something to the snipers that come out 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.899
 there to the gentlemen who leave there one 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.280
 of the players takes the sword and leaves 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.570
 for there for that position that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.159
 now we will see it and we will have it 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.289
 shoot with everything 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.119
 with rocket launchers with everything 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.590
 we have to remove the shield also 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.229
 let's see the weapons we will need 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.270
 we will have to knock him down the companion 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.039
 hit with the sword and it will rise and what 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.109
 we will have to knock down again 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.299
 worth the mate will give him again with 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.979
 the broken sword will come for the right 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.689
 when it gets up we will have to get 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.099
 here and the same look for the sword holder and 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.859
 shoot him a ticket twice 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:33.599
 carrying swords at the first time we've 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.340
 given will come the second one that is 

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.899
 You are there and once you think it is 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.000
 there in the middle we will knock down the portal 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.610
 sword the same the fellow gets 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.530
 here the sword's limp and will continue 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.810
 that area there we'll take acro 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.450
 is the first time the partner will give you 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.129
 with the sword and when he gets up 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.259
 again it is very grave the companion 

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:54.149
 put the second round in the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.950
 next round will not come out covered 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.079
 two achievements will better us 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.700
 we will have to come here to the bottom here 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.079
 in the background to shoot the ogres now 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.939
 also to all we will see now 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.590
 how would it be worth I'm explaining a 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.569
 poquillo the positions and that we have 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.069
 that to assert the shoulders from here 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.749
 back they kill themselves well 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.700
 once the others are eliminated 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:14.680
 we'll have to go forward 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.959
 to see the one of the sword what would be his 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.939
 strategy of the sword carrier 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.980
 make possible the level more actors 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.319
 we left from the beginning as we have 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.290
 said in the companions and the one with the paw 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.700
 same take the relic of this the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.859
 first he goes out to put the relic and 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.349
 you will have to come here to the center 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.719
 also the same will kill the one of the 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.700
 arcade and once it's the one with the leg 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.190
 dead will have to come with the sword 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.500
 around here for this area 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.320
 and here on the left dodging the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.420
 lackeys who go out of the others 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.910
 comrades must have already killed 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.320
 the Franks bring riva to the knights 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.510
 if we are hunters we can do 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.460
 invisible and when and when your body 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.630
 is lying down worth from here from 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.980
 the stone I think is lying down 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.570
 we will have to communicate 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.070
 logically we will come here and we will do 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.370
 the combo the combo that we make 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.500
 are three times the big hit is worth the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.620
 hit is the trigger from behind we make it 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.590
 three times with others it will rise us 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.090
 we will come again here we will put you with 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.850
 heavy weapons with everything 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.850
 we have and we will come again and 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.800
 we will give again the combo three of blows 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.840
 of the big ones and we'll come over here 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.880
 ok for the center again for 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.160
 push us in that would be the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.720
 strategy of the sword what is it 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.670
 what happens if we take too long if we do not do 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.090
 a lot of damage that the enemy goes into fury 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.540
 once it goes into fury 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.550
 the big eye it will grow we will have to 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.210
 kill him in the eye because if we do not die 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.370
 everyone 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.650
 once we kill the bear it will return to 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.330
 then out again so once 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.180
 between fury we can not do anything worth 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.830
 will finally work the bear is not going 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.030
 to stop going out others are going to continue 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.550
 also so we're not going to have 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.710
 possibility of practically nothing worth 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.840
 when a player dies, the same thing will come out 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.900
 the eye back big back the mouth the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.790
 supreme alarm ok you can kill that 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.560
 there are no problems with the sniper 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.240
 we can put all the damage we have 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.160
 anything goes to eliminate them and then 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.080
 revive the companion vale let's see 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.490
 when it enters into fury crota would be the 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.990
 first round of the portal so that 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.840
 we would have two bouts of blow to 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.820
 give him we would have another second round with 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.380
 carries each other two batches to give 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.420
 sold the first round of ogre 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.230
 we would have a third round of portal 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.090
 swords 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.130
 we would have the two batches another fourth 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.650
 round two more batches of blow to give 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.930
 and would come again the two achievements worth 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.610
 we would have a fifth round of porta 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.860
 swords there could no longer the message of 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.960
 imminent fury we could give you other 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.510
 two batches of espadazo and the sixth round 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.830
 of the one of the porta each would already come to the 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.960
 fury we would have nothing to do 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.760
 we will have nine minutes to kill him 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.139
 approximately and well let's see all 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.580
 the positions that we are going to take 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.949
 everything as we will have to eliminate the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.749
 enemies and others like I said before 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.879
 three on the left and three on the right 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:57.490
 and we will have to leave and come to 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:00.099
 down for the area that we've seen a 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.840
 Once we are here here, what 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.669
 said is to look for the portal every thing 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.650
 fast possible the companion with the caddy 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.319
 and it comes here when we need 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.999
 we take it off and we turn it on 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.860
 to give this would be the first round of 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:14.560
 portal every we will have to eliminate it what 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.930
 faster as possible, worth carrying nothing 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.610
 we eliminate him the partner takes the 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.370
 relic and directly from that companion 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.599
 is going to eliminate the francs made of 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.729
 here on the left for the two 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.740
 gentlemen we put all the damage very 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.840
 important to have a machine gun already 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.150
 that if we take a second without 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.800
 hit him acro is in the lab and the 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.120
 shield will be filled with the 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.969
 corrective measure machine gun by 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.650
 example has 100 bullets and life is not 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.479
 is going to fill the shield is not going to 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.979
 filling is very difficult we will have cai 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.099
 Aragon we will have the truth all the 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.749
 rocket launcher but we will shoot vale 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.370
 in the only one here of how we have seen two 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:50.229
 times in two runs we will have to give 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.819
 we have removed a little bit of life and 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.770
 we will come here in crotas 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.479
 will come to the area on the right 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.919
 then we will have to be stuck 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.629
 we can not go outside until it 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.180
 go because he is not shooting from above 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:03.460
 this would be the second round of the second 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.020
 Sword Bearer worth another follow here 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.940
 to follow then we will have to kill them 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.199
 from here in and once you leave 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.940
 for outside 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.039
 for there and for the medium always 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.050
 we can arrive the companion has put 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.000
 this pomp to generate order since if 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.360
 the partner leaves with the sword with the 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.270
 supercharged can give you a combo of 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.539
 two strong swords and one super from 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.580
 the scale is worth it will do even more damage 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:30.610
 we remove again we remove electro 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.009
 the crota will fall and the same thing both walked 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.020
 will come the first appearance of the 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.310
 eyes but once you created is it 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.349
 will raise when it will be in the area 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.740
 from the left we kill the eyes of 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.970
 the facts here in some companion 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.349
 simple you have to put a pomp that in the 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.900
 medium as we see and from behind the 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:48.430
 pomp super simple good practically 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.790
 they will not give us 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.590
 and we eliminate them the other two once 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.510
 that is eliminated, the 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.060
 porta fado and that would be the third round 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.340
 the third portal every one that comes out the same 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.970
 we kill the Franks the mate who 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.380
 is charged with the submachine gun is that 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.880
 you can regenerate half of us 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.350
 all the time making him 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.150
 getting hurt and you can not 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.100
 regenerate the shield and with the cockpit 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.480
 hong if we have the truth then you 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.950
 we will remove all the whole point 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.590
 we will have to be very coordinated in 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.530
 that and talk a lot to know when 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.910
 when can we give it now also 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.790
 would have the second appearance of the 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:27.280
 ogres as I said before it would be 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.710
 two appearances of these two others the 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.050
 fifth round of the belt by slice and this 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.180
 would be the last round here would already put the 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.070
 imminent rage message in two rounds 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.740
 last is what we would have for 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.930
 eliminate it worth 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.849
 and nothing we continue with this mechanics 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.039
 we can come up here to pick up 

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:45.419
 ammunition we can take all the 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.400
 possible pills since they are going to 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:49.830
 we need it and in the end we finish 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.569
 killing the bars we choose our 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.819
 rewards and as I say it's a fight 

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:55.560
 quite difficult are many attempts 

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:57.330
 a lot of fight that we are going to have between the 

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.039
 comrades and nothing guys this has been 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.530
 I hope you liked it, I hope 

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:05.509
 that can help and see you in 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.509
