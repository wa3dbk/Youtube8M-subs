 roasted this meat sprinkled on it and here 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.430
 it is considered well 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.159
 top of bliss for the french but in 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.560
 Mostly she sold as with such 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:14.730

 than they are wonderful why am i so 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:30.410
 love the fact is that it is like they would not 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.979
 before baked 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.560
 also because you can see in your head 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.880
 covered up they are called pre 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.750
 not until fried and see like for 10 minutes 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.360
 you put them in the oven and in ten 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.710
 minutes you freshly baked bread is 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.620
 very handy when years time and three 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.990
 bottom ran there from the bakery or when 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.710
 guests came from the bread did not calculate then 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.270
 that the french eat a lot of bread and 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.180
 how could it be simply irreplaceable 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.270
