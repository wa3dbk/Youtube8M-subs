tangles or knots this part is optional
but<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.879> taking<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.480> back<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.840> my<00:00:39.960> teasing

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
but I like taking the back of my teasing

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.530 
but I like taking the back of my teasing
comb<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:41.010> lifting<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.700> my<00:00:41.760> hair<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
comb and then lifting up my hair on the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.850 
comb and then lifting up my hair on the
front<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.170> way<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.710> flat<00:00:45.860> this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
front so that way it's not so flat this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.470 
front so that way it's not so flat this
part<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.219> probably<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.670> most<00:00:47.789> damaging<00:00:48.300> but

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
part is probably the most damaging but

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.000 
part is probably the most damaging but
you<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.780> need<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> cover<00:00:49.200> most<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.680> your<00:00:49.860> hair

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you will need to cover most of your hair

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.250 
you will need to cover most of your hair
with<00:00:50.219> hair<00:00:50.250> spray<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.510> tease<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.079> hair

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
with hair spray and then tease the hair

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.970 
with hair spray and then tease the hair
of<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.559> ponytail<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.219> crazy

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830

I'm going to call this method the double
twist<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:16.110> you're<00:01:16.380> twisting<00:01:16.800> your

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
twist because first you're twisting your

twist because first you're twisting your
hair<00:01:16.950> around<00:01:17.370> itself<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.510> you're

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
hair around itself and then you're

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.870 
hair around itself and then you're
twisting<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.230> so<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.650> creates<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> button

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.070

secure with your second hair tie and

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.719 
secure with your second hair tie and
then<00:01:26.290> you're<00:01:26.470> basically<00:01:26.590> done<00:01:27.690> at<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:30.490> point

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
then you're basically done at this point

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.820 
then you're basically done at this point
your<00:01:30.909> bun<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.330> pretty<00:01:31.840> average<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:32.680> is

your bun is pretty average and it is

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
really small so I would recommend going

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.110 
really small so I would recommend going
the<00:01:34.900> extra<00:01:35.320> mile<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.530> make<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.040> a<00:01:36.100> lot<00:01:36.220> bigger

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
there's nothing special about this part

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.320 
there's nothing special about this part
it's<00:01:42.680> simply<00:01:43.040> just<00:01:43.100> tugging<00:01:43.520> on<00:01:43.700> your<00:01:43.850> bun<00:01:44.030> and

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
it's simply just tugging on your bun and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.149 
it's simply just tugging on your bun and
fluffing<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:44.900> up<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.320> then<00:01:45.409> Bobby<00:01:45.650> pinning<00:01:45.920> it

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
fluffing it up and then Bobby pinning it

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.910
