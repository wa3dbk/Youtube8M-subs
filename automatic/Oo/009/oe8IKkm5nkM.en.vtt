there's all kinds of things you can do
with<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.289> sample<00:00:25.529> I'll<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.890> show<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
with this sample I'll just show you a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.290 
with this sample I'll just show you a
couple<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.539> get<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> idea<00:00:29.300> first

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
couple of them so you get the idea first

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.510 
couple of them so you get the idea first
of<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.510> I'm<00:00:30.599> gonna<00:00:30.779> set<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> amp<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:32.219> clean

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
of all I'm gonna set the amp for clean

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.280 
of all I'm gonna set the amp for clean
and<00:00:32.730> bright<00:00:33.590> I'm<00:00:34.590> gonna<00:00:34.890> bring<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> gain<00:00:35.579> down

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
and bright I'm gonna bring the gain down

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.910 
and bright I'm gonna bring the gain down
keep<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.440> EQ<00:00:37.860> set<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.760> does<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.920> ISF

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
keep the EQ set it does have the is ISF

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.130 
keep the EQ set it does have the is ISF
function<00:00:41.370> which<00:00:42.059> means<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.660> turn<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
function which means if I turn it to the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.600 
function which means if I turn it to the
left<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.530> gonna<00:00:43.649> sound<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.129> more<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.489> an

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
left it's gonna sound like more like an

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.959 
left it's gonna sound like more like an
American<00:00:45.360> amp<00:00:45.860> but<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.760> cool<00:00:47.910> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
American amp but this is really cool I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.779 
American amp but this is really cool I
can<00:00:48.239> kick<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> tube<00:00:49.079> emulation<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> I'm

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
can kick on the tube emulation and I'm

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.139 
can kick on the tube emulation and I'm
gonna<00:00:51.000> set<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.620> 6l6

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
gonna set it to 6l6

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:01.400 
gonna set it to 6l6
which<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:59.570> say<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:00.750> an<00:01:00.870> American<00:01:01.260> app

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
which is what say what an American app

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.929 
which is what say what an American app
would<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.730> like<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.820> Fender<00:01:04.580> we're<00:01:05.580> gonna<00:01:05.700> kick

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
would be like a Fender we're gonna kick

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.600 
would be like a Fender we're gonna kick
on<00:01:06.090> some<00:01:06.299> reverb<00:01:06.890> I've<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> choice<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
on some reverb I've got a choice of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.490 
on some reverb I've got a choice of
several<00:01:08.820> different<00:01:09.270> kinds<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.630> reverb<00:01:09.900> I'm

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
several different kinds of reverb I'm

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.460 
several different kinds of reverb I'm
gonna<00:01:10.710> set<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> nice<00:01:11.430> spring<00:01:11.790> reverb<00:01:12.470> and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
gonna set it to a nice spring reverb and

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.200 
gonna set it to a nice spring reverb and
I'll<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> nice<00:01:14.130> fender<00:01:14.580> II<00:01:14.670> sort<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> tone

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
I'll get a nice fender II sort of tone

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:34.819 
I'll get a nice fender II sort of tone
out<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.600> amplifier

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.330 

it<00:01:35.829> can<00:01:35.979> be<00:01:36.100> very<00:01:36.369> ringy<00:01:36.789> very<00:01:37.750> bright<00:01:38.340> breaks

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
it can be very ringy very bright breaks

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.520 
it can be very ringy very bright breaks
out<00:01:39.579> a<00:01:39.610> nap<00:01:39.899> now<00:01:40.899> I'm<00:01:40.990> gonna<00:01:41.140> get<00:01:41.289> a<00:01:41.320> little

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
out a nap now I'm gonna get a little

blues going here

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.469 
blues going here
will<00:01:43.090> turn<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:44.039> crunch<00:01:45.210> give<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.360> little

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
will turn it to crunch give it a little

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.620 
will turn it to crunch give it a little
bit<00:01:46.630> more<00:01:46.810> gain<00:01:47.670> I'll<00:01:48.670> bring<00:01:48.939> this<00:01:49.119> up<00:01:49.299> to<00:01:49.450> be

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
bit more gain I'll bring this up to be

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.249 
bit more gain I'll bring this up to be
in<00:01:49.960> between<00:01:50.770> say<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.630> British<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.810> American

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259
