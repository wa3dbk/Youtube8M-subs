00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.610
 welcome to try hd view 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.670
 have we can see 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.580
 new gadget this time from 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.500
 bhd a sound raver this is a device 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.990
 the can you with you at home on the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.540
 desk on a glass plate one 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.540
 bonnet or somewhere else 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.220
 hinstellen and this device whether by 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.150
 bluetooth to control and of course must 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.830
 I be meeting 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.480
 yes, I just missed it all 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.879
 Here we have one again 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.140
 very sturdy packaging here one 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.120
 small look note 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 Here is a small instructions for use 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.019
 then up here shows a little one 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 Protective Cover Everything You Really Need 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:59.519
 say very high quality packaged and 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:03.000
 we small out at us 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:08.220
 can see this is definitely yet 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.900
 many packed and we have there too 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.310
 already that is the first look 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.490
 I would say now consists of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.320
 aluminum feels in any case 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.420
 is synonymous for the size really right 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.060
 heavy 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.280
 down here you go then the plate 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.680
 it was making them scarfed it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 resonance is generated and here are too 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.859
 such a small smile or stop 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 Better just a last trigger was 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.780
 the sound comes out again 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.600
 apparently with a magnetic field like 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.259
 also the music or the like 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.869
 Noise in this wooden plate for 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.219
 example is like me at the desk 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.770
 pushes in and from it you have stop 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:56.999
 then this sound relationship we look 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.520
 something is still in the box so there 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:06.600
 looks pretty empty here then we have 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:09.179
 another usb connection cable the whole 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.860
 then runs in principle on the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.010
 USB connection and can be seen then 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.560
 it feeds on a layman in the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.560
 here in the device goes in and there 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.670
 on the side 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 and here we have the button on 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.130
 from the device here is the one over 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.170
 bluetooth activated 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.700
 and then we do not take any 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.700
 ask as you can see 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.370
 yes that it was now for the first time will 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.270
 Of course, another video for you turn 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.190
 in terms of sound quality then you can 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.370
 you have a picture yourself 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.870
 or make a judgment of the whole 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.780
 what else can you say about the device 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.930
 has a 360 degree sound in the runtime 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.230
 up to 120 hours is easy 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.610
 Pair bluetooth 2.0 with any 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:06.200
 Devices that have blood have what you can 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.760
 to say I have to believe 4 watt has 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.690
 the device but not really installed 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.250
 the world, apparently, very much 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.900
 Evasive I already have a lot 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.770
 a lot of positive resonance is part of it 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.930
 Just let yourself be surprised 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.040
 Of course I will reflect a video 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.900
 Imagine with the sound and then you can 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.100
 you just have a look at it 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.100
 until then, still good
