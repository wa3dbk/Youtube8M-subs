the behind the head push jerk is not

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.229 
the behind the head push jerk is not
allowing<00:03:28.500> those<00:03:28.590> elbows<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.220> stay<00:03:29.430> back<00:03:29.699> so

allowing those elbows to stay back so

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.149 
allowing those elbows to stay back so
one<00:03:30.389> of<00:03:30.419> the<00:03:30.599> common<00:03:31.049> faults<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.560> we<00:03:31.680> see<00:03:31.919> is

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
one of the common faults that we see is

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.460 
one of the common faults that we see is
dropping<00:03:33.000> those<00:03:33.090> elbows<00:03:33.449> underneath<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.290> bar

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
dropping those elbows underneath the bar

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.860 
dropping those elbows underneath the bar
as<00:03:34.769> we<00:03:35.489> go<00:03:35.669> for<00:03:35.879> this<00:03:35.970> dip<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.419> he's<00:03:36.540> gonna<00:03:36.659> pull

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
as we go for this dip so he's gonna pull

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.319 
as we go for this dip so he's gonna pull
his<00:03:36.900> elbows<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.379> front<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:39.030> is<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.180> bad

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
his elbows in front and this is a bad

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.759 
his elbows in front and this is a bad
position<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:39.870> don't<00:03:40.019> want<00:03:40.169> to<00:03:40.260> be<00:03:40.379> in<00:03:40.650> this

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
position we don't want to be in this

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.099 
position we don't want to be in this
position<00:03:41.250> when<00:03:41.549> we<00:03:41.579> create<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.359> jerk<00:03:42.629> as<00:03:42.780> you

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
position when we create that jerk as you

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.800 
position when we create that jerk as you
can<00:03:43.319> see<00:03:43.500> his<00:03:43.709> upper<00:03:44.069> spine<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.609> rounding<00:03:45.239> okay

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
can see his upper spine is rounding okay

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.449 
can see his upper spine is rounding okay
which<00:03:45.989> will<00:03:46.139> create<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.470> lack<00:03:46.859> of<00:03:46.889> spinal

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
which will create a lack of spinal

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.610 
which will create a lack of spinal
extension<00:03:47.729> which<00:03:48.329> means<00:03:48.629> he<00:03:49.109> will<00:03:49.260> not<00:03:49.409> be

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
extension which means he will not be

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.920 
extension which means he will not be
able<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.859> perform<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.370> slip<00:03:50.579> safely<00:03:51.090> okay<00:03:51.599> so
