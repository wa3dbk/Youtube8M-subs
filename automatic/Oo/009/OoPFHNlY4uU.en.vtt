 after a little over three years it will be 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.390
 registered on youtube 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.059
 I finally decided to show myself 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.190
 back since i canalis and not 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.740
 to be all about following is true continues 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.109
 request for details tutorials 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.520
 drawings I decided for free 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.570
 mostly this kind of video in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.039
 so requests to look for yours 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.019
 doubts 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.019
 in this video they were like drawing 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.109
 the eyes of a chosen character like 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.420
 subject from the freaks design protagonist 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.530
 of the hunter hunter series and I will show for 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.210
 the note how to draw the eyes of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 this character in the front view 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 side and three quarters 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.930
 if you doubt how he saw the video 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.180
 I advise you to comment on it though 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.370
 you have details managed among others 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.300
 drawings and I advise you to write the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.910
 my facebook wall 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.910
 now I leave you to the video good vision 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.980
 to draw the eyes of a 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.250
 first manga character you have to 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.890
 draw two horizontal lines that 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.040
 will serve as a limit to where you will go from 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.050
 place the eyes immediately after 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.790
 you will have to make a draft of the eye in 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.930
 way to know where it will be 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.950
 positioned make it very light like this 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.460
 excessively you can gate without 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.460
 problems 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:40.240
 once this is done you can start 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:46.799
 put more details then marked 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.799
 the iris the same in the other eye 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:07.719
 ok now the eyebrows that will be a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:10.269
 bit tip made this sketch you can 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.280
 start limestone more so 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:18.330
 to give more visibility to the eye 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:27.880
 start to mark the contours more 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:30.360
 so draw the reflection of the light e 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.360
 the iris 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.989
 having done that, now move on to the other 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:48.989
 which does the same thing as the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:51.769
 eye contour drawn on 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.769
 light reflection 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.079
 ok it's Libya again 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:10.359
 follow the eyebrow ok this will be 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.530
 the definitive form of hatred when 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.870
 say sure you are in to mark 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.670
 more or always with a pencil 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.209
 or maybe you can use one 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.209
 different tool 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.950
 ok is defined 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.810
 once finished you can delete the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.810
 our guidelines 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.830
 to draw the eyes a character 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.810
 in profile the draft must be said 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.910
 of the eye or sorry I meant before 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.510
 the horizontal lines must be drawn 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:11.650
 like a little while ago you always draw the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:14.090
 eye bag this time though 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:21.169
 launches since in profile it will be more 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:23.440
 thin when you have traced sketches 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:30.710
 now started to mark more 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:34.720
 ok done this diet always the reflection 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.720
 of light and then the eyebrow 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:45.440
 when you are sure, towel to design 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:49.190
 start marking it and trace what 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.090
 you have designed so as to have more 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.090
 visibility 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.190
 done this you can cancel 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.190
 the guidelines again 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.410
 for the character instead in view in 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.930
 three quarters the thing is not entirely 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.760
 same but similar to tracing 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.850
 horizontal lines and you will have to wrap them up 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.990
 a little bit inclined diagonally 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:22.080
 so having done this then he returns to his 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.700
 procedure always draw a draft 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:35.520
 of the eye so you know where you are going 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:37.910
 to position it and do the same for 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.910
 the other 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.250
 obviously indifferent from which you want 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:52.650
 starting is our choice then 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:55.550
 retrace eyebrows started a 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.550
 put more details 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.430
 the same in the other eye 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.419
 and eyebrows 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.570
 once done this you can start 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:43.080
 to mark the design again as from 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.080
 can complete it 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.600
 ok the collar also from pra ciglia ok the 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:57.510
 design is over I hope there has been 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.510
 useful ie the next
