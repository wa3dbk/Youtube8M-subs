00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 and this is that you are clamped 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:12.150
 1 and then once a day just once a day 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.639
 suitable uploaded there are not you to them 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.639
 turn on the stove as it worked so it works 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.260
 bucket she keep working a given 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.720
 the case is the third day 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.180
 when from here to sleep on a bucket 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.420
 rice husk and she both worked so 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.640
 work and then what happens 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.070
 here by the way here is a picture that should not 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.890
 had to go wide 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.140
 Beasts for color in two hours will be 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.309
 picture two hours two hours earlier 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.070
 we will not give a blast 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.180
 so look see what happens 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.890
 so we put it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.199
 it gives absolutely stable 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.079
 temperature well conditionally saying it now 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.799
 there was a dryer 75 degrees power somewhere 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.479
 there 32 kilowatts can be done 65 pond 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.950
 case she's somewhere two and a half three 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.590
 kilo watt such objectively means not 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.950
 power can be raised but then it is necessary 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.650
 will be twice a day three times so it 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.409
 product launched and now it is like a dryer 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.330
 can work for days day two three 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.909
 no electricity fails 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.420
 dried food service 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.150
 minimum fell asleep forgot asleep forgot 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.990
 nothing ignites it turns out that this 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.270
 by team 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.369
 instead of a three kilowatt awning 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.060
 continuous you worked for this 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.150
 dryers 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.759
 you got such a bird on land as well 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.159
 tropics by the way there is still a bunch of use 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.470
 then stoves for example here 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.030
 tropicana 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.580
 high humidity if the room 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.010
 no man lives and not 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.770
 airing candy cirrus and water all 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.650
 moldy and so on made just such 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.750
 the stove is such a candy 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.500
 This stove with skin than airy which 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.450
 lets the air hot it turns out 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.460
 means to make such a stove corrugations 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.870
 spread it in the room there put 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.580
 exhaust fans 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.460
 the most ordinary yet there are no people in the hotel 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.760
 or vice versa in any house during the rainy season 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.050
 want to dry turned on the hot air 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.610
 and blew it all dried up all shut the lambs 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.790
 He worked as a work to dry clothes 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.790
 arya turns out amazing thing on 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.550
 in fact, I will say that I am less 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.260
 just thought it was some kind of stove 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.290
 everything will be required in traffic 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.400
 honest do weighed because well I 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.070
 I understand for us there until the north there 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.870
 cold and proper for i deal with her 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.430
 did generally this stove for mobile 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.440
 houses 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.080
 that they were not harry and from the day there was not 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.959
 engage daughter but what she turned out to be 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.220
 and the cake is extremely interesting and important itself 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.700
 on her own in chaparral wants that huge 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.860
 niche 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.840
 for such heat generators 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.530
 which do not require maintenance not 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.050
 requires some special firebox here 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.540
 the fact that here it is fuel this fuel 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.280
 turned out to be agricultural waste 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.300
 can be honest to me 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.440
 discoveries i'm not sure i think that's what 34 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.370
 will burn anything like close 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:38.380
 and it burns 4 hours already would have read well 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.240
 that's as far as traffic goes 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.370
 that is for the tropics in and of itself 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:48.580
 surprisingly this one if you do as 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.930
 the stove needs this ribs to have it 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:56.560
 how to bake a premium mind gas stove for home 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.990
 convection but this is done with 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.440
 special casing 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:05.740
 means the essence of what it is in the skin means in 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.410
 it is going to air hot and on 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.990
 you can transport any place here 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.130
 it's in the dryer refuse in our conditions 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.130
 it's in the apartment 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.260
 warm floors and so on but it can 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.880
 if you insulate put on the street 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:26.110
 no problem that means that and you see smoke 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:32.110
 Yes, it works and now the third day 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.490
 it will work at least here 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.800
 the tropics are warm here 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.510
 naturally consumed little for and that 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.120
 same temperature so here she will 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.850
 to work for at least another three days here at 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.330
 this temperature 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.330
 let's look like
