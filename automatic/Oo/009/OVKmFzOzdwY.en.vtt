station part and we're going to put a
roof<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.259> next<00:01:31.500> week<00:01:32.150> then<00:01:33.150> there's<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
roof on it next week then there's the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
roof on it next week then there's the
cafe<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.229> destroyed<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.189> think<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.579> was

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
cafe we destroyed it I think that was

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.760 
cafe we destroyed it I think that was
the<00:01:35.700> last<00:01:36.000> week's<00:01:36.270> video<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.439> started<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the last week's video and we started to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.560 
the last week's video and we started to
rebuild<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.400> we've<00:01:38.939> got<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.180> windows

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
rebuild it now we've got these windows

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.289 
rebuild it now we've got these windows
the<00:01:40.259> door<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.829> more<00:01:41.670> windows<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.060> side

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the door and more windows on the side

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.999 
the door and more windows on the side
and<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.720> style<00:01:42.930> works<00:01:43.290> pretty<00:01:43.470> well<00:01:43.590> unless

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and this style works pretty well unless

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.050 
and this style works pretty well unless
we<00:01:44.159> come<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.460> something<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:44.939> see

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
we come up with something or see

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880 
we come up with something or see
something<00:01:45.090> online<00:01:45.509> that's<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:46.140> way<00:01:46.380> better<00:01:46.560> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
something online that's way way better I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.620 
something online that's way way better I
think<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.430> design<00:01:47.759> was<00:01:47.790> thick<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.360> we'll

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
think this design was thick and we'll

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.179 
think this design was thick and we'll
work<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.320> next<00:01:49.530> week<00:01:49.710> maybe<00:01:49.950> some

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
work with that so next week maybe some

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.330 
work with that so next week maybe some

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
going on in a newer videos it was the

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.720 
going on in a newer videos it was the
one<00:06:15.570> thing<00:06:15.630> that<00:06:15.780> I<00:06:15.900> did<00:06:15.990> is<00:06:16.200> there's<00:06:16.410> a<00:06:16.730> what

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
one thing that I did is there's a what

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.220 
one thing that I did is there's a what
they<00:06:17.850> did<00:06:18.060> is<00:06:18.180> they<00:06:18.210> had<00:06:18.540> a<00:06:18.570> really<00:06:18.960> stupid

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
they did is they had a really stupid

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.530 
they did is they had a really stupid
system<00:06:19.710> how<00:06:19.860> was<00:06:20.040> this<00:06:20.460> was<00:06:20.669> here<00:06:20.970> and<00:06:21.240> it

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
system how was this was here and it

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.150 
system how was this was here and it
looked<00:06:21.720> really<00:06:21.810> odd<00:06:22.200> I<00:06:22.440> did<00:06:22.620> not<00:06:22.770> like<00:06:22.919> that<00:06:23.070> at

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
looked really odd I did not like that at

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.790 
looked really odd I did not like that at
all<00:06:23.280> so<00:06:23.550> what<00:06:23.669> I<00:06:23.700> did<00:06:23.850> I<00:06:24.350> just<00:06:25.350> cut<00:06:25.590> that<00:06:25.740> off

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
all so what I did I just cut that off

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.850 
all so what I did I just cut that off
put<00:06:26.669> a<00:06:26.700> piece<00:06:26.910> there<00:06:27.120> put<00:06:27.780> little<00:06:27.960> dots<00:06:28.230> there

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
put a piece there put little dots there

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.940 
put a piece there put little dots there
and<00:06:29.100> then<00:06:29.550> did<00:06:30.150> this<00:06:30.360> of<00:06:31.320> course<00:06:31.650> there's<00:06:31.860> no

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
and then did this of course there's no

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.529 
and then did this of course there's no
way<00:06:32.160> to<00:06:32.220> fix<00:06:32.370> that<00:06:32.550> space<00:06:32.880> I<00:06:33.060> tried<00:06:33.270> a<00:06:33.300> few

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
way to fix that space I tried a few

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.779 
way to fix that space I tried a few
times<00:06:33.600> with<00:06:33.960> just<00:06:34.169> one<00:06:34.350> studs<00:06:34.710> up<00:06:34.979> and<00:06:35.640> down

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
times with just one studs up and down

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.700 
times with just one studs up and down
but<00:06:36.390> there's<00:06:36.570> no<00:06:36.720> possible<00:06:37.140> way<00:06:37.200> to<00:06:37.260> fix<00:06:37.500> that

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
but there's no possible way to fix that

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.750 
but there's no possible way to fix that
so

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
so

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.890 
so
and<00:06:38.850> do<00:06:39.030> a<00:06:39.060> little<00:06:39.210> bit<00:06:39.360> of<00:06:39.390> an<00:06:39.540> improvised

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
and do a little bit of an improvised

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.120 
and do a little bit of an improvised
here<00:06:40.200> and<00:06:40.380> puts<00:06:42.110> that<00:06:43.110> like<00:06:43.380> that<00:06:43.590> to<00:06:43.830> make<00:06:43.950> it

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
here and puts that like that to make it

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.910 
here and puts that like that to make it
nice<00:06:44.310> and<00:06:44.340> flat<00:06:44.700> so<00:06:45.020> the<00:06:46.020> bus<00:06:46.200> is<00:06:46.380> sort<00:06:46.860> of

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
nice and flat so the bus is sort of

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.110 
nice and flat so the bus is sort of
custom<00:06:47.220> there's<00:06:47.370> a<00:06:47.430> few<00:06:47.580> more<00:06:47.670> things<00:06:47.910> on<00:06:48.000> the

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
custom there's a few more things on the

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.970 
custom there's a few more things on the
inside<00:06:48.390> that<00:06:48.510> I<00:06:48.600> customized<00:06:49.080> but<00:06:49.320> it'll<00:06:49.860> be

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
inside that I customized but it'll be

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.680 
inside that I customized but it'll be
more<00:06:50.160> customized<00:06:50.670> by<00:06:50.820> next<00:06:51.060> time<00:06:51.240> and<00:06:51.420> totally

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
more customized by next time and totally

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.470 
more customized by next time and totally
done<00:06:51.870> and<00:06:52.490> this<00:06:53.490> is<00:06:53.640> the<00:06:53.760> second<00:06:54.120> attempt<00:06:54.390> of

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
done and this is the second attempt of

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.610 
done and this is the second attempt of
the<00:06:54.510> bus<00:06:54.690> that<00:06:54.720> we've<00:06:54.930> actually<00:06:55.110> done<00:06:55.350> we<00:06:55.500> had

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
the bus that we've actually done we had

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.560 
the bus that we've actually done we had
a<00:06:55.650> first<00:06:55.920> one<00:06:56.130> that<00:06:56.220> was<00:06:56.340> Green<00:06:56.490> and<00:06:56.850> it<00:06:57.420> just

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
a first one that was Green and it just

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.240 
a first one that was Green and it just
really<00:06:57.690> didn't<00:06:58.050> look<00:06:58.110> too<00:06:58.290> good<00:06:58.500> it<00:06:59.070> was<00:06:59.220> a

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250
