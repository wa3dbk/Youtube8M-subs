00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
there's a lot of practical applications

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.900 
there's a lot of practical applications
that<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.050> happen<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> device<00:00:38.879> like

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that can happen with with a device like

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
that can happen with with a device like
girl<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.660> they<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.260> repeat<00:00:40.590> at<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.920> higher

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
girl that they can repeat at a higher

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.340 
girl that they can repeat at a higher
level<00:00:41.250> than<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.510> even<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> best

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
level than then even the best

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.229 
level than then even the best
professionals<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.129> I'm<00:00:44.700> looking<00:00:44.969> forward<00:00:45.210> to

hopefully hop and move a little bit and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.900 
hopefully hop and move a little bit and
I'll<00:00:49.200> count<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> human<00:00:50.340> element<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> keep

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
up Earl leads off the match with a spare

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.619 
up Earl leads off the match with a spare
and<00:00:53.430> Chris<00:00:54.000> Barnes<00:00:54.539> jumps<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.230> him<00:00:55.410> early

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
and Chris Barnes jumps on him early

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.750 
and Chris Barnes jumps on him early
throwing<00:00:57.629> his<00:00:57.780> first<00:00:58.140> seven<00:00:58.620> strikes<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
throwing his first seven strikes and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000 
throwing his first seven strikes and
talking<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> little<00:01:00.329> trash<00:01:00.660> along<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> way<00:01:01.620> I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
talking a little trash along the way I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.290 
talking a little trash along the way I
think<00:01:02.280> he<00:01:02.399> needed<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> couple

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
think he needed to really get a couple

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
think he needed to really get a couple
more<00:01:03.420> warm-up<00:01:03.780> shots<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:05.159> Earl

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
more warm-up shots in there but Earl

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.230 
more warm-up shots in there but Earl
would<00:01:05.790> eventually<00:01:06.090> find<00:01:06.689> his<00:01:07.080> groove<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
would eventually find his groove the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.480 
would eventually find his groove the
ability<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.750> repeat<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> exact<00:01:10.830> same<00:01:11.130> shot

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
ability to repeat the exact same shot

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.399 
ability to repeat the exact same shot
proves<00:01:11.939> valuable<00:01:12.540> once<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.110> where<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
proves valuable once you know where to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.950 
proves valuable once you know where to
throw<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.310> end<00:01:14.460> though<00:01:14.729> Chris<00:01:15.450> Barnes

throw it in the end though Chris Barnes

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.360 
throw it in the end though Chris Barnes
is<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.439> too<00:01:16.680> tough

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
downfall yeah one of the things that's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.860 
downfall yeah one of the things that's
always<00:01:31.250> been<00:01:31.550> a<00:01:31.580> detriment<00:01:31.970> for<00:01:32.060> for<00:01:32.540> robots

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
always been a detriment for for robots

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.720 
always been a detriment for for robots
is<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.170> fact<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.500> they<00:01:34.160> hit<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.400> same<00:01:34.580> spot

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
is the fact that they hit the same spot

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.060 
is the fact that they hit the same spot
on<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.390> lane<00:01:35.570> every<00:01:36.530> time<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:36.980> they're

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
on the lane every time and they're

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.740 
on the lane every time and they're
consistent<00:01:37.610> at<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:37.880> URLs<00:01:38.180> consistent

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
consistent at that URLs consistent

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.300 
consistent at that URLs consistent
within<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.500> know<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.620> third<00:01:39.830> of<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:39.980> board<00:01:40.160> at

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
within you know a third of a board at

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.730 
within you know a third of a board at
fifteen<00:01:40.580> feet<00:01:40.760> down<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.120> lane<00:01:41.300> so<00:01:41.660> he's<00:01:42.410> taken

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
fifteen feet down the lane so he's taken

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.860 
fifteen feet down the lane so he's taken
the<00:01:42.830> oil<00:01:42.980> off<00:01:43.280> where<00:01:43.550> he's<00:01:43.700> already<00:01:43.910> bowled

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
the oil off where he's already bowled

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.200 
the oil off where he's already bowled
and<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.320> therefore<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:46.580> know<00:01:46.670> adjustments

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
and so therefore you know adjustments

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.470 
and so therefore you know adjustments
need<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.420> be<00:01:47.540> made<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:48.050> truly<00:01:49.480> consistently

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
need to be made to truly consistently

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.060 
need to be made to truly consistently
strike<00:01:50.870> and<00:01:51.140> if<00:01:51.290> you're<00:01:51.410> making<00:01:51.500> adjustments

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
strike and if you're making adjustments

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.950 
strike and if you're making adjustments
it's<00:01:52.220> human<00:01:52.790> that's<00:01:53.030> making<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.480> adjustments

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
it's human that's making the adjustments

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.300 
it's human that's making the adjustments
and<00:01:54.050> we<00:01:54.350> haven't<00:01:54.530> had<00:01:54.620> a<00:01:54.680> lot<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:54.890> time<00:01:55.130> with

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
and we haven't had a lot of time with

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.920 
and we haven't had a lot of time with
him<00:01:55.430> quite<00:01:55.700> yet<00:01:55.970> if<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.360> went<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.600> call<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.840> a

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
him quite yet if you went to call it a

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.240 
him quite yet if you went to call it a
dog<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.290> pony<00:01:57.380> show<00:01:57.530> I<00:01:57.680> think<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:58.010> was<00:01:58.130> supposed

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
dog and pony show I think I was supposed

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.100 
dog and pony show I think I was supposed
to<00:01:58.370> be<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.610> dog<00:01:58.790> today<00:01:59.150> but<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:02.060> as<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.900> turned

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
to be the dog today but it as it turned

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.550 
to be the dog today but it as it turned
out<00:02:03.940> he<00:02:04.940> struggled<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.420> little<00:02:05.510> bit<00:02:05.780> making

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
out he struggled a little bit making

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.859 
out he struggled a little bit making
some<00:02:06.830> adjustments<00:02:07.310> early<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:08.540> was

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
some adjustments early and and I was

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.080 
some adjustments early and and I was
able<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.770> capitalize<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.610> at<00:02:10.970> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
able to to capitalize on that at the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.970 
able to to capitalize on that at the
very<00:02:11.120> beginning<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.200> think<00:02:12.380> his<00:02:12.740> lack<00:02:12.950> of

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
very beginning and I think his lack of

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.680 
very beginning and I think his lack of
TV<00:02:13.520> experience<00:02:13.850> maybe<00:02:14.240> you've<00:02:14.390> heard<00:02:14.570> him

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
TV experience maybe you've heard him

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.680 
TV experience maybe you've heard him
today<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.230> little<00:02:15.410> bit<00:02:16.540> regardless<00:02:17.540> of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
today just a little bit regardless of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.960 
today just a little bit regardless of
the<00:02:17.780> outcome<00:02:17.930> however<00:02:18.440> Earl<00:02:18.970> definitely

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
the outcome however Earl definitely

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.800 
the outcome however Earl definitely
