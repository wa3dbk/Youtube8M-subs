the<00:00:57.600> superchargers<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.500> working

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the superchargers you just working

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.530 
the superchargers you just working
phenomenally<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.579> mean<00:01:00.149> there's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> big

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
phenomenally I mean there's a big

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.910 
phenomenally I mean there's a big
difference<00:01:00.750> between<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> supercharger<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
difference between a supercharger and a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
difference between a supercharger and a
stock<00:01:02.129> sled<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.790> so<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.960> superchargers

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
stock sled out here so the superchargers

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.100 
stock sled out here so the superchargers
the<00:01:04.650> future<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.159> awesome<00:01:05.549> they're<00:01:05.700> rocking

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
ripping it's a smooth horsepower so you

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.460 
ripping it's a smooth horsepower so you
don't<00:03:11.569> know<00:03:11.720> you're<00:03:11.900> going<00:03:12.109> that<00:03:12.290> fast

happened so quick but it's smooth and

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.270 
happened so quick but it's smooth and
it's<00:03:16.190> there<00:03:16.519> it's<00:03:16.760> just<00:03:16.849> raw<00:03:17.180> grit

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.720 

I<00:03:26.530> feel<00:03:27.530> like<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.800> superchargers<00:03:28.400> kind<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.670> a

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
I feel like the superchargers kind of a

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.570 
I feel like the superchargers kind of a
game-changer<00:03:29.360> in<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.870> trees<00:03:30.290> because<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.310> can

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
game-changer in the trees because I can

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.510 
game-changer in the trees because I can
screw<00:03:31.880> up<00:03:31.910> more<00:03:32.300> often<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.140> trees<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.620> you

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
screw up more often in the trees and you

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.760 
screw up more often in the trees and you
know<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.970> can<00:03:35.330> just<00:03:35.540> get<00:03:36.230> back<00:03:36.380> into<00:03:36.709> the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
know I can just get back into the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
struggle and it's instant right there I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.940 
struggle and it's instant right there I
got<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.750> track<00:03:38.959> speed<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.440> can<00:03:39.620> get<00:03:39.739> above

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
got the track speed and I can get above

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.920 
got the track speed and I can get above
that<00:03:40.160> tree<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.060> didn't<00:03:41.600> know<00:03:41.720> was

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
that tree that that I didn't know was

there all of a sudden the supercharger

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.880 
there all of a sudden the supercharger
seems<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.540> work<00:03:44.690> really<00:03:44.720> well<00:03:45.110> for<00:03:45.560> me<00:03:45.680> because

response it's really really good to know
that<00:03:54.950> you're<00:03:55.220> gonna<00:03:55.310> have<00:03:55.550> power<00:03:55.790> when<00:03:56.120> you

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
that you're gonna have power when you

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:03.300

need<00:03:56.300> it

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.400 

you<00:04:03.760> know<00:04:03.850> how<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:03.970> stalkers<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:04.810> instant

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
you know how a stalkers just instant

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.160 
you know how a stalkers just instant
throttle<00:04:05.770> response<00:04:05.920> it's<00:04:06.850> like<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.300> but<00:04:08.110> a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
throttle response it's like that but a

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.100 
throttle response it's like that but a
little<00:04:08.350> bit<00:04:08.590> more<00:04:08.620> throttle<00:04:09.100> response<00:04:09.400> and

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
little bit more throttle response and

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.320 
little bit more throttle response and
220<00:04:11.110> horsepower<00:04:11.350> full<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.850> works<00:04:13.060> so
