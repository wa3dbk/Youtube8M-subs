00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.050
 high speeds fast cycles 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.840
 coupled with lowest 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.480
 idle times short highspeed that 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.480
 there are demands today 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.480
 automation solutions 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.230
 automation solutions with pneumatics 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.210
 are the ideal technology around you 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.640
 to realize requirements 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.630
 high tempo at the highest possible 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.540
 reliability 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.790
 two ways lead to the goal firstly 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:45.090
 speed optimized applications 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.090
 and second, fast pneumatic products 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.600
 short neatly optimized arrangement 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.280
 optimal exploitation of the cheapest 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.350
 work area and how to steam 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.839
 when driving back the irritate 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.619
 options include pneumatic actuators 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:08.490
 you use the highest output in the shortest possible time 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.890
 time further potentials were given by the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.630
 as close as possible to the arrangement of controls 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.590
 and valves to the actuators 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.259
 opened up 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.460
 friction losses in the energy carrier air 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.470
 are almost reduced to a minimum 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.690
 the right product at the right place 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.179
 put the high power density of 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.640
 pneumatic components and the optimal 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.750
 Design guide at times from below 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.759
 one second 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.069
 the fastest pick and place operation in the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.340
 example shown is even only 0 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:42.270
 7 seconds optimal construction is the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.759
 a page 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.159
 Fast products are the other solid ones 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.229
 supports you in all potentials in 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.759
 your construction with speed 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.759
 to find optimized products 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.079
 systematically faster 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.200
 that means kicking place handed up to 100 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.689
 parts per minute minimum construction 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.970
 times as ready-to-install solution fast 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.700
 and easy commissioning 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.190
 always good for high cycle times the stick 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.200
 slip free fluidic mass in connection 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.250
 with the fast switch the emh 2 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.590
 he reaches a clock rate of 90 heart 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.330
 the fast- sounding valve ma 2 is the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.400
 ideal control for pneumatic 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.520
 applications that follow faster 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.300
 switching times work in the h2 reached 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.430
 of two milliseconds too 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.459
 standard products like the linear drive 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.890
 dnc can become high speed products 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:46.220
 if you are in a speed 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:48.650
 optimized applications work in 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.200
 The rod kinematics work faster 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.050
 Products Drives GPL and 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.150
 proportional valves mp y in one 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.430
 optimized interaction with each other 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.690
 You only get time from 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.690
 half a second 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.230
 occupied at 14 meters per second 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.450
 b25 drives the cutting knife and is 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.430
 so that in the situation also thin foils 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.430
 to cut exactly and cleanly 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.569
 Highspeed pneumatics is not just one 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.209
 catchword but a trend in the 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.819
 automation of festo coined 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.310
 has and drives on every day 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.310
 they 'll festo faster
