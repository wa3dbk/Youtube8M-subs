00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
now there are a couple of things that I

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.210 
now there are a couple of things that I
did<00:04:28.720> like<00:04:28.930> about<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.410> wireless<00:04:29.860> receiver

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
did like about the wireless receiver

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.129 
did like about the wireless receiver
case<00:04:30.460> for<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.730> iphone<00:04:31.150> 4<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.720> first<00:04:31.990> one

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
case for the iphone 4 and the first one

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.930 
case for the iphone 4 and the first one
would<00:04:32.230> be<00:04:32.290> that<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.830> really<00:04:33.040> does<00:04:33.280> not<00:04:33.460> add<00:04:33.699> too

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
would be that it really does not add too

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.330 
would be that it really does not add too
much<00:04:34.090> bulk<00:04:34.449> to<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.660> pocket<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.800> second<00:04:36.220> one

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
much bulk to the pocket the second one

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.580 
much bulk to the pocket the second one
would<00:04:36.460> be<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.060> is<00:04:37.210> very<00:04:37.540> thin<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.169> when<00:04:38.560> I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
would be that it is very thin and when I

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.350 
would be that it is very thin and when I
say<00:04:38.830> it's<00:04:39.010> very<00:04:39.070> thin<00:04:39.520> I'm<00:04:39.669> comparing<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.330> to

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
say it's very thin I'm comparing it to

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.840 
say it's very thin I'm comparing it to
the<00:04:40.630> wireless<00:04:41.080> receiver<00:04:41.590> case<00:04:41.860> for<00:04:42.699> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
iphone 3g and 3gs now is it the greatest

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.330 
iphone 3g and 3gs now is it the greatest
case<00:04:46.600> for<00:04:46.840> iphone<00:04:47.260> 4<00:04:47.590> no<00:04:47.830> it's<00:04:48.040> not<00:04:48.190> the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
case for iphone 4 no it's not the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.610 
case for iphone 4 no it's not the
greatest<00:04:48.580> case<00:04:48.970> but<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:49.900> works<00:04:50.110> really<00:04:50.260> well

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
greatest case but it works really well

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.670
