Hill<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> swing<00:01:23.729> set<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.210> three<00:01:24.450> biggest

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
Hill and the swing set the three biggest

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.300 
Hill and the swing set the three biggest
percentages<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:27.390> doesn't<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.170> give<00:01:29.159> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
percentages and it doesn't just give you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
percentages and it doesn't just give you
that<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:30.000> percent<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:31.079> cumulative

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that much more percent it's cumulative

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.670 
that much more percent it's cumulative
so<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> gives<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.909> 11<00:01:33.360> percent<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.020> plus<00:01:34.380> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so it gives you 11 percent more plus of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.420 
so it gives you 11 percent more plus of
this<00:01:34.920> more<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> adds<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.500> when<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
this more and it adds up so when you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.520 
this more and it adds up so when you
think<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.820> supposed<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.270> say<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> says<00:01:40.079> 52

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
think it's supposed to say if it says 52

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.490 
think it's supposed to say if it says 52
percent<00:01:41.130> increase<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.689> would<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:42.840> 100

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
percent increase you would think 100

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.490 
percent increase you would think 100
coins<00:01:43.740> would<00:01:43.979> become<00:01:44.390> 152<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.840> reality<00:01:45.990> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
coins would become 152 but in reality it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
coins would become 152 but in reality it
becomes<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.390> lot<00:01:48.390> more<00:01:48.600> than<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.030> what

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.800 
takes up a section let me show you kind
of<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> section<00:01:58.799> here<00:01:59.159> takes<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.450> spot

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
of the section here takes up this spot

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.469 
of the section here takes up this spot
and<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.439> kind<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.490> outline<00:02:03.180> that

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and you can kind of see the outline that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.870 
and you can kind of see the outline that
goes<00:02:03.659> way<00:02:03.930> around<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> outside<00:02:04.579> means<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
goes way around the outside means that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.219 
goes way around the outside means that
it<00:02:05.969> affects<00:02:06.299> everything<00:02:06.659> within<00:02:06.990> that

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
it affects everything within that

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.109 
it affects everything within that
outline<00:02:07.649> for<00:02:08.220> example<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.729> move<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> over

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
outline for example if I move it over

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.300 
outline for example if I move it over
here<00:02:09.690> well<00:02:10.289> there<00:02:10.470> has<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.709> be<00:02:10.739> space<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
here well there has to be space for it

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.650 
here well there has to be space for it
I'll<00:02:14.310> give<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.640> an<00:02:14.730> example<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.540> of

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
I'll give you an example with one of

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.990 
I'll give you an example with one of
these<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:16.170> percenters<00:02:16.770> I'll<00:02:17.550> take<00:02:17.850> these

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
these one percenters I'll take these

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.440 
these one percenters I'll take these
flowers<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.570> move<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.320> see<00:02:19.590> how<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:21.060> shows

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
flowers and move it you see how it shows

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.930 
flowers and move it you see how it shows
all<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.250> buildings<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.400> are<00:02:23.460> affected<00:02:23.910> by

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
all the buildings that are affected by

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.280 
all the buildings that are affected by
the<00:02:24.090> one<00:02:24.360> percent<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.020> see

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
the one percent and so and you can see

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.160 
the one percent and so and you can see
that<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.280> particular<00:02:29.430> case<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.480> goes<00:02:30.810> way

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
that in this particular case it goes way

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.060 
that in this particular case it goes way
out<00:02:31.850> around<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.660> area<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.650> affects<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
out around the area that it affects the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.320 
out around the area that it affects the
one<00:02:35.220> percent<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.360> swingset<00:02:37.020> goes<00:02:37.740> way<00:02:38.010> out

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
one percent the swingset goes way out

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.270 
one percent the swingset goes way out
the<00:02:39.330> arboretum<00:02:40.200> goes<00:02:40.440> way<00:02:40.620> out<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.100> all<00:02:41.250> of

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
the arboretum goes way out so all of

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.310 
the arboretum goes way out so all of
them<00:02:41.610> intersect<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.390> little<00:02:42.660> empty<00:02:42.990> area

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
them intersect in this little empty area

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.400 
them intersect in this little empty area
here<00:02:43.740> so<00:02:44.640> here's<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.060> trick<00:02:45.330> when<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.320> time

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
here so here's the trick when it's time

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.940 
here so here's the trick when it's time
to<00:02:46.620> collect<00:02:47.720> here<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.200> 75<00:02:50.100> coin<00:02:50.730> business

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
to collect here it's a 75 coin business

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.210 
to collect here it's a 75 coin business
you<00:02:52.950> would<00:02:53.100> click<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.730> move<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.990> business

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
you would click and move the business

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.520 
you would click and move the business
right<00:02:56.220> over<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:58.050> has<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.380> be

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
right over here and it has to be

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.560 
right over here and it has to be
attached<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.459> road<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.850> be<00:02:59.940> able<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.209> collect

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
attached to a road to be able to collect

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.199 
attached to a road to be able to collect
so<00:03:00.990> but<00:03:01.740> you<00:03:01.890> see<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.250> plus<00:03:02.550> sixty-two

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
so but you see the plus sixty-two

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.720 
so but you see the plus sixty-two
percent<00:03:03.420> that's<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.440> percentage<00:03:05.100> increase

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
percent that's the percentage increase

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.720 
percent that's the percentage increase
based<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.170> sections<00:03:07.800> all<00:03:08.220> these<00:03:08.459> things

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
based on this sections all these things

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.480 
based on this sections all these things
put<00:03:08.940> together<00:03:09.200> now<00:03:10.200> if<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.709> before<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.340> get

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
put together now if you before you get

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.510 
put together now if you before you get
to<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.780> 24,000<00:03:12.780> coins<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.520> fourteen

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
to the 24,000 coins and fourteen

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.949 
to the 24,000 coins and fourteen
thousand<00:03:14.940> coins<00:03:15.090> at<00:03:15.360> each<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.630> these<00:03:15.720> things

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
thousand coins at each of these things

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.530 
thousand coins at each of these things
cost<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.430> do<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.209> smaller

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
cost you can do this with the smaller

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.949 
cost you can do this with the smaller
things<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.290> create<00:03:19.680> as<00:03:19.980> much<00:03:20.660> overlap<00:03:21.660> as

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
things just create as much overlap as

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.190 
things just create as much overlap as
possible<00:03:22.560> with<00:03:23.190> each<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.489> these<00:03:23.580> things<00:03:24.200> to

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
possible with each of these things to

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.620 
possible with each of these things to
get<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.769> highest<00:03:26.010> percentage<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.000> then<00:03:27.480> as

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
get the highest percentage and then as

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.410 
get the highest percentage and then as
you<00:03:27.660> get<00:03:27.870> more<00:03:28.050> coins<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.950> just<00:03:29.790> adjust<00:03:29.970> this

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
you get more coins you just adjust this

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.840 
you get more coins you just adjust this
till<00:03:30.750> it's<00:03:30.900> at<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.860> point<00:03:32.160> it's<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.610> max

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
till it's at this point it's at the max

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.750 
till it's at this point it's at the max
that<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.330> be<00:03:33.650> I've<00:03:34.650> got<00:03:34.860> someone<00:03:35.280> percents

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
that it can be I've got someone percents

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.320 
that it can be I've got someone percents
in<00:03:36.060> around<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.540> edges<00:03:37.489> I've<00:03:38.489> got<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.730> barricade

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
in around the edges I've got a barricade

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.320 
in around the edges I've got a barricade
which<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.660> four<00:03:39.900> percent<00:03:40.380> I've<00:03:40.560> got<00:03:40.739> this

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
which is four percent I've got this

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.020 
which is four percent I've got this
point<00:03:42.330> gianna<00:03:42.900> tree<00:03:43.320> that's<00:03:43.620> four<00:03:43.950> percent<00:03:44.400> so

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
point gianna tree that's four percent so

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.060 
point gianna tree that's four percent so
all<00:03:45.180> these<00:03:45.330> things<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.810> most<00:03:46.140> i<00:03:46.410> could<00:03:46.470> get<00:03:46.769> up

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
all these things the most i could get up

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.210 
all these things the most i could get up
against<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.670> business<00:03:47.850> here<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.660> now<00:03:49.560> i<00:03:49.980> just

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
against the business here and now i just

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.380 
against the business here and now i just
come<00:03:50.700> here<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.090> i<00:03:51.330> collect<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.400> from<00:03:53.400> 166

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
come here and i collect and from 166

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.160 
come here and i collect and from 166
coins<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.900> should<00:03:55.110> be<00:03:55.260> giving<00:03:55.530> 75<00:03:56.160> normally

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
coins it should be giving 75 normally

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.110 
coins it should be giving 75 normally
but<00:03:58.310> what<00:03:59.310> you'll<00:03:59.489> see<00:03:59.820> is<00:04:01.010> in<00:04:02.010> went<00:04:02.190> from<00:04:02.280> 166

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
but what you'll see is in went from 166

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.229 
but what you'll see is in went from 166
to<00:04:03.239> 555<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.530> almost<00:04:05.220> four<00:04:05.640> hundred<00:04:05.820> coins

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
to 555 so almost four hundred coins

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.050 
to 555 so almost four hundred coins
