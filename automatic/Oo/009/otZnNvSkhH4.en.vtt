00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
before they review it and I gotta say

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
part I actually do think that they

reflection of the genre that the game
was<00:00:46.770> released<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.940> -<00:00:48.149> was<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.690> fun<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
me again that's a very good

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639 
me again that's a very good
representation<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> genre<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.289> isn't

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
representation of the genre but isn't

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
representation of the genre but isn't
super<00:00:52.890> fun<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.460> still<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> by<00:00:54.090> rating

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
super fun to me can still be a by rating

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.770 
super fun to me can still be a by rating
a<00:00:54.690> game<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> very<00:00:55.940> poor<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> overall

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
a game that is very poor as a overall

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.869 
a game that is very poor as a overall
representation<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.829> loved<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.609> had<00:00:59.730> an

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
representation but I loved it and had an

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.970 
representation but I loved it and had an
absolute<00:01:00.300> blast<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.809> long<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.350> define<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
absolute blast as long as I define the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.189 
absolute blast as long as I define the
reasons<00:01:02.340> why<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.850> could<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.570> find<00:01:03.960> myself

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
reasons why I could actually find myself

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.890 
reasons why I could actually find myself
giving<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.920> buy<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.700> despite<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:06.720> might

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
giving a buy for it despite there might

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.149 
giving a buy for it despite there might
be<00:01:06.930> issues<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.409> mean<00:01:07.500> some<00:01:07.710> games<00:01:07.920> don't<00:01:08.070> have

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
be issues I mean some games don't have

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.770 
be issues I mean some games don't have
the<00:01:08.340> best<00:01:08.490> graphics<00:01:08.880> whether<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.689> on

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the best graphics whether it's on

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.080 
the best graphics whether it's on
purpose<00:01:10.260> or<00:01:10.470> whether<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:11.640> they

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
purpose or whether it's because they

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.250 
purpose or whether it's because they
just<00:01:12.240> didn't<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> best<00:01:12.840> artists<00:01:13.170> but

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
just didn't have the best artists but

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.620 
just didn't have the best artists but
it's<00:01:13.439> got<00:01:13.560> an<00:01:13.680> amazing<00:01:13.799> game<00:01:14.340> play<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.970> state<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
decay is one of them where it's got a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.469 
decay is one of them where it's got a

all they have become almost attached to
the<00:01:29.939> entertainment<00:01:30.630> part<00:01:30.780> only<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.560> they're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the entertainment part only and they're

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.969

not<00:01:32.280> able<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.420> actually<00:01:33.630> look<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.710> something

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
not able to actually look at something

critically anymore and some of them who

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.100 
critically anymore and some of them who
hinge<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.439> would<00:01:37.590> say<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:39.079> personas<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
hinge I would say on the personas of

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.740 
hinge I would say on the personas of
criticism<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.250> actually<00:01:41.850> coming<00:01:42.150> across<00:01:42.360> as

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
criticism are actually coming across as

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.710 
criticism are actually coming across as
sort<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.680> juvenile<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.880> oh<00:01:45.060> well<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> just

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
sort of juvenile like oh well I just

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.270 
sort of juvenile like oh well I just
didn't<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:46.560> wasn't<00:01:46.890> fun<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> me

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
didn't you know it just wasn't fun to me

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.950 
didn't you know it just wasn't fun to me
so<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.579> gonna<00:01:47.729> play<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.240> find<00:01:48.810> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
so I'm not gonna play it I find that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.770 
so I'm not gonna play it I find that
really<00:01:49.409> odd<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> reviewer<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:51.509> because

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
really odd for a reviewer just because

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.289 
really odd for a reviewer just because
that<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.530> position<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> employment<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
that is the position the employment the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.450 
that is the position the employment the
job<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.750> they've<00:01:54.899> chosen<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.860> they<00:01:56.070> really

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
job that they've chosen so they really

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
job that they've chosen so they really
should<00:01:56.790> actually<00:01:57.060> end<00:01:57.630> up<00:01:57.840> playing<00:01:58.200> through

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
should actually end up playing through

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.990 
should actually end up playing through
that<00:01:58.619> entire<00:01:58.920> game<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.490> overall

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
that entire game that's my overall

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.060 
that entire game that's my overall
belief<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.630> also<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> lot<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.799> reviews

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
belief I also don't see a lot of reviews

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.100 
belief I also don't see a lot of reviews
do<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.520> fun<00:02:02.729> factor<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> think<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.750> you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
do the fun factor and I think that you

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.719 
do the fun factor and I think that you
can<00:02:04.320> sort<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.619> tell<00:02:04.799> when<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.189> don't<00:02:05.430> when

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
can sort of tell when they don't when

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.880 
can sort of tell when they don't when
they<00:02:05.880> don't<00:02:06.090> talk<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.689> fun<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.680> don't

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
they don't talk about the fun they don't

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.040 
they don't talk about the fun they don't
talk<00:02:08.099> about<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.399> emotional<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.270> impact

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
talk about that emotional and impact

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.900 
talk about that emotional and impact
then<00:02:10.679> there<00:02:11.099> might<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.340> something<00:02:11.760> missing

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
then there might be something missing

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.790 
then there might be something missing
from<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.360> review<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> know<00:02:12.959> at<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
from that review I know at the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.170 
from that review I know at the
reason<00:02:14.010> why<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.130> got<00:02:14.280> into<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.790> because<00:02:15.030> as

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
reason why I got into this is because as

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.580 
reason why I got into this is because as
I<00:02:15.390> started<00:02:15.660> watching<00:02:15.810> other<00:02:16.080> reviews<00:02:16.470> they

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
I started watching other reviews they

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.040 
I started watching other reviews they
were<00:02:16.650> always<00:02:16.860> missing<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.520> tangible<00:02:18.390> feeling

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
were always missing a tangible feeling

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.650 
were always missing a tangible feeling
of<00:02:19.470> two<00:02:19.920> friends<00:02:20.250> talking<00:02:20.760> about<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> game<00:02:21.330> and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
of two friends talking about a game and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.300 
of two friends talking about a game and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that's actually what the way I want my

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.010 
that's actually what the way I want my
review<00:02:23.730> where<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.180> know<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.540> break<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.930> down

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
review where you know you break it down

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.210

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.910 
friends about the levels and then
suddenly<00:02:27.930> you're<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.530> know<00:02:28.590> what<00:02:28.800> was

this<00:02:55.140> game<00:02:55.320> was<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.530> unenjoyable<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.730> all

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
for that I certainly don't play the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.080 
for that I certainly don't play the
blame<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.830> game<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.190> that's<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.610> developer

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
blame the game it's that's the developer

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.370 
blame the game it's that's the developer
and<00:03:03.180> what<00:03:03.360> they<00:03:03.480> did<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.900> how<00:03:03.960> they<00:03:03.990> put<00:03:04.290> it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
and what they did and how they put it

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.750 
and what they did and how they put it
together<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.890> didn't<00:03:05.130> come<00:03:05.250> together<00:03:05.430> for

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
together just didn't come together for

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.460 
together just didn't come together for
them<00:03:05.880> nobody<00:03:06.510> wakes<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.050> wants<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.320> make<00:03:07.440> a

them nobody wakes up and wants to make a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.890 
them nobody wakes up and wants to make a
bad<00:03:07.680> game<00:03:07.890> but<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.370> think<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.730> reviewers<00:03:09.270> job<00:03:09.600> is

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
bad game but I think a reviewers job is

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.770 
bad game but I think a reviewers job is
to<00:03:10.410> at<00:03:10.560> minimum<00:03:10.830> respect<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:12.180> people<00:03:12.540> put

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
to at minimum respect that people put

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.500 
to at minimum respect that people put
maybe<00:03:13.260> 60<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.130> 200<00:03:14.370> people<00:03:14.790> depending<00:03:15.300> on<00:03:15.360> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
maybe 60 to 200 people depending on the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.940 
maybe 60 to 200 people depending on the
development<00:03:15.900> team<00:03:15.930> all<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.260> way<00:03:16.350> down<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.740> to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
development team all the way down to to

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.670 
development team all the way down to to

put time in to make this game the the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.920 
put time in to make this game the the
most<00:03:20.010> or<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.370> least<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.850> can<00:03:21.000> do<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.450> play<00:03:21.690> it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
most or the least you can do is play it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.390 
most or the least you can do is play it
through<00:03:22.110> all<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.590> way<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.010> find<00:03:23.280> that

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
through all the way and I find that

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.580 
through all the way and I find that
that's<00:03:23.520> a<00:03:23.730> very<00:03:24.000> big<00:03:24.300> lack<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.810> respect<00:03:25.290> for

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
that's a very big lack of respect for

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.430 
that's a very big lack of respect for
the<00:03:26.430> developers<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.270> very<00:03:27.959> very

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
the developers it's very very

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.680 
the developers it's very very
disrespectful<00:03:29.220> now<00:03:29.730> when<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.120> comes<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.510> how<00:03:30.660> I

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
disrespectful now when it comes to how I

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.420 
disrespectful now when it comes to how I
feel<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.140> treats<00:03:31.410> fans<00:03:31.680> that's<00:03:32.010> not<00:03:32.220> as<00:03:32.400> much

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
feel it treats fans that's not as much

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.640 
feel it treats fans that's not as much
disrespectful<00:03:33.330> because<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.140> think<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.470> lot<00:03:34.500> of

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
disrespectful because I think a lot of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.560 
disrespectful because I think a lot of
fans<00:03:34.920> pick<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.250> reviewer<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.150> agrees

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
fans pick a reviewer that just agrees

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.780 
fans pick a reviewer that just agrees
with<00:03:36.810> them<00:03:37.020> in<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.770> what<00:03:38.070> they<00:03:38.250> like<00:03:38.580> and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
with them in in what they like and

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.850 
with them in in what they like and
that's<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.270> way<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.450> should<00:03:39.510> be<00:03:39.840> that's<00:03:40.560> the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
that's the way it should be that's the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.740 
that's the way it should be that's the
way<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.010> think<00:03:41.730> if<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.000> have<00:03:42.120> find<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.450> reviewer

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
way I think if you have find a reviewer

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.540 
way I think if you have find a reviewer
that<00:03:42.930> picks<00:03:43.260> things<00:03:43.530> apart<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.040> way<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.220> do

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
that picks things apart the way you do

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.790 
that picks things apart the way you do
and<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:45.660> excited<00:03:46.050> about<00:03:46.260> things<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.680> way<00:03:46.770> you

is<00:04:58.140> sort<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.950> symbiotic<00:04:59.310> thing<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.120> they

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
is sort of a symbiotic thing and they

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.570 
is sort of a symbiotic thing and they
want<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:01.650> like<00:05:01.830> their<00:05:02.010> game<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.340> course

want you to like their game of course

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.410 
want you to like their game of course
but<00:05:02.790> they<00:05:02.880> don't<00:05:02.910> want<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.240> show<00:05:03.360> you

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.240 
but they don't want to show you
something<00:05:03.870> that's<00:05:04.050> not<00:05:04.230> really<00:05:04.650> ready<00:05:04.950> for

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
something that's not really ready for

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.030 
something that's not really ready for
primetime<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:06.000> with<00:05:06.810> tech<00:05:07.290> land<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.830> with

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
primetime and with tech land and with

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.660 
primetime and with tech land and with
this<00:05:08.190> game

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
this game

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.760 
this game
it<00:05:08.790> seemed<00:05:09.390> ready<00:05:09.660> for<00:05:09.870> primetime<00:05:10.110> but<00:05:10.500> nobody

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
it seemed ready for primetime but nobody

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.110 
it seemed ready for primetime but nobody
got<00:05:10.920> it<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.310> think<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:11.670> that<00:05:11.760> caused<00:05:11.970> a

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
got it and I think that that caused a

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.370 
got it and I think that that caused a
lot<00:05:12.270> of<00:05:12.330> hurt<00:05:12.510> feelings<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:13.170> a<00:05:13.200> lot<00:05:13.350> of

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
lot of hurt feelings and a lot of

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.530 
lot of hurt feelings and a lot of
unprofessionalism<00:05:14.190> in<00:05:14.430> some<00:05:14.610> reviews<00:05:14.940> and
