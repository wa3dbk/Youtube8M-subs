00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.640
 of my friends then now we are 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.220
 an airport is called eloy arizona that 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.110
 it is known as the capital of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.969
 skydiving here at this airport 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 little one that seges it like that of 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.250
 edinburg texas is recognized at the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.080
 worldwide by the sky driving by jumping 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.970
 in parachute here come people from 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.670
 many countries in fact last night a group 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.890
 of Denmark to do courses of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.289
 skydiving for three weeks after 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.029
 see back the plane is here is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.380
 one of those that they use to be able 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.450
 jump that is equal to the one that is taking off 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.320
 they will see it give to the one who is going 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.040
 taking off that green there and this is another 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.590
 of those who use for skydiving and 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.539
 It is similar to the one that is behind me 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.079
 they have two of three of those what 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.960
 can see another one here in the background 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.980
 in the case of the camera at the bottom of the 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.829
 red shopping cart 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.140
 ss white hence that is another one that they use 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.940
 to jump by parachute you should have 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.320
 a lot of people inside and they start 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.600
 skip 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.939
 I am very recognized worldwide this 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.119
 place back there is one of the ds3 or 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.310
 of that 9 I do not remember what it is that 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.750
 is here the fund also used for the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.670
 skydiving is an airport 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.039
 inconvenient because that airspace 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.820
 without controlling classes only one can 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.039
 enter and exit as one needs it 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.200
 so that you have complications with them 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.899
 last night we arrived here because of the question 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.640
 we took fuel and I was jumping 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.009
 it was already night and one of those planes 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.240
 I walked took off when I came the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.100
 controller told me he was taking off 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.350
 the after I got in touch with the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.179
 pilot pilot told me to and be careful 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.009
 because we're going to jump to 7,000 feet over 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.890
 the airport is still towards the north 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.240
 east of the airport about I kept going towards 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.119
 the northeast the airport because I do not 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.939
 I saw them jumped the paratroopers in 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.369
 the night and I obviously did not see them in the 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.920
 night they do not see themselves difficult to see a 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.360
 most difficult plane is to see a series of 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.399
 parachute although they bring a beep 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.250
 they contract in the in the shoe they bring a 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.810
 focus a light on our blade but not what 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.819
 I saw about studying turns towards the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.580
 northeast until I already had a contact 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.349
 positive with them study the pilot I'll 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.730
 to enter the father friend the pilot 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.709
 next the most 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.629
 so that it does not interfere with the 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.379
 paratroopers between as fast as 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.480
 I could and then landed and when 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.940
 well alone I saw the parachutes come 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.590
 and land here on the back not 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.629
 if you reach it to see books 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.629
 in the back you can not see 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.400
 but on the other side of the tank there is 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.330
 some tubes that come up as 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.069
 ducts that's the air tunnel gel 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.750
 where they practice you get in there 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.489
 inside and it is a fan that is 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.780
 fanning the air upwards also 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.959
 is inside and starts to float 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.120
 begins to ignite the movements of 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.799
 you will need when you are up there 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.299
 that has all that here they have hotel 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.000
 has restaurant I'm very practical for 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.690
 we come to land to put the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.599
 plane on the ramp loading fuel and 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.700
 then go to the hotel to rest 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.849
 without necessary or to the restaurant to buy 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.680
 food but this is one of the places 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.209
 that I like and I do not like them 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.400
 provides look at already the parachutes 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.540
 not if they can see the base a 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.540
 bit difficult to grasp them 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.280
 here arribita up here is our 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.740
 idea is 123456 so that airs that were 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.170
 those that 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.230
 those who left a while ago to see 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.590
 you can not see the camera 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.490
 I do not see it with my glasses 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.620
 but over here they should be in the camera 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.599
 amazing 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.430
 is what I was telling my friends is 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.170
 It's hard to be seen but at the 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.500
 you will be able to see the line of 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.200
 the parachute 1234567 parachute 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.720
 sun down there they're going to land 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.920
 them in the field they have destined to 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.159
 a few moments ago we had 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.519
 driving there was a balloon towards this 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.430
 address and did not see it yet but 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.849
 it's a hot air balloon goes up and 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.069
 jump out of there from the screed that they tell me 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.200
 from that balloon jumps what they call him 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.260
 they call the fly wind that is a person 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.979
 with a special suit that gets 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.900
 wings back and lets you fly I go like 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.220
 if it were a plane without a motor in fact a 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.030
 glider 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.720
 the planes that they use here is 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.070
 where people from other countries have come 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.000
 You can watch on YouTube and search 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.470
 rocket man or forgiveness to the mind they go to 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.990
 find this kind of people that 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.000
 they are with parachutes but frying pan with a 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.390
 special costume that allows them to do 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.160
 plan and fly get a glider 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.220
 but in this case human because not 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.380
 they have a structure like airplanes 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:59.610
 Amazing incredible ingenuity 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.010
 from the incredible human people series 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.630
 amazing the engineering of the human being and 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.430
 They are very dedicated people too and very 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.380
 disciplined here has the hangars 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.570
 where they themselves learn to pack the 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.850
 parachute to reuse it in the 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.050
 next jump 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.670
 talking about trusting you 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.190
 confidence in yourself you do not have to 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.660
 pack your parachute and jump again 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.250
 or if it does not open because you can not 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.890
 the fault but they do not have a parachute 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.910
 of reserve that yes the primary parachute 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.740
 it does not open they have a secondary so that 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.850
 can open incredible 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.430
 the activity of the 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.900
 skydiving I really do not feel a 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.150
 attraction for it but I have to 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.330
 learn to jump because in the future 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.640
 immediately I will start classes of 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.220
 basic instruction aerobatic ar and for 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.990
 Be aerobatic here in the US every time 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.090
 that raise your nose more than 30 degrees or 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.920
 the 30-degree drop and you make a bank 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.630
 more than 60 degrees to the right or to the 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.280
 left if you have parachute in 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.260
 the plane or with you on the plane better 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.129
 said then is the arm so 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.800
 I have to 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.469
 jumping on a parachute would be illogical 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.360
 I was doing aerobatic or 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.919
 foreign my parachute and for some 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.789
 reason I had to jump out of the plane that 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.979
 something goes wrong 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.029
 I've never jumped before that's the reason 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.649
 why I have to learn to jump 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:20.019
 in parachutes does not call me much the 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:22.149
 I'm telling you, but I have to do it 

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.919
 to a point just come here with 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.839
 them to train in the tunnel and the 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.830
 attack is what I have with you 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.089
 I came out in the meantime please 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.249
 keep the heavens euros invested 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:32.950
 clicks in the sky safe and end has been a 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:35.730
 I miss the next song 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.730
 comes more
