already has this matte finish you know
this<00:01:24.970> is<00:01:25.120> the<00:01:25.210> part<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.510> we<00:01:25.720> hammer<00:01:26.020> over<00:01:26.230> the

the<00:01:48.010> main<00:01:48.220> issue<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:57.550> dry<00:01:59.130> completely<00:02:10.080> many

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
the main issue to dry completely many

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.410 
the main issue to dry completely many
decades<00:02:11.590> ago<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:15.490> just<00:02:15.640> want<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.820> dry<00:02:16.030> up<00:02:16.180> all

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
decades ago you just want to dry up all

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.440 
decades ago you just want to dry up all
the<00:02:16.980> try<00:02:17.980> out<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.250> water<00:02:18.490> any<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.240> water

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the try out the water any of the water

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.229 
the try out the water any of the water
that's<00:02:19.660> left<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:20.110> there<00:02:22.650> will<00:02:23.650> cause<00:02:24.239> spotting

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
that's left on there will cause spotting

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.750 
that's left on there will cause spotting
mainly<00:02:25.959> because<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.770> chemicals<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.430> your<00:02:27.459> tap

mainly because the chemicals in your tap
water<00:02:28.200> will<00:02:29.200> react<00:02:29.709> with<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.950> copper<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
water will react with the copper and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.750 
water will react with the copper and
leave<00:02:31.989> your<00:02:32.140> little<00:02:32.709> dark<00:02:32.890> spots<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.430> there<00:02:33.610> so
