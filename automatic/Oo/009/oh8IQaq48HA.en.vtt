00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 so here now I'm going to show you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.220
 how to assemble the tree so the most 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.080
 difficult is precisely to double the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.460
 in front so that's why I prefer 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.839
 do it on video 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.699
 so here it's back so for 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 notice that the part number 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.320
 it's back 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.050
 normally cut in half the size 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.849
 here it's the right girl is here it's 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.160
 the little assembly annotations that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.020
 means that the small b 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 they have to be assembled with the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.969
 little bedu in front and the little one with the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.070
 little adults in front so that's it 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.730
 in addition to the people to guide them 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.780
 in their assembly steps then 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 I cut off my back on purpose 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.910
 water liner smaller than the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:00.109
 lining as the fabric back you go 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.109
 see why so I'm going to sew here 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:16.650
 dolan of mature afar and when you see 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:18.930
 there I address them here I flap here the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 facing and suddenly I would not have a 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.890
 part of the walls too thick so 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.890
 after I prepare my intro him water 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:42.729
 I start then I stop at a 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:45.270
 millimeter of the seam and I return 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.479
 in my work 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.159
 here and there is the facing of the 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.310
 blow the lah facing it is ready 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.350
 and there is not much thickness 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.390
 after I prepare the neckline request 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.750
 in front then I told you about screen 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.759
 so always me I count the game screen 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:14.110
 complete in the middle here also in the middle and 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:17.230
 I put world in front of place takes 33 and 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.360
 I prepare the outstanding front walls 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.350
 the uncle takes against the screen I the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.590
 pain for me not decree and here 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.049
 also the bottom of the front is the big one 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.799
 middle just so the fabric does not get 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:37.970
 do not decide and I do the same thing I 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:42.650
 prepare my loulou at 1 cm 2 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.900
 power as I had planned before I 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:51.620
 planned you will rediscover a 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:58.490
 feeling that you did and I 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:04.700
 do you take as I did for the back and 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:06.980
 I'm going back and I'm going to go 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.470
 return to step two 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.830
 so I'm happy and I'm going to 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.830
 returns
