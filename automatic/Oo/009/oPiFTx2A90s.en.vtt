00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.169 
we're gonna start with a little bit at
the<00:00:29.079> time<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.679> justify<00:00:30.550> my<00:00:30.699> thumb<00:00:30.970> that's

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
the time and justify my thumb that's

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.940 
the time and justify my thumb that's
where<00:00:31.329> I'm<00:00:31.449> going<00:00:31.630> to<00:00:31.689> start<00:00:31.929> painting<00:00:32.200> and<00:00:32.619> I

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950

start<00:00:33.250> moving<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.670> brush<00:00:33.790> before<00:00:34.450> I<00:00:34.480> even

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
start moving the brush before I even

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.660 
start moving the brush before I even
touch<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.230> hair<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:36.039> we<00:00:36.160> get<00:00:36.309> this<00:00:36.460> motion

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
touch the hair so we get this motion

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:50.689 
touch the hair so we get this motion
going

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.229 

so<00:00:51.239> I'm<00:00:51.359> kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> working<00:00:51.960> back<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.410> forth

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
see how about good tension so that when

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
see how about good tension so that when
I'm<00:00:58.399> touching<00:00:58.579> down<00:01:00.910> it's<00:01:01.910> kind<00:01:02.059> of<00:01:02.090> like<00:01:02.239> the
