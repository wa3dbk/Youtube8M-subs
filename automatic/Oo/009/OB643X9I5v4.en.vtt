00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.029
 This is my humble proposal 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.730
 government program 2013-2019 but 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.950
 we are the Venezuelan people the 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.059
 that will give depth and 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:20.940
 legitimacy and indestructible strength 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.940
 to the second socialist plan of the nation 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.119
 this I repeat compatriots has for 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.170
 us and we should give it the biggest 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.890
 importance 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.890
 look 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:45.370
 forgive me for saying it this way 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.020
 because it does not sound nice surely but 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.790
 I wrote myself 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.540
 the five great historical objectives 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.899
 of our revolution 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:03.840
 and from there 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:10.229
 matches in the identification 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 and then writing the objectives 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.270
 strategic 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.480
 this comes by scale the first scale 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.850
 they are the great historical objectives 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.510
 the second scale are the objectives 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.570
 strategic 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.400
 sorry the second scale the objectives 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.560
 national or rhythms 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.080
 the first scale the objectives 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.650
 historical the great objectives 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.320
 historical the second scale the 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.920
 national objectives 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.570
 the third scale the objectives 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.200
 strategic and the fourth scale the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.340
 general objectives then there will be that 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.020
 keep working other scales more 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:04.030
 detailed specific objectives 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.130
 regional sectoral local objectives 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.120
 within a single large construction of the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.280
 socialist plan is a new way of 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.020
 to plan 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.060
 comprehensive socialist planning 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.160
 had and must leave the construction 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.030
 of socialism from the same 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.060
 planning that's why I ask you leaders 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.810
 political social leaders and people 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.760
 all youth peasant students 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.770
 working class everyone to discuss the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.950
 program and turn it into a flag of 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.600
 battle because this is the flag of the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.600
 battle the map of the battle 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.390
 I submit to the people 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.390
 five major historical objectives 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.000
 and as his word or as the same 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.590
 word says it 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.510
 they are historical because 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.510
 they come from far back 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.330
 they are located in the perspective of time 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.970
 past 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.670
 and they are located in the perspective of time 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.490
 to come they transcend us 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.970
 same 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.920
 they transcend yesterday's time 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.630
 they transcend today's time to the 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.530
 tomorrow's time 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.360
 they are the great permanent objectives 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.770
 historical 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.770
 the first of them 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.710
 the first of them 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:51.069
 it has to do with something that is vital 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.069
 truly vital 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.520
 Simon Bolivar 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.020
 the father bolivar 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.020
 I say it this way 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.110
 in January 1830, take good care of 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.910
 the date 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:16.220
 January 1830 the country was cracking 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.030
 all the effort of 20 years of 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.900
 revolution 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.900
 According to DÃ­az 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.070
 it was carried by the wind 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.070
 and I went back
