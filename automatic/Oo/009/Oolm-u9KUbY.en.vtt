00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
the YouTube cool hat man here with a

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.200 
the YouTube cool hat man here with a
video<00:00:03.149> about<00:00:03.210> another<00:00:03.689> thing<00:00:03.990> that<00:00:04.140> I<00:00:04.170> made

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
video about another thing that I made

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.100 
video about another thing that I made
this<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> box<00:00:06.779> with<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:08.450> lock<00:00:09.450> on<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:10.080> I

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
this is a box with a lock on it that I

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.499 
this is a box with a lock on it that I
made<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.650> completely<00:00:11.490> made<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.000> out<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.240> wood

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
made I completely made this out of wood

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.320 
made I completely made this out of wood
that<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.780> had<00:00:12.990> laying<00:00:13.230> around

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
that I had laying around

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.929 
that I had laying around
um<00:00:15.529> the<00:00:16.529> lock<00:00:16.740> actually<00:00:17.220> works<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:18.470> made<00:00:19.470> that

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
um the lock actually works I made that

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.090 
um the lock actually works I made that
I'm<00:00:20.939> gonna<00:00:21.090> demonstrate<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.960> see<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
I'm gonna demonstrate it to you see the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.830 
I'm gonna demonstrate it to you see the
symbols<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.880> are<00:00:24.869> called<00:00:25.710> Pigpen<00:00:26.279> cipher

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
symbols you see are called Pigpen cipher

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.580 
symbols you see are called Pigpen cipher
it's<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.990> type<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:29.060> like<00:00:30.060> secret<00:00:30.929> language<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
it's a type of like secret language that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.889 
it's a type of like secret language that
our<00:00:31.619> founding<00:00:32.250> fathers<00:00:32.640> used<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.270> create

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
our founding fathers used to create

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.650 
our founding fathers used to create
secret<00:00:34.290> notes<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:35.180> think<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.270> was<00:00:36.390> during<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
secret notes I think it was during the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.400 
secret notes I think it was during the
revolution<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.440> believe<00:00:37.890> um<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.170> are

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
revolution I believe um and these are

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.830 
revolution I believe um and these are
initials<00:00:42.200> for<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.420> only<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.750> who

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
initials for and I'm the only one who

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.500 
initials for and I'm the only one who
really<00:00:45.930> knows<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.440> mean<00:00:46.940> if<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.329> don't

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
really knows what they mean if you don't

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.959 
really knows what they mean if you don't
know<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:49.500> big<00:00:49.800> pen<00:00:50.010> cipher<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:51.199> but<00:00:52.199> uh<00:00:52.969> so

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
know what big pen cipher is but uh so

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.959 
know what big pen cipher is but uh so
you<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.469> try<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:56.820> which

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you got a try and you don't know which

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.329 
you got a try and you don't know which
one<00:00:57.469> it<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:59.270> say<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.350> go

think ahead real good okay so there's
the<00:02:00.970> locking<00:02:01.560> mechanism<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:04.200> used<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.320> mousetrap

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the locking mechanism I used a mousetrap

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.190 
the locking mechanism I used a mousetrap
some<00:02:07.840> other<00:02:07.990> wood<00:02:09.090> got<00:02:10.090> like<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.269> dowel<00:02:10.599> here<00:02:11.110> of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
some other wood got like a dowel here of

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:19.100 
some other wood got like a dowel here of
this<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:12.910> nail<00:02:15.150> wait<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.360> can<00:02:16.540> show<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.850> it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
this like a nail wait I can show you it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:29.509 
this like a nail wait I can show you it
worsened<00:02:23.370> okay<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:27.030> how<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.180> works<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.690> you

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
worsened okay so how it works is you

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.640 
worsened okay so how it works is you
spin<00:02:30.519> this<00:02:30.640> around<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.620> whatever<00:02:34.410> symbol<00:02:35.410> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
spin this around and whatever symbol the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.420 
spin this around and whatever symbol the
arrow<00:02:35.920> head<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.280> pointing<00:02:36.640> at<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.910> pull<00:02:37.269> in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
arrow head is pointing at you pull in

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.180 
arrow head is pointing at you pull in
and<00:02:39.780> sometimes<00:02:40.780> see<00:02:41.380> if<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:41.709> not<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.099> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
and sometimes see if it's not on the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.220 
and sometimes see if it's not on the
right<00:02:42.310> one<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:42.580> doesn't<00:02:42.849> hit<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.060> say<00:02:44.049> it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
right one it doesn't hit it say it's

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.319 
right one it doesn't hit it say it's
over<00:02:44.410> here<00:02:44.680> doesn't<00:02:45.220> hit<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:45.790> up<00:02:45.910> here<00:02:46.180> it

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
over here doesn't hit it it's up here it

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.930 
over here doesn't hit it it's up here it
doesn't<00:02:46.480> hit<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:47.489> but<00:02:48.489> if<00:02:48.609> you're<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:48.850> the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
doesn't hit it but if you're on the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.150 
doesn't hit it but if you're on the
right<00:02:49.120> one

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
right one

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.020 
right one
you<00:02:51.160> pull<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:52.480> mousetrap<00:02:52.959> will<00:02:53.140> hit<00:02:53.410> this

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
you pull the mousetrap will hit this

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.750 
you pull the mousetrap will hit this
which<00:02:55.030> will<00:02:55.239> unlatch<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:57.400> hook<00:02:57.579> on<00:02:57.820> top<00:02:59.760> and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
which will unlatch the hook on top and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.370 
which will unlatch the hook on top and
it<00:03:01.359> will<00:03:01.390> open<00:03:02.350> it<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:04.390> will<00:03:04.540> unlock<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.049> door

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
it will open it it will unlock the door

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.170 
it will open it it will unlock the door
so<00:03:05.650> I'll<00:03:05.739> show<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:06.940> go<00:03:07.090> like
