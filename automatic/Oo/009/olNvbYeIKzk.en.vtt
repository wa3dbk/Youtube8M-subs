00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.390
 kind of 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 Fu 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.410
 I understood 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.410
 Prefecture 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700
 Result 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.330
 I was not told money 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.290
 I want to go to see 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.290
 I write the same 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.770
 Transparent 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.770
 Opening half past 6 am 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 On the other hand 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.470
 In other words, the tendon of the foot 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.180
 I hope for a steady approach 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.459
 Neural network substitution 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.479
 9 times are in charge 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.389
 Returning to Japan, I have built a system for parallel processing of chairman 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.309
 by the way 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.759
 It's not possible 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.840
 Therefore 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.839
 f1 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.989
 But still the completed copyright infringement suspicion 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.859
 I agree with these reports 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.199
 It may seem to use the network of the first half of fiscal year 28 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:38.299
 In the future, the fall of auxiliary equipment deficits from the country will be devised like this 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.929
 I would like to say apologize for Mr. Hongono of various result towns. 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.929
 I thought I could prove it 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:50.629
 I told this 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.169
 I'm interested in something as it is 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.789
 What kind of purpose are you studying?
