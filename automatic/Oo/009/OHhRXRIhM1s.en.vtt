00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
that this one is slightly smaller but

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.509 
that this one is slightly smaller but
only<00:02:17.230> by<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.440> little<00:02:17.680> bit<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> 12.5<00:02:21.160> inch

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
only by a little bit this is a 12.5 inch

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.150 
only by a little bit this is a 12.5 inch
ER<00:02:21.640> but<00:02:22.209> when<00:02:22.780> actually<00:02:23.230> comparing<00:02:23.739> them<00:02:23.920> is

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
ER but when actually comparing them is

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.400 
ER but when actually comparing them is
just<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.459> little<00:02:24.550> bit<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.840> idea<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.380> just

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
just a little bit the idea but it just

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.410 
just a little bit the idea but it just
little<00:02:26.769> bit<00:02:26.830> longer<00:02:27.160> because<00:02:27.880> on<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.300> other

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
little bit longer because on the other

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.660 
little bit longer because on the other
hand<00:02:28.570> it's<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.410> little<00:02:29.650> bit<00:02:29.769> thinner<00:02:30.070> as<00:02:30.370> well

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
hand it's a little bit thinner as well

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.509 
hand it's a little bit thinner as well
as<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.030> can<00:02:31.180> see<00:02:31.239> here<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.800> ideapad<00:02:33.280> is

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
as you can see here so the ideapad is

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.210 
as you can see here so the ideapad is
sooner<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.090> lighter<00:02:34.450> as<00:02:34.720> well<00:02:34.930> but<00:02:35.769> this<00:02:35.980> one

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
sooner it's lighter as well but this one

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.660 
sooner it's lighter as well but this one
is<00:02:36.400> slightly<00:02:36.880> more<00:02:37.360> compact<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:39.100> course<00:02:39.430> just

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
is slightly more compact of course just

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.120 
is slightly more compact of course just
to<00:02:39.820> have<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.450> one<00:02:40.720> finger<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:41.170> common<00:02:41.500> both<00:02:41.980> of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
to have a one finger in common both of

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.130 
to have a one finger in common both of
them<00:02:42.250> are<00:02:42.310> yoga's<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.570> means<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.900> they

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
them are yoga's so that means that they

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.009 
them are yoga's so that means that they
