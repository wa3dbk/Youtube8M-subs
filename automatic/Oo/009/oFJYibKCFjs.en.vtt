00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 if you want cheap ultimate team coins 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.420
 looking for great price and a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.870
 reliable service and then go to 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.880
 www.versiercoach.nl 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.349
 and uses heart code and 5 for 5 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.570
 percent discount welcome ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.000
 this is say rotors murder is a few 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.859
 days ago i have a talens 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.720
 i had introduced a new rule the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.039
 things that I could use coins to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.420
 pack to buy after a win 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.119
 so you also see that i have 190,000 concept 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.250
 and 952 but that foundation nice number the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.109
 tribe say 109,000 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.910
 at least I bought it for 200 years because 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.739
 after victory, that seemed completely to me 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.790
 nice but of course I'm going again divisions 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.440
 what I can do with it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 continue i have an idea his team now 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.879
 only a semi weak defense 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 anyway i get a penalty here 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.350
 and this was my first game a week or so 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.940
 so and then well then he goes in there 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.039
 i'm fuckin 'angry 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.170
 goddamn more full we just keep going 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.219
 because it also bad mold and comes 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.660
 because of this 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.340
 and yes those ordinary things and such 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.600
 is it a happy one again 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.370
 I come here again through my channel and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.289
 the pretty good actually 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.430
 he only misses technically what actually 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.559
 didn't have to do anything technical 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.970
 respect to walcott in fifa it is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.799
 just front Veels much 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.420
 faster is because i get to three on one 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.189
 but of course completely beautiful so then go 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.869
 i like you there with a family that i like 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.820
 said very well if such ski is alone 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 I don't know what to think of him 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.479
 you know he is doing well now but me i 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.530
 always believe when i'm new to the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.299
 also really so that ar clean with a 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.610
 full team plays rid you feel it sews 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.960
 full of osmo you know where I'm going 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.880
 that players day to get better at all 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.500
 no matter how bad they are less you through 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.729
 have that too, but let me know 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.140
 in the responses 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.790
 I also want to 5 2 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.619
 naturally the most beautiful ge 45 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.150
 one hundred coins because I also won the title 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.170
 and therefore a few at the same time 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.400
 done things that i don't show what 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.240
 you are wilders alike 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.189
 logos this stadium everything 35 capek 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.930
 bought because I had won and 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.549
 actually got nothing out of it 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.380
 but although it appears so that was nice 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.000
 of course but for the rest it was 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.320
 nothing at all 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.630
 then we go on because I have to go against one 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040
 villa fc i don't even know but i had 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.299
 they did not see the team before the game 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.680
 should do that more often because me 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.329
 never know what kind of teams play that way 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.610
 because apparently they are quite a good one 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.280
 352 team and immediately from the kick-off 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.960
 I dribble through it and enjoy action 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.729
 so I stand for a 0 really had 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.289
 a super slogan or did went with flan 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.940
 and fer de that i mean what are you doing 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.090
 yourself this year if you have the two 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.190
 players used 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.660
 no matter how well I come to you on 2 0 and I can 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.980
 You already reveal that this is a whole 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.959
 interesting competition is going to be for 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.640
 me because here comes with it comes 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.930
 all three zero and I can talk about it 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.340
 have goals but then I am still 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.690
 just busy de surat already where this 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.400
 had about gone 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.650
 whatever i want to say is at the moment 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.680
 that you will hopefully watch this 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.780
 Tuesday so Tuesday, November 11 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.450
 I go live streaming in the evening I have 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.010
 still have 750 lot first owner account 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.420
 and i just go i just go one 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.950
 some packs open and I can see that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.780
 the roots are not not a very long one 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.190
 string but it just takes a little bit 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.079
 little by certain so that I have a few 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.180
 days would be done and tomorrow's moment 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.769
 and tara's beyond most a language today 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.030
 went pretty well today is natural 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.079
 Monday the tenth 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.030
 I will of course continue again 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.610
 learn but i thought hey i have one 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.989
 little time and I had a few days 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.730
 nothing done and I think it's pretty good 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.049
 ugly face in my videos to such 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.730
 nothing to do for a few days 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.170
 but that's because I upload so much 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.329
 you say to yourself a bit 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.410
 wood but I win 9 9 something 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.170
 of course is completely beautiful 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.720
 i open again 35k package i have too 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.760
 I decided that I only have a package or we 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.629
 just open package at all or like me 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.040
 win 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.660
 or if I win and of course a series 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.459
 wit those are the only two 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.489
 times that I open it because it becomes different 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.900
 it a bit much and also in terms of play 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.280
 will of course have a link from you 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.099
 coins for practice why wouldn't you 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.780
 buy players right away 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.410
 i will rule that if i am in the 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.139
 episode 2 times that I win one 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.489
 player purchase at the end of the episode 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:42.220
 and if, for example, I win xp once 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.380
 left equal or also lose once 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.120
 then you may decide who I am 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.669
 next episode 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.150
 so suppose for example this is episode 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.700
 12 or something 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.380
 well i i i am so now for example me 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.880
 have already won but set an episode 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.690
 13 I win one time I lose one 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.980
 times 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.690
 then you may in a comment one 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.269
 player I call at the end 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.319
 possibly from episode 14 may pick up whatever 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.780
 is how it works buy it clear 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.060
 and if not then you just have to 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.310
 the reactions were dark and then nice 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.299
 with pleasure again 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.630
 but of course you can already see the animals 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.650
 arrive 4 4 in the 90th minute I had 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.299
 quite a respect for that time actually 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.440
 an ai stuff with a man less 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.150
 and he was actually quite normal 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.370
 good playing so credit for him 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.050
 I bunch until you can still draw 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.330
 but good I really need this and lasts 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.380
 This team had a few, I do not, I again 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.150
 before the game that I 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.830
 Really more often need to do man research 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.660
 team never thought of bones box 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.130
 I had no idea where technically I wanted 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.780
 saw some names of i thought this belongs 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.460
 not able to fit but yes I knew 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.660
 not often against stuff so I knew too 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.330
 nothing at all 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.610
 but well you feel arriving x h30 forward 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.560
 literally if it is just people 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.230
 beer i believe my arsenal fan i do 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.770
 a red arsenal really throws up 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.620
 all sides lead against Anderlecht 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.930
 against swansea bear and you will go crazy 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.940
 of you have no idea how annoying that 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.990
 then only thing you there is 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.360
 pure supporter 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.080
 that is literally just what pissed off 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.430
 there is 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.720
 when a fall i come in this competition 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.130
 it was against a Dutchman, by the way 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.740
 I noticed with that you naturally saw as 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.140
 name nerdfighters one by I also come 2 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.300
 0 before and now we flush it a bit 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.820
 because he did this very much 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.920
 happy to purchase docs fighter up to 208 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.450
 there can not be two wrongs and 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.790
 us so quickly is of course very annoying 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.480
 but then this package comes 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.880
 I open it and you see you actually see 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.500
 nothing no that was a bad place where 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.600
 I still have a weighing age package 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.690
 white and that means I open it 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.820
 nice to park antoine griezmann 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.800
 impor like it 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.830
 You don't want to know how apparently I saw 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.450
 him I still modest holy shit I 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.950
 didn't know how much it was worth 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.800
 look in a bit and they are cheap 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.300
 buy now was 120k 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.760
 woman child you naturally want well 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.680
 now you can decide who I will get 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.120
 for a week at least my start 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.590
 next episode must buy say 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.280
 because I was actually too long for it now 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.360
 to do 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.860
 when is it about watching 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.130
 then liner did not close letters and 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.130
 I'll see you later
