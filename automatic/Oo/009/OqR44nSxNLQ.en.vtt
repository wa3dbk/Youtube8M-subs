00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.220 
caricature you know I'm starting with
the<00:02:51.459> hair<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.910> I'm<00:02:52.330> putting<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.990> pretty

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
the hair and I'm putting in a pretty

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.350 
the hair and I'm putting in a pretty
flat<00:02:53.560> tone<00:02:53.830> right<00:02:54.130> now<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.820> can<00:02:55.000> see<00:02:55.180> that

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
flat tone right now you can see that

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.940 
flat tone right now you can see that
it's<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.600> little<00:02:55.630> bit<00:02:55.900> darker<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.500> tone<00:02:56.530> at<00:02:56.890> the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
it's a little bit darker in tone at the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.740 
it's a little bit darker in tone at the
top<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:58.090> you're<00:02:58.270> going<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.420> see<00:02:58.630> me

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
top and you're going to see me

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.020 
top and you're going to see me
differentiate<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.650> bit<00:02:59.800> later<00:03:00.070> but<00:03:00.400> really

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
differentiate it a bit later but really

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.330 
differentiate it a bit later but really
I'm<00:03:01.209> just<00:03:01.239> focusing<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:02.020> getting<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.500> the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
I'm just focusing on getting in the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.850 
I'm just focusing on getting in the
basic<00:03:03.760> tones<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.989> that's<00:03:05.350> pretty<00:03:05.530> dark

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
basic tones and that's pretty dark

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.729 
basic tones and that's pretty dark
compared<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.550> rest<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.959> am<00:03:08.290> going<00:03:08.560> to

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
compared to the rest of it I am going to

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.750 
compared to the rest of it I am going to
use<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.890> blending<00:03:09.430> stump<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.630> neck<00:03:11.610> if<00:03:12.610> you

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
use a blending stump for the neck if you

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.780 
use a blending stump for the neck if you
don't<00:03:12.910> have<00:03:13.090> one<00:03:13.120> just<00:03:13.450> use<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:14.050> q-tip<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:15.550> can

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
don't have one just use a q-tip that can

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.630 
don't have one just use a q-tip that can
definitely<00:03:16.269> take<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.959> place<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.440> I'm<00:03:18.370> being

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
definitely take the place and I'm being

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.699 
definitely take the place and I'm being
I'm<00:03:18.820> using<00:03:19.060> actually<00:03:19.540> mechanical<00:03:20.110> pencil<00:03:20.500> you

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
I'm using actually mechanical pencil you

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.710 
I'm using actually mechanical pencil you
can<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:21.400> know<00:03:21.519> it's<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:21.970> regular<00:03:22.090> pencil

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
can you know it's just a regular pencil

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.280 
can you know it's just a regular pencil
but<00:03:22.930> it's<00:03:23.140> got<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> much<00:03:23.800> thinner<00:03:24.519> tip<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:26.110> can

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
but it's got a much thinner tip you can

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.920 
but it's got a much thinner tip you can
see<00:03:26.470> compared<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.220> one<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.810> know<00:03:28.900> I

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
see compared to that one and you know I

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.440 
see compared to that one and you know I
do<00:03:29.350> that<00:03:29.650> for<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:29.950> really<00:03:30.160> detailed<00:03:31.120> parts

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
do that for the really detailed parts

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.080 
do that for the really detailed parts
but<00:03:31.900> if<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:32.560> don't<00:03:32.739> have<00:03:32.920> one<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.489> those<00:03:33.700> just

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
but if you don't have one of those just

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.199 
but if you don't have one of those just
sharpen<00:03:34.930> your<00:03:35.050> pencil<00:03:35.440> extra<00:03:36.160> fine<00:03:36.370> for<00:03:37.120> the

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
sharpen your pencil extra fine for the

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.050 
sharpen your pencil extra fine for the
eyes<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:38.380> try<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.590> follow<00:03:38.860> along<00:03:39.280> there's<00:03:39.940> a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
eyes and try to follow along there's a

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.150

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
this far yeah maybe give shading a try

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.340 
this far yeah maybe give shading a try
for<00:04:24.550> step<00:04:24.820> 20<00:04:25.240> you're<00:04:25.510> gonna<00:04:25.630> see<00:04:25.930> me<00:04:26.080> shade

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
for step 20 you're gonna see me shade

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.930 
for step 20 you're gonna see me shade

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
i'm just kind of separating the lines in

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.460 
i'm just kind of separating the lines in
between<00:05:23.920> the<00:05:24.280> hands<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.780> that<00:05:26.050> is<00:05:26.260> pretty

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
between the hands and that is pretty

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.110 
between the hands and that is pretty
much<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:28.530> step<00:05:29.530> 21<00:05:29.890> we<00:05:30.250> are<00:05:30.280> going<00:05:30.730> to<00:05:30.940> do<00:05:31.090> the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
much that step 21 we are going to do the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.740 
much that step 21 we are going to do the
lower<00:05:31.510> body<00:05:31.810> and<00:05:32.730> you<00:05:33.730> know<00:05:33.850> we<00:05:34.150> are<00:05:34.330> just

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
lower body and you know we are just

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.140 
lower body and you know we are just
doing<00:05:35.440> essentially<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.490> same<00:05:36.640> thing<00:05:36.910> that<00:05:37.030> we

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
doing essentially the same thing that we

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.600 
doing essentially the same thing that we
did<00:05:37.180> in<00:05:37.420> the<00:05:37.450> previous<00:05:37.690> step<00:05:38.080> i<00:05:39.040> use<00:05:39.430> the

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
did in the previous step i use the

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.700 
did in the previous step i use the
eraser<00:05:40.060> to<00:05:40.210> carve<00:05:40.450> out<00:05:40.660> a<00:05:40.900> highlight<00:05:41.380> for<00:05:41.410> the

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
eraser to carve out a highlight for the

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.070 
but it's a good way to add a solid layer
of<00:06:41.860> tone<00:06:42.100> you<00:06:43.030> know<00:06:43.060> with<00:06:43.270> these<00:06:43.390> markers<00:06:43.870> and

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
actually really excited about this one

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.040 
actually really excited about this one
because<00:07:00.700> sometimes<00:07:01.300> when<00:07:01.480> you<00:07:01.630> teach<00:07:01.810> people

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
because sometimes when you teach people

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.440 
because sometimes when you teach people
to<00:07:02.200> draw<00:07:02.500> portraits<00:07:02.830> you<00:07:03.790> have<00:07:03.940> to<00:07:04.120> be<00:07:04.240> so

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
to draw portraits you have to be so

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.930 
to draw portraits you have to be so
exact<00:07:04.900> to<00:07:05.230> get<00:07:05.380> the<00:07:05.530> likeness<00:07:05.950> and<00:07:06.160> you<00:07:06.850> know

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
exact to get the likeness and you know

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.020 
exact to get the likeness and you know
this<00:07:07.090> gives<00:07:07.330> you<00:07:07.420> a<00:07:07.450> nice<00:07:07.630> opportunity<00:07:07.990> to<00:07:09.030> not

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
this gives you a nice opportunity to not

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.460 
this gives you a nice opportunity to not
really<00:07:10.330> feel<00:07:10.510> the<00:07:10.660> pressure<00:07:10.900> to<00:07:11.050> do<00:07:11.290> that

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
really feel the pressure to do that

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.280 
really feel the pressure to do that
because<00:07:11.680> if<00:07:12.130> you<00:07:12.280> get<00:07:12.520> if<00:07:13.180> you<00:07:13.570> get<00:07:13.840> all<00:07:14.020> of<00:07:14.050> the

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290 
because if you get if you get all of the

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.310 
because if you get if you get all of the
pieces<00:07:14.470> in<00:07:15.010> place<00:07:15.070> you'll<00:07:16.060> have<00:07:16.270> a<00:07:16.300> nerd<00:07:16.600> and

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320 
pieces in place you'll have a nerd and

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.440 
pieces in place you'll have a nerd and
whether<00:07:17.740> or<00:07:17.860> not<00:07:18.010> it<00:07:18.310> looks<00:07:18.550> exactly<00:07:18.700> like<00:07:19.120> the

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.450 
whether or not it looks exactly like the

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.050 
whether or not it looks exactly like the
reference<00:07:19.810> image<00:07:20.080> or<00:07:20.200> not<00:07:20.380> so<00:07:20.770> and<00:07:21.730> that<00:07:21.910> might

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
reference image or not so and that might

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.780 
reference image or not so and that might
be<00:07:22.210> a<00:07:22.240> good<00:07:22.450> thing<00:07:22.510> you<00:07:22.930> know<00:07:22.960> I<00:07:23.050> like
