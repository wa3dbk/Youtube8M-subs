as<00:02:21.810> soon<00:02:22.140> as<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.620> installed<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.160> my<00:02:23.370> compute

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
as soon as I installed it my compute

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.960 
as soon as I installed it my compute
as<00:02:24.599> well<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.409> CD<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.830> came<00:02:26.010> with<00:02:26.190> it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
as well as the CD it came with it

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.640 
as well as the CD it came with it
immediately<00:02:27.360> started<00:02:27.959> working<00:02:28.019> there<00:02:28.349> was<00:02:28.440> no

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
immediately started working there was no

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.589 
immediately started working there was no
lag<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.280> was<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.670> was<00:02:29.819> super<00:02:30.150> super<00:02:30.420> fast

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
lag it was it was super super fast

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.509 
lag it was it was super super fast
something<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.739> think<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.010> might<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.310> a

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
something that I think you might have a

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.330 
something that I think you might have a
hard<00:02:32.760> time<00:02:32.970> seeing<00:02:33.299> right<00:02:33.629> now<00:02:33.659> is<00:02:34.140> there<00:02:35.099> are

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
hard time seeing right now is there are

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.339 
hard time seeing right now is there are
some<00:02:35.909> lights<00:02:36.209> here<00:02:36.420> at<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.900> top<00:02:37.080> these<00:02:37.290> are

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
some lights here at the top these are

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.140 
some lights here at the top these are
kind<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.799> some<00:02:38.129> of<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.280> hidden<00:02:38.519> keys<00:02:38.700> so

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
kind of so some of the hidden keys so

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.600 
kind of so some of the hidden keys so
it's<00:02:39.299> really<00:02:39.450> cool<00:02:39.690> about<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.349> that<00:02:40.610> once

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
it's really cool about this is that once

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.850 
it's really cool about this is that once
you<00:02:41.730> tap<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.269> lights<00:02:42.450> come<00:02:42.720> on<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:43.620> can

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
you tap it the lights come on you can

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.100 
you tap it the lights come on you can
adjust<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> sound<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:44.819> can<00:02:44.970> mute<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.930> can

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
adjust the sound you can mute it you can

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.930 
adjust the sound you can mute it you can
turn<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.440> volume<00:02:46.470> up<00:02:46.890> turn<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.610> volume<00:02:47.730> down

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
turn the volume up turn the volume down

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.650 
turn the volume up turn the volume down
and<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:49.379> does<00:02:49.680> dim<00:02:50.069> back<00:02:50.459> up<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:50.910> they're

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
and it does dim back up so they're

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.180 
and it does dim back up so they're
hidden<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.349> that's<00:02:52.620> actually<00:02:52.799> not

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
hidden and that's actually not

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.680 
hidden and that's actually not
necessarily<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.879> good<00:02:54.000> thing<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.420> it's

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
necessarily a good thing and it's

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.890 
necessarily a good thing and it's
actually<00:02:54.900> kind<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.290> hard<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.590> see<00:02:56.629> it's<00:02:57.629> kind

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
actually kind of hard to see it's kind

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.770 
actually kind of hard to see it's kind
of<00:02:57.959> hard<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.200> see<00:02:58.379> them<00:02:58.560> if<00:02:58.829> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.780> poor

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
of hard to see them if you have poor

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.720 
of hard to see them if you have poor
lighting<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.220> some<00:03:02.430> ways<00:03:02.549> it's

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
lighting but it is in some ways it's

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.369 
lighting but it is in some ways it's
actually<00:03:02.849> an<00:03:03.090> advantage<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.720> like<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.200> long

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
actually an advantage I like the long

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.160 
actually an advantage I like the long
reach<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> keypad<00:03:06.599> I<00:03:06.629> mean<00:03:06.900> there<00:03:07.140> are

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
reach and the keypad I mean there are

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.599 
reach and the keypad I mean there are
just<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.410> many<00:03:07.560> things<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.099> like<00:03:08.190> about<00:03:08.250> this

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
just so many things to like about this

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.660 
just so many things to like about this
let<00:03:08.760> me<00:03:08.819> talk<00:03:08.970> about<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.239> pros<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.420> cons<00:03:09.629> so

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
let me talk about the pros and cons so

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.220 
let me talk about the pros and cons so
the<00:03:11.670> pro<00:03:11.910> for<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.359> for<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.599> keyboard<00:03:12.989> would

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
the pro for that for the keyboard would

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.650 
the pro for that for the keyboard would
be<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.680> design<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:14.250> really<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.940> design<00:03:15.090> I

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
be the design I really like the design I

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.890 
be the design I really like the design I
think<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.950> really<00:03:17.790> sophisticated<00:03:18.660> looking

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
think it's really sophisticated looking

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.589 
think it's really sophisticated looking
um<00:03:19.109> it's<00:03:20.010> got<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.700> great<00:03:20.910> reach<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.239> mentioned

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
um it's got the great reach I mentioned

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.839 
um it's got the great reach I mentioned
and<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.530> speed<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.920> connect<00:03:23.250> was<00:03:23.430> really

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
and the speed to connect was really

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.150 
and the speed to connect was really
really<00:03:24.269> fast<00:03:24.569> now<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.019> con<00:03:25.410> would<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.799> it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
really fast now the con would be it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.550 
really fast now the con would be it
cannot<00:03:26.519> adjust<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.510> height<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.049> right<00:03:28.260> here

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
cannot adjust the height so right here

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.039 
cannot adjust the height so right here
there's<00:03:29.130> only<00:03:29.220> one<00:03:29.819> adjust<00:03:30.299> there's<00:03:30.569> only<00:03:30.780> one

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
there's only one adjust there's only one

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.170 
there's only one adjust there's only one
height<00:03:31.459> opportunities<00:03:32.459> if<00:03:32.609> you<00:03:32.730> wanted<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.120> a

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
height opportunities if you wanted it a

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.479 
height opportunities if you wanted it a
little<00:03:33.359> higher<00:03:33.859> that's<00:03:34.859> not<00:03:35.190> going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> happen

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
little higher that's not going to happen

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.449 
little higher that's not going to happen
and<00:03:35.810> there's<00:03:36.810> no<00:03:37.139> reminders<00:03:37.829> something<00:03:38.340> you

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
and there's no reminders something you

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.550 
and there's no reminders something you
don't<00:03:38.700> realize<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.359> need<00:03:39.660> but<00:03:40.230> there's<00:03:40.380> no

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
don't realize you need but there's no

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.270 
don't realize you need but there's no
reminder<00:03:41.099> indicator<00:03:41.579> for<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.720> cats<00:03:42.989> or<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
reminder indicator for the cats or the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.770 
reminder indicator for the cats or the
num<00:03:44.459> lock<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.849> if<00:03:44.940> you've<00:03:45.090> accidentally<00:03:45.569> hit

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
num lock so if you've accidentally hit

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.729 
num lock so if you've accidentally hit
that<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.169> you<00:03:46.230> don't<00:03:46.319> remember

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
that and you don't remember

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.650 
that and you don't remember
there's<00:03:47.310> just<00:03:47.489> they<00:03:47.849> could<00:03:48.030> probably<00:03:48.239> include

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
there's just they could probably include

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.300 
there's just they could probably include
like<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> little<00:03:49.139> light<00:03:49.319> or<00:03:49.650> something<00:03:49.919> to<00:03:50.130> help

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
like a little light or something to help

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.309 
like a little light or something to help
you<00:03:50.519> know<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.480> those<00:03:51.660> are<00:03:51.840> pressed<00:03:52.109> other

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
you know that those are pressed other

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.289 
you know that those are pressed other
than<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.709> do<00:03:53.250> really<00:03:53.639> like<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.910> keyboard

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
than that I do really like the keyboard

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.270 
than that I do really like the keyboard
so<00:03:54.599> let's<00:03:55.380> talk<00:03:55.470> about<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.769> mouse<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.130> is

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
so let's talk about the mouse this is

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.620 
so let's talk about the mouse this is
actually<00:03:56.609> probably<00:03:57.000> what<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.180> liked<00:03:57.419> the<00:03:57.510> most

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
actually probably what I liked the most

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.259 
actually probably what I liked the most
about<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.410> combo<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.950> it's<00:03:59.790> got<00:03:59.970> some<00:04:00.150> really

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
about the combo and it's got some really

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.140

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
double-a batteries and I didn't have to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.990 
double-a batteries and I didn't have to
change<00:04:13.019> those<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.379> actually<00:04:13.500> have<00:04:14.280> I've<00:04:14.579> lasted

the<00:05:18.540> magnifier<00:05:19.050> Agri<00:05:19.410> section<00:05:19.680> was<00:05:19.919> really

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
the magnifier Agri section was really

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.950 
the magnifier Agri section was really
handy<00:05:20.550> when<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.120> wanted<00:05:21.360> to<00:05:21.419> zoom<00:05:21.690> in<00:05:21.840> on

handy when I wanted to zoom in on

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.750 
handy when I wanted to zoom in on
something<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.500> was<00:05:22.590> really<00:05:23.040> easy<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.370> do<00:05:23.610> that

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
something it was really easy to do that

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.450 
something it was really easy to do that
right<00:05:24.030> here<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:25.260> con<00:05:25.470> actually<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.190> only

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
right here so the con actually the only

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.550 
right here so the con actually the only
con<00:05:26.639> is<00:05:26.669> also<00:05:27.450> one<00:05:27.660> of<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.840> pros<00:05:28.050> which<00:05:28.290> is<00:05:28.440> the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
con is also one of the pros which is the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.310 
con is also one of the pros which is the
magnifier<00:05:29.040> it<00:05:29.340> is<00:05:29.880> very<00:05:30.300> close<00:05:30.660> to<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.110> click

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
magnifier it is very close to the click

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.320 
magnifier it is very close to the click
button<00:05:31.530> so<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:31.800> could<00:05:32.010> accidentally<00:05:32.729> magnify

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
button so you could accidentally magnify

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.270 
button so you could accidentally magnify
when<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:33.720> didn't<00:05:33.930> mean<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.080> but<00:05:34.919> other<00:05:35.100> than

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
when you didn't mean to but other than

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.580 
when you didn't mean to but other than
that<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:35.490> really<00:05:35.820> liked<00:05:36.000> it<00:05:36.240> I<00:05:36.419> would<00:05:36.990> say<00:05:37.229> the

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
that I really liked it I would say the

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.800 
that I really liked it I would say the
both<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.550> these<00:05:38.729> are<00:05:39.090> something<00:05:39.510> I<00:05:39.570> really

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
both of these are something I really

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.110 
both of these are something I really
enjoyed<00:05:40.410> and<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:41.040> would<00:05:41.340> highly<00:05:41.610> recommend<00:05:41.640> the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
enjoyed and I would highly recommend the

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.210 
enjoyed and I would highly recommend the
price<00:05:42.300> of<00:05:42.479> these<00:05:42.600> together<00:05:43.530> is<00:05:43.830> about<00:05:44.070> a

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
price of these together is about a

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.730 
price of these together is about a
hundred<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:44.880> twenty<00:05:45.150> dollars<00:05:45.300> I<00:05:45.810> think<00:05:46.380> it's

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
hundred and twenty dollars I think it's
