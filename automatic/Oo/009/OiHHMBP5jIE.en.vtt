00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.040 
air pocket excuse me in the front you
can<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:56.969> instead<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.360> carbon<00:00:57.629> fiber<00:00:57.780> plate

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
can see instead of a carbon fiber plate

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.779 
can see instead of a carbon fiber plate
they<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> hard<00:00:58.920> plastic<00:00:59.100> plate<00:00:59.520> in

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
they use a like a hard plastic plate in

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.250 
they use a like a hard plastic plate in
the<00:01:00.120> middle<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.660> probably<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.230> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the middle and it's probably because of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.830 
the middle and it's probably because of
a<00:01:01.850> probably<00:01:02.879> cuts<00:01:03.120> down<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> cost<00:01:03.449> quite<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
a probably cuts down on the cost quite a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.090 
a probably cuts down on the cost quite a
bit<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.080> carbon<00:01:04.379> fire<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:05.010> bit

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
bit because carbon fire is a little bit

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.770 
bit because carbon fire is a little bit
more<00:01:05.220> expensive<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
more expensive and then you can see the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
more expensive and then you can see the
little<00:01:06.990> pocket<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> back<00:01:07.740> there<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
little pocket on the back there with a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.399
