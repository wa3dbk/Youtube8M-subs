00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
to work there is a movement that I do

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.060 
to work there is a movement that I do
well<00:01:03.760> there's<00:01:03.970> a<00:01:04.030> movement<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.360> can<00:01:04.510> do<00:01:05.070> over

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
well there's a movement you can do over

the<00:03:08.200> thing<00:03:08.379> is<00:03:08.409> there's<00:03:09.000> think<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.299> as

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
the thing is there's think of that as

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.960 
the thing is there's think of that as
the<00:03:10.959> base<00:03:11.139> of<00:03:11.349> your<00:03:11.470> fork<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:12.069> then<00:03:12.669> you<00:03:12.819> can

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
the base of your fork and then you can

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.629 
the base of your fork and then you can
sprinkle<00:03:13.389> all<00:03:13.689> these<00:03:13.840> good<00:03:14.169> style<00:03:14.829> moves<00:03:15.159> on

to that okay so so there's a few
different<00:03:19.060> styles<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.599> can<00:03:19.689> use<00:03:20.220> there's<00:03:21.220> CCS

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
different styles you can use there's CCS

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.309 
different styles you can use there's CCS
which<00:03:22.329> are<00:03:22.659> is<00:03:23.280> basically<00:03:24.389> kicking<00:03:25.389> in<00:03:25.629> and
