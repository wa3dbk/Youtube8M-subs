00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.490
 hello youtube friends today we are going to 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.010
 teach how to make a pitcher by 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.759
 comments that have come to us good 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.709
 to need what they will need is going to 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.709
 be a retractable clip 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.640
 that of a friend who sent us a 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.149
 comment the web is the rope of the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.180
 track clip and good a cover and 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:34.220
 cellophane red blue and green 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.530
 well what is it that we are going to first 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.520
 do let's grab our gun 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.090
 silicone and we're going to stick the clip 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.090
 retractable 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.650
 they should tell you a hole so that the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:00.910
 health health yes the next thing that 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.640
 follow is to paste that is to make figures of 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.620
 cellophane regarding the man thrower 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 Spider 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.380
 a blue circle 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.940
 a green rectangle and many squares 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.200
 Red red boxes are optional 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.860
 good what we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.860
 paste 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.860
 the blue cellophane 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.490
 if they have gears like these can 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.180
 put those that are a little smaller 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.080
 so they stay this way and in the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.080
 idea that is mechanical 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.640
 then we paste the green rectangle 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.640
 next to the circle 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.260
 so it should not be left 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.110
 now we go to investment reach to notice 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.110
 because the colors are very dark 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.130
 let's start to paste the squares 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.109
 you have to make sure that the balance 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.590
 tranquil be well insured so that 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.590
 do not fall 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.300
 if they fall, you have to remove them 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.810
 the silicone they had put on because yes 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.810
 does not hit 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.880
 while doing that to make the bracelet 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.330
 we will need more or less 15 centimeters 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.780
 of what he has in his hand 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.280
 so that it covers them as a bracelet 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.670
 elastic 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.340
 of the thicker so they ask for it and the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:18.090
 bits of what is called duty are two 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.650
 one goes here 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.650
 and the other one goes down here 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.420
 A) Yes 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.070
 good since we determine not to be like this and 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.530
 let's cut a piece of cardboard 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.770
 as we have done in several videos 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:40.900
 let's cut out a piece of cardboard 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.680
 chubby to put it back and simulate 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.680
 that exists 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.489
 make sure it is aligned 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.489
 this with this 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:03.690
 now they are going to stick the bracelet what is going to 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.690
 be our bracelet as 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.800
 so now let's make the bracelet 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:22.479
 we have to grab the bit 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.479
 wait and put a little bit 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.490
 when they put it on, we put it 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:30.569
 here 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.150
 at one extreme so that it sticks and stays that way 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:40.250
 as a bracelet we need to put it on 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.250
 another side of the other side of I put it like that 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.129
 since that dog just looks they have to 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.780
 do this 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.720
 and pedal 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.260
 I forgot that the red squares 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.630
 be more or less I propose a 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.330
 centimeter and for those of us 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.100
 they asked how to put the tractive book 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.100
 you have to put it down the lid 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:16.770
 very well after we do the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:19.529
 bracelet we are going to put the launcher 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.889
 let's paste this 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:25.919
 in this way so 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.370
 it is optional to remove this is 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.350
 transparent 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.830
 It is very difficult so they ask for help 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.370
 very good after 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.030
 we put this 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.030
 A) Yes 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:50.020
 and it is ours, this is the web 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:55.199
 which is the retractable clip 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.199
 and to do us a favor 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:02.190
 make comments to make videos 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:05.670
 new subscribe and comment goodbye
