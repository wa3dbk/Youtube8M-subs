now<00:00:13.259> traditionally<00:00:13.860> another<00:00:14.219> question<00:00:14.610> that

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
now traditionally another question that

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.029 
now traditionally another question that
I<00:00:14.790> get<00:00:14.849> asked<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.420> lot<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.900> medium<00:00:16.830> gauge

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
I get asked a lot is medium gauge

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.800 
I get asked a lot is medium gauge
strings<00:00:17.490> versus<00:00:17.970> lighter<00:00:18.180> gauge<00:00:18.480> strings

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
strings versus lighter gauge strings

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.439 
strings versus lighter gauge strings
before<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.230> even<00:00:19.380> go<00:00:19.529> into<00:00:19.710> material<00:00:20.220> why<00:00:21.060> does

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
before we even go into material why does

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.060 
before we even go into material why does
Martin<00:00:21.779> put<00:00:22.199> medium<00:00:22.470> gauge<00:00:22.650> strings<00:00:22.920> on

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
Martin put medium gauge strings on

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
Martin put medium gauge strings on
certain<00:00:23.340> guitars<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.850> why<00:00:24.000> light<00:00:24.510> gauge

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
certain guitars and why light gauge

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.540 
certain guitars and why light gauge
strings<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.080> other<00:00:25.350> guitars<00:00:25.740> well<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.430> goes

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
strings on other guitars well that goes

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.210 
strings on other guitars well that goes
back<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.090> number<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.570> years<00:00:27.930> traditionally<00:00:28.920> our

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
back a number of years traditionally our

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.189 
back a number of years traditionally our
guitars<00:00:29.550> had<00:00:29.820> heavy<00:00:30.210> gauge<00:00:30.480> strings<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.050> them

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
guitars had heavy gauge strings on them

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.069 
guitars had heavy gauge strings on them
and<00:00:31.610> we<00:00:32.610> decided<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.149> put<00:00:33.510> medium<00:00:33.840> gauge

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and we decided to put medium gauge

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.470 
and we decided to put medium gauge
strings<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.680> because<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.670> damage<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.329> was

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
strings on because of damage that was

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.319 
strings on because of damage that was
happening<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> tops<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.239> those

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
happening with the tops so all of those

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.530 
happening with the tops so all of those
guitars<00:00:39.750> from<00:00:40.050> back<00:00:40.260> then<00:00:40.579> d-28<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.910> 18s<00:00:42.329> your

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
guitars from back then d-28 the 18s your

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.030 
guitars from back then d-28 the 18s your
more<00:00:42.690> standard<00:00:43.050> traditional<00:00:43.170> types<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
more standard traditional types of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.220 
more standard traditional types of
guitars<00:00:44.390> still<00:00:45.390> come<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.600> medium<00:00:46.020> gauge

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
guitars still come with medium gauge

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.990 
guitars still come with medium gauge
strings<00:00:46.620> now<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.430> our<00:00:47.550> guitars<00:00:47.850> are

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
strings now all of our guitars are

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.630 
strings now all of our guitars are
braced<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:49.020> medium<00:00:49.410> gauge<00:00:49.620> strings<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
braced for medium gauge strings but you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.060 
braced for medium gauge strings but you
can<00:00:50.850> put<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.300> eight<00:00:51.539> strings<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.260> any<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
can put like eight strings on any of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.680 
can put like eight strings on any of
them<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> other<00:00:53.940> question<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.390> why<00:00:54.629> do

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
them so the other question is why do

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.150 
them so the other question is why do
certain<00:00:54.989> guitars<00:00:55.410> come<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.800> light<00:00:55.949> gauge

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
certain guitars come with light gauge

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.060 
certain guitars come with light gauge
strings<00:00:56.520> well<00:00:56.969> over<00:00:57.539> time<00:00:57.859> styles<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> music

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
strings well over time styles of music

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.279 
strings well over time styles of music
and<00:00:59.520> styles<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.000> play<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.329> changed<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and styles of play have changed so you

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.009 
and styles of play have changed so you
want<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> compensate<00:01:02.340> by<00:01:03.059> using<00:01:03.449> lighter

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
want to compensate by using lighter

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.750 
want to compensate by using lighter
gauge<00:01:04.260> strings<00:01:04.619> lead<00:01:05.070> players<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
gauge strings lead players like a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.340 
gauge strings lead players like a
lighter<00:01:06.000> gauge<00:01:06.210> string<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.840> bending<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
lighter gauge string and for bending and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.830 
lighter gauge string and for bending and
things<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.970> us<00:01:09.090> guitars<00:01:09.630> with

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
things like that so for us guitars with

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.289 
things like that so for us guitars with
cutaways<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.619> smaller<00:01:11.010> instruments<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.180> get

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
cutaways or smaller instruments to get

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
cutaways or smaller instruments to get

there's<00:02:57.690> no<00:02:57.930> sacrifice<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.830> volume<00:02:59.220> but

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
there's no sacrifice in the volume but

there's no sacrifice in the volume but
you<00:02:59.490> get<00:02:59.610> increased<00:03:00.030> flexibility<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:01.380> is
