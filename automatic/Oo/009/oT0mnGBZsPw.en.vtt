 the boy the wolf screamed 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.910
 Once upon a time there was a shepherd boy on the 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.099
 the village of sheep sat on a hillside 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.820
 She was careful and terrible 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.820
 was bored 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.619
 to cheer up a bit 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.830
 he once aired and screamed because of the wolf 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.500
 is behind the sleep more 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.510
 Immediately the villagers came to the hill 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.990
 Run up to help the boy 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.630
 to expel the wolf 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.329
 but when they reached the top they even saw 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.280
 no wolf the boy just laughed 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.280
 view of her angry faces 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.589
 shepherd boy does not scream wolf though 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.870
 no one is there, said the villagers 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.040
 and grumbled up the hill again 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.230
 down 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.980
 after some time the boy screamed 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.230
 again because wolf the wolf is behind the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.510
 sleep more to his mischievous 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.600
 the villagers ran with pleasure 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.299
 back up the hill to help him 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.820
 but when they got to the top and again 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.040
 No wolf found they said sternly 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.350
 Do you cry out in case 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.200
 that really once something had happened 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.720
 not wolf if no one is there but 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.820
 the boy just bordered when he watched them 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.979
 as they angrily descend the hill again 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.979
 went and sat in the grass 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.210
 later in the day, however, saw the boy 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.030
 suddenly like a wolf itself 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.250
 struck his herd to stalked immediately 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.150
 on his feet and screamed so alarmingly 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.150
 louder could 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.930
 the villagers 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.140
 but thought he would give them one again 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.229
 wanted to play a trick and did not come 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.150
 in the evening at sunset wondering 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.520
 Why is not the boy boy? 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.860
 So they went back to the village 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.690
 up the hill to look for him 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.690
 they found him crying 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.679
 It was really a wolf here 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.179
 Flock of sheep has run away and now 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.760
 scattered everywhere 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.480
 I called wolf, why are you ? 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.480
 did not come 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.690
 An old man tried to catch the boy 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.620
 comfort you as down to the village 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.920
 went back 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.890
 We will help you to get the sheep in the morning 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.590
 but find you notice a liar 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.430
 you do not believe it even if he then the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.060
 truth speaks 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.060
 The End
