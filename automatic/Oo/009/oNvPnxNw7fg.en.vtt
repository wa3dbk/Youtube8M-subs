00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.360
 massive cult all at least once in life 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.660

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 and also easier to express your emotions 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.320
 it seems that you finally merged 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.090
 Internet party from nothing millions 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.399

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.830
 constantly after the sentence many up 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.650
 almost everyone puts brackets okay if 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.500
 it is both brackets that is like this but it happens 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.439
 even so the amount is due 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.110
 why do you need it or is it a problem 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.100
 the Internet gives a phrase with interruptions 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:29.700

 mean smiles if a lot of brackets 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.530
 then a man like that laughs fun to him 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.439

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.250

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.109
 Russian speaking people 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.470
 let's remember the internet in Russia 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:15.129
 appeared in the early 90s just 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.590
 after the collapse of the ussr already in those years were 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.760
 users who wrote brackets in 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.780
 your posts 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.959
 but they were all Russian-speaking 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.569
 remember 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.639
 have you ever seen foreigners who 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.790
 writes you a message with brackets 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:34.449
 if so then you are very lucky you 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.150
 stumbled upon a soviet spy the plan was 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.650
 developed by the leaders of the USSR to 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.159
 identify your people in different 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.459
 spheres on the Internet, they are the first to start 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.510

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.090
 could suspect 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.120
 Then today, foreigners have become 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.280
 notice that something is wrong on the forums until 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.760
 Discussion threads are still being created 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.769
