important rules for making tea the next

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.040 
important rules for making tea the next
rule<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:24.070> quality<00:02:24.460> of<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.640> water<00:02:25.020> when<00:02:26.020> I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
rule is the quality of the water when I

I've<00:02:28.210> used<00:02:28.450> previously<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.110> put<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.410> fresh

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
I've used previously and put in fresh

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.130 
I've used previously and put in fresh
cold<00:02:30.070> water<00:02:30.130> out<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.670> tap<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.630> reason<00:02:32.050> I

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
cold water out of the tap the reason I

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.800 
cold water out of the tap the reason I
do<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.650> because<00:02:33.450> fresh<00:02:34.450> cold<00:02:34.750> water

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
do that is because fresh cold water

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.140 
do that is because fresh cold water
contains<00:02:35.380> more<00:02:35.710> dissolved<00:02:36.220> oxygen<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.760> it's

contains more dissolved oxygen and it's

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.700 
contains more dissolved oxygen and it's
the<00:02:37.270> dissolved<00:02:37.810> oxygen<00:02:37.960> in<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.350> water<00:02:38.500> that

the dissolved oxygen in the water that

gets the flavor off the tea leaf if you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.040 
gets the flavor off the tea leaf if you
re<00:02:41.560> boil<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.950> kettle<00:02:42.070> four<00:02:42.370> or<00:02:42.460> five<00:02:42.640> times

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
water has less dissolved oxygen you

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.150 
water has less dissolved oxygen you
won't<00:02:50.080> get<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.320> full<00:02:50.500> flavor<00:02:50.530> out<00:02:50.920> you'll<00:02:51.070> get

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.080 
a flat double boring cup of tea so it's

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
of temperature out of the water that

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.800 
of temperature out of the water that
water<00:03:18.580> temperature<00:03:18.760> falls<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.660> don't

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
water temperature falls and you don't

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.760 
water temperature falls and you don't
get<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:19.989> full<00:03:20.230> brew<00:03:20.620> out<00:03:21.130> of<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.820> tea<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:23.680> a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
get a full brew out of the tea just a

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.080 
get a full brew out of the tea just a
bit<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.010> water<00:03:24.130> in<00:03:24.250> there<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.730> bottom<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
bit of water in there in the bottom of

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.990 
bit of water in there in the bottom of
the<00:03:25.180> tea<00:03:25.330> pot<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:26.370> I'm<00:03:27.370> going<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.670> pick<00:03:27.880> the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
the tea pot and I'm going to pick the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.760 
the tea pot and I'm going to pick the
tea<00:03:28.150> pot<00:03:28.330> up<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.690> give<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:29.500> just<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.739> little

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
tea pot up and give it just a little

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.490 
tea pot up and give it just a little
swirl<00:03:30.280> around<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.030> warms<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.110> whole<00:03:32.350> of

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
swirl around so it warms the whole of

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.979 
swirl around so it warms the whole of
the<00:03:32.560> pot<00:03:32.770> and<00:03:33.780> then<00:03:34.780> tip<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.670> away<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.720> now

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
the pot and then tip that away so now

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.110 
the pot and then tip that away so now
that<00:03:38.050> tea<00:03:38.530> pots<00:03:38.739> are<00:03:38.890> warm<00:03:39.070> obviously<00:03:39.820> what<00:03:40.000> we

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
that tea pots are warm obviously what we

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.410 
that tea pots are warm obviously what we
need<00:03:40.330> is<00:03:40.920> some<00:03:41.920> tea<00:03:42.130> if<00:03:42.820> you're<00:03:43.000> using<00:03:43.150> loose

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
need is some tea if you're using loose

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.270 
need is some tea if you're using loose
leaf<00:03:43.630> tea<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.050> old<00:03:44.410> rule<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:44.800> this<00:03:45.040> one

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
leaf tea the old rule is this one

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.150 
leaf tea the old rule is this one
teaspoonful<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.180> tea<00:03:46.360> per<00:03:47.320> person<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.920> one

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
teaspoonful of tea per person and one

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.610 
teaspoonful of tea per person and one
for<00:03:48.520> the<00:03:48.730> pot<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:49.989> teapot<00:03:50.320> is<00:03:50.440> going<00:03:50.560> to

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
for the pot so this teapot is going to

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.850 
for the pot so this teapot is going to
make<00:03:50.739> tea<00:03:51.520> for<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.360> five<00:03:52.570> of<00:03:52.720> us<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.410> I'm<00:03:53.709> going

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
make tea for the five of us so I'm going

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.040 
make tea for the five of us so I'm going
to<00:03:53.890> put<00:03:54.070> six<00:03:54.580> spoonfuls<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.239> tea<00:03:55.630> into<00:03:55.959> this

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
to put six spoonfuls of tea into this

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
to put six spoonfuls of tea into this
pot<00:03:56.320> but<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:56.980> just<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.280> starting<00:03:57.640> point

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
pot but that is just a starting point

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.380 
pot but that is just a starting point
the<00:04:00.070> amount<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.489> tea<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.120> amount<00:04:01.330> of

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
the amount of tea and the amount of

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.360 
the amount of tea and the amount of
water<00:04:01.600> or<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.900> ratio<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.320> tea<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.830> water<00:04:03.040> is

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
water or the ratio of tea to water is

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.420 
water or the ratio of tea to water is
what<00:04:04.350> changes<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.410> intensity<00:04:05.980> of<00:04:06.250> what<00:04:06.400> I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
what changes the intensity of what I

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.800 
what changes the intensity of what I
would<00:04:06.550> call<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.970> flavor<00:04:07.209> what<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.690> would

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
would call the flavor what you would

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.259 
would call the flavor what you would
call<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.110> strength<00:04:08.440> of<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.800> tea<00:04:08.980> if<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:10.000> want

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
call the strength of the tea if you want

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.120 
call the strength of the tea if you want
more<00:04:10.959> intensity<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.650> flavor<00:04:11.769> or<00:04:11.980> more

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
more intensity of flavor or more

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.430 
more intensity of flavor or more
strength<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.459> use<00:04:12.790> more<00:04:13.030> tea<00:04:13.269> if<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:14.080> want

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
strength you use more tea if you want

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.650 
strength you use more tea if you want
the<00:04:14.590> less<00:04:14.739> of<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.340> would<00:04:15.519> obviously<00:04:15.940> put

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
the less of that you would obviously put

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.800 
the less of that you would obviously put
one<00:04:16.840> spoonful<00:04:17.290> less<00:04:17.850> it's<00:04:18.850> like<00:04:19.120> using<00:04:19.419> a

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
one spoonful less it's like using a

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.390 
one spoonful less it's like using a
cordial<00:04:20.169> in<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.440> glass<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.799> water<00:04:20.979> if<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.250> just

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
cordial in a glass of water if you just

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.300 
cordial in a glass of water if you just
put<00:04:21.549> a<00:04:21.580> tiny<00:04:21.880> drop<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.210> cordial<00:04:22.690> in

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
put a tiny drop of cordial in

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.220 
put a tiny drop of cordial in
glass<00:04:23.520> then<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.120> guess<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.330> hint<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.960> if<00:04:25.110> you

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
glass then you guess a hint of it if you

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.480 
glass then you guess a hint of it if you
put<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.440> cover<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.830> bottom<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.370> glass

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
put it cover the bottom of the glass

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.170 
put it cover the bottom of the glass
quite<00:04:26.760> well

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
quite well

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.520 
quite well
and<00:04:27.540> add<00:04:27.690> water<00:04:27.870> then<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.200> get<00:04:28.350> much<00:04:28.500> more

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
and add water then you get much more

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.200 
and add water then you get much more
intensity<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.400> flavor<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:29.700> it's<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.000> same

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
intensity of flavor so it's the same

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.760 
intensity of flavor so it's the same
thing<00:04:30.450> with<00:04:30.540> tedium<00:04:30.960> additi<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.560> amount

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
thing with tedium additi in the amount

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.720 
thing with tedium additi in the amount
of<00:04:31.830> water<00:04:32.150> varies<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.570> intensity<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.550> all<00:04:35.550> the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
of water varies the intensity of all the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.659 
of water varies the intensity of all the
strength<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.840> tea<00:04:37.190> tea<00:04:38.190> bags<00:04:38.430> were

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
strength of the tea tea bags were

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.420 
strength of the tea tea bags were
obviously<00:04:39.300> designed<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.930> make<00:04:40.830> a<00:04:40.860> cup<00:04:41.160> or<00:04:41.280> a

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
obviously designed to make a cup or a

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.260 
obviously designed to make a cup or a
mugful<00:04:42.050> personally<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.200> if<00:04:44.130> I'm<00:04:44.340> making
