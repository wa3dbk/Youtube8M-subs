00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
about a minute and you can see how nice

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.979 
about a minute and you can see how nice
that<00:02:25.680> looks<00:02:25.950> underneath<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.060> all<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.870> bad

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
that looks underneath the all the bad

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.920 
that looks underneath the all the bad
clear<00:02:28.319> coat<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.510> obviously<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.569> got<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.750> scrape

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
clear coat so obviously I got to scrape

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.589 
clear coat so obviously I got to scrape
the<00:02:31.110> other<00:02:31.200> ones<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.769> then<00:02:32.269> clean<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.420> up<00:02:33.510> and

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
the other ones and then clean it up and

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.640 
the other ones and then clean it up and
do<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.720> final<00:02:33.930> cleanup<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.670> here's<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
do the final cleanup and here's the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.020 
do the final cleanup and here's the
first<00:02:37.650> two<00:02:37.799> hubcaps<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.549> see<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> paint

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
first two hubcaps you can see the paint

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.339 
first two hubcaps you can see the paint
has<00:02:39.269> pretty<00:02:39.450> much<00:02:39.599> turned<00:02:39.840> into<00:02:39.930> sludge

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
has pretty much turned into sludge

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.890 
has pretty much turned into sludge
although<00:02:40.739> they<00:02:40.890> made<00:02:41.069> in<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.489> need<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.660> hit<00:02:42.780> them

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
although they made in I need to hit them

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.500 
although they made in I need to hit them
just<00:02:43.109> a<00:02:43.200> little<00:02:43.230> longer<00:02:43.650> with<00:02:44.040> thee<00:02:46.970> okay<00:02:47.970> I'm

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
just a little longer with thee okay I'm

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.390 
just a little longer with thee okay I'm
just<00:02:49.049> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.290> finish<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.650> up<00:02:49.799> here<00:02:50.130> lost

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
just going to finish this up here lost

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.520 
just going to finish this up here lost
power<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.239> other<00:02:51.450> camera<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.350> have<00:02:52.440> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
power to the other camera so we have to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.270 
power to the other camera so we have to
plug<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.859> in<00:02:53.480> as<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.599> can<00:02:54.720> see<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.230> just<00:02:55.889> need

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
plug that in as you can see I just need

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.559 
plug that in as you can see I just need
to<00:02:57.260> scrape<00:02:58.260> these<00:02:58.500> some<00:02:58.769> more<00:02:58.950> maybe<00:02:59.609> let<00:03:00.420> them

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
to scrape these some more maybe let them

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.660 
to scrape these some more maybe let them
soak<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:01.019> little<00:03:01.049> longer<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.859> some<00:03:02.190> more<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.489> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
soak a little longer in some more of the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.000 
soak a little longer in some more of the
paint<00:03:03.329> stripper<00:03:03.569> but<00:03:04.530> these<00:03:04.739> are<00:03:04.829> going<00:03:04.950> to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
paint stripper but these are going to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.570 
paint stripper but these are going to
come<00:03:05.130> clean<00:03:05.430> and

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
come clean and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
come clean and
we'll<00:03:06.700> paint<00:03:07.360> them<00:03:08.400> same<00:03:09.400> here<00:03:09.730> with<00:03:10.480> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
we'll paint them same here with the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.970 
we'll paint them same here with the
wheels<00:03:10.780> once<00:03:11.050> they're<00:03:11.200> cleaned<00:03:11.620> up<00:03:11.770> I'll

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
wheels once they're cleaned up I'll

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.870 
wheels once they're cleaned up I'll
paint<00:03:12.550> them<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.850> got<00:03:12.970> some<00:03:13.920> rust-oleum<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.670> think

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
paint them I got some rust-oleum I think

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.960 
paint them I got some rust-oleum I think
hammered<00:03:16.360> finish<00:03:16.600> paint<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.800> mean<00:03:18.550> this<00:03:18.700> wheel

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
hammered finish paint I mean this wheel

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.430 
hammered finish paint I mean this wheel
itself<00:03:19.330> looks<00:03:19.630> alright<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:19.960> some<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.320> them

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
itself looks alright but some of them

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.110 
itself looks alright but some of them
are<00:03:20.500> really<00:03:21.070> kind<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.400> beat-up<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.820> I<00:03:21.940> think

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
are really kind of beat-up and I think

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.260 
are really kind of beat-up and I think
the<00:03:22.270> hammered<00:03:23.020> paint<00:03:23.260> would<00:03:24.090> look<00:03:25.090> pretty

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
the hammered paint would look pretty

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:32.120 
the hammered paint would look pretty
good<00:03:25.450> on<00:03:25.540> them<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.910> that's<00:03:28.060> all<00:03:28.210> for<00:03:28.390> now

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130

see<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.350> got<00:03:56.530> them<00:03:56.680> stripped<00:03:57.010> off<00:03:57.990> after<00:03:58.990> that<00:03:59.230> I

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
see I got them stripped off after that I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.120 
see I got them stripped off after that I
washed<00:04:01.360> them<00:04:01.570> down<00:04:01.810> with<00:04:01.990> degreaser<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:02.860> then

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
washed them down with degreaser and then

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.240 
washed them down with degreaser and then
pulled<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.670> wheel<00:04:03.970> blades<00:04:04.330> because<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:05.250> mean

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
pulled the wheel blades because I mean

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.970 
pulled the wheel blades because I mean
obviously<00:04:06.370> I'm<00:04:06.730> not<00:04:06.850> going<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.890> driving<00:04:08.890> on

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
obviously I'm not going to be driving on

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.810 
obviously I'm not going to be driving on
these<00:04:09.100> wheels<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.730> though<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:10.739> rebalanced

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
these wheels and though the rebalanced

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.699 
these wheels and though the rebalanced
once<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:13.150> have<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:15.959> snow<00:04:16.959> tires<00:04:17.230> ready<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.620> go

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
once I have the snow tires ready to go

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.360 
once I have the snow tires ready to go
on<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:20.290> course<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.590> have<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.709> get<00:04:20.890> snow<00:04:21.130> tires

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
on of course I have to get snow tires

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.450 
on of course I have to get snow tires
first<00:04:21.609> as<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:23.590> can<00:04:23.710> see<00:04:23.830> then<00:04:23.980> once<00:04:24.190> they<00:04:24.400> were

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
first as you can see then once they were

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.360 
first as you can see then once they were
all<00:04:24.940> cleaned<00:04:25.270> up<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.570> dry<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:26.140> primed<00:04:26.710> them<00:04:26.950> and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
all cleaned up and dry I primed them and

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.710 
all cleaned up and dry I primed them and
even<00:04:28.060> just<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.480> primer<00:04:29.250> looks<00:04:30.270> loads<00:04:31.270> better

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
even just the primer looks loads better

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.520 
even just the primer looks loads better
grass<00:04:32.790> also<00:04:33.790> took<00:04:33.970> quite<00:04:34.300> a<00:04:34.360> while<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.840> mask

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
grass also took quite a while to a mask

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.370 
grass also took quite a while to a mask
off<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.830> wheels<00:04:36.220> but<00:04:36.660> another<00:04:37.660> primed<00:04:38.050> and

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
off the wheels but another primed and

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.200 
off the wheels but another primed and
the<00:04:38.530> is<00:04:39.220> a<00:04:39.280> self<00:04:39.730> etching<00:04:40.000> primer<00:04:40.570> here

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.490 

figured<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:45.930> might<00:04:46.520> be<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.550> little<00:04:47.700> tougher

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
figured it might be a little tougher

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.960 
figured it might be a little tougher
than<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:51.980> than<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.010> standard<00:04:53.520> primer<00:04:54.200> and

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
than the than the standard primer and

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.760 
than the than the standard primer and
here<00:04:56.970> is<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.300> paint<00:04:57.540> but<00:04:58.080> I'm<00:04:58.170> about<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.530> spray

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
here is the paint but I'm about to spray

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.070 
here is the paint but I'm about to spray
on<00:04:58.920> it

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
on it

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.960 
on it
the<00:05:01.080> rust-oleum<00:05:01.560> hammered<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.400> figured<00:05:02.790> that

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
the rust-oleum hammered I figured that

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.360 
the rust-oleum hammered I figured that
the<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:04.260> hammered<00:05:04.650> finish<00:05:04.830> which<00:05:05.190> is

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
the the hammered finish which is

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.710 
the the hammered finish which is
actually<00:05:05.700> supposed<00:05:06.000> to<00:05:06.090> look<00:05:06.210> just<00:05:06.450> like<00:05:06.660> it

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
actually supposed to look just like it

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.400 
actually supposed to look just like it
does<00:05:06.990> on<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.230> cap<00:05:07.470> here<00:05:07.740> we'll<00:05:08.130> find<00:05:08.310> out<00:05:08.550> soon

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
does on the cap here we'll find out soon

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.170 
does on the cap here we'll find out soon
figure<00:05:10.950> that<00:05:11.100> might<00:05:11.280> hide<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:12.000> little

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
figure that might hide the little

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.770 
figure that might hide the little
imperfections<00:05:13.280> that<00:05:14.280> still<00:05:14.630> exist<00:05:15.630> in<00:05:15.720> the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
imperfections that still exist in the

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.530 
imperfections that still exist in the
wheels<00:05:15.990> but<00:05:16.670> right<00:05:17.670> now<00:05:17.820> I'm<00:05:18.060> actually<00:05:18.210> very

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
wheels but right now I'm actually very

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.330 
wheels but right now I'm actually very
very<00:05:18.720> happy<00:05:19.140> with<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:21.800> too<00:05:22.800> bad<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.100> primer

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
very happy with the too bad the primer

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.420 
very happy with the too bad the primer
isn't<00:05:24.180> really<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.390> topcoat<00:05:24.870> and<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:25.200> could

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
isn't really a topcoat and I could

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.400 
isn't really a topcoat and I could
certainly<00:05:26.430> deal<00:05:26.940> with<00:05:27.180> this<00:05:30.020> with<00:05:31.020> this<00:05:31.170> matte

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
certainly deal with this with this matte

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.650 
certainly deal with this with this matte
gray<00:05:31.710> look<00:05:31.980> so<00:05:32.370> I'm<00:05:33.030> going<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.240> spray<00:05:33.480> these

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
gray look so I'm going to spray these

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.020 
gray look so I'm going to spray these
down<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.200> then<00:05:34.640> show<00:05:35.640> you<00:05:35.670> what<00:05:35.820> they<00:05:35.910> look

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
down and then show you what they look

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.710 
down and then show you what they look
like

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.540 

well<00:05:41.720> that<00:05:42.380> didn't<00:05:42.650> take<00:05:42.830> too<00:05:43.039> long<00:05:43.220> I

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
well that didn't take too long I

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.090 
well that didn't take too long I
actually<00:05:44.000> have<00:05:44.449> two<00:05:44.810> coats<00:05:45.110> on<00:05:45.500> these<00:05:45.860> wheels

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
actually have two coats on these wheels

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.450 
actually have two coats on these wheels
now<00:05:46.400> and<00:05:46.699> I<00:05:49.300> am<00:05:50.410> very<00:05:51.410> very<00:05:51.770> happy<00:05:51.949> with<00:05:52.250> how

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
now and I am very very happy with how

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.839 
now and I am very very happy with how
they<00:05:52.580> turned<00:05:52.610> out<00:05:53.000> I<00:05:53.800> mean<00:05:54.800> just<00:05:57.610> with<00:05:58.610> just

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
they turned out I mean just with just

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.850 
they turned out I mean just with just
some<00:05:59.000> cleanup<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.539> some<00:06:01.120> and<00:06:02.120> less<00:06:03.050> than<00:06:03.229> $10

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
some cleanup and some and less than $10

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.800 
some cleanup and some and less than $10
worth<00:06:04.130> of<00:06:04.370> primer<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.569> paint<00:06:05.930> I<00:06:06.349> mean<00:06:06.710> these

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
worth of primer and paint I mean these

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.050 
worth of primer and paint I mean these
$40<00:06:08.810> wheels<00:06:09.199> look<00:06:09.620> amazing<00:06:10.099> so<00:06:12.729> you<00:06:13.729> can<00:06:13.849> still

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
$40 wheels look amazing so you can still

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.580 
$40 wheels look amazing so you can still
see<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:15.070> the<00:06:16.070> damage<00:06:16.490> here<00:06:17.320> but<00:06:18.320> I<00:06:18.349> think<00:06:18.500> it's

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
see the the damage here but I think it's

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.670 
see the the damage here but I think it's
far<00:06:18.830> less<00:06:18.860> obvious<00:06:20.259> especially<00:06:21.259> when<00:06:21.530> you<00:06:21.590> get

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
far less obvious especially when you get

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.320 
far less obvious especially when you get
back<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:22.009> about<00:06:22.160> this<00:06:22.370> distance<00:06:22.900> and<00:06:24.729> I<00:06:25.729> mean

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
back to about this distance and I mean

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.969 
back to about this distance and I mean
the<00:06:26.389> point<00:06:26.599> isn't<00:06:26.810> even<00:06:27.110> frillier<00:06:27.440> really<00:06:27.830> for

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
the point isn't even frillier really for

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.310 
the point isn't even frillier really for
these<00:06:28.039> to<00:06:28.220> look<00:06:28.370> good<00:06:28.580> it's<00:06:28.729> just<00:06:29.229> to<00:06:30.229> have

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
these to look good it's just to have

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.020 
these to look good it's just to have
something<00:06:30.620> to<00:06:30.740> upon<00:06:31.130> which<00:06:31.340> to<00:06:31.550> mount<00:06:31.669> snow

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
something to upon which to mount snow

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.420 
something to upon which to mount snow
tires<00:06:32.740> but<00:06:33.740> these<00:06:33.919> are<00:06:34.039> going<00:06:34.130> to<00:06:34.190> look<00:06:34.280> pretty

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
tires but these are going to look pretty

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.820 
tires but these are going to look pretty
good<00:06:34.580> anyway

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
good anyway

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.010 
good anyway
in<00:06:37.310> fact<00:06:37.520> I'm<00:06:37.699> liking<00:06:38.060> these<00:06:38.210> so<00:06:38.479> much<00:06:38.690> now<00:06:38.930> I'm

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
in fact I'm liking these so much now I'm

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.779 
in fact I'm liking these so much now I'm
thinking<00:06:39.349> about<00:06:39.440> getting<00:06:40.069> another<00:06:40.400> set<00:06:40.699> of

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
thinking about getting another set of

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:48.790 
thinking about getting another set of
forests<00:06:41.120> or<00:06:41.830> 15-4<00:06:44.860> just<00:06:45.860> for<00:06:47.800> year-round

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
forests or 15-4 just for year-round

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.300 
forests or 15-4 just for year-round
driving<00:06:51.099> of<00:06:52.099> course<00:06:52.370> then<00:06:52.669> that<00:06:52.970> would<00:06:53.090> mean

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
driving of course then that would mean

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.339 
driving of course then that would mean
it'd<00:06:55.310> be<00:06:55.460> kind<00:06:55.759> of<00:06:55.880> a<00:06:56.090> waste<00:06:56.630> of<00:06:56.870> the<00:06:57.849> 14s<00:06:59.349> the

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349 
it'd be kind of a waste of the 14s the

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:04.840 
it'd be kind of a waste of the 14s the
tires<00:07:00.530> of<00:07:00.710> this<00:07:00.830> bought<00:07:00.979> a<00:07:01.009> few<00:07:01.130> months<00:07:01.370> ago<00:07:01.490> so

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.910 

anyhow<00:07:05.660> that's<00:07:06.110> how<00:07:06.350> this<00:07:06.470> turned<00:07:06.770> out

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
anyhow that's how this turned out

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.880 
anyhow that's how this turned out
obviously<00:07:07.490> tomorrow<00:07:08.230> I'm<00:07:09.230> going<00:07:09.350> to<00:07:09.410> take<00:07:09.650> the

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
obviously tomorrow I'm going to take the

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.840 
obviously tomorrow I'm going to take the
the<00:07:09.920> paper<00:07:10.730> and<00:07:10.970> the<00:07:11.060> tape<00:07:11.240> off<00:07:11.450> and<00:07:12.700> I<00:07:13.700> may

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
the paper and the tape off and I may

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.700 
the paper and the tape off and I may
even<00:07:14.090> do<00:07:14.360> a<00:07:14.390> test-fit<00:07:14.960> of<00:07:15.020> these<00:07:15.230> just<00:07:15.530> to<00:07:15.620> make

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
even do a test-fit of these just to make

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.840 
even do a test-fit of these just to make
sure<00:07:16.010> that<00:07:16.250> they<00:07:16.430> fit<00:07:16.910> on<00:07:16.940> the<00:07:17.150> car<00:07:18.550> but<00:07:19.550> I

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
sure that they fit on the car but I

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.250 
sure that they fit on the car but I
believe<00:07:20.150> there<00:07:20.300> shouldn't<00:07:20.540> be<00:07:20.630> any<00:07:20.870> problem

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
believe there shouldn't be any problem

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:27.430 
believe there shouldn't be any problem
with<00:07:21.380> that<00:07:22.240> so<00:07:23.710> that's<00:07:24.710> all<00:07:25.100> for<00:07:25.310> you
