00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
another bicycle and they got 27 years

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.499 
another bicycle and they got 27 years
out<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.320> bicycle<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.240> again<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.360> still

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
a good bicycle and I think we could

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.740 
a good bicycle and I think we could
rejuvenate<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.180> want<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> spend

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
rejuvenate it but do they want to spend

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.319 
rejuvenate it but do they want to spend
that<00:01:27.840> kind<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.140> money<00:01:28.220> I'm<00:01:29.220> hitting<00:01:29.970> his<00:01:30.119> seat

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that kind of money I'm hitting his seat

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.160 
that kind of money I'm hitting his seat

a<00:03:14.450> little<00:03:14.660> bit<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.900> love<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.350> I<00:03:15.380> think<00:03:15.620> this

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
a little bit of love and I think this

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.120 
a little bit of love and I think this
thing<00:03:15.950> might<00:03:16.100> come<00:03:16.130> back<00:03:16.460> to<00:03:16.520> shape<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:18.010> think<00:03:19.010> I

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
thing might come back to shape I think I

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.130 
thing might come back to shape I think I
might<00:03:19.340> put<00:03:19.520> them<00:03:19.670> up<00:03:19.820> for<00:03:20.300> where<00:03:20.480> we<00:03:20.630> are<00:03:20.660> and

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
might put them up for where we are and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.660 
might put them up for where we are and
the<00:03:21.440> type<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.800> riding<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.310> think<00:03:22.520> this

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
the type of riding and I think this

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.250 
the type of riding and I think this
these<00:03:23.060> people<00:03:23.270> are<00:03:23.510> going<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.690> be<00:03:23.810> doing<00:03:24.110> which

is<00:03:24.290> Recreation<00:03:25.010> leisure<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.580> think<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:26.630> would

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
is Recreation leisure I think I would

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.180 
is Recreation leisure I think I would
put<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.080> money<00:03:27.110> into<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:27.680> when<00:03:27.890> this<00:03:28.040> one
