it doesn't do damage and there's many

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.610 
it doesn't do damage and there's many
different<00:03:06.370> kinds<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:06.849> got<00:03:07.000> auric<00:03:07.620> acid

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
different kinds you got auric acid

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.680 
different kinds you got auric acid
lactic<00:03:08.859> acid<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.579> carbonic<00:03:10.060> acid<00:03:10.390> those<00:03:10.540> are

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
lactic acid and carbonic acid those are

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.380 
lactic acid and carbonic acid those are
the<00:03:10.780> basic<00:03:11.200> ones<00:03:11.470> we<00:03:11.650> know<00:03:11.829> but<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.609> becomes

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
the basic ones we know but that becomes

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.500 
the basic ones we know but that becomes
a<00:03:13.629> cumulation<00:03:14.170> because<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.769> started<00:03:15.280> from<00:03:15.549> day

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
a cumulation because it started from day

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.860 
a cumulation because it started from day
one<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.079> it<00:03:17.200> built<00:03:17.440> up<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.940> the

one and it built up and this is the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.720 
one and it built up and this is the
manifestation<00:03:20.379> of<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.579> disease<00:03:22.799> this<00:03:23.799> eve<00:03:24.250> and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
manifestation of a disease this eve and

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.199 
manifestation of a disease this eve and
that's<00:03:25.030> how<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.420> versus<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:27.549> is<00:03:27.579> not<00:03:27.819> a<00:03:27.849> spur

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
that's how you versus this is not a spur

tunity doctors anything we just

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.069 
tunity doctors anything we just
eliminate<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.400> acid<00:03:30.910> bring<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.750> body<00:03:31.959> to

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
eliminate the acid bring the body to

water accordingly to make it the texture
of<00:04:48.720> grits<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:51.240> now<00:04:51.390> we're<00:04:51.600> trying<00:04:52.640> for<00:04:55.430> please

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
of grits so now we're trying for please

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.150 
of grits so now we're trying for please
let<00:04:56.880> go<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.210> sugar<00:04:57.480> it<00:04:58.170> all<00:04:58.350> this<00:04:58.650> food<00:04:58.950> is

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
let go the sugar it all this food is

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.150 
let go the sugar it all this food is
just<00:04:59.400> an<00:04:59.580> addiction<00:05:00.570> but<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.170> kind<00:05:01.470> of<00:05:01.620> damage

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
just an addiction but the kind of damage

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.810 
just an addiction but the kind of damage
it<00:05:02.480> attacks<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:04.140> nerve<00:05:04.380> that's<00:05:04.860> why<00:05:05.190> we're

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
it attacks the nerve that's why we're

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.270 
it attacks the nerve that's why we're
Restless<00:05:06.570> even<00:05:06.780> Restless<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.740> brain<00:05:08.010> and
