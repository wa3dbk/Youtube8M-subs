00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.600 
going to hold my knife at an angle
sometimes<00:01:33.660> it'll<00:01:34.050> be<00:01:34.110> called<00:01:34.320> give<00:01:35.160> it<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.310> bias

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
sometimes it'll be called give it a bias

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.730 
sometimes it'll be called give it a bias
cut<00:01:36.210> I'm<00:01:36.570> gonna<00:01:36.750> take<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:37.380> strips

cut I'm gonna take one of these strips

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.500 
cut I'm gonna take one of these strips
and<00:01:38.040> turn<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> where<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.150> perpendicular

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
and turn it to where it's perpendicular

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.080 
and turn it to where it's perpendicular
to<00:01:39.870> my<00:01:40.110> knife<00:01:40.350> I'm<00:01:40.920> gonna<00:01:41.100> hold<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> knife<00:01:41.640> at

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
a little bit of an angle or a bias and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.400 
a little bit of an angle or a bias and
I'm<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.760> go<00:01:45.000> ahead<00:01:45.120> and<00:01:45.360> cut<00:01:45.540> off<00:01:45.690> that

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
I'm gonna go ahead and cut off that

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.500 
I'm gonna go ahead and cut off that
corner<00:01:46.890> right<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:48.060> I'm<00:01:48.180> gonna<00:01:48.270> move

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
corner right there then I'm gonna move

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.960 
corner right there then I'm gonna move
on<00:01:48.720> over<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.590> my<00:01:49.800> thumb<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> back<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
on over I have my thumb at the back of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.680 
on over I have my thumb at the back of
my<00:01:51.510> Strip<00:01:51.870> fingertips<00:01:52.650> curled<00:01:52.979> underneath

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
my Strip fingertips curled underneath

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.020 
my Strip fingertips curled underneath
and<00:01:54.690> then<00:01:54.870> basically<00:01:55.320> start<00:01:55.620> to<00:01:55.800> make<00:01:56.030> some

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and then basically start to make some

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.960 
and then basically start to make some
parallel<00:01:57.540> cuts<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.440> this<00:01:58.760> making<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.850> little

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
parallel cuts like this making a little

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.030
