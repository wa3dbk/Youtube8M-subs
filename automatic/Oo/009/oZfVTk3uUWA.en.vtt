the tail

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.660 
the tail
there's<00:02:14.140> appears<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> badge<00:02:15.220> missing

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
there's appears to be a badge missing

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.790 
there's appears to be a badge missing
actually<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:16.240> believe<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.080> shouldn't<00:02:17.320> say<00:02:17.410> GT

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
actually I believe it shouldn't say GT

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.570 
actually I believe it shouldn't say GT
five<00:02:18.160> or<00:02:18.850> at<00:02:19.030> least<00:02:19.270> GT<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.740> wonder<00:02:21.520> if

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
five or at least GT but I wonder if

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.830 
five or at least GT but I wonder if
someone's<00:02:21.880> gone<00:02:22.030> past<00:02:22.330> with<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.600> screwdriver

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
someone's gone past with the screwdriver

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.440 
someone's gone past with the screwdriver
or<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.830> owner<00:02:24.010> himself<00:02:24.220> has<00:02:24.610> taken<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.030> off<00:02:25.150> I

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
or the owner himself has taken it off I

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.360 
or the owner himself has taken it off I
hope<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.500> case<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:27.070> it<00:02:27.130> looks<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.340> be

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
hope that's the case but it looks to be

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.000 
hope that's the case but it looks to be
