aquatic swim tips today we're going to

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.410 
aquatic swim tips today we're going to
be<00:00:04.589> talking<00:00:04.830> about<00:00:05.040> eggbeater<00:00:05.700> kick<00:00:05.790> the

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
be talking about eggbeater kick the

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.940 
be talking about eggbeater kick the
first<00:00:06.779> thing<00:00:06.990> we're<00:00:07.109> going<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.290> do<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.740> have

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
first thing we're going to do is have

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.310 
first thing we're going to do is have
SAP<00:00:08.280> demonstrate<00:00:09.120> eggbeater<00:00:09.719> kick<00:00:09.780> for<00:00:10.200> us

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
SAP demonstrate eggbeater kick for us

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.270 
SAP demonstrate eggbeater kick for us
here<00:00:11.040> we<00:00:11.130> go

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.790 

right<00:00:13.850> so<00:00:14.150> what<00:00:14.510> we<00:00:14.630> can<00:00:14.840> see<00:00:15.050> from<00:00:15.290> Zach's

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
right so what we can see from Zach's

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.750 
right so what we can see from Zach's
eggbeater<00:00:16.129> kick<00:00:16.190> is<00:00:16.550> is<00:00:16.700> feet<00:00:16.970> are<00:00:17.150> flexed<00:00:17.600> his

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
eggbeater kick is is feet are flexed his

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.500 
eggbeater kick is is feet are flexed his
knees<00:00:19.760> are<00:00:20.150> up<00:00:21.130> his<00:00:22.130> feet<00:00:22.520> are<00:00:22.760> moving<00:00:22.880> one<00:00:23.360> at

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
knees are up his feet are moving one at

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.410 
knees are up his feet are moving one at
a<00:00:23.599> time<00:00:23.840> opposite<00:00:24.650> each<00:00:24.830> other<00:00:25.029> and<00:00:26.029> his

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
a time opposite each other and his

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.230 
a time opposite each other and his
shoulders<00:00:26.960> are<00:00:27.290> but<00:00:28.250> right<00:00:28.490> above<00:00:28.730> his<00:00:28.970> hips

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
shoulders are but right above his hips

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.180 
shoulders are but right above his hips
Zach<00:00:29.840> can<00:00:30.109> you<00:00:30.260> demonstrate<00:00:30.440> what<00:00:30.920> it<00:00:30.949> looks

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
Zach can you demonstrate what it looks

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.160 
Zach can you demonstrate what it looks
like<00:00:31.340> when<00:00:31.550> swimmers<00:00:31.910> leaned<00:00:32.270> forward<00:00:32.870> and

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
like when swimmers leaned forward and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.260 
like when swimmers leaned forward and
they<00:00:33.710> try<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:33.949> do<00:00:34.160> eggbeater<00:00:34.580> kick<00:00:34.610> yes<00:00:34.970> so

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
they try to do eggbeater kick yes so

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.330 
they try to do eggbeater kick yes so
then<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.140> head<00:00:36.350> goes<00:00:36.590> in<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:36.800> water<00:00:36.949> a<00:00:37.129> little

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
then the head goes in the water a little

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.470 
then the head goes in the water a little
bit<00:00:37.489> more<00:00:37.940> he<00:00:38.540> loses<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:38.989> lot<00:00:39.290> of<00:00:39.470> his

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
bit more he loses a lot of his

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.729 
bit more he loses a lot of his
efficiency<00:00:41.480> there<00:00:41.750> exact<00:00:42.199> you<00:00:42.350> can<00:00:42.410> come<00:00:42.650> back

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
efficiency there exact you can come back

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.729 
efficiency there exact you can come back
up<00:00:42.949> right<00:00:43.239> so<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.690> next<00:00:44.720> thing<00:00:45.110> Zach's<00:00:45.500> going

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
up right so the next thing Zach's going

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.130 
up right so the next thing Zach's going
to<00:00:45.829> do<00:00:45.980> is<00:00:46.280> demonstrate<00:00:46.880> three<00:00:47.750> different

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
to do is demonstrate three different

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.720 
to do is demonstrate three different
ways<00:00:48.290> that's<00:00:48.620> where<00:00:48.800> sometimes<00:00:49.070> do<00:00:49.550> their

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
ways that's where sometimes do their

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.049 
ways that's where sometimes do their
treading<00:00:50.710> incorrectly<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.070> let's<00:00:52.520> start<00:00:52.879> with

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
treading incorrectly so let's start with

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.630 
treading incorrectly so let's start with
the<00:00:53.180> first<00:00:53.390> one<00:00:53.719> Zach<00:00:54.620> demonstrate<00:00:55.160> for<00:00:55.340> us<00:00:55.370> a

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
the first one Zach demonstrate for us a

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.819 
the first one Zach demonstrate for us a
frog

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
frog

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.069 
frog
so<00:00:58.309> in<00:00:58.579> a<00:00:58.700> frog<00:00:58.910> kick<00:00:59.210> both<00:00:59.540> legs<00:00:59.870> are<00:00:59.989> moving

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
so in a frog kick both legs are moving

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.229 
so in a frog kick both legs are moving
at<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.410> same<00:01:00.680> time<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.760> legs<00:01:02.090> are

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
at the same time and the legs are

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.910 
at the same time and the legs are
squeezing<00:01:02.420> together<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.410> what<00:01:03.500> we<00:01:03.590> can<00:01:03.739> see

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
squeezing together so what we can see

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.160 
squeezing together so what we can see
here<00:01:04.250> is<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.489> zach<00:01:05.330> is<00:01:05.479> bouncing<00:01:05.840> up<00:01:06.050> and

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
here is that zach is bouncing up and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.590 
here is that zach is bouncing up and
down<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.440> lot<00:01:06.740> which<00:01:07.250> is<00:01:07.280> very<00:01:07.760> inefficient<00:01:08.090> and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
down a lot which is very inefficient and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.020 
down a lot which is very inefficient and
so<00:01:08.840> we'll<00:01:09.320> get<00:01:09.440> more<00:01:09.740> tired<00:01:10.130> trying<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.790> bring

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
so we'll get more tired trying to bring

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.830 
so we'll get more tired trying to bring
ourselves<00:01:11.150> back<00:01:11.510> up<00:01:12.340> as<00:01:13.340> we<00:01:13.400> go<00:01:13.700> along<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.270> Zach

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
ourselves back up as we go along so Zach

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.230 
ourselves back up as we go along so Zach
now<00:01:15.050> you<00:01:15.110> can<00:01:15.350> switch<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.650> a<00:01:15.950> like<00:01:16.520> running<00:01:17.000> or

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
now you can switch to a like running or

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.510 
now you can switch to a like running or
doing<00:01:17.659> flutter<00:01:17.960> kick<00:01:18.229> for<00:01:18.560> your<00:01:18.650> treading<00:01:18.979> so

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
doing flutter kick for your treading so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.870 
doing flutter kick for your treading so
this<00:01:19.700> is<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.850> flutter<00:01:20.150> kick<00:01:20.890> his<00:01:21.890> shoulders<00:01:22.520> are

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
this is a flutter kick his shoulders are

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.630 
this is a flutter kick his shoulders are
right<00:01:23.270> above<00:01:23.540> his<00:01:23.869> hips<00:01:24.229> but<00:01:24.920> this<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.369> again

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
right above his hips but this is again

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.180 
right above his hips but this is again
really<00:01:26.000> inefficient<00:01:26.420> kick<00:01:26.869> he's<00:01:27.350> trying<00:01:28.070> to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
really inefficient kick he's trying to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.930 
really inefficient kick he's trying to
generate<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.640> lot<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.090> propulsion<00:01:29.659> upward<00:01:30.440> and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
generate a lot of propulsion upward and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.730 
generate a lot of propulsion upward and
isn't<00:01:31.940> creating<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.330> really<00:01:32.600> wide<00:01:32.990> face<00:01:33.380> for

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
isn't creating a really wide face for

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.550 
isn't creating a really wide face for
his<00:01:33.890> feet<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.570> move<00:01:35.570> through<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.869> water<00:01:35.990> so

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
his feet to move through the water so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.139 
his feet to move through the water so
now<00:01:36.890> let's<00:01:37.070> do<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.280> scissor<00:01:37.729> kick<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.090> I'm

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
now let's do a scissor kick and I'm

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.040 
now let's do a scissor kick and I'm
going<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.300> have<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.539> turn<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.750> little<00:01:38.869> bit

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
going to have you turn a little bit

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.139 
going to have you turn a little bit
sideways<00:01:39.289> to<00:01:39.649> get<00:01:39.740> yeah<00:01:40.130> there<00:01:40.399> you<00:01:40.490> go<00:01:40.550> so

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
sideways to get yeah there you go so

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.480 
sideways to get yeah there you go so
sort<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:41.660> like<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.050> flutter<00:01:42.320> kick<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:43.190> legs

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
sort of like the flutter kick the legs

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.550 
sort of like the flutter kick the legs
are<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.090> know<00:01:44.210> right<00:01:44.450> below<00:01:44.720> his<00:01:44.990> hips<00:01:45.320> and

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
are you know right below his hips and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.440 
are you know right below his hips and
this<00:01:45.710> is<00:01:45.890> kind<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.460> combination<00:01:46.940> he's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
this is kind of a combination he's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.609 
this is kind of a combination he's
bouncing<00:01:47.929> up<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:48.170> down<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:50.140> he's<00:01:51.140> not<00:01:51.320> he's

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
bouncing up and down and he's not he's

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.830

really easy way to practice this at home
and<00:01:58.520> this<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.640> also<00:01:58.909> how<00:01:59.179> we<00:01:59.240> teach<00:01:59.539> eggbeater

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
and this is also how we teach eggbeater

when we're doing eggbeater kick it is

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.449 
when we're doing eggbeater kick it is
like<00:02:08.929> you're<00:02:09.140> sitting<00:02:09.470> in<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.890> water<00:02:10.099> so

that's going to live

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.540 
that's going to live
and<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.690> leg<00:02:12.960> at<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> time<00:02:13.170> flex<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.310> foot<00:02:14.490> and
