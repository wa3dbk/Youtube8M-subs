get tired of it's called color making
and<00:01:59.729> using<00:01:59.790> dyes<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.780> pigments<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.890> just

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and using dyes and pigments and it just

tells you all about color all you could
need<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.710> well<00:02:05.310> not<00:02:05.759> really<00:02:05.969> because

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
need to know well not really because

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.540 
need to know well not really because
it's<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:06.869> big<00:02:06.899> book<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.680> probably

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
it's not a very big book but probably

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.800 
it's not a very big book but probably
much<00:02:08.789> more<00:02:08.819> than<00:02:09.179> you'll<00:02:09.300> ever<00:02:09.390> need<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> know

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
much more than you'll ever need to know

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.340 
much more than you'll ever need to know
about<00:02:10.170> color<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.860> find<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> very

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
about color I find it very

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.920 
about color I find it very
very<00:02:12.710> interesting<00:02:13.190> for<00:02:13.370> example<00:02:13.900> did<00:02:14.900> you

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
very interesting for example did you

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.740 
very interesting for example did you
know<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:16.010> Egyptians<00:02:16.790> invented<00:02:17.090> glass

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
know that the Egyptians invented glass

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.260 
know that the Egyptians invented glass
and<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.950> third<00:02:18.980> millennium<00:02:19.370> BC<00:02:19.730> they

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
and in the third millennium BC they

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.790 
and in the third millennium BC they
perfected<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.840> fabrication<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.620> synthetic

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
perfected the fabrication of a synthetic

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.720 
perfected the fabrication of a synthetic
blue<00:02:22.220> pigment<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:23.590> double<00:02:24.590> silica<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.370> copper

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
blue pigment a double silica of copper

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.520 
blue pigment a double silica of copper
and<00:02:25.760> calcium<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.510> made<00:02:26.840> up<00:02:26.990> for<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.290> lack<00:02:27.500> of

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
and calcium that made up for the lack of

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.620 
and calcium that made up for the lack of
natural<00:02:27.800> blue<00:02:28.190> Merrill's<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:29.360> first

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
natural blue Merrill's this first

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.480 
natural blue Merrill's this first
synthetic<00:02:29.960> was<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> resounding<00:02:30.560> success<00:02:30.590> it

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
synthetic was a resounding success it

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.010 
synthetic was a resounding success it
can<00:02:31.640> be<00:02:31.700> manufactured<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.390> quantities<00:02:32.810> great

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
can be manufactured in quantities great

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.110 
can be manufactured in quantities great
enough<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.320> decorate<00:02:33.710> a<00:02:33.740> large<00:02:33.920> object<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.460> me

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
enough to decorate a large object can me

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.990 
enough to decorate a large object can me
I<00:02:35.390> can't<00:02:36.170> talk<00:02:36.680> apparently<00:02:37.370> there's<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.790> whole

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
I can't talk apparently there's a whole

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.400 
I can't talk apparently there's a whole
chapter<00:02:38.030> called<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.870> search<00:02:39.080> for<00:02:39.380> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
chapter called the search for the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.560 
chapter called the search for the
perfect<00:02:39.650> yellow<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.580> battle<00:02:41.000> for<00:02:41.180> indigo

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
perfect yellow the battle for indigo

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.260 
perfect yellow the battle for indigo
anyway<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.380> love<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:43.070> book<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.790> also<00:02:43.940> have

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
anyway I love this book and I also have

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.810 
anyway I love this book and I also have
this<00:02:44.540> one<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.260> artists<00:02:45.740> color<00:02:46.040> manual<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.670> know

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
this one the artists color manual I know

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.610 
this one the artists color manual I know
it's<00:02:47.180> not<00:02:47.360> very<00:02:47.480> interesting<00:02:48.080> but<00:02:48.350> that's<00:02:48.500> why

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
it's not very interesting but that's why

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.960 
it's not very interesting but that's why
I'm<00:02:48.740> suggesting<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.400> our<00:02:49.430> videos<00:02:49.790> be

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
I'm suggesting that our videos be

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.670 
I'm suggesting that our videos be
allowed<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.300> be<00:02:50.390> under<00:02:50.630> two<00:02:50.780> minutes<00:02:50.960> you're

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
allowed to be under two minutes you're

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.870 
allowed to be under two minutes you're
not<00:02:51.800> watching<00:02:51.950> lost<00:02:52.280> right<00:02:52.580> now<00:02:52.610> well

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
not watching lost right now well

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.400 
not watching lost right now well
actually<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.270> over<00:02:53.390> because<00:02:53.960> it's<00:02:54.140> like

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
actually it's over because it's like

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.950 
actually it's over because it's like
after<00:02:54.590> eleven<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:55.850> you're<00:02:56.450> at<00:02:56.570> your<00:02:56.720> lost

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
after eleven but you're at your lost

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.410 
after eleven but you're at your lost
