00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:12.620
 So an engraving machine in x 535 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.410
 electric and driver from inter tig 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.260
 produced by the company inter so it means that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.920
 such a serious machine like a nap 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:28.260
 and reviews and we already have where my 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.700
 disassembled the internal device now 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.850
 try it as it will take from us 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.870
 metal engraving on metal here we take 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:48.050
 We put on dvoechku and try on 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.050
 soviet loved to experience it all 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.940
 started 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:01.820
 on this we have already made up a machine 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.489
 Bulldog on it is now near from engrave 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:10.150
 typewriter you x 535 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.150
 and compare for one like that 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:48.210
 so what we see in the account here 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:53.490
 engraving near the bottom line here it is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:59.700
 this one x 535 is almost the same 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.950
 she engraves solid metal unequivocally 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.850
 so as the engraving experience on the other 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:11.340
 metal is much wider line and punches 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.550
 better now let's take it to us 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 got 1 under the scissors arm repeat on 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.870
 scissors is an experiment 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.120
 all our shortages 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.129
 and so here you are scissors 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.989
 about meal just remembers metal 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.020
 a clear mark leaves deep but thin 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.989
 too sharpened because the needle is very 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:13.530
 ok straight line please if hand 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:19.690
 is well worth it you can write and draw 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:31.569
 Anything to do so machine 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:36.390
 Drops x 535 in x 535 adjustment 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:42.510
 hit amplitude switch for metal 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.510
 ok very good thanks
