00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello to all there is still a tiny detail that did you have 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.609
 may not have said that but some have scored since I received some 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:08.449
 phone calls 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:10.679
 I hold in harmony calendar 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.629
 the staff wanted me to have the basins left to my left 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.299
 elise and the other three for me it's the opposite I learned on my own 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.460
 that's how it is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.830
 gold back on the harmonicas a big hard so in one go 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.529
 in a comparable way 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.310
 a dish love to bleed 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.909
 here 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.909
 harmonica always at wholesale 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.400
 nationally 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.830
 to them from us 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.620
 small course on one of the pillars of the blues is something that I am 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.170
 realized 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.200
 signed clothes and I find it a shame it's something 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.950
 of indispensable my opinion 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.560
 to play a life of blues twelve measures 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.990
 % to the harmonica so first of all that we extend second position in this case 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.519
 right here 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.519
 it means that for others we do not believe it 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.410
 the guitarist the pianist who will accompany us will have to play a flu 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.240
 on the ground simply because when aspiring in a hiking harmonica 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.380
 in the bass part of the harmonica we see what he did on the wax 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.550
 these repression too 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.550
 it's a ground agreement 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.780
 to see in the holes it's in the troops to 1 2 3 4 in the holes of 3 4 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.280
 5 you will find the rope are sevenths ie on the site 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.470
 seems 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.740
 the blues abbey was composed in the following way we will find the three 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.700
 first measurements in soil the fourth time in France on the 7th so no 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.900
 of panic the first three measures i'm going to breathe their points of 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.020
 troyes August two three four me perso I prefer in 3 hours to me I find 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.230
 that the program a bump interesting moment 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.860
 for his fourth player alone this 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.780
 of 3 4 5 inspired 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 following four measures we will find two chords back 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 for that it's not complicated since your harmonica ponds of water 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.630
 means that the more the same for all 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.180
 a man like you are going to suffer any time where you blow in three 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.440
 holes you play the water rope so you just have to blow 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.480
 the next two measures so then we find the ground rope 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.650
 for his friend of three spirea 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.939
 last four measures of the city 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.879
 we will find first of all we give to the ear will grant 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.060
 composed of another 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.940
 a shady part late 40s 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.670
 nowhere on their serial monitors in any case it is found on some in 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.240
 have plenty of time in the handicaps understood you will vefa now on 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.659
 harmony as normal in four five six aspire you proved falla 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.949
 that would correspond to the rope for the miners me I'm a rebel I have not 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.299
 want to play the common so I'm going to settle for playing only platonic 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.629
 that is to say, the drill that I will find in the inspired bread hen 4 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:38.919
 aspirated 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.709
 so striped inspired a breathe box 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.199
 just behind gm the agreement of all 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.529
 then a ground agreement inspired by troy and in the end again an agreement 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.299
 I'm going to breathe for the moment as long as we have not learned to do 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.329
 the full in the anguished for a long time we do not go there we play the 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.489
 spoon taking into account that m 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.789
 we learn to 20 liters 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:04.389
 lung capacity so we will not be able to play on the four times to 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.319
 every time I make you a proposal simply to play and articulate in 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.749
 sucking by blowing 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.109
 tanaka a pole 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.509
 caracas 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.509
 caracas inquiry read 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.099
 the painting 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.710
 when I finished the biggest board game style 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.750
 we come back on the video for the same thing with a club
