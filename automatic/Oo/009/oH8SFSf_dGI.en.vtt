material it's called power dry high
efficiency<00:00:29.429> now<00:00:30.000> I've<00:00:30.119> been<00:00:30.240> using<00:00:30.420> power<00:00:30.720> dry

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
efficiency now I've been using power dry

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.440 
efficiency now I've been using power dry
since<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.410> first<00:00:31.529> came<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.880> find<00:00:33.329> it

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
since it first came out and I find it

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.930 
since it first came out and I find it
incredibly<00:00:34.170> capable<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:35.250> keeping<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> warm

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
incredibly capable at keeping you warm

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.450 
incredibly capable at keeping you warm
but<00:00:36.300> keeping<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> dry<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.950> stuff<00:00:38.190> just

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
but keeping you dry and this stuff just

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.130 
but keeping you dry and this stuff just
feels<00:00:38.670> softer<00:00:39.329> than<00:00:39.540> anything<00:00:39.629> I've<00:00:39.989> used

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
feels softer than anything I've used

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.750 
feels softer than anything I've used
before<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.530> incredibly<00:00:41.129> wearable<00:00:41.370> it's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
before it's incredibly wearable it's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.200 
before it's incredibly wearable it's
lovely

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210

dbits<00:01:04.409> pick<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.280> moisture<00:01:05.430> off<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:05.970> skin<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
dbits pick up moisture off your skin and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.969 
dbits pick up moisture off your skin and
conduct<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> moisture<00:01:07.290> through<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> garment

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
conduct the moisture through the garment

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.920 
conduct the moisture through the garment
it<00:01:08.490> gets<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> outside<00:01:09.119> which<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> large

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it gets to the outside which is a large

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.080 
it gets to the outside which is a large
surface<00:01:10.320> area<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:11.010> spreads<00:01:11.490> across<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
surface area it spreads across it and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330 
surface area it spreads across it and
evaporates<00:01:12.600> rapidly<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.650> very<00:01:14.010> very

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
evaporates rapidly so it's very very

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.420 
evaporates rapidly so it's very very
active<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.030> quick<00:01:15.450> at<00:01:15.630> moving<00:01:15.990> moisture

active and quick at moving moisture

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
active and quick at moving moisture
you've<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.580> got<00:01:17.820> channels<00:01:18.659> between<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
you've then got channels between the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.130 
you've then got channels between the

perfect if you're going somewhere like

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
perfect if you're going somewhere like
the<00:01:52.710> Arctic<00:01:53.009> where<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.369> was<00:01:53.460> deeply<00:01:53.939> cold<00:01:54.180> and

you wore this as a base layer it would
be<00:01:55.770> perfect<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.030> could<00:01:57.180> actually<00:01:57.270> wear<00:01:57.540> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
combination of those two layers would

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.160 
combination of those two layers would
work<00:02:01.320> brilliantly<00:02:01.820> in<00:02:02.820> terms<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.240> features<00:02:03.689> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
work brilliantly in terms of features it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.859 
work brilliantly in terms of features it
has<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> very<00:02:04.680> deep<00:02:05.009> chest<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.689> want

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
has a very deep chest it so if you want

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
has a very deep chest it so if you want
to<00:02:06.960> dump<00:02:07.200> heat<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.770> will<00:02:07.979> allow<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> lot<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.640> heat

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
to dump heat it will allow a lot of heat

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.089 
to dump heat it will allow a lot of heat
to<00:02:08.970> sort<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.690> issue<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:11.009> your

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
to sort of issue out of you out of your

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.830 
to sort of issue out of you out of your
core<00:02:11.390> behind<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.599> zip<00:02:12.810> there's<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
core behind the zip there's a

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.500 
core behind the zip there's a
baffle<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.769> it's<00:02:15.040> warm<00:02:15.370> everywhere<00:02:16.120> and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
baffle so it's warm everywhere and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.360 
baffle so it's warm everywhere and
comfortable<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.560> then<00:02:17.830> at<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:17.980> top<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
comfortable and then at the top of the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.240 
comfortable and then at the top of the
zip<00:02:18.580> here<00:02:18.849> it's<00:02:19.390> got<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.599> guard<00:02:19.959> up<00:02:20.890> on<00:02:21.099> your

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
zip here it's got a guard up on your

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.130 
zip here it's got a guard up on your
chin<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.030> zip<00:02:22.239> doesn't<00:02:22.629> catch<00:02:22.810> your<00:02:22.989> chin

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
chin so the zip doesn't catch your chin

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.540 
chin so the zip doesn't catch your chin
at<00:02:23.260> all<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.500> that's<00:02:23.620> really<00:02:23.830> soft<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:24.310> even<00:02:24.489> if

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
at all and that's really soft so even if

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.009 
at all and that's really soft so even if
you<00:02:24.610> add<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> little<00:02:24.849> bit<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.060> stubble<00:02:25.360> that

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
you add a little bit of stubble that

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.800 
you add a little bit of stubble that
wouldn't<00:02:26.319> rub<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.709> would<00:02:26.860> feel<00:02:27.010> comfortable

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
wouldn't rub that would feel comfortable

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.470 
wouldn't rub that would feel comfortable
it<00:02:28.810> has<00:02:28.840> thumb<00:02:29.349> loops<00:02:29.560> which<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.209> think

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
it has thumb loops which in and I think

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.660 
it has thumb loops which in and I think
in<00:02:31.599> in<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.900> well-designed<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.860> winter<00:02:33.250> garment

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
in in a well-designed the winter garment

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.140 
in in a well-designed the winter garment
thumb<00:02:33.879> loops<00:02:34.090> are<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.360> real<00:02:34.629> asset<00:02:35.580> because<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
thumb loops are a real asset because the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.300 
thumb loops are a real asset because the
veins<00:02:37.599> that<00:02:37.840> are<00:02:38.290> here<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.680> your<00:02:38.890> in<00:02:39.160> your

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
veins that are here in your in your

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.059 
veins that are here in your in your
wrists<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:40.180> no<00:02:40.360> fat<00:02:40.569> over<00:02:40.900> them<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.650> if<00:02:41.890> this

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
wrists have no fat over them so if this

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.220 
wrists have no fat over them so if this
part<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.430> your<00:02:42.549> body<00:02:42.700> gets<00:02:42.940> really<00:02:43.239> cold<00:02:43.450> your

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
part of your body gets really cold your

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.809 
part of your body gets really cold your
fingers<00:02:44.530> stop<00:02:44.709> working<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.190> then<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.430> can't

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
fingers stop working and then you can't

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.600 
fingers stop working and then you can't
you<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.180> can't<00:02:46.480> operate<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:48.310> put<00:02:48.519> your

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
you just can't operate so you put your

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.039 
you just can't operate so you put your
thumbs<00:02:48.790> through<00:02:49.000> there<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.510> put<00:02:49.720> your<00:02:49.840> gloves

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
thumbs through there you put your gloves

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.630 
thumbs through there you put your gloves
over<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> top<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.739> keeps<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.099> area<00:02:51.430> nice<00:02:51.610> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
over the top it keeps this area nice and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.460 
over the top it keeps this area nice and
warm<00:02:51.940> constantly<00:02:52.420> keeps<00:02:52.989> your<00:02:53.170> fingers

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
warm constantly keeps your fingers

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.660 
warm constantly keeps your fingers
working<00:02:53.650> stops<00:02:54.130> you're<00:02:54.250> getting<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.519> hot

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
working stops you're getting the hot

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.870 
working stops you're getting the hot
aches<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.450> such<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> degree<00:02:56.069> now<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.099> think<00:02:57.310> this

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
aches to such a degree now I think this

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.970 
aches to such a degree now I think this
kind<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.329> top<00:02:58.569> is<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:01.480> useful<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.049> so<00:03:02.500> wearable

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
kind of top is so useful and so wearable

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.610 
kind of top is so useful and so wearable
even<00:03:03.340> though<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:03.670> relatively<00:03:04.000> expensive<00:03:04.620> it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
even though it's relatively expensive it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.199 
even though it's relatively expensive it
creates<00:03:06.010> for<00:03:06.160> me<00:03:06.280> something<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:06.940> I<00:03:07.000> consider

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
creates for me something that I consider

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.150 
creates for me something that I consider
to<00:03:07.420> be<00:03:07.510> great<00:03:07.780> value<00:03:08.170> because<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.829> will<00:03:08.950> last

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
to be great value because it will last

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.039 
to be great value because it will last
for<00:03:09.489> years<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:09.849> years<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.329> will<00:03:10.480> wear<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.930> all

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
for years and years you will wear it all

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.990 
for years and years you will wear it all
the<00:03:11.140> time<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:12.220> would<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:12.370> for<00:03:12.610> me<00:03:12.700> one<00:03:12.849> of<00:03:12.879> my

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
the time it would be for me one of my

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.110 
the time it would be for me one of my
go-to<00:03:13.360> tops<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.340> would<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.610> thoroughly

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
go-to tops and I would just thoroughly

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.460 
go-to tops and I would just thoroughly
enjoy<00:03:16.390> wearing<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.870> I'd<00:03:16.930> actually<00:03:17.230> wear<00:03:17.379> this
