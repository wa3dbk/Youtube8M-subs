00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.480 

I'm<00:00:05.660> a<00:00:05.779> hobbyist<00:00:06.140> and<00:00:06.500> so<00:00:06.859> I've<00:00:07.370> been

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
I'm a hobbyist and so I've been

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.060 
I'm a hobbyist and so I've been
interested<00:00:07.640> in<00:00:08.179> you<00:00:08.659> know<00:00:08.719> the<00:00:08.900> LED<00:00:09.499> lighting

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
interested in you know the LED lighting

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.859 
interested in you know the LED lighting
technology<00:00:10.849> for<00:00:11.119> a<00:00:11.150> long<00:00:11.209> time

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:11.869 
technology for a long time

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.239 
technology for a long time
so<00:00:12.019> I<00:00:12.049> think<00:00:12.320> I<00:00:12.379> was<00:00:12.469> waiting<00:00:12.739> for<00:00:12.860> something

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:13.249 
so I think I was waiting for something

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.000 
so I think I was waiting for something
that<00:00:13.599> you<00:00:14.599> know<00:00:14.690> was<00:00:14.779> gonna<00:00:14.929> be<00:00:15.169> affordable

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
that you know was gonna be affordable

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.710 
that you know was gonna be affordable
and<00:00:16.160> was<00:00:16.550> gonna<00:00:16.670> deliver<00:00:17.029> you<00:00:17.390> know<00:00:17.420> sort<00:00:17.689> of

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
and was gonna deliver you know sort of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.659 
and was gonna deliver you know sort of
the<00:00:17.810> performance<00:00:18.320> that<00:00:18.439> we<00:00:18.529> expect<00:00:18.949> from<00:00:19.099> a

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:19.669 
the performance that we expect from a

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.659 
the performance that we expect from a
really<00:00:20.240> bright<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:21.669> energy-efficient

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
really bright and energy-efficient

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.339 
really bright and energy-efficient
technology<00:00:23.300> when<00:00:23.689> I'm<00:00:23.810> searching<00:00:24.140> around<00:00:24.230> for

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
technology when I'm searching around for

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.529 
technology when I'm searching around for
products<00:00:24.859> I<00:00:25.039> found<00:00:25.249> a<00:00:25.400> castle<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.029> saw<00:00:26.240> that

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
products I found a castle and saw that

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.480 
products I found a castle and saw that
new<00:00:26.689> units<00:00:26.990> were<00:00:27.109> tunable<00:00:27.589> and<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:27.890> we<00:00:28.009> pick

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
new units were tunable and so we pick

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.730 
new units were tunable and so we pick
our<00:00:28.640> spectrum<00:00:29.179> not<00:00:29.689> have<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.050> same<00:00:30.289> exact

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
our spectrum not have the same exact

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.010 
our spectrum not have the same exact
light<00:00:31.039> profile<00:00:31.909> on<00:00:32.090> every<00:00:32.270> exhibit<00:00:32.599> so<00:00:32.870> that

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
light profile on every exhibit so that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.630 
light profile on every exhibit so that
from<00:00:33.260> a<00:00:33.350> guests<00:00:33.620> perspective<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.340> be<00:00:34.399> able<00:00:34.460> to

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
from a guests perspective and be able to

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.010 
from a guests perspective and be able to
see<00:00:34.789> something<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.149> little<00:00:35.270> bit<00:00:35.629> different

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
see something a little bit different

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.510 
see something a little bit different
with<00:00:36.110> every<00:00:36.350> exhibit<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:36.920> then<00:00:37.309> we're

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
with every exhibit and then we're

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.889 
with every exhibit and then we're
actually<00:00:37.640> using<00:00:37.910> them<00:00:38.210> lots<00:00:38.539> of<00:00:38.660> bigger

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
actually using them lots of bigger

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.200 
actually using them lots of bigger
exhibits<00:00:39.410> now<00:00:39.590> we<00:00:40.190> just<00:00:40.370> built<00:00:40.609> a<00:00:40.820> pretty

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
exhibits now we just built a pretty

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.439 
exhibits now we just built a pretty
impressive<00:00:41.620> rack<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:43.010> put<00:00:43.280> up<00:00:43.699> I<00:00:44.059> think

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
impressive rack to put up I think

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.540 
impressive rack to put up I think
there's<00:00:44.629> eight<00:00:45.109> or<00:00:45.260> ten<00:00:45.500> lights<00:00:46.160> on<00:00:46.370> that

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
there's eight or ten lights on that

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.729 
there's eight or ten lights on that
specific<00:00:47.120> exhibit<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.019> that's<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.320> seagrass

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
specific exhibit and that's a seagrass

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.380 
specific exhibit and that's a seagrass
exhibit<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:49.399> it's<00:00:49.550> going<00:00:49.699> to<00:00:49.760> be<00:00:49.910> three

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
exhibit so it's going to be three

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.090 
exhibit so it's going to be three
thousand<00:00:50.840> gallons<00:00:50.980> somewhere<00:00:51.980> in<00:00:52.039> that

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
thousand gallons somewhere in that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.830 
thousand gallons somewhere in that
neighborhood<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:53.000> that's<00:00:53.269> how<00:00:53.390> we<00:00:53.449> like<00:00:53.660> that

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
neighborhood and that's how we like that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.630 
neighborhood and that's how we like that
exhibit<00:00:54.289> is<00:00:54.530> with<00:00:54.710> all<00:00:54.859> those<00:00:55.010> individual

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
exhibit is with all those individual

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.819 
exhibit is with all those individual
units<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.870> shipper<00:00:57.109> we're<00:00:57.320> getting<00:00:57.530> off<00:00:57.649> of

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
units the shipper we're getting off of

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.889 
units the shipper we're getting off of
that<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.219> way<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.429> fish<00:00:58.670> present<00:00:59.149> has<00:00:59.690> been

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
that the way the fish present has been

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.360 
that the way the fish present has been
really<00:01:00.170> really<00:01:00.289> positive<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:01.010> guests<00:01:01.280> have

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
really really positive the guests have

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.189 
really really positive the guests have
really<00:01:01.609> noticed<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.539> I<00:01:02.839> think<00:01:03.109> we're

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
really noticed it and I think we're

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.170 
really noticed it and I think we're
really<00:01:03.289> happy<00:01:03.589> with<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.890> product<00:01:04.280> we're

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
really happy with the product we're

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.790 
really happy with the product we're
using<00:01:05.330> kecil<00:01:05.750> lighting<00:01:06.050> on<00:01:06.230> a<00:01:06.530> number<00:01:06.770> of

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
using kecil lighting on a number of

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.130 
using kecil lighting on a number of
cylinder<00:01:07.190> shaped<00:01:07.430> exhibits<00:01:07.910> we<00:01:08.210> had<00:01:08.420> sort<00:01:09.050> of

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
cylinder shaped exhibits we had sort of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.460 
cylinder shaped exhibits we had sort of
a<00:01:09.230> problem<00:01:09.530> with<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.460> narrow<00:01:11.330> tall<00:01:11.810> footprint

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
a problem with the narrow tall footprint

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.050 
a problem with the narrow tall footprint
of<00:01:12.710> these<00:01:12.890> exhibits<00:01:13.190> we<00:01:13.580> wanted<00:01:13.850> something

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
of these exhibits we wanted something

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.400 
of these exhibits we wanted something
that<00:01:14.180> would<00:01:14.390> push<00:01:14.600> light<00:01:14.840> all<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.110> way<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.260> the

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
that would push light all the way to the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.680 
that would push light all the way to the
bottom<00:01:15.620> you<00:01:16.040> know

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
bottom you know

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.630 
bottom you know
we<00:01:16.750> found<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.110> with<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:18.010> confined<00:01:18.580> space

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
we found that with the confined space

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.020 
we found that with the confined space
that<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.690> those<00:01:19.900> tanks<00:01:20.710> had<00:01:20.890> overhead<00:01:21.850> that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
that that those tanks had overhead that

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.220 
that that those tanks had overhead that
the<00:01:22.180> Kessel<00:01:22.540> was<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.750> perfect<00:01:23.110> thing<00:01:23.200> to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
the Kessel was the perfect thing to

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:34.359 
the Kessel was the perfect thing to
fitted<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:23.680> that<00:01:23.830> space

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.179 

and<00:01:35.229> then<00:01:36.229> obviously<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:36.770> know<00:01:36.920> being<00:01:37.130> a

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
and then obviously you know being a

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.740 
and then obviously you know being a
conservation<00:01:37.759> organization<00:01:37.850> were<00:01:38.479> really

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
conservation organization were really

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.539 
conservation organization were really
interested<00:01:39.229> in<00:01:39.289> energy<00:01:39.710> efficiency<00:01:40.189> we're

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
interested in energy efficiency we're

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.789 
interested in energy efficiency we're
really<00:01:40.729> interested<00:01:41.270> in<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:42.409> know<00:01:42.439> having<00:01:42.590> as

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
really interested in you know having as

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.919 
really interested in you know having as
minimal<00:01:43.280> carbon<00:01:43.819> footprint<00:01:44.240> as<00:01:44.299> we<00:01:44.420> can<00:01:44.689> and

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
minimal carbon footprint as we can and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.529 
minimal carbon footprint as we can and
so<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:46.100> energy<00:01:46.250> savings<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.210> energy

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
so the energy savings and the energy

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.010 
so the energy savings and the energy
efficiency<00:01:48.439> of<00:01:48.590> an<00:01:48.770> LED<00:01:49.100> technology<00:01:49.340> and

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
efficiency of an LED technology and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.380 
efficiency of an LED technology and
especially<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.350> Kessel<00:01:51.679> units<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:53.240> was<00:01:53.360> a

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
especially the Kessel units it was a

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.819 
especially the Kessel units it was a
no-brainer<00:01:53.810> for<00:01:53.899> us<00:01:54.110> or<00:01:54.380> they're<00:01:54.500> really<00:01:54.679> good

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
no-brainer for us or they're really good
