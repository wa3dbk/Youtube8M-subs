00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:17.579
 Carlos, let's go to the sale of interesting and beneficial food for all 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.240
 the Latin of conception of montreal this nothing more and nothing less than 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:28.079
 latin yellow pages 2008 are with us instigators of this 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.779
 project sos others 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.140
 mario cortabitarte what is the director of this project 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.559
 according to others 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.589
 juan carlos what is the manager and this way the cars that his director of 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:39.700
 sales 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.520
 where does this project come from? 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.990
 what happens is that the project was already moving as a year supa 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.850
 soon 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.590
 idea we do not know storybook yellow pages percent is ist and in other 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.840
 communities that was organized like Arab Jews 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.830
 the Chinese and yellow pages 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.860
 and we who are a good community anyway we assume term did not know 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.860
 after the pac will determine yellow yellow pages 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.460
 but here it's very interesting to see that the Latino community 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.750
 I did not have 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.510
 join yearbook 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.120
 that could some pair to the whole 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.700
 of the merchants of the Latin commune 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.840
 cuba there was a problem you may have to charge him exports advertising 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.460
 we feel very good now 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.820
 diskin that there are more but of the yellow pages that organize 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.930
 trade affirmed 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.800
 and that quality start adp all the merchants so that through sms 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.620
 yearbook you can go 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.880

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.500
 hanged man I want that work was not easy because also 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.200
 in many shops that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.870
 percent appear and disappear 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.760
 exactly we had to do a 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.690
 buzz in your first one record of all the companies after a debugging of 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.010

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.780
 like everything or merchant also seeks a means through accounts that 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.629
 known 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.219

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.849
 commercial but the goiás is five years in montreal 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.119
