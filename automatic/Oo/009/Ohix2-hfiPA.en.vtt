try me first it's on if you keep it it

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.509 
try me first it's on if you keep it it
will<00:05:52.929> absorb<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.529> factor<00:05:54.069> even<00:05:54.279> though

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:54.519 
will absorb the factor even though

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:57.869 
will absorb the factor even though
you're<00:05:54.699> not<00:05:54.849> using<00:05:55.119> it<00:05:55.449> and<00:05:55.629> it's<00:05:55.809> on<00:05:56.429> so<00:05:57.429> yes

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:57.879 
you're not using it and it's on so yes

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.569 
you're not using it and it's on so yes
all<00:05:58.329> the<00:05:58.569> instructions<00:05:59.139> right<00:05:59.319> now<00:05:59.549> so<00:06:00.549> I

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:00.579 
all the instructions right now so I

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:02.249 
all the instructions right now so I
think<00:06:01.029> this<00:06:01.149> will<00:06:01.239> take<00:06:01.449> up<00:06:01.659> battery<00:06:02.079> even

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
think this will take up battery even

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.139 
think this will take up battery even
though<00:06:02.349> you're<00:06:02.529> not<00:06:02.649> using<00:06:02.919> it<00:06:03.249> and<00:06:03.519> it's<00:06:04.059> an

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:04.149 
though you're not using it and it's an

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:07.859
