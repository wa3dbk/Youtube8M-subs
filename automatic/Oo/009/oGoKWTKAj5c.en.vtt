putting<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.030> tournament<00:00:12.540> mode<00:00:12.690> there's<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.710> lot

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
putting in tournament mode there's a lot

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.709 
putting in tournament mode there's a lot
of<00:00:14.040> different<00:00:14.340> techniques<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.059> people<00:00:15.299> use

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
of different techniques that people use

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.930 
of different techniques that people use
to<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.139> putts<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.949> tournament<00:00:17.520> mode<00:00:17.699> I'm

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
to make putts in tournament mode I'm

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.980 
to make putts in tournament mode I'm
just<00:00:18.119> going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.270> give<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.570> mine<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
just going to give you mine and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.290 
just going to give you mine and
hopefully<00:00:19.410> by<00:00:20.070> watching<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.580> it'll<00:00:21.210> help

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
hopefully by watching this it'll help

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.970 
hopefully by watching this it'll help
you<00:00:21.570> understand<00:00:22.020> some<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> dynamics<00:00:22.890> that

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
you understand some of the dynamics that

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.029 
you understand some of the dynamics that
go<00:00:23.100> into<00:00:23.640> making<00:00:24.029> putts<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.750> mode<00:00:25.039> two

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
go into making putts on this mode two

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.670 
go into making putts on this mode two
components<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.760> making<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.539> pot<00:00:27.750> one<00:00:28.289> would<00:00:28.529> be

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
components to making a pot one would be

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.710 
components to making a pot one would be
judging<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> left<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.640> right<00:00:29.789> break<00:00:30.060> this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
judging the left and right break this

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.479 
judging the left and right break this
video<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.140> not<00:00:31.260> about<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:32.070> left<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
video is not about that that left and

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.490 
video is not about that that left and
right<00:00:32.640> break<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.840> don't<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
right break I really don't have a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.709 
right break I really don't have a
formula<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.180> comes<00:00:36.600> with

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
formula for that it just comes with

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.240 
formula for that it just comes with
practice<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.469> you'll<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.710> able<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.010> judge

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
practice that you'll be able to judge

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.869 
practice that you'll be able to judge
those<00:00:38.690> left<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.809> right<00:00:40.020> breaks<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:41.010> real<00:00:41.309> key

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
those left and right breaks the real key

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.490 
those left and right breaks the real key
to<00:00:41.910> putting<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.480> tournament<00:00:42.899> mode<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.140> getting

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
to putting in tournament mode is getting

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.350 
to putting in tournament mode is getting
your<00:00:43.649> speed<00:00:43.950> down<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.910> got<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> right

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
your speed down if you got the right

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.510 
your speed down if you got the right
speed<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.530> misjudged<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.190> left<00:00:47.370> or

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
speed but have misjudged the left or

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.619 
speed but have misjudged the left or
right<00:00:47.550> break<00:00:47.940> you'll<00:00:48.180> at<00:00:48.270> least<00:00:48.329> have

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
right break you'll at least have

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.920 
right break you'll at least have
yourself<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.230> nice<00:00:49.379> short<00:00:49.789> second<00:00:50.789> putt<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.719> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
yourself a nice short second putt if you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
yourself a nice short second putt if you
do<00:00:52.110> miss<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.829> let's<00:00:53.129> work<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.789> getting<00:00:54.210> our

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
do miss so let's work on getting our

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.110 
do miss so let's work on getting our
speed<00:00:54.690> right<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:56.070> rest<00:00:56.309> will<00:00:56.489> come<00:00:56.550> with

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
speed right and the rest will come with

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680 
speed right and the rest will come with
practice<00:00:58.760> one<00:00:59.760> very<00:01:00.000> important<00:01:00.449> thing<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
practice one very important thing to

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
practice one very important thing to
keep<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.020> mind<00:01:01.079> when<00:01:01.500> putting<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.010> tournament

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
keep in mind when putting in tournament

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
keep in mind when putting in tournament
mode<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.149> why<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> can't<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
mode is that why you can't see the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.870 
mode is that why you can't see the
putting<00:01:04.320> meter<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:05.040> actually<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.640> one

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
putting meter there actually is one

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
putting meter there actually is one
going<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> background<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
going on in the background just like it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.230 
going on in the background just like it
would<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> other<00:01:08.580> levels<00:01:09.030> where<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
would be on the other levels where you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.090 
would be on the other levels where you
can<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.650> thing<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> keep

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
can see it so that's one thing to keep

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.830 
can see it so that's one thing to keep
in<00:01:11.250> mind<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.670> speed<00:01:11.939> we'll<00:01:12.119> talk<00:01:12.330> about<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
in mind for speed we'll talk about that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.280 
in mind for speed we'll talk about that
in<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.229> few<00:01:13.260> minutes<00:01:14.810> before<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.259> that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
in just a few minutes before we do that

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.160 
in just a few minutes before we do that
let's<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.890> talk<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.430> basics<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
let's just talk about the basics of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.560 
let's just talk about the basics of
judging<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:20.040> speed<00:01:20.909> based<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
judging for speed based on the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.010 
judging for speed based on the
conditions<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.740> your<00:01:22.830> putt<00:01:23.900> before<00:01:24.900> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
conditions for your putt before you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
conditions for your putt before you
execute<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.530> putt<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.610> need<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.970> three

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
execute your putt you need to do three

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
execute your putt you need to do three
steps<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.869> order<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> adjust<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> actual

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
steps in order to adjust for the actual

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.429 
steps in order to adjust for the actual
green<00:01:29.759> conditions<00:01:30.329> first<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.200> need<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
green conditions first you need to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.179 
green conditions first you need to
adjust<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.220> green<00:01:32.939> elevation<00:01:33.979> one<00:01:34.979> inch

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
adjust for the green elevation one inch

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.679 
adjust for the green elevation one inch
of<00:01:35.310> elevation<00:01:35.850> equals<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.329> foot<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
of elevation equals one foot of

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.429 
of elevation equals one foot of
adjustment<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:38.340> second<00:01:38.729> step<00:01:38.960> would<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
adjustment the second step would be to

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.219 
adjustment the second step would be to
adjust<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> actual<00:01:41.970> green<00:01:42.270> speed<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
adjust for the actual green speed and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.679 
adjust for the actual green speed and
I've<00:01:43.350> got<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> different<00:01:44.630> percentages<00:01:45.630> that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
I've got the different percentages that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.950 
I've got the different percentages that
you<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.079> take<00:01:46.259> off<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:47.460> distance<00:01:48.119> based

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you would take off your distance based

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.370 
you would take off your distance based
on<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> green<00:01:49.500> speed<00:01:50.030> keep<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.180> mind<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:52.020> for

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
on the green speed keep in mind that for

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.920 
on the green speed keep in mind that for
rain<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.040> need<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.399> add<00:01:53.640> an<00:01:54.090> additional<00:01:54.270> 50%

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
rain you need to add an additional 50%

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.539 
rain you need to add an additional 50%
after<00:01:55.770> adjusting<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.280> green<00:01:56.640> speed<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.960> also

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
after adjusting for green speed and also

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.420 
after adjusting for green speed and also
on<00:01:59.600> when<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> play<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> gust<00:02:01.259> ax<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:02.100> need<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
on when you play a gust ax you need to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.770 
on when you play a gust ax you need to
take<00:02:02.640> off<00:02:02.820> an<00:02:03.030> additional<00:02:03.540> ten<00:02:03.750> percent

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
take off an additional ten percent

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.569 
take off an additional ten percent
because<00:02:04.469> those<00:02:04.680> greens<00:02:05.009> tend<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.369> play<00:02:05.549> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
because those greens tend to play a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.280 
because those greens tend to play a
little<00:02:05.790> bit<00:02:06.000> faster<00:02:06.479> than<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.659> other<00:02:06.899> courses

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
little bit faster than the other courses

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
little bit faster than the other courses
in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.420> third<00:02:09.420> step<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.830> after<00:02:11.190> you've

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
in the third step is that after you've

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.800 
in the third step is that after you've
made<00:02:11.550> these<00:02:12.180> two<00:02:12.450> adjustments<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.440> that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
made these two adjustments is that

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.979 
made these two adjustments is that
actually<00:02:14.319> move<00:02:14.530> your<00:02:14.560> aiming<00:02:15.370> marker<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.780> that

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
actually move your aiming marker to that

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.140 
actually move your aiming marker to that
desired<00:02:17.530> distance<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.400> that's<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.060> to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
desired distance and that's going to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.790 
desired distance and that's going to
come<00:02:19.330> into<00:02:19.510> play<00:02:19.599> when<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.080> actually<00:02:20.290> execute

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
come into play when you actually execute

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.720 
come into play when you actually execute
your<00:02:21.400> putt<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:22.060> your<00:02:22.209> aiming<00:02:22.450> marker

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
your putt to have your aiming marker

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.110 
your putt to have your aiming marker
where<00:02:25.110> your<00:02:26.110> adjustment<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:26.860> set

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.580 

so<00:02:31.120> taking<00:02:31.420> those<00:02:31.510> three<00:02:31.720> steps<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.230> account

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
so taking those three steps to account

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.920 
so taking those three steps to account
for<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.890> putt<00:02:33.220> there's<00:02:33.520> no<00:02:33.700> elevation<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.900> I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
for this putt there's no elevation so I

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.540 
for this putt there's no elevation so I
don't<00:02:35.110> have<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.349> adjust<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.400> on

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
don't have to adjust for that this is on

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.020 
don't have to adjust for that this is on
tournament<00:02:37.060> mode<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.140> want<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.590> remove<00:02:39.220> 40%

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
tournament mode so I want to remove 40%

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.869 
tournament mode so I want to remove 40%
which<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:40.450> taken<00:02:40.840> off<00:02:40.959> about<00:02:41.230> eight<00:02:41.470> feet<00:02:41.849> so<00:02:42.849> I

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
which is taken off about eight feet so I

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.300 
which is taken off about eight feet so I
move<00:02:43.120> my<00:02:43.269> aiming<00:02:43.780> marker<00:02:44.110> back<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.680> then

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
move my aiming marker back and then

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.850 
move my aiming marker back and then
execute<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:45.970> putt<00:02:52.290> okay<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.349> you've<00:02:53.590> got<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
execute the putt okay so you've got the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.559 
execute the putt okay so you've got the
basics<00:02:54.280> down<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.790> adjusting<00:02:55.180> for<00:02:55.330> green

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
basics down for adjusting for green

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.270 
basics down for adjusting for green
conditions<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.230> next<00:02:56.500> step<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.160> actually

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
conditions the next step is to actually

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.070 
conditions the next step is to actually
execute<00:02:57.849> your<00:02:58.150> putt<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.599> these<00:02:58.840> swing

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
execute your putt and these swing

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.759 
execute your putt and these swing
percentages<00:03:00.239> will<00:03:01.239> help<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.629> achieve<00:03:02.319> the

percentages will help you achieve the

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.620 
percentages will help you achieve the
desired<00:03:03.160> amount<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.940> feet<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.299> you've<00:03:04.450> just

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
desired amount of feet that you've just

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.750 
desired amount of feet that you've just
adjusted<00:03:05.200> for<00:03:05.410> based<00:03:05.650> on<00:03:05.860> green<00:03:06.220> conditions

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
adjusted for based on green conditions

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.240 
adjusted for based on green conditions
anything<00:03:07.450> over<00:03:07.900> 40<00:03:08.110> feet<00:03:08.500> you're<00:03:08.890> pretty<00:03:09.099> much

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
anything over 40 feet you're pretty much

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.890 
anything over 40 feet you're pretty much
on<00:03:09.489> your<00:03:09.519> own<00:03:09.819> though<00:03:10.030> those<00:03:10.299> are<00:03:10.450> tough<00:03:10.660> ones

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
on your own though those are tough ones

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.170 
on your own though those are tough ones
to<00:03:11.079> make<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:12.160> how<00:03:12.280> do<00:03:12.340> people<00:03:12.640> get<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.910> correct

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
to make so how do people get the correct

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.630 
to make so how do people get the correct
percentages<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.989> putt<00:03:14.170> some<00:03:15.010> people<00:03:15.340> use

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
percentages on the putt some people use

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.699 
percentages on the putt some people use
that<00:03:15.940> ball<00:03:16.239> in<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.810> bottom<00:03:17.079> left<00:03:17.290> portion<00:03:17.530> of

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
that ball in the bottom left portion of

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.759 
that ball in the bottom left portion of
the<00:03:17.769> screen<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:19.269> help<00:03:19.480> them<00:03:19.720> some<00:03:20.319> people<00:03:20.500> will

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
the screen to help them some people will

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.979 
the screen to help them some people will
use<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.099> actual<00:03:21.370> putter<00:03:21.670> animation<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
use the actual putter animation the

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.569 
use the actual putter animation the
important<00:03:23.380> thing<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.650> think<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.069> keep<00:03:24.400> in

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
important thing I think is to keep in

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.640 
important thing I think is to keep in
mind<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.390> as<00:03:25.540> soon<00:03:25.720> as<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.019> pull<00:03:26.260> back<00:03:26.410> on

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
mind is that as soon as you pull back on

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.949 
mind is that as soon as you pull back on
your<00:03:26.680> putter<00:03:27.069> that<00:03:27.370> invisible<00:03:28.269> putt<00:03:28.540> meter<00:03:28.750> is

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
your putter that invisible putt meter is

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.710 
your putter that invisible putt meter is
filling<00:03:29.380> up<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.739> as<00:03:29.920> soon<00:03:29.950> as<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.310> push

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
filling up and as soon as you push

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.900 
filling up and as soon as you push
forward<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.110> joystick<00:03:32.319> that<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.430> when

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
forward on the joystick that is when

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.120 
forward on the joystick that is when
it's<00:03:34.120> going<00:03:34.359> to<00:03:34.450> stop<00:03:34.780> filling<00:03:35.200> up<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:35.739> that's

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
it's going to stop filling up so that's

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.790 
it's going to stop filling up so that's
what<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:36.639> use<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.000> get<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.420> correct<00:03:37.660> percentage

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
what I use to get the correct percentage

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.290 
what I use to get the correct percentage
so<00:03:40.800> let's<00:03:40.980> start<00:03:41.190> here<00:03:41.340> by<00:03:41.580> looking<00:03:41.610> at<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.120> very

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
so let's start here by looking at a very

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.260 
so let's start here by looking at a very
short<00:03:42.600> putt<00:03:42.930> it's<00:03:43.860> very<00:03:44.130> easy<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.700> blow<00:03:45.090> these

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
short putt it's very easy to blow these

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.240 
short putt it's very easy to blow these
by<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.540> hole<00:03:45.840> if<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.230> don't<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.890> motion

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
by the hole if you don't have the motion

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.620 
by the hole if you don't have the motion
down<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.660> what<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> want<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.790> want<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.420> bowl

to roll about three feet so I want a 33%
swing<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:56.100> use<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.459> practice<00:03:56.760> swing

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
swing and you can use a practice swing

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.990 
swing and you can use a practice swing
to<00:03:57.330> help<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.660> get<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:57.959> 33%<00:03:58.730> but<00:03:59.730> what<00:03:59.880> I'm

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
to help you get that 33% but what I'm

to help you get that 33% but what I'm
doing<00:04:00.330> here<00:04:00.510> with<00:04:00.690> my<00:04:00.810> joystick<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:01.470> I'm<00:04:01.709> just

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
doing here with my joystick is I'm just

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.770 
doing here with my joystick is I'm just
flicking<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.670> as<00:04:02.820> soon<00:04:03.090> as<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.360> pull<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.750> back

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
flicking it as soon as I pull it back

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.410 
flicking it as soon as I pull it back
I'm<00:04:04.140> flicking<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.709> back<00:04:04.890> forward<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:06.090> just<00:04:06.330> a

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
I'm flicking it back forward it's just a

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.000 
I'm flicking it back forward it's just a
quick<00:04:06.660> flick<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.140> doesn't<00:04:07.410> really<00:04:07.500> matter<00:04:07.770> how

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
quick flick it doesn't really matter how

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.580 
quick flick it doesn't really matter how
far<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.430> bring<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.730> back<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.209> how<00:04:10.140> quickly

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
far you bring it back it's how quickly

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.170 
far you bring it back it's how quickly
you<00:04:10.890> do<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.190> forward<00:04:11.459> after<00:04:11.820> you've<00:04:11.940> brought

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
you do the forward after you've brought

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.140 
you do the forward after you've brought
it<00:04:12.330> back<00:04:13.250> okay<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.310> let's<00:04:14.610> put<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:15.060> all

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
it back okay so let's put it all

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.199 
it back okay so let's put it all
together<00:04:15.360> here<00:04:16.250> first<00:04:17.250> thing<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.579> do<00:04:17.640> when<00:04:18.180> I

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
together here first thing I do when I

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.210 
together here first thing I do when I
lining<00:04:18.660> up<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.930> putt<00:04:19.140> is<00:04:19.380> I'm<00:04:19.620> going<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.829> try<00:04:20.010> and

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
lining up a putt is I'm going to try and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.640 
lining up a putt is I'm going to try and
guess<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:21.359> left<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.720> right<00:04:21.900> break<00:04:22.169> again

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
guess the left and right break again

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.520 
guess the left and right break again
this<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.980> feel<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.250> just<00:04:23.430> comes<00:04:23.820> with<00:04:24.030> practice

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
this is feel it just comes with practice

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.080 
this is feel it just comes with practice
next<00:04:25.530> thing<00:04:25.680> I'm<00:04:25.800> going<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:25.980> do<00:04:26.100> is<00:04:26.220> adjust<00:04:26.340> for

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
next thing I'm going to do is adjust for

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.810 
next thing I'm going to do is adjust for
green<00:04:27.390> speed<00:04:27.720> I'm<00:04:27.900> on<00:04:28.050> tournament<00:04:28.560> mode<00:04:28.740> so<00:04:29.220> at

is<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:38.190> want<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.669> see<00:04:38.850> let's<00:04:39.180> see<00:04:39.360> 27<00:04:40.260> feet<00:04:40.620> I

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
is I want to see let's see 27 feet I

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.340 
is I want to see let's see 27 feet I
want<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:41.100> hit<00:04:41.190> it<00:04:41.340> about<00:04:41.460> 72%<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:43.020> I'm<00:04:43.200> gonna

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
want to hit it about 72% so I'm gonna

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.200 
want to hit it about 72% so I'm gonna
try<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:44.040> get<00:04:44.160> my<00:04:44.310> timing<00:04:44.669> down<00:04:45.090> on<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.440> 72%<00:04:46.440> putt

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
try and get my timing down on a 72% putt

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.120 
try and get my timing down on a 72% putt
and<00:04:48.210> then<00:04:48.660> it's<00:04:48.810> just<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.110> matter<00:04:49.290> of<00:04:49.470> executing

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
and then it's just a matter of executing

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.640 
and then it's just a matter of executing
that<00:04:50.340> seventy-two<00:04:50.970> percent<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.810> as<00:04:51.990> soon<00:04:52.200> as<00:04:52.350> I

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
that seventy-two percent so as soon as I

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.250 
that seventy-two percent so as soon as I
pull<00:04:53.160> back<00:04:53.190> I'm<00:04:53.729> waiting<00:04:54.540> until<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.840> think<00:04:54.900> it's

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
pull back I'm waiting until I think it's

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.120 
pull back I'm waiting until I think it's
72%<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.520> then<00:04:57.210> hit<00:04:57.390> my<00:04:57.540> path<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.440> while<00:04:59.100> I

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
72% and then hit my path and while I

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.430 
72% and then hit my path and while I
didn't<00:04:59.610> make<00:04:59.790> my<00:05:00.000> putt<00:05:00.060> can't<00:05:00.810> do<00:05:01.050> better<00:05:01.260> than

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
didn't make my putt can't do better than

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.820 
didn't make my putt can't do better than
that

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
that

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.860 
that
I've<00:05:02.040> at<00:05:02.250> least<00:05:02.280> got<00:05:02.580> my<00:05:02.850> speed<00:05:03.210> correct<00:05:03.660> so

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
I've at least got my speed correct so

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.680 
I've at least got my speed correct so
I've<00:05:04.020> left<00:05:04.200> myself<00:05:04.410> an<00:05:04.800> easy<00:05:04.979> tap-in

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
I've left myself an easy tap-in

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.659 
I've left myself an easy tap-in
and<00:05:06.690> here's<00:05:07.200> another<00:05:07.290> long<00:05:07.860> putt<00:05:08.160> we'll<00:05:08.430> put

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
and here's another long putt we'll put

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.880 
and here's another long putt we'll put
everything<00:05:08.910> into<00:05:09.270> play<00:05:09.630> first<00:05:10.350> adjust<00:05:10.770> for

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
everything into play first adjust for

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.030 
everything into play first adjust for
the<00:05:11.400> break<00:05:11.820> that's<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.479> guesstimate<00:05:12.990> next<00:05:13.950> you

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
the break that's a guesstimate next you

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.680 
the break that's a guesstimate next you
want<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.310> adjust<00:05:14.400> for<00:05:14.729> elevation<00:05:14.850> it's<00:05:15.479> two

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
want to adjust for elevation it's two

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.719 
want to adjust for elevation it's two
feet<00:05:15.960> up<00:05:16.140> with<00:05:16.560> an<00:05:16.710> inch<00:05:16.890> equals<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:17.370> foot<00:05:17.400> we

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
feet up with an inch equals a foot we

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.590 
feet up with an inch equals a foot we
want<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.030> add<00:05:18.150> 24<00:05:18.990> feet<00:05:19.290> puts<00:05:19.860> us<00:05:20.010> at<00:05:20.160> 86<00:05:20.729> this

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
want to add 24 feet puts us at 86 this

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.570 
want to add 24 feet puts us at 86 this
is<00:05:21.780> on<00:05:21.900> fast<00:05:22.200> green<00:05:22.560> so<00:05:22.800> we<00:05:22.830> want<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.220> take<00:05:23.400> off

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
is on fast green so we want to take off

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.529 
is on fast green so we want to take off
30%<00:05:24.419> so<00:05:24.900> that<00:05:25.080> puts<00:05:25.320> me<00:05:25.470> back<00:05:25.650> about<00:05:25.800> 60<00:05:26.370> per<00:05:26.539> 60

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
30% so that puts me back about 60 per 60

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.529 
30% so that puts me back about 60 per 60
feet<00:05:27.780> that<00:05:28.200> I<00:05:28.229> want<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.530> hit<00:05:28.620> this<00:05:28.800> putt<00:05:29.039> and

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
feet that I want to hit this putt and

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.000 
feet that I want to hit this putt and
then<00:05:30.539> it's<00:05:30.690> just<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.930> matter<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.200> executing<00:05:31.410> the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
then it's just a matter of executing the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.219 
then it's just a matter of executing the
timing<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.640> get<00:05:32.760> it<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:33.000> roll<00:05:33.150> 60<00:05:33.660> feet<00:05:33.900> so

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
timing to get it to roll 60 feet so

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.430 
timing to get it to roll 60 feet so
