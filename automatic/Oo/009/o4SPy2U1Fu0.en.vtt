drivers they come with for booty shots

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.429 
drivers they come with for booty shots
and<00:00:29.119> have<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.630> strength<00:00:31.109> free<00:00:31.199> technology

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
and have the strength free technology

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.569 
and have the strength free technology
that<00:00:31.740> Mike's<00:00:31.890> been<00:00:32.070> using<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.460> couple

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
that Mike's been using it for a couple

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.280 
that Mike's been using it for a couple
of<00:00:32.730> years<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.840> change<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> face

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
of years now so you can change the face

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.049 
of years now so you can change the face
angle<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.649> trajectory<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.219> knowledge<00:00:35.940> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
angle in trajectory and knowledge of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.150 
angle in trajectory and knowledge of
different<00:00:36.300> angles<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.630> things<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
different angles and things like that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.220 
different angles and things like that
the<00:00:38.160> shafts<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.790> very<00:00:38.910> lightweight<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the shafts are very lightweight and the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.470 
the shafts are very lightweight and the
actual<00:00:40.350> drivers<00:00:40.920> hold<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.940> compression

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
actual drivers hold the compression

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750 
actual drivers hold the compression
technology<00:00:42.899> basically<00:00:43.890> reduces<00:00:44.309> drag<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
technology basically reduces drag and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.450 
technology basically reduces drag and
creates<00:00:45.539> more<00:00:45.750> aerodynamic<00:00:46.379> efficiency<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
creates more aerodynamic efficiency it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.920 
creates more aerodynamic efficiency it
allows<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> swing<00:00:48.180> through<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.600> ball<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
allows you to swing through the ball a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.709 
allows you to swing through the ball a
lot<00:00:49.140> easier<00:00:49.320> create<00:00:50.190> more<00:00:50.280> club<00:00:50.489> head<00:00:50.520> speed

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
lot easier create more club head speed

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.959 
lot easier create more club head speed
hittable<00:00:51.719> greater<00:00:52.199> distances<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.309> go<00:00:53.699> very

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
hittable greater distances to go very

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
hittable greater distances to go very
good<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.510> any<00:00:54.660> drivers<00:00:56.480> here<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
good for any drivers here we have the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.090 
good for any drivers here we have the

the octane black tour these come with

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.770 
the octane black tour these come with
very<00:01:10.920> high<00:01:11.130> end<00:01:11.310> project<00:01:11.760> x<00:01:11.880> jaws<00:01:12.090> which<00:01:12.510> are

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
very high end project x jaws which are

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.590 
very high end project x jaws which are
pretty<00:01:13.260> rare<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> find<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.950> standard<00:01:14.400> and

pretty rare to find a standard and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
pretty rare to find a standard and
they've<00:01:15.600> got<00:01:15.630> no<00:01:15.869> real<00:01:16.350> technology<00:01:16.770> speak<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
they've got no real technology speak of

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.679 
they've got no real technology speak of
as<00:01:17.189> such<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.450> literally

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
as such but it's just so it's literally

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.429 
as such but it's just so it's literally
just<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> driver<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:21.540> octane<00:01:22.049> black

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
just you and the driver the octane black

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.480 
just you and the driver the octane black
tour<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> slightly<00:01:23.460> smaller<00:01:23.610> head<00:01:24.150> than

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
tour is a slightly smaller head than

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
tour is a slightly smaller head than
normal<00:01:26.490> octane<00:01:26.759> black<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> octane<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
normal octane black and the octane the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.590 
normal octane black and the octane the
tall<00:01:28.530> actually<00:01:28.950> comes<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.369> degree<00:01:29.610> open<00:01:29.909> so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
tall actually comes one degree open so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.410 
tall actually comes one degree open so
it<00:01:30.900> sets<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.560> slightly<00:01:32.400> open<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.909> target<00:01:33.299> which

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it sets up slightly open to target which

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.640 
it sets up slightly open to target which
is<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> good<00:01:34.049> features<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.470> have

into<00:01:52.829> these<00:01:52.950> drivers<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.970> again<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.540> emphasis

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
into these drivers so again the emphasis

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.440 
into these drivers so again the emphasis
on<00:01:55.020> lightweight<00:01:56.060> drivers<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.329> actually

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
on lightweight drivers that can actually

roll out onto the floor so two new
drivers<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:24.100> they'll<00:02:24.190> both<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.700> very

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
drivers and I think they'll both be very

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.260 
drivers and I think they'll both be very
very<00:02:25.210> popular<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:27.460> let's<00:02:27.610> just<00:02:27.790> summarizing

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
very popular so let's just summarizing

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.880 
very popular so let's just summarizing
those<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.690> drive<00:02:28.930> those<00:02:29.170> well<00:02:29.470> there's<00:02:29.710> four

those to drive those well there's four

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.430 
those to drive those well there's four
drivers<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.870> hopes<00:02:31.870> giving<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> little
