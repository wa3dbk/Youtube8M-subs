energy<00:02:21.860> wedge<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.240> when<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.810> get<00:02:24.230> hit<00:02:24.440> here

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
energy wedge so it when you get hit here

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.490 
energy wedge so it when you get hit here
it<00:02:25.370> compresses<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.510> takes<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:28.209> impact<00:02:29.209> now<00:02:30.140> I

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
it compresses and takes the impact now I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.400 
it compresses and takes the impact now I
actually<00:02:31.190> have<00:02:31.640> one<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:31.970> these<00:02:32.060> out<00:02:32.300> here<00:02:32.510> from

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
actually have one of these out here from

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
actually have one of these out here from
the<00:02:33.530> old<00:02:33.800> chin<00:02:34.100> cup<00:02:34.280> there<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.120> old<00:02:35.240> face<00:02:35.780> mask

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
the old chin cup there the old face mask

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.710 
the old chin cup there the old face mask
that's<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.700> one<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:37.940> came<00:02:38.060> from<00:02:38.240> my<00:02:38.360> old<00:02:38.480> one

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
that's the one that came from my old one

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.570 
that's the one that came from my old one
and<00:02:39.410> they<00:02:39.560> sent<00:02:39.770> me<00:02:39.860> new<00:02:39.980> one<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.520> put

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
and they sent me new one so I just put

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.710 
and they sent me new one so I just put
them<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:41.560> its<00:02:42.560> rubber<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.790> pretty<00:02:44.450> hard<00:02:44.630> to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
them in its rubber it's pretty hard to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.790 
them in its rubber it's pretty hard to
compress<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.910> smaller<00:02:47.239> hits<00:02:47.620> would<00:02:48.620> only

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
compress the smaller hits would only

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.650 
compress the smaller hits would only
compress<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.430> little<00:02:49.550> bit<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.420> still

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
compress it a little bit so it still

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.150 
compress it a little bit so it still
take<00:02:50.870> mostly<00:02:51.230> impact<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.769> he'll<00:02:52.070> only

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
take mostly impact but he'll only

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.740 
take mostly impact but he'll only
compresses<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.700> bit<00:02:55.090> which<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.390> big<00:02:56.540> ones

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
compresses a bit which is the big ones

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.600 
compresses a bit which is the big ones
it'll<00:02:57.050> completely<00:02:57.920> compress<00:02:58.430> pretty<00:02:58.700> much<00:03:00.610> so

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
it'll completely compress pretty much so

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.800 
it'll completely compress pretty much so
the<00:03:01.940> inside<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:03.380> helmet<00:03:03.800> as<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.570> see

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
the inside of this helmet as you can see

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.890 
the inside of this helmet as you can see
that's<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.410> inside<00:03:06.739> as<00:03:07.370> TPU<00:03:08.300> everywhere

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
that's the inside as TPU everywhere

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.080 
that's the inside as TPU everywhere
which<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.830> cone-shaped<00:03:11.260> material<00:03:12.260> it's

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
which is a cone-shaped material it's

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.729 
which is a cone-shaped material it's
it's<00:03:14.090> kind<00:03:14.360> of<00:03:14.390> like<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.690> plasticky<00:03:15.470> stuff

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
it's kind of like this plasticky stuff

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.920 
it's kind of like this plasticky stuff
but<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.160> really<00:03:16.430> absorbs<00:03:16.580> well<00:03:17.060> but<00:03:17.720> what<00:03:17.840> I've

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
but it really absorbs well but what I've

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.199 
but it really absorbs well but what I've
noticed<00:03:18.110> just<00:03:18.410> like<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.829> actual<00:03:19.160> liner<00:03:19.489> when

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
noticed just like the actual liner when

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.080 
noticed just like the actual liner when
it<00:03:20.299> gets<00:03:20.360> cold<00:03:20.750> starts<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.620> shrink<00:03:21.769> so<00:03:22.760> yeah

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
it gets cold starts to shrink so yeah

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.330 
it gets cold starts to shrink so yeah
this<00:03:23.420> thing<00:03:23.630> actually<00:03:23.890> starts<00:03:24.890> slipping<00:03:25.100> off

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
this thing actually starts slipping off

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.880 
this thing actually starts slipping off
my<00:03:25.549> head<00:03:25.760> when<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:26.600> play<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.079> cold<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:27.860> i

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
my head when I play in the cold so i

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.410 
my head when I play in the cold so i
don't<00:03:28.250> really<00:03:28.370> like<00:03:28.459> using<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:28.970> for<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.209> gold

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
don't really like using it for the gold

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.949 
don't really like using it for the gold
but<00:03:30.170> that's<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.680> um<00:03:31.450> job<00:03:32.450> pads<00:03:32.690> are<00:03:32.930> not

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
but that's it um job pads are not

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.900 
but that's it um job pads are not
inflatable<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.680> can't<00:03:36.920> get<00:03:37.130> inflatable<00:03:37.790> ones

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
inflatable you can't get inflatable ones

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.940 
inflatable you can't get inflatable ones
it's<00:03:38.239> not<00:03:38.390> like<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.630> word<00:03:38.750> else<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.560> have<00:03:39.829> to

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
it's not like the word else you have to

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.240 
it's not like the word else you have to
find<00:03:40.190> your<00:03:40.430> size<00:03:43.299> it<00:03:44.299> also<00:03:44.450> has<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:45.470> stuff

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
find your size it also has this stuff

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.020 
find your size it also has this stuff
that's<00:03:46.660> quarter<00:03:47.660> turn<00:03:47.840> release<00:03:48.170> it's<00:03:49.100> like

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
that's quarter turn release it's like

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.670 
that's quarter turn release it's like
this<00:03:50.360> stuff<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.780> riddle<00:03:51.019> except<00:03:51.470> instead

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
this stuff on the riddle except instead

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.890 
this stuff on the riddle except instead
of<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:51.890> Radel<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.820> just<00:03:53.000> poke<00:03:53.269> it<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.630> it

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
of the Radel you just poke it and it

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.020 
of the Radel you just poke it and it
pops<00:03:54.110> off<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:55.130> have<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.370> push<00:03:55.670> down<00:03:55.880> and

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
pops off this you have to push down and

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.060 
pops off this you have to push down and
then<00:03:56.150> turn<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.600> it's<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.620> quarter<00:03:57.860> turn

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
then turn and it's just a quarter turn

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.150 
then turn and it's just a quarter turn
and<00:03:58.130> then<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.459> springs<00:03:58.850> out<00:03:59.829> to<00:04:00.829> inflation

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
and then it springs out to inflation

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.289 
and then it springs out to inflation
points<00:04:01.610> for<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.540> top<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.160> back<00:04:04.160> insides<00:04:04.549> it

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
points for a top and back insides it

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.930 
points for a top and back insides it
does<00:04:05.600> not<00:04:05.750> cradle<00:04:06.320> your<00:04:07.070> head<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.910> just

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
does not cradle your head that just

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.550 
does not cradle your head that just
pushes<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:08.900> forward<00:04:09.739> into<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.310> front<00:04:10.880> pad<00:04:11.060> I

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
pushes it forward into the front pad I

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.009 
pushes it forward into the front pad I
prefer<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.950> 360<00:04:13.820> at<00:04:14.209> least<00:04:14.359> in<00:04:14.570> terms<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.900> that

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
prefer the 360 at least in terms of that

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.210 
prefer the 360 at least in terms of that
because<00:04:15.320> it<00:04:15.470> actually<00:04:15.590> cradles<00:04:16.039> your<00:04:16.130> head

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
because it actually cradles your head

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.250 
because it actually cradles your head
which<00:04:16.430> helps<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.760> keeps<00:04:16.940> on<00:04:17.090> keep<00:04:17.750> on<00:04:17.930> that's

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
which helps it keeps on keep on that's

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.070 
which helps it keeps on keep on that's
just<00:04:18.590> personal<00:04:18.769> opinion<00:04:19.220> um<00:04:19.880> so<00:04:20.780> that's

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
just personal opinion um so that's

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.820 
just personal opinion um so that's
pretty<00:04:21.470> much<00:04:21.530> shut<00:04:22.160> on<00:04:22.370> 4d<00:04:23.410> that's<00:04:24.410> the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
pretty much shut on 4d that's the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.649 
pretty much shut on 4d that's the
