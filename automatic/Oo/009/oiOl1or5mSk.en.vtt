the<00:01:10.260> bottom<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> barrel<00:01:11.430> um<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:12.270> will

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the bottom of the barrel um they will

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390 
the bottom of the barrel um they will
touch<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.990> viewed<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
touch I viewed I was on it from a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.399

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260 
be able to get some better interest
rates<00:01:39.960> maybe<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.470> will<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:40.770> lower<00:01:41.460> fare<00:01:41.939> or

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
rates maybe it will get lower fare or

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.950 
rates maybe it will get lower fare or
lower<00:01:42.450> fees<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:45.540> though<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
lower fees and it really though what I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.300 
lower fees and it really though what I
found<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:46.860> an<00:01:46.979> issue<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
found is it's really an issue of
