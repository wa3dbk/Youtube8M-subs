00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
slackline without using a ratchet as you

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.640 
slackline without using a ratchet as you
guys<00:00:24.150> might<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.539> I'm<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.019> huge<00:00:25.199> fan<00:00:25.289> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
guys might know I'm not a huge fan of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.589 
guys might know I'm not a huge fan of
using<00:00:25.769> ratchets<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:27.029> don't<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:27.390> them

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
using ratchets I just don't like them

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.450 
using ratchets I just don't like them
they<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.349> know<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:28.590> eat<00:00:28.769> your<00:00:28.920> webbing<00:00:29.279> they

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
they you know they eat your webbing they

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.740 
they you know they eat your webbing they
pinch<00:00:29.670> your<00:00:29.789> fingers<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.269> bleed<00:00:30.480> everywhere

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
pinch your fingers you bleed everywhere

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.450 
pinch your fingers you bleed everywhere
sometimes<00:00:31.320> they<00:00:31.470> explode<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.279> they're

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
sometimes they explode it's just they're

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.250 
sometimes they explode it's just they're
not<00:00:32.579> good<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.480> plain<00:00:34.079> old

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
not good I like you know plain old

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.979 
not good I like you know plain old
mechanical<00:00:34.800> pulley<00:00:34.980> style<00:00:35.399> physics<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:36.960> I

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
mechanical pulley style physics so I

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.440 
mechanical pulley style physics so I
have<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.410> me<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.910> two-inch<00:00:38.910> line<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.390> my

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
have with me a two-inch line here in my

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.060 
have with me a two-inch line here in my
hand<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:40.020> happens<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.620> given<00:00:40.890> line

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
hand this happens to be a given line

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.740 
hand this happens to be a given line
these<00:00:41.850> are<00:00:42.000> pretty<00:00:42.120> fun<00:00:42.329> lines<00:00:42.540> they're

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
these are pretty fun lines they're

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.270 
these are pretty fun lines they're
really<00:00:42.930> good<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.260> acrobatics<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.010> tricks

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
really good for acrobatics and tricks

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.160 
really good for acrobatics and tricks
and<00:00:44.399> stuff<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.390> really<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and stuff I think really that's the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.229 
and stuff I think really that's the
benefit<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.710> two-inch<00:00:47.010> line<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.430> they're

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
benefit of a two-inch line is they're

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.700 
benefit of a two-inch line is they're
not<00:00:48.420> very<00:00:48.480> slack<00:00:49.020> they're<00:00:49.289> actually<00:00:49.530> pretty

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
not very slack they're actually pretty

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.290 
not very slack they're actually pretty
tight<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> lot<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.789> acrobatics

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
tight so you can do a lot of acrobatics

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.939 
tight so you can do a lot of acrobatics
on<00:00:51.449> them<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.750> don't<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.440> consider<00:00:52.620> them

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
on them I don't really consider them

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740 
on them I don't really consider them
slack<00:00:53.250> lines<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:53.910> they're<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.270> fun<00:00:54.480> for

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
slack lines but they're really fun for

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.450 
slack lines but they're really fun for
what<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.770> know<00:00:55.860> there's<00:00:56.039> sort<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
what they are you know there's sort of a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.599 
what they are you know there's sort of a
sports<00:00:56.760> car<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.300> slack<00:00:58.199> lining<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
sports car of slack lining so if you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.189 
sports car of slack lining so if you
know<00:00:59.730> that's<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.270> want<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.780> sort

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
know that's what you want is that sort

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.380 
know that's what you want is that sort
of<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.410> tight<00:01:01.710> springy<00:01:02.579> factor<00:01:03.059> then<00:01:03.239> go

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
of really tight springy factor then go

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.560 
of really tight springy factor then go
for<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> Gibbon<00:01:05.100> line<00:01:05.450> down<00:01:06.450> at

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
for it so I have a Gibbon line down at

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.670 
for it so I have a Gibbon line down at
that<00:01:06.659> end<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> line<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.560> I've

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that end of the line you can see I've

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.170 
that end of the line you can see I've
just<00:01:07.710> hooked<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> carabiner<00:01:08.790> given

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
just hooked it up with a carabiner given

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.480 
just hooked it up with a carabiner given
its<00:01:09.270> nice<00:01:09.390> enough<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.830> sew<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> loop<00:01:11.130> into<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
its nice enough to sew a loop into the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.789 
its nice enough to sew a loop into the
end<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.880> me<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.900> one<00:01:16.080> end<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> hooking

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
end for me so for one end of it hooking

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
end for me so for one end of it hooking
it<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.159> no<00:01:17.310> big<00:01:17.490> deal<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.180> like

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it up is no big deal you do it just like

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.910 
it up is no big deal you do it just like
ubin<00:01:18.570> will<00:01:18.689> tell<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.770> also

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
ubin will tell you to do you can also

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.450 
ubin will tell you to do you can also
use<00:01:21.080> just<00:01:22.080> regular<00:01:22.140> two-inch<00:01:22.920> tubular

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
use just regular two-inch tubular

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
use just regular two-inch tubular
webbing<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.939> buy<00:01:24.090> at<00:01:24.150> REI<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.780> 64<00:01:25.229> cents

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
webbing that you buy at REI for 64 cents

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.410 
webbing that you buy at REI for 64 cents
a<00:01:25.560> foot<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.240> would<00:01:27.390> have

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
a foot and if you do that you would have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.910 
a foot and if you do that you would have
fixed<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.960> end<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> other<00:01:28.650> trick

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
fixed at that end with the other trick

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.039 
fixed at that end with the other trick
I'm<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> show<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.420> when<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.810> want<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I'm about to show you so when we want to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.069 
I'm about to show you so when we want to
set<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.380> basically<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.900> three<00:01:33.900> into

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
set it up basically like a three into

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.710 
set it up basically like a three into
one<00:01:34.110> primitive<00:01:34.650> system<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:36.210> measure<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.600> out

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
one primitive system you measure it out

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.749 
one primitive system you measure it out
and<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> distance<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.640> you're

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
and you get to the distance that you're

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.870 
and you get to the distance that you're
going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> normally<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.270> at<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.930> I'll<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.619> say

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
going to normally be at so I'll just say

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.680 
going to normally be at so I'll just say
right<00:01:41.880> about<00:01:41.970> here

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.930 

and<00:01:44.780> then<00:01:45.440> here's<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.710> trick<00:01:46.010> is<00:01:46.190> instead<00:01:46.880> of

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
and then here's the trick is instead of

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.400 
and then here's the trick is instead of
just<00:01:47.060> passing<00:01:47.600> this<00:01:47.780> through<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:48.020> lock<00:01:48.230> ring

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
just passing this through a lock ring

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.490 
just passing this through a lock ring
you<00:01:49.250> take<00:01:49.430> some<00:01:49.580> 1<00:01:49.760> inch<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.290> you're<00:01:51.290> going<00:01:51.440> to

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
you take some 1 inch and you're going to

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.910 
you take some 1 inch and you're going to
need<00:01:51.680> about<00:01:52.780> at<00:01:53.780> least<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.260> would<00:01:54.380> say<00:01:54.530> 10<00:01:54.710> feet

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
need about at least I would say 10 feet

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.710 
need about at least I would say 10 feet
maybe<00:01:55.190> closer<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.610> 15<00:01:55.970> feet<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.300> depends<00:01:56.660> on

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
maybe closer to 15 feet it depends on

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.600 
maybe closer to 15 feet it depends on
the<00:01:56.870> size<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.080> your<00:01:57.200> line<00:01:57.470> but<00:01:58.370> it's<00:01:58.460> going<00:01:58.550> to

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
the size of your line but it's going to

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.480 
the size of your line but it's going to
be<00:01:58.700> 3<00:01:58.850> times<00:01:59.000> whatever<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.480> gap<00:01:59.630> is<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:01.310> take

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
be 3 times whatever the gap is you take

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.600 
be 3 times whatever the gap is you take
that<00:02:01.640> 1<00:02:01.820> inch<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.620> you<00:02:03.770> fold<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.130> 1<00:02:04.280> inch<00:02:04.460> over

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
that 1 inch and you fold the 1 inch over

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.920 
that 1 inch and you fold the 1 inch over
and<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:06.350> tuck<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.710> back<00:02:06.920> inside<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.600> 2<00:02:08.600> inch

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.660 

so<00:02:11.930> I'll<00:02:12.260> try<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.500> make<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:12.920> be<00:02:13.130> able<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.550> see

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
so I'll try to make you be able to see

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.360 
so I'll try to make you be able to see
what<00:02:13.760> I'm<00:02:13.850> doing<00:02:13.880> here<00:02:14.180> got<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> 2<00:02:15.080> inch

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.650 

tucked<00:02:19.370> inside<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.910> one<00:02:20.060> or<00:02:20.360> though<00:02:20.540> I'm

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
tucked inside the one or though I'm

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.880 
tucked inside the one or though I'm
sorry<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.930> 1<00:02:21.050> inch<00:02:21.200> tucked<00:02:21.410> inside<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.740> 2

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
sorry the 1 inch tucked inside the 2

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.860 
sorry the 1 inch tucked inside the 2
inch<00:02:22.300> folded<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.390> over<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:26.540> time<00:02:26.750> I'm

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
inch folded it over and this time I'm

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.290 
inch folded it over and this time I'm
going<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.050> use<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.230> 2<00:02:27.890> inch<00:02:28.100> walk<00:02:28.700> ring<00:02:28.970> instead

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
going to use a 2 inch walk ring instead

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.620 
going to use a 2 inch walk ring instead
of<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.480> normal<00:02:29.600> one<00:02:29.840> inch<00:02:30.020> lock<00:02:30.200> ring<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.390> pass

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
of a normal one inch lock ring so I pass

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.310 
of a normal one inch lock ring so I pass
it<00:02:32.810> through<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.110> loop<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.620> like<00:02:33.710> normal

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.680 

pass<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.560> through<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.800> loop<00:02:39.830> again

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.570 

so<00:02:45.260> I've<00:02:45.380> got<00:02:45.500> all<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:45.770> sandwiched<00:02:46.190> in<00:02:46.370> here

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
so I've got all this sandwiched in here

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.090 
so I've got all this sandwiched in here
and<00:02:46.900> then<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:49.570> use<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.810> non<00:02:51.110> oval<00:02:51.650> beaner<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:51.950> use<00:02:52.070> a

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
and then I use a non oval beaner I use a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.430 
and then I use a non oval beaner I use a
pear-shaped<00:02:52.490> beaner<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.690> passed<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.140> fat

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
pear-shaped beaner and I passed the fat

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.530 
pear-shaped beaner and I passed the fat
end<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.800> beaner<00:02:55.090> through<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.180> loop<00:02:56.360> and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
end of the beaner through the loop and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.970 
end of the beaner through the loop and
leave<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.780> there<00:02:56.960> you<00:02:57.140> want<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.710> be<00:02:57.800> careful

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
leave it there you want to be careful

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.500 
leave it there you want to be careful
not<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.280> use<00:02:58.490> an<00:02:58.610> oval<00:02:58.820> because<00:02:59.090> an<00:02:59.210> oval

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
not to use an oval because an oval

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.510 
not to use an oval because an oval
beaner<00:02:59.720> is<00:03:00.380> too<00:03:00.620> thin<00:03:00.860> it's<00:03:01.010> not<00:03:01.160> two<00:03:01.310> inches

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
beaner is too thin it's not two inches

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.040 
beaner is too thin it's not two inches
wide<00:03:01.580> here<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.480> will<00:03:02.540> end<00:03:02.690> up<00:03:02.780> pinching

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
wide here and it will end up pinching

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.290 
wide here and it will end up pinching
the<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.740> fabric<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.580> sort<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:04.820> burning<00:03:05.060> it

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
the the fabric and sort of burning it

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.480 
the the fabric and sort of burning it
and<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:05.630> causing<00:03:06.020> issues<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.220> sort<00:03:07.400> of

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
and just causing issues and I sort of

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.000 
and just causing issues and I sort of
learned<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.910> hard<00:03:08.030> way<00:03:08.210> unfortunately

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
learned that the hard way unfortunately

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.000 
learned that the hard way unfortunately
then<00:03:10.010> from<00:03:10.250> here<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.810> beauty<00:03:12.080> part<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.440> that

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
then from here the beauty part is that

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.850 
then from here the beauty part is that
you've<00:03:13.610> got<00:03:13.820> this<00:03:14.000> nice<00:03:14.210> 1<00:03:14.510> inch<00:03:14.660> line<00:03:14.930> affixed

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
you've got this nice 1 inch line affixed

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.910 
you've got this nice 1 inch line affixed
and<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.670> can<00:03:16.850> just<00:03:17.090> treat<00:03:17.330> this<00:03:17.590> like<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:18.620> a

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
and you can just treat this like it's a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:32.860 
and you can just treat this like it's a
one<00:03:19.550> inch<00:03:19.700> primitive

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:43.880 

so<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.930> go<00:03:34.080> underneath<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:39.120> go<00:03:42.560> doing<00:03:43.560> here

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
so I go underneath and I go doing here

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:57.260 
so I go underneath and I go doing here
and<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.190> go<00:03:44.340> underneath<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:56.760> go<00:03:56.910> over<00:03:57.150> the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
and I go underneath and I go over the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:11.410 
and I go underneath and I go over the
top

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.619 

and<00:04:12.420> then<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.989> last<00:04:13.140> step<00:04:13.319> is<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:13.859> go

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
and then the last step is that I go

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:21.439 
and then the last step is that I go
inside<00:04:15.889> and<00:04:16.889> I<00:04:17.310> tuck<00:04:17.519> this<00:04:17.669> loop<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:20.609> then

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
inside and I tuck this loop and then

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.420 
inside and I tuck this loop and then
just<00:04:21.479> for<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.259> know<00:04:22.350> safety<00:04:22.770> factor<00:04:23.130> I'll<00:04:23.250> go

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
just for you know safety factor I'll go

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.620 
just for you know safety factor I'll go
since<00:04:23.639> these<00:04:23.759> are<00:04:23.910> all<00:04:23.940> lucky<00:04:24.180> beaters<00:04:24.600> and

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
since these are all lucky beaters and

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.020 
since these are all lucky beaters and
just<00:04:25.410> screw<00:04:25.680> down<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.889> de<00:04:26.400> gates<00:04:26.610> on<00:04:26.789> them<00:04:26.910> so

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
just screw down the de gates on them so

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:36.790 
just screw down the de gates on them so
they<00:04:27.120> can't<00:04:27.300> come<00:04:27.479> open<00:04:32.000> okay

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.670 

so<00:04:37.430> two-inch<00:04:38.110> because<00:04:39.110> it's<00:04:39.289> really<00:04:39.410> tight

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
so two-inch because it's really tight

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.420 
so two-inch because it's really tight
does<00:04:39.919> not<00:04:40.069> like<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.340> stretch<00:04:40.580> very<00:04:40.849> much<00:04:42.430> or

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
does not like to stretch very much or

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.589 
does not like to stretch very much or

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
because it doesn't like to stretch very

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.119 
because it doesn't like to stretch very
much<00:04:44.780> it's<00:04:44.960> really<00:04:45.169> tight<00:04:45.319> sort<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.770> chicken

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
much it's really tight sort of chicken

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.700 
much it's really tight sort of chicken
and<00:04:46.220> egg<00:04:46.310> kind<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.550> thing<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.990> by<00:04:48.319> yourself

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
and egg kind of thing so by yourself

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.080 
and egg kind of thing so by yourself
you're<00:04:49.190> probably<00:04:49.430> not<00:04:49.639> going<00:04:49.759> to<00:04:49.819> get<00:04:49.970> this

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
you're probably not going to get this

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.730 
you're probably not going to get this
tight<00:04:50.300> enough<00:04:50.479> to<00:04:51.080> do<00:04:51.259> much<00:04:51.440> more<00:04:51.680> than

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
tight enough to do much more than

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.520 
tight enough to do much more than
basically<00:04:52.430> be<00:04:52.759> sort<00:04:53.659> of<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.840> really<00:04:54.050> crappy

slackline it wobbles a lot but it

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.970 
to get a shot of that kids love slack
lines<00:05:56.480> to<00:05:57.480> know<00:05:57.600> if<00:05:57.720> I've<00:05:57.950> mentioned<00:05:58.950> that

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
lines to know if I've mentioned that

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:10.790 
lines to know if I've mentioned that
before<00:05:59.100> oh<00:06:07.880> I<00:06:08.880> didn't<00:06:09.150> twist<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.590> twist<00:06:10.590> the

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
before oh I didn't twist the twist the

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:21.610 
before oh I didn't twist the twist the
ring

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.589 

so<00:06:22.620> that's<00:06:22.800> pretty<00:06:22.949> tight<00:06:23.189> I<00:06:23.520> can<00:06:24.449> get<00:06:24.569> a

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
so that's pretty tight I can get a

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.270 
so that's pretty tight I can get a
little<00:06:24.870> tighter<00:06:25.050> but<00:06:25.289> that<00:06:25.949> covers<00:06:26.189> the

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
little tighter but that covers the

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.369 
little tighter but that covers the
basics<00:06:26.610> of<00:06:26.699> it<00:06:26.759> so<00:06:27.060> basically<00:06:27.659> we<00:06:27.930> just<00:06:28.110> adapt

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:28.379 
basics of it so basically we just adapt

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.159 
basics of it so basically we just adapt
a<00:06:28.590> three<00:06:29.159> into<00:06:29.310> one<00:06:29.460> system<00:06:29.719> to<00:06:30.719> the<00:06:30.840> two<00:06:30.990> inch

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
a three into one system to the two inch

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.379 
a three into one system to the two inch
by<00:06:31.949> using<00:06:32.129> a<00:06:32.310> two<00:06:32.430> inch<00:06:32.580> ring<00:06:32.819> and<00:06:33.060> a<00:06:33.150> pair<00:06:33.360> of

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
by using a two inch ring and a pair of

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.119 
by using a two inch ring and a pair of
 beaner<00:06:33.780> if<00:06:34.710> that<00:06:34.830> doesn't<00:06:35.009> make<00:06:35.069> sense

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 
 beaner if that doesn't make sense

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.080 
 beaner if that doesn't make sense
drop<00:06:35.550> me<00:06:35.639> an<00:06:35.699> email

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090
