of first one that is the more Jew of the
Beautyblender<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> dirty<00:00:23.730> one

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
Beautyblender and this is a dirty one

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.439 
Beautyblender and this is a dirty one
that<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.420> been<00:00:25.050> dampened<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.189> use<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.300> can

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that is been dampened and use so you can

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.660 
that is been dampened and use so you can
see<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> sort<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> difference<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.769> size<00:00:29.010> now

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670

probably<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.570> closest<00:00:34.260> I've<00:00:34.410> come<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.860> Jew

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

for the Beautyblender in terms of the
softness<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.100> them<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.399> perform<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.059> almost

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
these come really close and I wouldn't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.029 
these come really close and I wouldn't
be<00:00:50.239> unhappy<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:52.050> were<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.559> use<00:00:52.800> these

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
be unhappy if I were to just use these

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.850 
be unhappy if I were to just use these
at<00:00:53.309> all<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:54.570> perform<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> same<00:00:55.440> way<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
at all they perform in the same way and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.950 
at all they perform in the same way and
they<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.070> beautifully<00:00:56.550> soft<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.420> next<00:00:57.780> one

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
they are beautifully soft the next one

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
they are beautifully soft the next one
and<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.410> an<00:00:58.649> incredibly<00:00:59.039> soft<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.670> this

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and that's an incredibly soft one this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.330 
and that's an incredibly soft one this
one<00:01:00.449> has<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> same<00:01:00.870> softness<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.010> dry

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
one has the same softness this is dry

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.670 
one has the same softness this is dry
but<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.539> placed<00:01:03.780> into<00:01:04.110> water<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
but it can be placed into water and it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.760 
but it can be placed into water and it
will<00:01:04.799> increase<00:01:05.100> its<00:01:05.400> size<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.970> softness<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
will increase its size and softness the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.560 
will increase its size and softness the
this<00:01:08.159> has<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> point<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.060> believe

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this has a point to it and I believe

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.000 
this has a point to it and I believe
that<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:09.900> are<00:01:09.960> very<00:01:10.229> very<00:01:10.470> similar<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that these are very very similar to the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.620 
that these are very very similar to the
Real<00:01:11.159> Techniques<00:01:11.189> ones<00:01:11.729> which<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.299> used

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
Real Techniques ones which are not used

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
Real Techniques ones which are not used
or<00:01:12.840> seen<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:14.010> apparently<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.119> what

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
or seen but apparently that's what

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.850 
or seen but apparently that's what
people<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.509> saying<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.810> me<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.710> bear

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
people are saying to me so you can bear

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.570 
people are saying to me so you can bear
that<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.159> mind

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that in mind

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.240 
that in mind
it<00:01:17.909> has<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> slant<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> very<00:01:19.890> sharp

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it has a slant on it like a very sharp

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.219 
it has a slant on it like a very sharp
edge<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.970> apparently<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> I'll<00:01:21.900> go<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
edge which apparently and I'll go on to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:22.910 
edge which apparently and I'll go on to
the<00:01:22.380> next<00:01:22.560> one

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the next one

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.620 
the next one
you<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.549> winged<00:01:23.820> eyeliner<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.479> by

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
you can do winged eyeliner with by

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990 
you can do winged eyeliner with by
placing<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> stencil<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.820> good

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
placing here as a stencil these are good

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.399 
placing here as a stencil these are good
because<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.450> could<00:01:27.630> pack<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.110> color

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
because you could pack on color

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.920 
because you could pack on color
underneath<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> eyes<00:01:29.479> absolutely<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.810> can

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
underneath the eyes absolutely you can

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.450 
underneath the eyes absolutely you can
also<00:01:31.020> blend<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.650> course<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.130> your

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
also blend of course with all your

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.910 
also blend of course with all your
foundations<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> point<00:01:34.170> you're<00:01:34.530> able

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
foundations and with a point you're able

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.910 
foundations and with a point you're able
to<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.030> sharp<00:01:36.299> lines<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.380> comes<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
to go in for sharp lines then comes the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.200 
to go in for sharp lines then comes the
last<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.340> which<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> black<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
last one which is the black and this is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.569

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
really hard one this really is more for

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.950 
really hard one this really is more for
packing<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.770> powders<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.490> blending<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.690> those

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
packing on powders and blending of those

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.380 
packing on powders and blending of those
of<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.380> want<00:02:10.760> sort<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.820> more<00:02:12.060> harsh

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
of you want sort of more harsh

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.050 
of you want sort of more harsh
highlights<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.440> contouring<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> think

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
highlights and contouring but I think

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.120 
highlights and contouring but I think
they're<00:02:15.210> really<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:15.570> good<00:02:15.750> these<00:02:16.140> retail

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
they're really really good these retail

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.850 
they're really really good these retail
at<00:02:17.310> $5.99<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.600> obviously<00:02:19.020> it's<00:02:19.290> around<00:02:19.620> about

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
at $5.99 so obviously it's around about

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.490 
at $5.99 so obviously it's around about
three<00:02:20.250> times<00:02:20.660> less<00:02:21.660> than<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.200> Beautyblender

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
three times less than the Beautyblender

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.410 
three times less than the Beautyblender
so<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.130> bear<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.580> mind<00:02:23.610> same

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
so you can bear that in mind same

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.150 
so you can bear that in mind same
