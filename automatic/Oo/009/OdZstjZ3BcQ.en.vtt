a brake disk in order for them to work

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.430 
a brake disk in order for them to work
perfectly<00:00:12.549> together<00:00:12.760> avoiding<00:00:13.719> frictions

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440

perfectly together avoiding frictions
between<00:00:14.530> the<00:00:14.980> disc<00:00:15.219> and<00:00:15.459> the<00:00:15.520> caliper<00:00:15.850> which

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
between the disc and the caliper which

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.600 
between the disc and the caliper which
would<00:00:16.570> cause<00:00:16.779> uneven<00:00:17.410> wear<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:17.890> the<00:00:18.039> desk<00:00:18.310> and

would cause uneven wear and the desk and

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.169 
would cause uneven wear and the desk and
pants<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:20.170> will<00:00:20.320> use<00:00:20.619> a<00:00:20.830> size<00:00:21.279> 5<00:00:21.759> allen<00:00:22.330> key

the<00:00:35.079> two<00:00:35.289> bolts<00:00:37.289> Center<00:00:38.289> the<00:00:38.440> brake<00:00:38.710> caliper

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
the two bolts Center the brake caliper

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.060 
the two bolts Center the brake caliper
and<00:00:39.520> then<00:00:40.270> tighten<00:00:40.899> and<00:00:41.140> check<00:00:41.739> that<00:00:41.920> the

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
and then tighten and check that the

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
and then tighten and check that the
wheel<00:00:42.280> spins<00:00:42.730> freely<00:00:43.239> with<00:00:43.989> no<00:00:44.230> friction<00:00:45.090> to

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
Center the caliper you start by

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.950 
Center the caliper you start by
loosening<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.640> two<00:00:48.850> bolts<00:00:49.269> that<00:00:49.329> anchor<00:00:49.870> it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
loosening the two bolts that anchor it

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:58.529 
loosening the two bolts that anchor it
to<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.289> frame<00:00:56.879> once<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.059> bolts<00:00:58.300> are<00:00:58.510> loose

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
to the frame once the bolts are loose

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:05.340 
to the frame once the bolts are loose
you<00:00:59.530> check<00:00:59.859> that<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.129> calipers<00:01:00.670> loose<00:01:01.059> -<00:01:04.350> in

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
you check that the calipers loose - in

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.020 
you check that the calipers loose - in
order<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.950> allow<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.280> Pistons<00:01:06.850> in<00:01:07.000> the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
order to allow the Pistons in the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.660 
order to allow the Pistons in the
caliper<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.750> work<00:01:07.930> properly<00:01:08.230> you<00:01:09.130> press<00:01:09.460> the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
caliper to work properly you press the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.740 
caliper to work properly you press the
brake<00:01:09.880> lever<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:15.400> will<00:01:15.670> fix<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.270> caliper

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
brake lever this will fix the caliper

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.560 
brake lever this will fix the caliper
tied<00:01:17.050> to<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.410> disc<00:01:17.730> meaning<00:01:18.730> it<00:01:19.090> is<00:01:19.330> now

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
tied to the disc meaning it is now

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.400 
tied to the disc meaning it is now
centered<00:01:21.270> once<00:01:22.270> we've<00:01:22.450> checked<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.900> caliper

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
centered once we've checked the caliper

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.370 
centered once we've checked the caliper
centered<00:01:23.980> we<00:01:24.760> tighten<00:01:25.270> slightly<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.110> balls

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
centered we tighten slightly the balls

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.670 
centered we tighten slightly the balls
and<00:01:26.740> spin<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.490> wheel<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:28.170> check<00:01:29.170> if<00:01:29.470> there's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
and spin the wheel to check if there's

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:38.720 
and spin the wheel to check if there's
any<00:01:29.830> friction<00:01:34.260> if<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.530> wheel<00:01:35.710> spins<00:01:36.160> really

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.440 

brake<00:01:39.730> slowly<00:01:40.420> if<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.500> brake<00:01:41.740> too<00:01:41.980> hard<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
brake slowly if you brake too hard the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.950 
brake slowly if you brake too hard the
caliper<00:01:43.930> might<00:01:44.170> move<00:01:47.460> once<00:01:48.460> check<00:01:48.910> this<00:01:49.240> you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
caliper might move once check this you

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.419 
caliper might move once check this you
can<00:01:50.140> tighten<00:01:50.590> up<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.770> bolts

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:05.590 

check<00:01:59.429> again<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> wheel<00:02:00.390> spins<00:02:00.659> freely

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.139 

remember<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.409> tighten<00:02:07.740> too<00:02:08.220> much<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
remember not to tighten too much the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.050 
remember not to tighten too much the
first<00:02:09.450> bolt<00:02:09.810> before<00:02:10.619> tighten<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> second

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
first bolt before tighten in the second

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.550 
first bolt before tighten in the second
a<00:02:12.330> bit<00:02:12.629> too<00:02:13.640> if<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.849> do<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.870> caliper<00:02:16.349> might

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
a bit too if you do the caliper might

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.030 
a bit too if you do the caliper might
move<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:17.190> not<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> centered<00:02:18.930> again<00:02:22.040> well

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
move and not be a centered again well

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.360 
move and not be a centered again well
hope<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.150> has<00:02:24.330> been<00:02:24.360> useful<00:02:24.830> now<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.890> know<00:02:26.160> how

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
hope it has been useful now you know how

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.070 
hope it has been useful now you know how
to<00:02:26.400> centre<00:02:26.879> your<00:02:27.060> caliper<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.720> allow<00:02:28.019> the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
to centre your caliper to allow the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.100 
to centre your caliper to allow the
Pistons<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.739> work<00:02:29.010> correctly<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.790> get<00:02:30.569> even

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
Pistons to work correctly and get even

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.239 
Pistons to work correctly and get even
wear<00:02:31.349> on<00:02:31.590> your<00:02:31.769> pads<00:02:32.239> Cheers
