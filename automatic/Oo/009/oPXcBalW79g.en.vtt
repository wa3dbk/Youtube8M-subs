00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
day's labor that's pretty good I think I

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.070 
day's labor that's pretty good I think I
start<00:02:44.720> about<00:02:44.930> right<00:02:45.200> here<00:02:45.880> towards<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
start about right here towards the the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.080 
start about right here towards the the
underarm<00:02:48.500> part<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:48.980> goes<00:02:49.069> up<00:02:49.250> under<00:02:49.640> like

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
underarm part that goes up under like

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.340 
underarm part that goes up under like
the<00:02:50.239> part<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.569> sweater<00:02:50.780> does<00:02:50.959> upon<00:02:51.200> your

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
the part of the sweater does upon your

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.960 
the part of the sweater does upon your
arm<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.709> think<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.100> start<00:02:52.370> there<00:02:52.549> because<00:02:52.819> it

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
arm so I think I start there because it

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.580 
arm so I think I start there because it
looks<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:53.569> that's<00:02:54.019> as<00:02:54.170> far<00:02:54.290> as<00:02:54.350> I'm

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
looks like that so that's as far as I'm

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.120 
looks like that so that's as far as I'm
gonna<00:02:54.739> get

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
gonna get

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.160 
gonna get
so<00:02:55.819> what<00:02:56.090> I'm<00:02:56.150> gonna<00:02:56.269> do<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.750> I'm<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:56.900> gonna

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.199 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
start<00:02:57.350> cut<00:03:03.430> what<00:03:04.430> I'm<00:03:04.549> gonna<00:03:04.640> do<00:03:04.850> is<00:03:05.030> I'm<00:03:05.120> gonna

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
start cut what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:18.970 
start cut what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
kind<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.540> make<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.690> like<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.620> round<00:03:06.950> shape

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.950 

so<00:03:19.980> they<00:03:20.190> actually<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.150> wasn't<00:03:21.570> I'm<00:03:21.720> Lea

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
so they actually the it wasn't I'm Lea

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.210 
so they actually the it wasn't I'm Lea
so<00:03:22.290> then<00:03:22.410> what<00:03:22.530> I'm<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.740> do<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.100> I'm

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
so then what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.710 
so then what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.490> take<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.850> late<00:03:24.000> ones<00:03:24.210> and<00:03:24.510> I'm<00:03:24.570> just

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
going to take the late ones and I'm just

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.030 
going to take the late ones and I'm just

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
going to stretch it out like these to

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.770 
going to stretch it out like these to
kind<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.280> make<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.460> a<00:03:26.550> little<00:03:26.700> bit<00:03:26.820> looser<00:03:26.970> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
kind of make it a little bit looser and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.880 
kind of make it a little bit looser and
now<00:03:28.050> I'm<00:03:28.320> just<00:03:28.590> going<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:28.950> do<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.610> other<00:03:29.700> arm
