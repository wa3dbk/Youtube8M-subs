in this video I wanted to show you how
to<00:00:25.980> reduce<00:00:26.279> three<00:00:26.939> types<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.449> canes<00:00:27.890> there<00:00:28.890> is

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
to reduce three types of canes there is

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.229 
to reduce three types of canes there is
the<00:00:29.250> round<00:00:29.460> cane<00:00:29.820> which<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.990> rose<00:00:31.199> cane<00:00:32.239> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the round cane which is a rose cane the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.100 
the round cane which is a rose cane the
rectangle<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.170> square<00:00:34.440> cane<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.870> there's<00:00:36.870> a

triangle<00:00:37.500> cane<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.610> case<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
triangle cane in this case it's a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.549 
triangle cane in this case it's a
butterfly<00:00:40.110> wing<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:41.989> will<00:00:42.989> start<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
butterfly wing I will start with the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.420 
butterfly wing I will start with the
round<00:00:43.770> cane<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:45.090> wanted<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.450> talk<00:00:45.930> about

that all of the clays that you used

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.860 
that all of the clays that you used
building<00:00:55.710> your<00:00:56.100> cane<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.570> same

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
building your cane are the same

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.090 
building your cane are the same

consistency and temperature firm clays
or<00:01:02.520> soft<00:01:03.149> clays<00:01:03.449> move<00:01:03.840> differently<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.890> will

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
or soft clays move differently and will

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.840 
or soft clays move differently and will
not<00:01:05.820> reduce<00:01:06.299> evilly<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.130> combine<00:01:08.580> them

not reduce evilly when you combine them
in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> same<00:01:09.479> cane<00:01:10.369> I<00:01:11.390> usually<00:01:12.390> let<00:01:12.960> my<00:01:13.320> canes

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
in the same cane I usually let my canes

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.390 
in the same cane I usually let my canes
rest<00:01:14.070> overnight<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.170> resting<00:01:16.619> thing

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
rest overnight and the resting thing

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
rest overnight and the resting thing
makes<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.360> cane<00:01:21.110> beat<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> same

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
makes the cane beat in the same

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
makes the cane beat in the same
temperature<00:01:23.159> from<00:01:24.060> top<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.509> bottom<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
temperature from top to bottom and

temperature from top to bottom and
inside<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.310> outside<00:01:27.680> when<00:01:28.680> I'm<00:01:28.829> building<00:01:29.070> my

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
inside and outside when I'm building my

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.980 
inside and outside when I'm building my
cane<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.750> give<00:01:31.740> special<00:01:32.189> 10<00:01:32.939> attention<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
cane I I give special 10 attention to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.520 
cane I I give special 10 attention to
any<00:01:34.380> air<00:01:34.770> pockets<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.630> filled<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:37.259> with

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
any air pockets and I filled them with

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.760 
any air pockets and I filled them with
my<00:01:37.950> background<00:01:38.250> color<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.299> make<00:01:40.290> sure<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
my background color I make sure that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.999 
my background color I make sure that
there<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.159> no<00:01:41.340> holes<00:01:41.700> showing<00:01:42.560> which<00:01:43.560> cause

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
there are no holes showing which cause

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.910 
there are no holes showing which cause
usually<00:01:44.399> lots<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.329> distortion<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.409> they<00:01:46.860> are

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
usually lots of distortion when they are

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.960 
usually lots of distortion when they are
reduced<00:01:50.090> when<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> start<00:01:51.799> reducing<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:53.340> canes

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
reduced when I start reducing my canes

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.030 
reduced when I start reducing my canes
I<00:01:54.030> usually<00:01:55.430> squeeze<00:01:56.430> stretch<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.780> pull<00:01:58.229> these

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
I usually squeeze stretch and pull these

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
I usually squeeze stretch and pull these
are<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.549> three<00:01:59.939> things<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.200> when<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
are the three things that I do when I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.740 
are the three things that I do when I
move<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.479> cane<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.189> reduce<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.540> when<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
move my cane and reduce it when you

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.160 
move my cane and reduce it when you
reduced<00:02:07.439> round<00:02:08.009> canes<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:09.179> start<00:02:09.750> with

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
reduced round canes you start with

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.580 
reduced round canes you start with
pressing

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
pressing

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.119 
pressing
hard<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.910> middle<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.690> cane<00:02:13.959> which<00:02:14.860> is

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
hard in the middle of the cane which is

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.900 
hard in the middle of the cane which is
the<00:02:15.550> waste<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:16.769> call<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.069> waste<00:02:18.250> because<00:02:18.489> it's

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
the waste I call it a waste because it's

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.240 
the waste I call it a waste because it's
like<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.390> woman's<00:02:19.900> body<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.830> middle<00:02:21.129> of

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
like a woman's body it's the middle of

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.380 
like a woman's body it's the middle of
the<00:02:21.430> cane<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:23.050> start<00:02:23.760> stretching<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.150> and

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
the cane and I start stretching it and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.770 
the cane and I start stretching it and
stretching<00:02:26.379> it<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:29.910> somebody<00:02:30.910> said<00:02:31.239> choke

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
stretching it and somebody said choke

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.770 
stretching it and somebody said choke
the<00:02:32.230> cane<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.890> similar<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.790> choking<00:02:34.629> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the cane it's similar to choking the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.220 
the cane it's similar to choking the
game<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:36.489> cane<00:02:36.849> is<00:02:36.879> cold<00:02:37.450> because<00:02:37.989> it

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
game and this cane is cold because it

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.759 
game and this cane is cold because it
was<00:02:38.260> resting<00:02:39.040> overnight<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:41.080> I'm<00:02:41.140> starting<00:02:41.709> to

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
was resting overnight so I'm starting to

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.780 
was resting overnight so I'm starting to
make<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.730> warm<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.680> I'm<00:02:46.170> squeezing<00:02:47.170> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
make it warm and I'm squeezing and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.839 
make it warm and I'm squeezing and
turning<00:02:49.349> squeezing<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:51.069> turning<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:53.849> this

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
turning squeezing and turning and this

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.020 
turning squeezing and turning and this
takes<00:02:55.180> time<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.959> know<00:02:56.349> when<00:02:57.129> you<00:02:57.340> reduce<00:02:57.790> your

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
takes time you know when you reduce your

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.800 
takes time you know when you reduce your
case<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.780> should<00:02:59.019> do<00:02:59.349> it<00:02:59.530> carefully<00:02:59.950> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
case you should do it carefully and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.229 
case you should do it carefully and
gradually<00:03:01.890> don't<00:03:02.890> try<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.220> reduce<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:03.940> cane

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
gradually don't try to reduce your cane

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.140 
gradually don't try to reduce your cane
fast<00:03:04.690> because<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.590> usually<00:03:06.030> distort<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
fast because it usually distort the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.819 
fast because it usually distort the
design<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.970> it's<00:03:10.420> much<00:03:10.780> better<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.500> do<00:03:11.680> it

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
design it's it's much better to do it

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.210 
design it's it's much better to do it
slowly<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.629> see<00:03:13.900> slowly<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.860> cane

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
slowly and you see slowly the cane

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.930 
slowly and you see slowly the cane
becomes<00:03:15.900> longer<00:03:16.900> but<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.470> takes<00:03:17.680> time<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.340> just

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
becomes longer but it takes time I just

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.900 
becomes longer but it takes time I just
move<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.329> from<00:03:19.569> hand<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.959> hand<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.670> squeeze<00:03:21.670> it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
move it from hand to hand and squeeze it

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.629 
move it from hand to hand and squeeze it
and<00:03:22.090> turn<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:23.040> squeeze<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.250> turn<00:03:26.370> right<00:03:27.370> now

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
and turn it squeeze and turn right now

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.729 
and turn it squeeze and turn right now
I'm<00:03:27.940> squeezing<00:03:28.450> in<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.750> middle<00:03:29.049> I'm<00:03:29.260> still

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
I'm squeezing in the middle I'm still

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.069 
I'm squeezing in the middle I'm still
squeezing<00:03:30.430> in<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.609> middle<00:03:30.880> but<00:03:31.090> I'm<00:03:31.389> you<00:03:31.959> know

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
squeezing in the middle but I'm you know

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:39.050 
squeezing in the middle but I'm you know
moving<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:33.069> edges<00:03:33.489> as<00:03:33.670> well

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.330

there<00:03:42.760> came<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.450> their<00:03:43.750> work<00:03:44.109> surface<00:03:44.739> or<00:03:45.069> they

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
there came to their work surface or they

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.110 
there came to their work surface or they

thickness as I can now there's a time

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.400 
thickness as I can now there's a time
when<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.220> can<00:04:54.670> put<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.180> on<00:04:55.330> your<00:04:55.390> surface<00:04:56.170> and

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
when you can put it on your surface and

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.100 
when you can put it on your surface and
roll<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.550> but<00:04:57.940> not<00:04:58.420> yet

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110

I never roll my cane on on the surface

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.510 
I never roll my cane on on the surface
right<00:05:03.280> from<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.330> beginning<00:05:04.530> because<00:05:05.530> there

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
right from the beginning because there

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.390 
right from the beginning because there
are<00:05:06.730> so<00:05:06.970> many<00:05:07.120> elements<00:05:07.450> inside<00:05:08.260> here<00:05:08.710> that

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
are so many elements inside here that

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.970 
are so many elements inside here that
they<00:05:09.790> are<00:05:09.850> filled<00:05:10.240> with<00:05:10.330> air<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.990> if<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.590> put<00:05:11.860> it

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
they are filled with air and if I put it

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.920 
they are filled with air and if I put it
in<00:05:12.190> my<00:05:12.460> on<00:05:12.790> my<00:05:13.300> surface<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:14.800> usually<00:05:15.550> just

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
in my on my surface it usually just

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.010 
in my on my surface it usually just
break<00:05:16.930> apart<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:18.330> everything<00:05:19.330> I<00:05:19.480> worked<00:05:19.750> on

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
break apart and everything I worked on

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.810 
break apart and everything I worked on
is<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:21.400> going<00:05:21.670> to<00:05:21.850> waste<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:23.650> doing<00:05:24.400> this<00:05:24.580> with

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
is is going to waste so doing this with

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.820 
is is going to waste so doing this with
your<00:05:25.000> hands<00:05:25.480> is<00:05:26.760> making<00:05:27.760> every<00:05:28.480> hole<00:05:28.870> or<00:05:29.290> air

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
your hands is making every hole or air

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.690 
your hands is making every hole or air
pocket<00:05:30.310> closed<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:32.440> clay<00:05:32.710> is<00:05:32.950> attaching

to to each other and all the parts are
being<00:05:39.700> one<00:05:40.860> when<00:05:41.860> the<00:05:42.250> cane<00:05:42.490> reaches<00:05:43.060> about

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
being one when the cane reaches about

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:51.830 
being one when the cane reaches about
this<00:05:43.720> size<00:05:44.190> it's<00:05:45.190> about<00:05:49.020> 15<00:05:50.020> centimeters<00:05:50.470> or

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
this size it's about 15 centimeters or

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.390 
this size it's about 15 centimeters or
almost<00:05:52.840> 6<00:05:53.200> inch<00:05:53.500> I<00:05:54.000> can<00:05:55.000> start<00:05:55.330> rolling<00:05:55.690> it<00:05:56.080> and

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
almost 6 inch I can start rolling it and

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.450 
almost 6 inch I can start rolling it and
rolling<00:05:57.400> it<00:05:57.700> I<00:05:58.000> just<00:05:58.570> roll<00:05:59.230> it<00:05:59.380> with<00:05:59.620> my<00:05:59.830> hands

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
rolling it I just roll it with my hands

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.600 
rolling it I just roll it with my hands
I<00:06:00.720> don't<00:06:01.720> have<00:06:02.110> to<00:06:02.260> roll<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.560> right<00:06:03.100> to<00:06:03.460> the

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
I don't have to roll it right to the

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.690 
I don't have to roll it right to the
edge<00:06:03.760> because<00:06:04.390> I<00:06:04.660> usually<00:06:05.410> cut<00:06:05.680> my<00:06:05.920> canes<00:06:06.280> in

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
edge because I usually cut my canes in

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.350 
edge because I usually cut my canes in
half<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.300> then<00:06:07.480> I<00:06:07.780> just<00:06:08.380> put<00:06:08.650> it<00:06:08.770> on<00:06:08.950> my<00:06:09.340> box<00:06:10.000> of

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
half and then I just put it on my box of

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.830 
half and then I just put it on my box of
canes<00:06:10.690> and<00:06:11.080> they<00:06:12.010> wait<00:06:12.310> until<00:06:12.730> I<00:06:13.030> want<00:06:13.450> to<00:06:13.630> get

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
canes and they wait until I want to get

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.990 
canes and they wait until I want to get
it<00:06:14.020> to<00:06:14.470> make<00:06:15.160> it<00:06:15.370> smaller<00:06:16.710> so<00:06:17.710> this<00:06:17.950> is<00:06:18.160> that

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
it to make it smaller so this is that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.650 
it to make it smaller so this is that
the<00:06:19.360> final<00:06:20.290> rolling<00:06:20.950> which<00:06:21.580> smooth<00:06:22.210> is<00:06:22.390> my

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
the final rolling which smooth is my

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:30.150 
the final rolling which smooth is my
hands<00:06:23.170> and<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:24.610> take<00:06:25.000> a<00:06:25.030> blade<00:06:25.390> I<00:06:28.860> just<00:06:29.860> cut<00:06:30.130> it

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
hands and I take a blade I just cut it

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.660 
hands and I take a blade I just cut it
in<00:06:30.400> half<00:06:30.670> and<00:06:31.830> this<00:06:32.830> is<00:06:32.890> what<00:06:33.250> we're<00:06:33.460> waiting

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
in half and this is what we're waiting

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.550 
in half and this is what we're waiting
for

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
for

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.130 
for
it's<00:06:35.560> the<00:06:35.830> final<00:06:36.310> cane

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
it's the final cane

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.400 
it's the final cane
this<00:06:38.140> is<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:38.440> final<00:06:38.830> result<00:06:39.870> so<00:06:40.870> this<00:06:41.110> is<00:06:41.290> the

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
this is the final result so this is the

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.720 
this is the final result so this is the
way<00:06:41.560> I<00:06:41.590> reduced<00:06:42.340> round<00:06:42.940> canes<00:06:44.310> now<00:06:45.310> to<00:06:45.370> the

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
way I reduced round canes now to the

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.870 
way I reduced round canes now to the
next<00:06:46.060> game<00:06:48.630> it's<00:06:49.630> this<00:06:49.960> stare<00:06:50.640> rectangle<00:06:51.640> it's

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
next game it's this stare rectangle it's

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.190 
next game it's this stare rectangle it's

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.250 
you how to reduce this one
I<00:07:03.070> didn't<00:07:03.790> attach<00:07:04.180> them<00:07:04.510> together<00:07:04.690> because

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
I didn't attach them together because

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.580 
I didn't attach them together because
it's<00:07:05.440> too<00:07:05.740> long<00:07:06.040> to<00:07:06.400> reduce<00:07:07.090> this<00:07:08.080> kind<00:07:08.440> of

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
it's too long to reduce this kind of

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.450 
it's too long to reduce this kind of
cane<00:07:08.830> but<00:07:09.190> I'm<00:07:09.340> just<00:07:09.700> reducing<00:07:10.330> it
