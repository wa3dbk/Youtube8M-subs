select windows task manager once you do

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.890 
select windows task manager once you do
that<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.880> should<00:00:17.970> get<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.270> window<00:00:18.570> and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
that you should get this window and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.769 
that you should get this window and
currently<00:00:19.650> my<00:00:20.220> grant<00:00:20.520> oh<00:00:20.670> my<00:00:20.850> cpu<00:00:21.300> usage<00:00:21.420> is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
currently my grant oh my cpu usage is

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.990 
currently my grant oh my cpu usage is
very<00:00:22.050> high<00:00:22.260> because<00:00:22.500> i'm<00:00:22.680> using<00:00:22.740> hypo<00:00:23.220> cam<00:00:23.400> but

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
very high because i'm using hypo cam but

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.029 
very high because i'm using hypo cam but
generally<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.539> CPU<00:00:25.019> usage<00:00:25.199> should<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.830> very

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
generally you CPU usage should be very

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.470 
generally you CPU usage should be very
low<00:00:26.250> when<00:00:26.279> you're<00:00:26.580> not<00:00:26.670> running<00:00:26.820> any<00:00:27.029> programs

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
low when you're not running any programs

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.140 
low when you're not running any programs
also<00:00:27.840> your<00:00:28.590> PF<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.070> use<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.640> should<00:00:29.789> always<00:00:30.000> be

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
also your PF you use it should always be

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.389 
also your PF you use it should always be
relatively<00:00:30.660> low<00:00:30.960> if<00:00:31.529> that's<00:00:31.769> high<00:00:31.980> that's<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
relatively low if that's high that's a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.920 
relatively low if that's high that's a
sign<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.910> need<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.149> replace<00:00:33.390> your<00:00:33.480> gram

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
sign that you need to replace your gram

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.959 
sign that you need to replace your gram
or<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.770> new<00:00:34.800> motherboard<00:00:35.219> which<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:35.880> be

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
or get a new motherboard which would be

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.350 
or get a new motherboard which would be
an<00:00:36.059> extreme<00:00:36.420> case<00:00:37.309> now<00:00:38.309> first<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.059> speed<00:00:39.270> up

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
an extreme case now first to speed up

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.840 
an extreme case now first to speed up
your<00:00:39.480> computer<00:00:39.590> I'd<00:00:40.590> recommend<00:00:40.920> dbag<00:00:41.489> minting

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
your computer I'd recommend dbag minting

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.270 
your computer I'd recommend dbag minting
your<00:00:42.000> hard<00:00:42.210> drive<00:00:42.450> which<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.260> basically<00:00:43.559> when

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
your hard drive which is basically when

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.040 
your hard drive which is basically when
you<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.460> your<00:00:44.520> computer<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:45.180> files<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.840> all

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you get your computer your files are all

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.020 
you get your computer your files are all
lined<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.800> bookshelf<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.550> every<00:00:47.879> time

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
lined up like a bookshelf and every time

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.549 
lined up like a bookshelf and every time
you<00:00:48.090> save<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> new<00:00:48.570> file<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.200> inserting

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
you save a new file it's like inserting

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.740 
you save a new file it's like inserting
a<00:00:49.680> book<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> middle<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.850> each<00:00:51.120> file<00:00:51.390> let

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
a book in the middle so each file let

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.779 
a book in the middle so each file let
you<00:00:51.870> save<00:00:52.110> inserts<00:00:52.920> another<00:00:53.190> book<00:00:53.399> pushing

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
you save inserts another book pushing

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.600 
you save inserts another book pushing
all<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:53.969> files<00:00:54.270> further<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> further<00:00:54.960> away

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
all the files further and further away

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
all the files further and further away
defragmenting<00:00:56.610> basically<00:00:57.329> lines<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.410> all

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
defragmenting basically lines of all

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.010 
defragmenting basically lines of all
lines<00:00:59.160> those<00:00:59.340> files<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.780> they're

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
lines those files up for you so they're

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.510 
lines those files up for you so they're
easier<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> access<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> takes<00:01:02.370> less

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
easier to access and it takes less

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.170 
easier to access and it takes less
memory<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.229> first<00:01:04.970> go<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> your

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
do fragmented mine recently so I should

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.950 
do fragmented mine recently so I should
not<00:01:32.460> need<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> defragment<00:01:33.390> mine<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.810> let's

see what it says
and<00:01:36.820> here's<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.030> estimated<00:01:38.539> discs<00:01:38.899> basis

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
and here's the estimated discs basis

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.219 
and here's the estimated discs basis
I've<00:01:39.740> used<00:01:40.130> before<00:01:40.399> defragmented<00:01:41.270> for<00:01:42.109> I've

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
I've used before defragmented for I've

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.080 
I've used before defragmented for I've
defragmented<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:42.950> that's<00:01:43.130> very<00:01:43.429> good<00:01:43.640> you

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
defragmented and that's very good you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.730 
defragmented and that's very good you
want<00:01:44.210> most<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.539> white<00:01:44.689> space<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.259> be<00:01:45.439> on<00:01:45.619> the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
want most the white space to be on the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.469 
want most the white space to be on the
right<00:01:45.859> side<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.250> see<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.490> says<00:01:46.700> do<00:01:46.969> not<00:01:47.000> eat<00:01:47.359> it

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
have a couple files in the lamp that's

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.830 
have a couple files in the lamp that's
fine<00:02:03.700> now<00:02:04.700> another<00:02:05.209> way<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.420> speed<00:02:05.659> up<00:02:05.719> your

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
fine now another way to speed up your

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.529 
fine now another way to speed up your
computer<00:02:05.899> is<00:02:06.319> to<00:02:06.439> compress<00:02:06.740> old<00:02:07.130> files<00:02:07.509> so<00:02:08.509> you

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
computer is to compress old files so you

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.800 
computer is to compress old files so you
go<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> stout<00:02:09.489> control<00:02:10.489> panel<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:11.510> can<00:02:11.660> also

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
go to stout control panel you can also

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.420 
go to stout control panel you can also
get<00:02:12.079> a<00:02:12.110> defragmentation<00:02:12.500> from<00:02:13.069> control<00:02:13.400> panel

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
get a defragmentation from control panel

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.970 
get a defragmentation from control panel
I<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:14.000> find<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.239> easier<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.540> use<00:02:14.690> one<00:02:14.930> though

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
I just find it easier to use one though

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.289 
I just find it easier to use one though
now<00:02:15.980> from<00:02:16.130> here<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.549> go<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.700> performance<00:02:17.180> and

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
now from here you go to performance and

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.309 
now from here you go to performance and
maintenance<00:02:18.730> now<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.480> do<00:02:20.599> free<00:02:20.810> up<00:02:20.930> space<00:02:21.079> on

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
maintenance now you do free up space on

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.000 
maintenance now you do free up space on
your<00:02:21.379> hard<00:02:21.500> drive<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:23.410> now<00:02:24.410> i'm<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:24.890> say

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
your hard drive and now i'm going to say

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.360 
your hard drive and now i'm going to say
i<00:02:25.069> want<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.250> clean<00:02:25.400> up<00:02:25.489> my<00:02:25.519> c<00:02:25.760> drive<00:02:26.079> and<00:02:27.079> now<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
i want to clean up my c drive and now it

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.520 
i want to clean up my c drive and now it
should<00:02:28.579> start<00:02:28.790> analyzing<00:02:29.360> my<00:02:29.450> files<00:02:29.750> this

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
should start analyzing my files this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.470 
should start analyzing my files this
will<00:02:30.680> take<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.950> while<00:02:31.069> so<00:02:31.220> i<00:02:31.640> won't<00:02:31.970> complete<00:02:32.390> it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
will take a while so i won't complete it

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.839 
will take a while so i won't complete it
right<00:02:32.629> now<00:02:32.780> but<00:02:33.470> see<00:02:33.860> it's<00:02:34.010> disk<00:02:34.400> cleanup<00:02:34.640> is

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
right now but see it's disk cleanup is

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.430 
right now but see it's disk cleanup is
calculating<00:02:35.329> how<00:02:35.420> much<00:02:35.510> space<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.810> can<00:02:36.140> be

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
calculating how much space you can be

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.809 
calculating how much space you can be
able<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.650> free<00:02:36.799> up<00:02:36.829> this<00:02:37.400> may<00:02:37.549> take<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.730> few

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
able to free up this may take a few

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.430 
able to free up this may take a few
minutes<00:02:37.940> it'll<00:02:38.329> probably<00:02:38.569> take<00:02:38.840> anywhere<00:02:39.319> in

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
minutes it'll probably take anywhere in

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.890 
minutes it'll probably take anywhere in
between<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:40.040> minute<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:41.060> 10<00:02:41.480> minutes<00:02:41.720> to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
between a minute to 10 minutes to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.140 
between a minute to 10 minutes to
analyze<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.889> I'm<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.549> going<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.760> exit<00:02:44.030> out<00:02:44.090> of

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
analyze so I'm just going to exit out of

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.059 
analyze so I'm just going to exit out of
this<00:02:44.329> also<00:02:45.230> another<00:02:45.500> note<00:02:45.769> undo
