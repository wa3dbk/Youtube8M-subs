if you had to produce full I checked out

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.540 
if you had to produce full I checked out
you<00:00:05.400> know<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> general<00:00:06.359> viewer<00:00:07.189> one<00:00:08.189> piece<00:00:08.429> of

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
you know a general viewer one piece of

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.419 
you know a general viewer one piece of
evidence<00:00:08.610> which<00:00:09.000> says<00:00:09.179> yes<00:00:09.469> evolution<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.590> how

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
evidence which says yes evolution is how

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.890 
evidence which says yes evolution is how
we<00:00:11.490> got<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.210> how<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.389> develop<00:00:12.570> what

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
we got here and how we develop what

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.509 
we got here and how we develop what
would<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.110> be<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.500> think<00:00:13.830> nowadays<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.370> will<00:00:14.460> be

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
would it be I think nowadays it will be

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.980 
would it be I think nowadays it will be
something<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.940> Darwin<00:00:15.450> himself<00:00:15.540> knew

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
something that Darwin himself knew

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.480 
something that Darwin himself knew
nothing<00:00:16.170> about<00:00:16.440> which<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.980> molecular

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
nothing about which is molecular

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.029 
nothing about which is molecular
genetics<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.779> if<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.109> compare<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
genetics because if you compare the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.189 
genetics because if you compare the
genes<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.760> any<00:00:21.119> living<00:00:21.390> creature<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.990> like

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
genes of any living creature you like

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.720 
genes of any living creature you like
with<00:00:22.410> any<00:00:22.560> other<00:00:22.650> living<00:00:22.949> creature<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.519> like

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
with any other living creature you like

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.810 
with any other living creature you like
you<00:00:24.420> find<00:00:24.750> large<00:00:25.470> numbers<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.310> genes<00:00:26.609> are

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
you find large numbers of the genes are

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.269 
you find large numbers of the genes are
the<00:00:26.910> same<00:00:27.150> or<00:00:27.480> nearly<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.080> same<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the same or nearly the same but the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.339 
the same or nearly the same but the
difference<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.849> between<00:00:29.910> them<00:00:30.630> which<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.109> can

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
difference is between them which you can

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.260 
difference is between them which you can
actually<00:00:31.740> count<00:00:32.009> literally<00:00:32.820> count<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
actually count literally count the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.319 
actually count literally count the
differences<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:34.850> exactly<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.239> would

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
differences are exactly what you would

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.600 
differences are exactly what you would
expect<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.230> had<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> hierarchical<00:00:38.190> family

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
expect if we had a hierarchical family

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.549 
expect if we had a hierarchical family
tree<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.329> take<00:00:39.510> close<00:00:39.809> cousins<00:00:40.350> like

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
tree so if you take close cousins like

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.910 
tree so if you take close cousins like
rats<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.100> mice<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:41.550> humans<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.420> chimpanzees

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
rats and mice or humans and chimpanzees

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.200 
rats and mice or humans and chimpanzees
almost<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.070> their<00:00:44.250> genes<00:00:44.520> are<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> same<00:00:45.000> if

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
almost all their genes are the same if

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
almost all their genes are the same if
you<00:00:45.270> take<00:00:45.450> distant<00:00:45.930> cousins<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.530> humans<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
you take distant cousins like humans and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.720 
you take distant cousins like humans and
cabbages<00:00:48.590> they're<00:00:49.590> got<00:00:50.160> still<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> lot<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
cabbages they're got still got a lot of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.790 
cabbages they're got still got a lot of
genes<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.180> common<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.629> many<00:00:52.170> many<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.590> them

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
genes in common but many many of them

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.770 
genes in common but many many of them
are<00:00:52.980> different<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.940> all<00:00:54.149> falls<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
are different it all falls on a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.220 
are different it all falls on a
beautiful<00:00:55.440> family<00:00:56.070> tree<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.940> cousinship<00:00:57.690> but

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
beautiful family tree of cousinship but

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.049 
beautiful family tree of cousinship but
the<00:00:58.320> problem<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.399> because<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the problem really is that it because of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.569 
the problem really is that it because of
the<00:01:00.180> time<00:01:00.480> span<00:01:01.140> people<00:01:01.500> can't<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:02.070> natural

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the time span people can't see natural

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.240 
the time span people can't see natural
selection<00:01:02.940> hackney<00:01:03.329> that's<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.979> it<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
selection hackney that's right it is a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.910 
selection hackney that's right it is a
process<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.820> takes<00:01:06.240> orders<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.350> magnitude

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
process that takes orders of magnitude

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.760 
process that takes orders of magnitude
longer<00:01:08.460> than<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.360> human<00:01:09.780> life<00:01:09.960> span<00:01:10.140> than

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
longer than a human life span than

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.520 
longer than a human life span than
humans<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:11.670> used<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.210> dealing<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.380> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
humans are used to dealing with and so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.050 
humans are used to dealing with and so
that<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> real<00:01:14.100> problem<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:14.939> as

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that is a real problem it's not as

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.850 
that is a real problem it's not as
difficult<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.689> understanding<00:01:16.229> say<00:01:16.380> quantum

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
difficult as I understanding say quantum

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.679 
difficult as I understanding say quantum
theory<00:01:17.159> which<00:01:17.700> really<00:01:17.909> does<00:01:18.090> make<00:01:18.270> formidable

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
theory which really does make formidable

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.280 
theory which really does make formidable

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
demands on the human mind but the sheer

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
demands on the human mind but the sheer
time<00:01:22.680> span<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.400> hard<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.909> grasp<00:01:24.090> that's<00:01:24.479> true

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
time span is hard to grasp that's true

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.100 
time span is hard to grasp that's true
as<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.890> understand<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.390> are<00:01:27.540> saying<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
as I understand it you are saying this

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.030 
as I understand it you are saying this
is<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:29.659> scientific<00:01:30.659> process<00:01:31.320> an<00:01:31.470> automatic

to say that it's random and I must

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
to say that it's random and I must
stress<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> very<00:01:50.040> common

therefore come from well you can make

then it's filtered too long centuries of
culture<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.940> now<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.210> have<00:03:00.390> moral<00:03:01.290> philosophy

the<00:03:54.300> reason<00:03:54.600> i<00:03:54.660> interjected<00:03:55.200> argue<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.739> that<00:03:55.769> I

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
the reason i interjected argue is that I

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.070 
the reason i interjected argue is that I
get<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.070> bit<00:03:56.220> fed<00:03:56.400> up<00:03:56.430> with<00:03:56.730> being<00:03:56.970> wheeled<00:03:57.810> out

and I suspect is wearing me but why is
it<00:04:07.230> important<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.769> destroy<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.760> your<00:04:09.030> view<00:04:09.300> too

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
well it's not important to destroy

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.340 
well it's not important to destroy
anything<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.390> but<00:04:12.570> it<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:12.780> important<00:04:13.290> to

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
anything but it but it is important to

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.530 
anything but it but it is important to
get<00:04:13.500> at<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.680> truth<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.850> if<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.330> don't

what's true then

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.600 
what's true then
all<00:04:20.930> means<00:04:21.169> say<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.650> don't<00:04:21.949> watch<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.280> don't<00:04:22.460> wish

to know you do wish to know the truth

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.159 
to know you do wish to know the truth
then<00:04:24.620> then<00:04:24.980> because<00:04:25.699> what<00:04:25.910> I<00:04:25.940> there<00:04:26.750> is<00:04:26.870> as<00:04:27.020> you

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
then then because what I there is as you

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.219 
then then because what I there is as you
know<00:04:27.199> at<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.620> moment<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:28.780> scientific<00:04:29.780> school

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
know at the moment a scientific school

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.020 
know at the moment a scientific school
which<00:04:30.530> says<00:04:30.889> that<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.160> religious<00:04:31.460> impulse<00:04:31.820> is

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
which says that the religious impulse is

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.689 
which says that the religious impulse is
actually<00:04:32.419> something<00:04:33.380> in<00:04:33.860> our<00:04:34.040> DNA<00:04:34.250> oh<00:04:34.669> I

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
actually something in our DNA oh I

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.270 
actually something in our DNA oh I
believe<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.410> but<00:04:36.410> that<00:04:36.560> not<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.919> good<00:04:37.010> girl

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
believe that but that not a good girl

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.219 
believe that but that not a good girl
and<00:04:37.310> gullibility<00:04:37.820> is<00:04:38.180> polar<00:04:38.389> bear<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.960> yeah

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
and gullibility is polar bear that yeah

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.320 
and gullibility is polar bear that yeah
that<00:04:39.530> doesn't<00:04:39.740> make<00:04:39.919> it<00:04:40.100> true<00:04:40.220> of<00:04:40.340> course<00:04:40.580> and

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
that doesn't make it true of course and

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.689 
that doesn't make it true of course and
but<00:04:41.900> might<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.500> make<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.770> necessary<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.580> have

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
but might it make it necessary to have

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.400 
but might it make it necessary to have
queso<00:04:43.970> well<00:04:44.240> not<00:04:44.360> exactly<00:04:44.419> necessary<00:04:45.199> because

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
queso well not exactly necessary because

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.780 
queso well not exactly necessary because
the<00:04:45.590> plenty<00:04:45.979> of<00:04:46.070> people<00:04:46.340> managed<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.699> do

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
the plenty of people managed to do

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.460 
the plenty of people managed to do
without<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.090> but<00:04:47.449> it<00:04:47.630> is<00:04:48.110> certainly<00:04:48.380> possible

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
without it but it is certainly possible

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.189 
without it but it is certainly possible
that<00:04:48.919> it<00:04:49.610> does<00:04:49.910> give<00:04:50.150> some<00:04:50.419> psychological

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
that it does give some psychological

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.200 
that it does give some psychological
comfort<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:52.250> gives<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.610> reverse<00:04:52.880> as<00:04:53.060> well<00:04:53.180> I

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
comfort it gives the reverse as well I

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.400 
comfort it gives the reverse as well I
mean<00:04:53.389> if<00:04:53.479> you<00:04:53.540> look<00:04:53.660> at<00:04:53.780> people<00:04:53.900> afraid<00:04:54.290> of

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
mean if you look at people afraid of

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.920 
mean if you look at people afraid of
dying<00:04:54.770> if<00:04:55.669> you<00:04:55.940> look<00:04:56.210> at<00:04:56.389> some<00:04:56.600> of<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.750> most

dying if you look at some of the most

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.170 
dying if you look at some of the most
people's<00:04:57.470> you<00:04:58.280> will<00:04:58.400> find<00:04:58.639> that<00:04:58.790> many<00:04:58.970> of<00:04:59.090> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
people's you will find that many of the

general sort of way I mean you can say

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.240 
general sort of way I mean you can say
