00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
we'll be taking a look at the yo-yo 560

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.930 
we'll be taking a look at the yo-yo 560
TX<00:00:19.430> system

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.840 

now<00:00:28.940> the<00:00:29.000> yo-yo<00:00:29.450> 560<00:00:30.140> TX<00:00:30.530> is<00:00:30.770> a<00:00:31.130> wireless<00:00:31.610> flash

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
now the yo-yo 560 TX is a wireless flash

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.870 
now the yo-yo 560 TX is a wireless flash
controller<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:33.050> 560<00:00:33.560> TX<00:00:33.860> is<00:00:34.070> best<00:00:34.370> used<00:00:34.640> with

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
controller the 560 TX is best used with

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.900 
controller the 560 TX is best used with
the<00:00:35.060> yo-yo<00:00:35.450> 560<00:00:36.140> Mach<00:00:36.380> 3<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.040> yo-yo<00:00:37.220> 560

the yo-yo 560 Mach 3 and the yo-yo 560

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.210 
the yo-yo 560 Mach 3 and the yo-yo 560
Mach<00:00:38.090> 4<00:00:38.330> flashes<00:00:38.750> because<00:00:39.170> these<00:00:39.530> two<00:00:39.800> flashes

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
Mach 4 flashes because these two flashes

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.670 
Mach 4 flashes because these two flashes
have<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.489> built-in<00:00:40.910> receiver<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:42.230> will<00:00:42.470> work

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
have a built-in receiver that will work

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.869 
have a built-in receiver that will work
with<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.250> 560<00:00:43.820> TX<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.170> when<00:00:45.379> we<00:00:45.500> use<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:45.890> 560<00:00:46.489> TX

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
with the 560 TX so when we use a 560 TX

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.930 
with the 560 TX so when we use a 560 TX
with<00:00:47.150> a<00:00:47.180> 563<00:00:47.809> or<00:00:48.260> fall<00:00:48.470> flash<00:00:48.739> not<00:00:49.340> only<00:00:49.700> can<00:00:49.910> we

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
with a 563 or fall flash not only can we

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.479 
with a 563 or fall flash not only can we
remotely<00:00:50.540> trigger<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.320> flashes<00:00:51.739> we<00:00:52.160> can<00:00:52.309> also

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
remotely trigger the flashes we can also

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.790

actually<00:01:51.409> also<00:01:51.859> has<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.490> built-in<00:01:52.820> transmitter

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
actually also has a built-in transmitter

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.819 
actually also has a built-in transmitter
however<00:01:53.960> for<00:01:54.109> this<00:01:54.200> video<00:01:54.500> we'll<00:01:54.619> be<00:01:54.710> using

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
however for this video we'll be using

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.669 
however for this video we'll be using
the<00:01:55.039> 560<00:01:55.549> TX<00:01:56.000> as<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.899> master<00:01:57.259> transmitter

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
the 560 TX as the master transmitter

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.310 
the 560 TX as the master transmitter
since<00:01:58.009> this<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.579> a<00:01:58.820> dedicated<00:01:59.630> transmitter

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
since this is a dedicated transmitter

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.520 
since this is a dedicated transmitter
and<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:01.009> also<00:02:01.280> supports<00:02:02.270> up<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.570> 6<00:02:03.049> groups

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
and it also supports up to 6 groups

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.929 
and it also supports up to 6 groups
we're<00:02:03.829> about<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.009> built<00:02:04.250> in<00:02:04.340> transmitter<00:02:04.759> in

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
we're about a built in transmitter in

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.569 
we're about a built in transmitter in
the<00:02:04.969> 560<00:02:05.509> for<00:02:05.719> only<00:02:06.020> supports<00:02:06.469> up<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.649> 3<00:02:07.250> groups

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
the 560 for only supports up to 3 groups

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.550 
the 560 for only supports up to 3 groups
so<00:02:08.420> if<00:02:08.539> you're<00:02:08.660> looking<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.960> control<00:02:09.200> large

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
so if you're looking to control large

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.050 
so if you're looking to control large
groups<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.070> flashes<00:02:10.490> I<00:02:10.610> would<00:02:10.789> still

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
groups of flashes I would still

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.830 
groups of flashes I would still
recommend<00:02:11.210> going<00:02:11.750> with<00:02:11.900> 2<00:02:12.560> 560<00:02:13.250> TX<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.660> now

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
recommend going with 2 560 TX so now

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.990 
recommend going with 2 560 TX so now
I'll<00:02:15.020> mount<00:02:15.200> my<00:02:15.380> 560<00:02:15.890> TX<00:02:16.190> onto<00:02:16.430> my<00:02:16.520> camera<00:02:16.880> so

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
I'll mount my 560 TX onto my camera so

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.330 
I'll mount my 560 TX onto my camera so
it's<00:02:17.120> not<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.420> master<00:02:17.930> transmitter<00:02:18.770> unit<00:02:19.100> and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
it's not the master transmitter unit and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.690 
it's not the master transmitter unit and
on<00:02:20.060> my<00:02:20.210> yo-yo<00:02:20.390> 563<00:02:21.140> s<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.590> force<00:02:22.010> I'll<00:02:22.280> make

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
on my yo-yo 563 s and force I'll make

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.660 
on my yo-yo 563 s and force I'll make
sure<00:02:22.850> they<00:02:23.000> are<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.240> our<00:02:23.510> X<00:02:23.810> receiver<00:02:24.530> mode<00:02:24.830> now

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
sure they are in our X receiver mode now

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.360 
sure they are in our X receiver mode now
like<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.120> said<00:02:26.360> just<00:02:26.390> now<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.230> young<00:02:27.410> no<00:02:27.560> 560<00:02:28.069> TX

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
like I said just now the young no 560 TX

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.670 
like I said just now the young no 560 TX
supports<00:02:28.880> up<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.000> 6<00:02:29.360> groups<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.230> each<00:02:30.380> -

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
supports up to 6 groups so in each -

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.740 
supports up to 6 groups so in each -
slave<00:02:30.890> flashes<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.370> can<00:02:31.520> assign<00:02:31.850> them<00:02:32.060> into<00:02:32.510> one

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
slave flashes I can assign them into one

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.660 
slave flashes I can assign them into one
group<00:02:33.020> so<00:02:33.530> well<00:02:33.680> now<00:02:33.770> I'll<00:02:33.980> put<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.250> young<00:02:34.520> no

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
group so well now I'll put the young no

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.920 
group so well now I'll put the young no
560<00:02:35.330> mark<00:02:35.570> 3<00:02:35.840> into<00:02:36.410> group

3<00:03:47.849> on<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> right<00:03:48.169> so<00:03:49.169> when<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.319> change<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
3 on the right so when I change the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.729 
3 on the right so when I change the
settings<00:03:50.040> from<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.760> TX<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:52.290> slave<00:03:52.500> flash

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
settings from the TX the slave flash

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.349 
settings from the TX the slave flash
will<00:03:52.980> also<00:03:53.250> have<00:03:53.489> its<00:03:53.699> output<00:03:54.090> setting

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
will also have its output setting

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.990 
will also have its output setting
automatically<00:03:55.019> updated<00:03:55.560> wirelessly<00:03:56.040> as<00:03:56.340> well

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
automatically updated wirelessly as well

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.720 
automatically updated wirelessly as well
so<00:03:57.840> now<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.049> can<00:03:58.409> also<00:03:58.620> change<00:03:58.949> the<00:03:59.190> firing<00:03:59.549> mode

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
so now I can also change the firing mode

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.149 
so now I can also change the firing mode
hit<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.870> mode<00:04:01.079> button<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.470> it's<00:04:01.650> now<00:04:01.919> in

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
hit the mode button and it's now in

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.300 
hit the mode button and it's now in
multi<00:04:02.819> flash<00:04:03.120> strobe<00:04:03.569> mode<00:04:04.019> ok<00:04:04.680> also<00:04:04.980> press<00:04:05.190> it

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
multi flash strobe mode ok also press it

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.610 
multi flash strobe mode ok also press it
again<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.819> disable<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.599> flash<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.260> can<00:04:07.409> see

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
again to disable the flash you can see

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.680 
again to disable the flash you can see
it's<00:04:07.889> showing<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.370> mode<00:04:08.669> as<00:04:08.849> MT<00:04:09.269> which<00:04:09.479> is<00:04:09.599> the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
it's showing the mode as MT which is the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.869 
it's showing the mode as MT which is the
two<00:04:09.870> hyphens<00:04:10.290> over<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:11.069> this<00:04:11.280> means<00:04:11.519> this

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
two hyphens over here so this means this

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.030 
two hyphens over here so this means this
group<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.329> now<00:04:12.569> disabled<00:04:13.260> group<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.889> now

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
group is now disabled group a is now

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.550 
group is now disabled group a is now
disabled<00:04:14.639> now<00:04:15.419> I<00:04:15.449> can<00:04:15.659> also<00:04:15.840> do<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.229> same<00:04:16.260> for

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
disabled now I can also do the same for

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.319 
disabled now I can also do the same for
Group<00:04:16.769> B<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:17.220> I'll<00:04:17.310> cycle<00:04:17.669> down<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.909> Group<00:04:18.090> B

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
Group B so I'll cycle down to Group B

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.180 
Group B so I'll cycle down to Group B
and<00:04:18.479> then<00:04:18.690> as<00:04:18.870> well<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.409> can<00:04:19.530> see<00:04:19.739> my<00:04:19.949> flash

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
and then as well you can see my flash

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.099 
and then as well you can see my flash
that<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.549> in<00:04:20.669> Group<00:04:20.880> B<00:04:21.120> will<00:04:21.449> have<00:04:21.599> its<00:04:21.780> setting

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
that is in Group B will have its setting

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.980 
that is in Group B will have its setting
updated<00:04:22.620> automatically<00:04:23.280> as<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:24.419> change<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.870> on

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
updated automatically as I change it on

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.920 
updated automatically as I change it on
the<00:04:25.320> T<00:04:25.500> X<00:04:25.800> so<00:04:26.760> this<00:04:26.970> is<00:04:27.090> great<00:04:27.300> for<00:04:27.449> remotely

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
the T X so this is great for remotely

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.750 
the T X so this is great for remotely
controlling<00:04:28.349> your<00:04:28.590> flashes<00:04:28.979> directly<00:04:29.580> from

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
controlling your flashes directly from

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.060 
controlling your flashes directly from
the<00:04:29.970> TX<00:04:30.380> particularly<00:04:31.380> useful<00:04:31.530> when<00:04:31.949> you

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
the TX particularly useful when you

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.920 
the TX particularly useful when you
already<00:04:32.250> have<00:04:32.520> all<00:04:32.909> your<00:04:33.060> flashes<00:04:33.419> set<00:04:33.599> up<00:04:33.750> and

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
already have all your flashes set up and

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.990 
already have all your flashes set up and
scattered<00:04:34.320> across<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.919> place<00:04:35.099> so<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.639> do<00:04:35.849> not

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
scattered across the place so you do not

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.029 
scattered across the place so you do not
need<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.270> go<00:04:36.389> behind<00:04:36.840> each<00:04:37.080> flash<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.770> tweak

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
need to go behind each flash to tweak

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.040 
need to go behind each flash to tweak
the<00:04:38.190> settings<00:04:38.220> individually<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:39.630> can<00:04:39.780> all<00:04:40.020> be

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
the settings individually it can all be

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.290 
the settings individually it can all be
done<00:04:40.199> wirelessly<00:04:40.650> from<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.789> top<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.180> your

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
done wirelessly from the top of your

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.230 
done wirelessly from the top of your
camera<00:04:42.510> from<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.199> TX<00:04:43.560> unit<00:04:43.949> now<00:04:44.669> because<00:04:45.060> of

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
camera from the TX unit now because of

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.940 
camera from the TX unit now because of
the<00:04:45.450> group<00:04:45.659> system<00:04:46.080> I<00:04:46.169> can<00:04:46.380> have<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.529> different

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
the group system I can have a different

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.250 
the group system I can have a different
setting<00:04:47.250> for<00:04:47.279> each<00:04:47.700> group<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.659> for<00:04:48.840> example

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
setting for each group so for example

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.300 
setting for each group so for example
I'll<00:04:49.380> set<00:04:49.710> my<00:04:49.919> fly

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
I'll set my fly

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.570 
I'll set my fly
in<00:04:50.550> Group<00:04:50.790> A<00:04:50.940> two<00:04:51.720> fire<00:04:51.960> at<00:04:52.230> one<00:04:52.560> over<00:04:52.800> 30<00:04:53.340> to

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
in Group A two fire at one over 30 to

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.700 
in Group A two fire at one over 30 to
power<00:04:53.880> off<00:04:54.090> we<00:04:54.510> set<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.840> mono<00:04:55.139> mode<00:04:55.410> and

power off we set it to mono mode and
then<00:04:56.610> 1<00:04:57.450> over<00:04:57.960> 32<00:04:58.320> power<00:04:58.770> so<00:04:59.280> my<00:04:59.430> young<00:04:59.580> no<00:04:59.700> 560

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
then 1 over 32 power so my young no 560

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.140 
then 1 over 32 power so my young no 560

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
mark 3 that is in Group A will fire at 1

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.780 
mark 3 that is in Group A will fire at 1
over<00:05:03.330> 32<00:05:03.600> power<00:05:03.900> when<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:04.470> trigger<00:05:04.770> it<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.160> then

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
over 32 power when I trigger it and then

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.980 
over 32 power when I trigger it and then
I<00:05:05.820> want<00:05:06.180> my<00:05:06.300> 560<00:05:06.870> full<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.800> fire<00:05:08.040> at<00:05:08.280> say<00:05:08.990> 1/16

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990

so<00:05:10.590> I'll<00:05:10.710> set<00:05:10.889> it<00:05:10.919> to<00:05:11.480> 1/16<00:05:12.480> power<00:05:12.870> so<00:05:13.740> when<00:05:14.010> I

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
so I'll set it to 1/16 power so when I

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.960 
so I'll set it to 1/16 power so when I
take<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.820> photo<00:05:15.210> attached<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.110> my<00:05:16.230> camera<00:05:16.970> went

setting<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.790> I<00:05:23.850> just<00:05:24.210> dialed<00:05:24.600> in<00:05:24.720> so<00:05:25.080> using

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
setting that I just dialed in so using

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.020 
setting that I just dialed in so using
this<00:05:25.860> system<00:05:26.040> will<00:05:26.340> allow<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.790> play

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
this system will allow you to play

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.990 
this system will allow you to play
around<00:05:27.240> with<00:05:27.330> different<00:05:27.840> lighting<00:05:28.050> ratios<00:05:28.650> or

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
around with different lighting ratios or

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.850 
around with different lighting ratios or
another<00:05:30.000> case<00:05:30.240> would<00:05:30.419> be<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.690> say<00:05:30.870> I<00:05:31.050> only<00:05:31.410> want

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
another case would be is say I only want

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.120 
another case would be is say I only want
my<00:05:31.919> B<00:05:32.310> flash<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.790> fire<00:05:32.970> but<00:05:33.330> not<00:05:33.660> my<00:05:33.930> a<00:05:34.110> flash<00:05:34.590> so

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
my B flash to fire but not my a flash so

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.340 
my B flash to fire but not my a flash so
from<00:05:35.340> my<00:05:35.460> TX<00:05:35.820> I<00:05:35.970> can<00:05:36.150> just<00:05:36.330> simply<00:05:36.480> disable

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
from my TX I can just simply disable

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.940 
from my TX I can just simply disable
Group<00:05:37.860> A<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:39.570> my<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.810> flash<00:05:40.050> which<00:05:40.230> is<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.440> 560

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
Group A so my a flash which is the 560

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.000 
Group A so my a flash which is the 560
mark<00:05:41.190> 3<00:05:41.460> is<00:05:41.640> now<00:05:42.180> disabled<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.140> then<00:05:43.560> when<00:05:43.770> I

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
mark 3 is now disabled and then when I

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.030 
mark 3 is now disabled and then when I
fire<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:44.580> want<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.120> trigger<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:45.890> only<00:05:46.890> the

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
fire it want to trigger it only the

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.280 
fire it want to trigger it only the
flashes<00:05:47.520> sorry<00:05:48.180> only<00:05:48.419> the<00:05:48.540> groups<00:05:48.840> that<00:05:48.960> are

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
flashes sorry only the groups that are

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.100 
flashes sorry only the groups that are
enabled<00:05:49.950> will<00:05:50.400> fire<00:05:50.669> disabled<00:05:51.540> groups<00:05:51.840> will

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
enabled will fire disabled groups will

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.050 
enabled will fire disabled groups will
not<00:05:52.350> fire<00:05:52.590> so<00:05:52.800> in<00:05:52.950> this<00:05:53.100> case<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.430> group<00:05:53.610> a<00:05:53.790> is

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
not fire so in this case the group a is

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.480 
not fire so in this case the group a is
disabled<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:54.900> my<00:05:55.140> 560<00:05:55.650> mark<00:05:55.830> 3<00:05:56.010> which<00:05:56.220> is<00:05:56.250> in

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
disabled so my 560 mark 3 which is in

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.570 
disabled so my 560 mark 3 which is in
Group<00:05:56.669> A<00:05:56.820> we<00:05:57.570> will<00:05:57.690> not<00:05:57.870> fire<00:05:58.290> so<00:05:59.190> this<00:05:59.400> system

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
Group A we will not fire so this system

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.460 
Group A we will not fire so this system
is<00:05:59.880> very<00:05:59.910> versatile<00:06:00.810> because<00:06:01.020> you<00:06:01.229> can<00:06:01.320> have

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
is very versatile because you can have

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.530 
is very versatile because you can have
multiple<00:06:01.710> flashes<00:06:02.370> in<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.610> group<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.090> get<00:06:03.419> up

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
multiple flashes in a group and get up

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.180 
multiple flashes in a group and get up
up<00:06:03.750> to<00:06:03.930> six<00:06:04.200> groups<00:06:04.470> if<00:06:04.680> you're<00:06:04.830> controlling

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
up to six groups if you're controlling

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.330 
up to six groups if you're controlling
with<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.669> TX<00:06:06.080> now<00:06:07.080> if<00:06:07.350> I<00:06:07.560> have<00:06:07.770> a<00:06:07.800> flash<00:06:08.100> that

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
with the TX now if I have a flash that

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.610 
with the TX now if I have a flash that
does<00:06:08.490> not<00:06:08.700> have<00:06:08.970> a<00:06:09.150> built-in<00:06:09.510> receiver<00:06:09.960> just

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
does not have a built-in receiver just

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.590 
does not have a built-in receiver just
like<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.890> 563<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.669> fall<00:06:11.940> which<00:06:12.120> do<00:06:12.450> have

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
like the 563 and fall which do have

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.870 
like the 563 and fall which do have
built-in<00:06:12.960> receivers<00:06:13.500> I<00:06:13.680> can<00:06:14.250> actually<00:06:14.400> still

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
built-in receivers I can actually still

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.200 
built-in receivers I can actually still
use<00:06:14.910> it<00:06:15.270> with<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.600> TX<00:06:16.020> so<00:06:16.590> for<00:06:16.770> example<00:06:17.210> now

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
use it with the TX so for example now

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.529 
use it with the TX so for example now
here<00:06:18.570> I<00:06:18.600> have<00:06:18.750> a<00:06:18.930> young<00:06:19.229> no<00:06:19.410> 568a<00:06:20.370> x2<00:06:20.820> flash<00:06:21.120> so

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
here I have a young no 568a x2 flash so

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.659 
here I have a young no 568a x2 flash so
this<00:06:21.750> flash<00:06:22.110> does<00:06:22.440> not<00:06:22.710> have<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:23.400> built-in

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
this flash does not have the built-in

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.960 
this flash does not have the built-in
receiver<00:06:24.270> of<00:06:24.570> the<00:06:24.630> 5<00:06:25.050> 60s<00:06:25.560> so<00:06:26.190> what<00:06:26.370> I<00:06:26.400> can<00:06:26.729> do

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
receiver of the 5 60s so what I can do

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.690 
receiver of the 5 60s so what I can do
is<00:06:27.180> I<00:06:27.479> can<00:06:27.539> attach<00:06:27.900> it<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:28.289> either<00:06:28.500> a<00:06:28.680> RF<00:06:29.220> 6:03

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
is I can attach it to either a RF 6:03

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.480 
is I can attach it to either a RF 6:03
or<00:06:30.419> a<00:06:31.260> RF<00:06:31.950> 6:05<00:06:32.990> so<00:06:33.990> when<00:06:34.200> I<00:06:34.229> attach<00:06:34.560> it<00:06:34.740> to<00:06:35.010> a<00:06:35.039> 6

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
or a RF 6:05 so when I attach it to a 6

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.800 
or a RF 6:05 so when I attach it to a 6
0<00:06:35.640> 3<00:06:35.700> or<00:06:36.060> 6<00:06:36.270> 0<00:06:36.539> 5<00:06:36.840> and<00:06:38.030> then<00:06:39.030> when<00:06:39.210> I<00:06:39.419> take<00:06:39.780> a

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
0 3 or 6 0 5 and then when I take a

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.760 
0 3 or 6 0 5 and then when I take a
picture<00:06:40.550> put<00:06:41.550> this<00:06:41.729> down<00:06:42.140> attach<00:06:43.140> this<00:06:43.410> to<00:06:43.560> my

camera and then when I take a picture

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.990 
camera and then when I take a picture
you<00:06:47.910> can<00:06:48.060> see<00:06:48.090> the<00:06:48.419> 5<00:06:48.660> 60<00:06:49.080> X<00:06:49.380> 2<00:06:49.590> has<00:06:49.919> also<00:06:50.250> fired

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
you can see the 5 60 X 2 has also fired

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.150 
you can see the 5 60 X 2 has also fired
however<00:06:51.720> do<00:06:51.900> note<00:06:52.050> that<00:06:52.320> using<00:06:52.530> this<00:06:52.830> will
