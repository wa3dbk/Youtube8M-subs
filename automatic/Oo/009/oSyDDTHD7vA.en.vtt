00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.419 
them back yet and then also because of
certain<00:01:51.929> players<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.649> how<00:01:52.770> many<00:01:52.829> games<00:01:53.219> are

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
certain players and how many games are

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.389 
certain players and how many games are
played<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.969> season<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.799> wanted<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> rest<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.699 
played in the season I wanted to rest a
few<00:01:56.429> so<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:57.289> hopefully<00:01:58.289> that<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.560> got

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
few so then hopefully that we got

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.199 
few so then hopefully that we got
through<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.069> the<00:01:59.100> final<00:01:59.579> which<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.880> did<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
through to the final which we did and

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.529 
through to the final which we did and
they<00:02:00.929> will<00:02:01.140> all<00:02:01.259> play<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> final<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:03.420> know

they will all play in the final you know

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.260 
they will all play in the final you know
so<00:02:03.810> there's<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.770> there's<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> reason<00:02:05.640> behind<00:02:05.670> how

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
so there's a there's a reason behind how

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.169 
so there's a there's a reason behind how
I've<00:02:06.479> selected<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.229> team<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:08.280> know<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.030> then

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
I've selected the team you know so then

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.609 
I've selected the team you know so then
hopefully<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.259> through<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
hopefully we can get through the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.350 
hopefully we can get through the
competition<00:02:10.920> without<00:02:11.250> picking<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.819> any

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
competition without picking up any

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.780

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790

performance and the players work really

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.819 
performance and the players work really
hard<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.150> they<00:02:18.750> kept<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> shape<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> team
