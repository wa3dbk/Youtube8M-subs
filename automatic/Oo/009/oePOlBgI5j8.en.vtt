00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.200
 What's up, guys, so I just 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:13.589
 assemble the new exhaust from the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:17.580
 child is scaled that I did and there it is 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:20.580
 I need to see but it is always mentioned think 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.439
 which was very short because actually 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.039
 could not muffle much noise from the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.650
 motorcycle probably do not have more to 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.160
 Front I have to do a little bit 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.160
 bigger 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.000
 will stay to decrease a little noise 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.080
 which looks like it's still noisy 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.650
 A delicious filet gave but it accelerates Christmas 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.650
 so damn 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.760
 that is all right high is that there was only 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.050
 first escape I did I found 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.730
 which is still very high and becomes a 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.900
 a little lower so as not to have 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.420
 problem, right? 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.910
 But the motorbike is too good. 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.680
 You know me here and then more. 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.990
 front in which a couple of weeks 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.420
 I go there in the month staying here did 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.170
 escape for me I'll get a 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.300
 another damn of that style there is not cut 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:43.420
 Only this time I cut too much. 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:46.660
 short, and still there a little 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.020
 High I still could not find myself much 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.540
 so the popping of the noise is not 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.649
 so for now this leak will 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:03.490
 I'll stay, but I'll beat you soon. 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:04.690
 I modified it right there on the loose in the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.899
 stop 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.100
 a hug for you and a good end of 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.720
 beauty week 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.310
 Thank you so much for caring, everyone. 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.060
 What is now welcome, a 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.060
 Hugs thanks
