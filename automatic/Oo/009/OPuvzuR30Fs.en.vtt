so<00:00:14.500> today<00:00:14.770> I'm<00:00:15.010> here<00:00:15.460> to<00:00:15.640> teach<00:00:15.820> you<00:00:16.150> how<00:00:16.630> to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
so today I'm here to teach you how to

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.950 
so today I'm here to teach you how to
grow<00:00:16.960> an<00:00:17.080> ear<00:00:17.380> using<00:00:18.220> fat<00:00:18.630> now<00:00:19.630> you're

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
grow an ear using fat now you're

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.330 
grow an ear using fat now you're
probably<00:00:20.200> thinking<00:00:20.350> I'm<00:00:20.650> either<00:00:20.830> crazy<00:00:21.130> or

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
probably thinking I'm either crazy or

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.490 
probably thinking I'm either crazy or
wasting<00:00:21.910> my<00:00:22.029> time<00:00:22.270> because<00:00:22.810> this<00:00:23.110> has<00:00:23.290> already

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
wasting my time because this has already

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.410 
wasting my time because this has already
been<00:00:23.680> done<00:00:23.890> before<00:00:24.220> you've<00:00:24.880> all<00:00:25.029> seen<00:00:25.270> the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
been done before you've all seen the

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.730 
been done before you've all seen the
photo<00:00:25.660> of<00:00:25.900> the<00:00:25.990> mouse<00:00:26.170> with<00:00:26.349> the<00:00:26.380> air<00:00:26.529> on<00:00:26.619> its

surgical procedure that we perform to
reconstruct<00:00:45.309> this<00:00:45.460> requires<00:00:46.269> us<00:00:46.449> to<00:00:46.479> remove

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
reconstruct this requires us to remove

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.200 
reconstruct this requires us to remove
ribs<00:00:47.199> from<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.379> patient<00:00:47.860> and<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.760> cartilage

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
ribs from the patient and the cartilage

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.479 
ribs from the patient and the cartilage
from<00:00:49.510> those<00:00:49.780> ribs<00:00:50.140> is<00:00:50.350> used<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:50.979> carve<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.370> new

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
from those ribs is used to carve a new

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.350 
from those ribs is used to carve a new
ear<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.989> is<00:00:53.229> a<00:00:53.620> major<00:00:54.070> operation<00:00:54.610> with

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
ear this is a major operation with

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.149 
ear this is a major operation with
significant<00:00:56.049> risks<00:00:56.409> and<00:00:56.589> significant

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
significant risks and significant

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.030 
significant risks and significant
complications<00:00:57.790> and<00:00:58.620> therefore<00:00:59.620> I<00:00:59.830> believe

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
complications and therefore I believe

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.549 
complications and therefore I believe
there<00:01:00.339> must<00:01:00.580> be<00:01:00.790> a<00:01:00.820> better<00:01:00.970> solution<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.720> the

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
there must be a better solution and the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.829 
there must be a better solution and the
ability<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.190> grow<00:01:03.430> an<00:01:03.580> ear<00:01:03.729> would<00:01:04.299> be<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.510> major

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
ability to grow an ear would be a major

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.969 
ability to grow an ear would be a major
step<00:01:05.049> forwards<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.720> back<00:01:07.870> to<00:01:07.900> our<00:01:08.020> mouse<00:01:08.320> it

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
step forwards so back to our mouse it

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.130 
step forwards so back to our mouse it
didn't<00:01:09.340> fix<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.610> problem<00:01:10.030> but<00:01:10.540> it<00:01:10.659> showed<00:01:10.960> us

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
didn't fix the problem but it showed us

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.530 
didn't fix the problem but it showed us
two<00:01:11.440> key<00:01:11.860> principles<00:01:12.580> that<00:01:12.820> if<00:01:13.150> you<00:01:13.270> want<00:01:13.479> to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
two key principles that if you want to

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.050 
two key principles that if you want to
engineer<00:01:13.780> any<00:01:14.290> tissue<00:01:14.680> you<00:01:15.370> need<00:01:15.580> one<00:01:15.760> of<00:01:15.790> two

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
engineer any tissue you need one of two

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.900 
engineer any tissue you need one of two
things<00:01:16.330> firstly<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:18.040> right<00:01:18.280> type<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.550> cells

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
things firstly the right type of cells

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.080 
things firstly the right type of cells
and<00:01:19.530> secondly<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:21.100> right<00:01:21.280> scaffold<00:01:21.880> on<00:01:22.030> which

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
and secondly the right scaffold on which

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.960 
and secondly the right scaffold on which
they<00:01:22.390> will<00:01:22.510> grow<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.050> this<00:01:24.010> is<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.610> basis<00:01:24.940> of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
they will grow and this is the basis of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.470 
they will grow and this is the basis of
my<00:01:25.150> project<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:26.140> identify<00:01:26.260> cells<00:01:27.040> and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
my project to identify cells and

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.300 
my project to identify cells and
scaffolds<00:01:28.480> that<00:01:28.660> I<00:01:28.960> can<00:01:29.290> use<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:30.160> grow

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
scaffolds that I can use to grow

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.710 
scaffolds that I can use to grow
cartilage<00:01:30.970> for<00:01:31.390> ear<00:01:31.570> reconstruction<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.600> the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
cartilage for ear reconstruction so the

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.990 
cartilage for ear reconstruction so the
human<00:01:35.050> body<00:01:35.260> is<00:01:35.440> an<00:01:35.560> organism<00:01:35.890> whose<00:01:36.340> lifespan

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
human body is an organism whose lifespan

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.270 
human body is an organism whose lifespan
is<00:01:37.120> measured<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.510> decades<00:01:38.160> but<00:01:39.160> the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
is measured in decades but the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.190 
is measured in decades but the
individual<00:01:39.850> cells<00:01:40.150> which<00:01:40.390> comprise<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.840> have

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
individual cells which comprise it have

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.780 
individual cells which comprise it have
a<00:01:41.230> lifespan<00:01:41.800> which<00:01:42.160> is<00:01:42.280> measured<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.700> only

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
a lifespan which is measured in only

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.870 
a lifespan which is measured in only
days<00:01:43.620> it's<00:01:44.620> therefore<00:01:44.920> intuitive<00:01:45.730> that<00:01:45.820> the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
days it's therefore intuitive that the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.420 
days it's therefore intuitive that the
body<00:01:46.150> must<00:01:46.540> contain<00:01:47.100> populations<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.250> cells

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
body must contain populations of cells

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.700 
body must contain populations of cells
that<00:01:48.790> are<00:01:49.270> capable<00:01:49.540> of<00:01:49.840> replenishing<00:01:50.320> and

adipose tissue is a fantastic source of
stem<00:02:17.769> cells<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.290> found<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.739> cells<00:02:20.980> now<00:02:21.849> I

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
stem cells so I found the cells now I

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.220 
stem cells so I found the cells now I
need<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.150> find<00:02:22.359> the<00:02:22.420> scaffold<00:02:23.639> polymers

individual polymers and from that I've

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.820 
individual polymers and from that I've
identified<00:02:37.950> five<00:02:38.790> specific<00:02:39.480> polymers<00:02:40.140> which

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
identified five specific polymers which

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.030 
identified five specific polymers which
