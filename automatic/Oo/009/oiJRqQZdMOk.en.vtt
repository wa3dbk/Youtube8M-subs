00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.870 
weaknesses so in that part it's just
like<00:01:31.439> golf<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.040> mean<00:01:32.070> that's<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:32.610> when

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
like golf I mean that's what I do when

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.999 
like golf I mean that's what I do when
I'm<00:01:33.030> open<00:01:33.630> tiger<00:01:33.960> i<00:01:33.990> watch<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.890> make

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I'm open tiger i watch and make

I'm open tiger i watch and make
observations<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.259> give<00:01:37.439> them

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
observations and then you know give them

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.800 
observations and then you know give them
some<00:01:37.680> ideas<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.040> what<00:01:38.189> he<00:01:38.369> could<00:01:38.549> practice<00:01:38.810> so

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
some ideas of what he could practice so

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.510 
some ideas of what he could practice so
even<00:01:40.049> though<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.380> least<00:01:40.740> experienced<00:01:41.280> player

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
even though the least experienced player

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
even though the least experienced player
such<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.210> myself<00:01:42.360> we'd<00:01:42.930> probably<00:01:43.110> able<00:01:43.259> to
