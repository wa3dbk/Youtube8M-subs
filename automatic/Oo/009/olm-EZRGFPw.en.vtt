00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.740
 although in him what I propose to do 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.660
 these little things of paper to assemble a 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.910
 simple and cheap center so that 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.910
 see the technique has so many 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.200
 applications as you can think of is not 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.330
 can do a lot of these 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.060
 paper appointments and put them in a vase 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.750
 of glass can be placed 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.270
 individually on the edge of a 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.059
 bookshelf or put them online to 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.040
 create a table runner obviously 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.200
 They also serve to decorate wrappers 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.570
 of gifts can be pasted in a frame 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.239
 of photos use to make scrapbook 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.850
 as I told you that of so many 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.949
 applications as ideas what I 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.329
 I propose is to use them as an element 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.900
 main in a centerpiece 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.880
 spring 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.920
 because there is nothing more cities than 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.390
 flowers these paper roses are 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.120
 perfect to give that touch of 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.760
 spring to anise are so easy to 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.880
 do and so cheap you only need 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.800
 strips -something thick paper can be 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.720
 use as a toilet paper as I have 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.300
 done me or can these roses be made 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.890
 with tissue paper the only thing necessary is 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.720
 that the paper is a soft paper and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.120
 malleable to get rolled up 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 easily and that the result looks like 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.950
 a flower very similar to a rose 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.750
 because that's what you have to do now 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.850
 you are seeing it is about rolling 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.280
 an obese strip of paper on itself 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.930
 to fix the shape is convenient 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.330
 Twist the paper while going 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.040
 rolling then to give us 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.410
 roll each of the little things 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.550
 we can use adhesive 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.550
 to fix the final end 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.180
 about the adhesive glue should be 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.340
 soft because the paper is too and if 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.920
 a strong tail is used is possible 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.930
 that he burns or makes them any 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.350
 Adhesive or children's adhesive 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.350
 will serve 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.470
 to create the centerpiece of what you 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.240
 I propose is to place a good bunch of 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.400
 these little paper roses on a plate 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.010
 although you can also use a 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.260
 tray a fountain to a decorative base 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.119
 that you have by house as my proposal 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.670
 is to make a center of spring mass 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.300
 easy and cheap I propose to ride 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.300
 about a single 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.370
 and that's all you already know that this idea 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.110
 as well as others you can find them in 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 rope book decorates point is
