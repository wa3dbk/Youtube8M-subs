 Then you can not learn Japanese when you talk about economics that are top- matted for two minutes. 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.179
 So today it is an interesting case for Sam Kim officials of the Japanese minicar 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.400
 Posted 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:19.439
 Hello I itneunjineun that he gave no lines at all the cars around the problem in South Korea 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.010
 But the Japanese minicar cross from the title of the article very provocative that even galttae 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.539
 Let's go until we get to the channel's. 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.740
 Oh, do you have any 60 hangeo far between until the minicar will go without restrictions Yes 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:36.210
 However , it is the right answer if you go to any restrictions . 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.660
 I mean really I look at the left created a lot of raised areas 5 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.010
 So anyway , it seems to be gray where the 15-year-old card is known until 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.829
 Yes, for example, the diet that sells the most cops in Japan 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.600
 That's what I see in Honda 2 4 . 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:55.530
 3 I went to do the same thing and did not sin any better to improve on improvement 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.359
 It seems that Kao-2 is the same, 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.570
 I push it up to now, and that 's why I'm a police officer in Japan 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.189
 Market size of this sub-market in 1 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.450
 How much is this? Yes, about 40% 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.439
 It's filled with light vehicles 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.860
 When I look at my own one year, I get about 1.5 million to 2 million 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.450
 It's possible 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.159
 Japan's annual mini-market is selling up to 2 million units in Korea. 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:27.689
 The whole car is about 1.5 million cars . 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.950
 The slope claim is the whole automobile market in Korea and the repetition is how good it is 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.180
 I'll come out in a variety of ways. 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.320
 What is the biggest difference between Korean and Japanese police? 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:42.030
 Because the personality of the light vehicle is different, the size of the engine is different and the engine displacement is over. 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:46.770
 But I'm not God Bo million of one-time media functionality minicar minicar 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:52.020
 Practicality and low maintenance costs also interesting news anchor to this case dimensions 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:56.969

 I've been so did not see with We have the view that its focus 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.929
 Geuraetneunde as tea to drink, for example, what the difference is aroused differences of perception 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.830
 For example, in Kanto 5 star good ra 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.550
 Sliding doors and itneyo can momjom the headlamps taillights 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.690
 If a long car ride dimensional simhaejin know the day of its population so seulah

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.660
 Inde intended to allow children can easily open and close the sliding course plates sat there 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.379
 Electric door of the door 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.940
 I came in here, o, but then I fell into Kia's Ray. 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.900
 Run to power. 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.640
 What price will not rise for example to play different schools mean that's why four andan 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:46.680
 Of course, in terms of cost savings , Grayair lost the electric motor. 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.740
 When you have nothing but solidarity is an example of the cost savings haeteumyeonseo head 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.730
 I do not know. 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.960
 No matter what anything like me that do not turn right teacher for the University of the police of the two countries 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.130
 20 I ate something to know what the difference was . Well, 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.090
 The biggest reason I like it is because he's a tight car . 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.860
 He did it. 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.210
 Who the hell is not regulated cargo in the mountains of the car-free glass is unconditional and garages 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:16.890
 I do not have a garage, even iteoyaji agreement'm the ability to buy a car 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:20.310
 The good fortune is that parking is very expensive and you have your own apartment. 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.720
 The parking fee is spoiled separately. It 's not my own place, but I live in this apartment. 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.290
 I have to pay for parking . 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.610
 Yes I live in an apartment, but I do not have a car, 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.140
 There's a window. 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.070
 If something like that. Why yen in Tokyo chijamyeon's like a country that doing away three people 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.850
 I wrote it. 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.870
 That's why I wrote about a month's worth of monthly parking fees in that area. 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.250
 The two companies 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.780
 And the entrance of the Tokyo god is 4 500,000 won . 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:50.100
 When they enter the more expensive central Tokyo than 1 million won or more monthly comic r3 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:53.900
 It has also lost the ability to methane and only 50 are Manhattan palm 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.900
