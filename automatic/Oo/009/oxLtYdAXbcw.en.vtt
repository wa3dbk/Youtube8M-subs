00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
well mark what's the first this tremolo

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.300 
well mark what's the first this tremolo
anything<00:02:41.110> special<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.739> dig<00:02:41.890> about<00:02:42.010> this

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
anything special that you dig about this

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.460 
anything special that you dig about this
this<00:02:42.730> has<00:02:42.940> got<00:02:43.090> very<00:02:43.300> cool<00:02:43.480> cool<00:02:43.840> controlling

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
this has got very cool cool controlling

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.560 
this has got very cool cool controlling
in<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:44.920> takes<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.340> from<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.610> sine<00:02:45.880> wave<00:02:45.910> to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
in it that takes it from a sine wave to

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.910 
in it that takes it from a sine wave to
a<00:02:46.600> square<00:02:46.959> wave<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.410> can<00:02:47.560> get<00:02:47.680> really

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
a square wave so you can get really

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.270 
a square wave so you can get really
smooth<00:02:48.459> kind<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.030> Val<00:02:49.780> B<00:02:50.110> type<00:02:50.500> tremolo<00:02:50.980> sound

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
smooth kind of Val B type tremolo sound

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.860 
smooth kind of Val B type tremolo sound
and<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.489> can't<00:02:51.700> really<00:02:51.910> aggressive<00:02:52.510> kind<00:02:52.720> of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
and you can't really aggressive kind of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.960 
and you can't really aggressive kind of
in-your-face<00:02:53.019> Garage<00:02:53.830> Band<00:02:54.070> sounds<00:02:54.550> really

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
in-your-face Garage Band sounds really

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:13.440 
in-your-face Garage Band sounds really
cool

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.729 

you<00:03:14.450> love<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.720> distortion<00:03:15.260> you're<00:03:15.470> telling

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
you love the distortion you're telling

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:15.970 
you love the distortion you're telling
me

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
me

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.619 
me
well<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.250> distortion<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.909> very<00:03:17.150> cool<00:03:17.390> it's

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
well the distortion is very cool it's

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.500 
well the distortion is very cool it's
really<00:03:17.959> kind<00:03:18.319> of<00:03:18.470> dirty<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.879> mean<00:03:20.239> and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
really kind of dirty and mean and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.660 
really kind of dirty and mean and
aggressive<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.650> just<00:03:21.950> says<00:03:22.159> rock'n'roll

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
aggressive and it just says rock'n'roll

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:40.020 
aggressive and it just says rock'n'roll
basically

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.250 

all<00:03:41.030> right<00:03:41.180> arts<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.540> gonna<00:03:41.720> play<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:41.930> phaser

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
all right arts is gonna play the phaser

00:03:42.260 --> 00:04:26.480 
all right arts is gonna play the phaser
for<00:03:42.650> us<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.980> high<00:03:43.129> watt<00:03:43.310> phaser<00:04:09.489> overdrive

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.160 

phaser<00:04:27.490> is<00:04:27.850> very<00:04:28.120> cool<00:04:28.330> I<00:04:28.630> mean<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:28.990> just

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
phaser is very cool I mean it just

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.140 
phaser is very cool I mean it just
reminds<00:04:29.650> me<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.860> something<00:04:30.400> from<00:04:30.430> you<00:04:31.030> know

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
reminds me of something from you know

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.210 
reminds me of something from you know
like<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.450> seven<00:04:31.960> is<00:04:32.140> something<00:04:32.680> off<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> Pink

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
like the seven is something off a Pink

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.590 
like the seven is something off a Pink
Floyd<00:04:33.430> album<00:04:33.670> something<00:04:34.120> like<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:34.510> it's

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
Floyd album something like that it's

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.960 
Floyd album something like that it's
very<00:04:34.660> cool<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:36.040> overdrive<00:04:36.460> is<00:04:36.580> just<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:36.790> real

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
very cool the overdrive is just a real

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.270 
very cool the overdrive is just a real
nice<00:04:37.210> gives<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.690> nice<00:04:37.870> grip<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.590> sound<00:04:38.890> just

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
nice gives a nice grip to the sound just

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.950 
nice gives a nice grip to the sound just
takes<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.610> amp<00:04:39.730> a<00:04:39.820> little<00:04:40.060> bit<00:04:40.150> further<00:04:40.450> and

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
takes the amp a little bit further and

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.420 
takes the amp a little bit further and
then<00:04:41.290> you<00:04:41.380> can<00:04:41.560> just<00:04:41.710> go<00:04:41.860> on<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:41.980> full-on

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
then you can just go on the full-on

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.860 
then you can just go on the full-on
distortion<00:04:42.970> after<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.480> take<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:43.750> all

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
distortion after that to take you all

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.230 
distortion after that to take you all
the<00:04:43.900> way<00:04:44.010> this<00:04:45.010> is<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.310> pretty<00:04:45.520> special<00:04:45.910> amps

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
the way this is to pretty special amps

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.320 
the way this is to pretty special amps
right<00:04:46.420> here<00:04:47.130> tell<00:04:48.130> us<00:04:48.250> about<00:04:48.430> what's<00:04:48.640> going<00:04:48.880> on

Grohl<00:04:51.580> yeah<00:04:51.820> absolutely<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.660> top<00:04:53.050> one<00:04:53.290> is<00:04:53.500> an

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
Grohl yeah absolutely this top one is an

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.310 
Grohl yeah absolutely this top one is an
amplifier<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.090> we<00:04:55.420> made<00:04:55.630> for<00:04:55.810> Dave<00:04:56.020> last

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
amplifier that we made for Dave last

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.830 
amplifier that we made for Dave last
year<00:04:56.590> we<00:04:57.220> made<00:04:57.370> him<00:04:57.520> five<00:04:57.790> of<00:04:58.030> these<00:04:58.210> it's

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
year we made him five of these it's

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.560 
year we made him five of these it's
based<00:04:59.200> on<00:04:59.320> an<00:04:59.470> s<00:04:59.650> AP<00:05:00.130> amplifier<00:05:00.970> from<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.360> late

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
based on an s AP amplifier from the late

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.140 
based on an s AP amplifier from the late
sixties<00:05:02.140> which<00:05:02.710> was<00:05:02.920> used<00:05:03.130> most<00:05:03.370> famously<00:05:03.880> by

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150

switch<00:05:07.720> on<00:05:08.050> it<00:05:08.170> which<00:05:08.380> is<00:05:08.590> very<00:05:08.830> rare<00:05:09.130> for<00:05:09.160> a

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
switch on it which is very rare for a

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.430 
switch on it which is very rare for a
handbill<00:05:10.240> amp<00:05:10.480> from<00:05:10.570> that<00:05:10.780> period<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.320> what

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
handbill amp from that period and what

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.200 
handbill amp from that period and what
that<00:05:11.590> does<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:11.950> brings<00:05:12.220> down<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.760> volume

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
that does it brings down the volume

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.270 
that does it brings down the volume
so<00:05:13.780> in<00:05:13.900> essence<00:05:14.260> you've<00:05:14.440> got<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.680> rhythm<00:05:14.950> and<00:05:15.220> a

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
so in essence you've got a rhythm and a

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.310 
so in essence you've got a rhythm and a
lead<00:05:15.460> volume<00:05:15.850> you<00:05:16.300> attenuate<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.840> signal<00:05:17.020> for

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
lead volume you attenuate the signal for

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.110 
lead volume you attenuate the signal for
the<00:05:17.410> Rivermen<00:05:17.650> basically<00:05:18.250> turn<00:05:18.640> it<00:05:18.790> back<00:05:19.090> on

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
the Rivermen basically turn it back on

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.240 
the Rivermen basically turn it back on
for<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:20.080> lead<00:05:20.320> sound<00:05:20.620> it's<00:05:20.740> very<00:05:20.800> cool<00:05:21.220> and

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
for the lead sound it's very cool and

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.890 
for the lead sound it's very cool and
all<00:05:21.550> hand<00:05:21.850> built<00:05:22.060> in<00:05:22.180> England<00:05:22.510> point-to-point
