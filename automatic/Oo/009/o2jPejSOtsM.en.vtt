so<00:05:03.030> let's<00:05:03.300> continue<00:05:04.310> when<00:05:05.310> emotive<00:05:06.060> goes

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
so let's continue when emotive goes

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.220 
so let's continue when emotive goes
farther<00:05:07.980> than<00:05:08.160> he<00:05:08.610> should<00:05:08.910> he<00:05:09.630> goes<00:05:09.840> further

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
farther than he should he goes further

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.670 
farther than he should he goes further
than<00:05:10.440> other<00:05:10.910> buildings<00:05:11.910> then<00:05:12.810> he<00:05:13.080> becomes<00:05:13.410> the

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
than other buildings then he becomes the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.770 
than other buildings then he becomes the
target<00:05:13.950> and<00:05:16.310> big<00:05:17.310> due<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:20.030> that<00:05:21.030> he's<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.360> hero

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
target and big due to that he's a hero

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.460 
target and big due to that he's a hero
new<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:22.950> walls<00:05:23.990> enemies<00:05:24.990> are<00:05:25.200> just

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
new to the walls enemies are just

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.840 
new to the walls enemies are just
destroying<00:05:26.460> calls<00:05:26.790> and<00:05:27.180> that<00:05:27.900> Troy's

destroying calls and that Troy's
everything<00:05:30.890> so<00:05:33.470> this<00:05:34.470> is<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.980> worst<00:05:35.400> thing

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
everything so this is the worst thing

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.280 
everything so this is the worst thing
about<00:05:36.750> using<00:05:37.170> imported<00:05:37.740> inhuman<00:05:38.490> monsters

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.620 
about using imported inhuman monsters
well<00:05:41.570> they<00:05:42.570> can<00:05:43.790> repair<00:05:44.790> that<00:05:44.820> problem

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
well they can repair that problem

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.790 
well they can repair that problem
solving<00:05:46.260> by<00:05:47.250> putting<00:05:47.880> her<00:05:47.910> own<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.800> buildings

solving by putting her own and buildings
further<00:05:50.660> so<00:05:51.660> important<00:05:52.440> won't<00:05:52.860> go<00:05:53.160> so<00:05:53.850> far<00:05:54.440> but

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
further so important won't go so far but

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.100 
further so important won't go so far but
that<00:05:55.710> will<00:05:56.070> cause<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.910> promise<00:05:57.330> once<00:05:57.720> more<00:05:57.930> if

that will cause the promise once more if

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.000 
that will cause the promise once more if
