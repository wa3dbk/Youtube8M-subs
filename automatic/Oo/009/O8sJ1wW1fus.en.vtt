00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
know there's already been gameplays of

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.410 
know there's already been gameplays of
them<00:04:13.049> being<00:04:13.290> uploaded<00:04:13.650> phase<00:04:14.489> heist<00:04:14.880> had<00:04:15.150> one

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
them being uploaded phase heist had one

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.449 
them being uploaded phase heist had one
all<00:04:15.750> sniping<00:04:16.229> which<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.709> just<00:04:16.979> completely

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
all sniping which is just completely

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.380 
all sniping which is just completely
ridiculous<00:04:18.169> but<00:04:19.169> um<00:04:19.640> basically<00:04:20.640> what<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.180> is

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
ridiculous but um basically what it is

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.980 
ridiculous but um basically what it is
it<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.750> not<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.019> nuke<00:04:22.440> it's<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.430> 25<00:04:24.090> kill<00:04:24.419> streak

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
it is not a nuke it's a 25 kill streak

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.659 
it is not a nuke it's a 25 kill streak
for<00:04:25.289> for<00:04:25.500> me<00:04:25.620> because<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:26.009> have<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.220> hard<00:04:26.430> line<00:04:26.639> on

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
for for me because I have a hard line on

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.960 
for for me because I have a hard line on
and<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:28.139> not<00:04:28.319> like<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.740> game-ending<00:04:29.610> nuke

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
and it's not like the game-ending nuke

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.719 
and it's not like the game-ending nuke
of<00:04:30.180> modern<00:04:30.509> warfare<00:04:30.660> 2<00:04:31.080> when<00:04:31.949> you<00:04:32.069> get<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.520> you

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
call it in and it has a little countdown

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.689

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
and it kills everybody on the enemy team

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.330 
and it kills everybody on the enemy team
it<00:04:38.699> acts<00:04:38.880> as<00:04:39.030> an<00:04:39.180> EMP<00:04:39.690> for<00:04:39.960> one<00:04:40.139> minute<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.650> it

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
it acts as an EMP for one minute and it
