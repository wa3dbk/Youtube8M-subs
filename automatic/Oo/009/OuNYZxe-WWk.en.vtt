00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
like using these tiny little guys

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.200 
like using these tiny little guys
because<00:03:55.980> they're<00:03:56.160> hard<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.460> see<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.850> your<00:03:56.970> hair

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210
