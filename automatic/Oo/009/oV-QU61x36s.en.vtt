00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello friends and friends I will move to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.410
 teach them how to make a little box so 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.469
 serves for the desk to put the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.290
 papers or in a project later goes 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.139
 to serve as the base for a balloon 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.770
 aerostatic this box is made in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.289
 completely with ice cream sticks and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.350
 I will proceed to spend stensen already 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.730
 teachers 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.340
 yes what they will obviously need 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.600
 ice cream sticks you are going to see the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.820
 As the stick and they will support or be 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.540
 they are going to gather between them calculation between 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.410
 12 and 13 sticks everything depends on this and 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.300
 they're going to hit one side and now we're going to 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.559
 hit the other leaving a little bit of 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.460
 margin on the sides and here more or less 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.240
 they also leave 1 centimeter and a half 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.000
 approximately to see let's measure 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.500
 2 almost two centimeters from the shore 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.610
 inwards we're going to put the other one 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.409
 pallet just do it with this 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 the silicone gun 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.149
 so we will support the other or 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.149
 less at the same height 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.110
 the important thing is that they stick well 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.610
 yes 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:35.140
 there is look, this is going to be the base 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.020
 between 12 and 13 sticks and two sticks that 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.330
 they are going to grab all the woods then 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.070
 this is the basis for the sides that 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.870
 we are going to need 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:50.050
 let's use four equal sides like this 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.479
 with sticks are also going to do here 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.580
 one that is about to be finished are going to 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:01.330
 make 1 2 3 4 5 sticks in a row and go 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.180
 from half a stick what 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.630
 we start in the exact half and we're going to 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.020
 put one and another to the other side we're going to 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.020
 to size 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.159
 and we're going to stick them with silicone 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.489
 be careful that the silicones dry 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.500
 fast so do not delay to the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.020
 place them 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.250
 well then with the sticks what 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.160
 we do is grab our woods well 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.790
 let's do four of these if four 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.510
 for each side of the box and what 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.019
 let's do let's put first 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.060
 let's measure this 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.760
 let's put the ones on the side first 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.670
 where is the palette where is this 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.890
 pallet and we will support it well on the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:01.390
 pallet there they come and they will leave in the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.220
 margins are going to leave here those who are going 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.590
 to leave a little space for 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.010
 the other one also sits there yes 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.280
 then we will start supporting and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.190
 hitting is at the same height of this 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.799
 another then what are we going to do we are going to 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.670
 put both on the side and on the 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:24.060
 bottom part of the stick so 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.400
 silicone 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.510
 and we're just going to support it 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.510
 and we hold 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.950
 and this time 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.540
 that's where our little box is going , 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.489
 we're going to do the other side 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.489
 let's support it 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:53.550
 try when they support it that is 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:57.120
 rights out of the sticks 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.300
 those who are standing if they were 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.300
 outside 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.780
 the box is taking shape and now 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:14.650
 we're just going to paste the others in 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:18.320
 the other side we are going to put here 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:24.430
 from this side too 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.430
 from this side and at the base 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.259
 and we will support 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.259
 we place 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.240
 see how it is going 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.490
 when you sit down, you see, we're going to what 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.270
 leave like that but actually these fins 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.169
 they go from the other side if from the outside 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.169
 then the same here 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.810
 there we are going to put more silicone 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.569
 I do not want to delay because it dries 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.120
 Quick 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.790
 and we will support 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.240
 I had been 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.100
 and there is that the 'army' see our box 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.110
 if we want it to be wider than 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.710
 inside obviously this is going to go more 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.530
 outward yes 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.020
 Once we have it ready, I'm going to 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.290
 give a paint trick so that 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.620
 look how they are, they see that everything is as 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.510
 dotted with colors then what are 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.860
 to do first is to lend a hand 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:41.350
 of white latex if of white latex and 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.920
 once they have that latex already 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:48.790
 Dry will grab a toothbrush 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.370
 and they're going to grab a common acrylic they're going 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.940
 to water a little bit they are going to 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:58.440
 little water and a little water 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:02.140
 to wet and they will wet the brush well and 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.670
 they're just going to do this so they're going 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:09.550
 they are going to pass the finger and they will go 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:13.450
 staining the box with colors come here 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.880
 I be pink and use a lilac then I 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.400
 that what they are going to do, they simply do 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.090
 this movement and it's going to splash all 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.390
 this colors good I hope that you 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.490
 have liked and that they do this for 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.160
 have it on the desk 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.169
 the house or to use it in the next 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.300
 project that is going to be this balloon 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.960
 Hot Air we are in the next 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.960
 draft
