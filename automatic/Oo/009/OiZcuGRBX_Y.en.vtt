hi i'm jim with n'stuff music.com and

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.310 
hi i'm jim with n'stuff music.com and
we're<00:00:34.240> here<00:00:34.360> today<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.660> talk<00:00:34.840> about<00:00:34.900> the

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
we're here today to talk about the

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.979 
we're here today to talk about the
philosophers<00:00:35.920> tone<00:00:36.220> from<00:00:37.060> pig<00:00:37.330> Tronics<00:00:37.810> now

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
philosophers tone from pig Tronics now

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.920 
philosophers tone from pig Tronics now
what<00:00:38.200> this<00:00:38.410> is<00:00:38.770> it's<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.700> compressor<00:00:40.180> pedal<00:00:40.450> but

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
what this is it's a compressor pedal but

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.900 
what this is it's a compressor pedal but
it's<00:00:41.170> a<00:00:41.260> compressor<00:00:41.710> pedal<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.520> has<00:00:42.670> some

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
it's a compressor pedal that has some

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.689 
it's a compressor pedal that has some
really<00:00:43.059> unique<00:00:43.300> features<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.559> let's<00:00:45.489> take<00:00:45.670> a

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
really unique features so let's take a

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.520 
really unique features so let's take a
look<00:00:45.970> at<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.150> controls<00:00:46.540> here<00:00:46.840> we're<00:00:47.230> gonna<00:00:47.320> go

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
look at the controls here we're gonna go

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.950 
look at the controls here we're gonna go
from<00:00:47.739> right<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.100> left

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
from right to left

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.910 
from right to left
volume<00:00:49.960> control<00:00:51.390> treble<00:00:52.390> control<00:00:52.780> we<00:00:53.770> have<00:00:53.890> a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
volume control treble control we have a

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.920 
volume control treble control we have a
blend<00:00:54.340> control<00:00:54.850> which<00:00:55.239> gives<00:00:55.480> you<00:00:55.570> kind<00:00:55.720> of<00:00:55.809> a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
blend control which gives you kind of a

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.770 
blend control which gives you kind of a
parallel<00:00:56.230> compression<00:00:56.710> effect<00:00:57.160> it<00:00:57.780> blends

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
parallel compression effect it blends

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.030 
parallel compression effect it blends
between<00:00:59.500> the<00:01:00.489> guitars<00:01:01.440> unaltered<00:01:02.440> tone<00:01:02.710> and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
between the guitars unaltered tone and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.850 
between the guitars unaltered tone and
the<00:01:03.399> compressed<00:01:03.970> tone<00:01:04.470> sustain<00:01:05.470> which<00:01:05.740> is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
the compressed tone sustain which is

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.130 
the compressed tone sustain which is
basically<00:01:06.160> the<00:01:06.310> amount<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.610> squash<00:01:07.030> it's<00:01:08.020> the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
basically the amount of squash it's the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.690 
basically the amount of squash it's the
amount<00:01:08.259> of<00:01:08.410> compression<00:01:08.740> on<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.040> signal<00:01:09.520> and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
amount of compression on the signal and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.060 
amount of compression on the signal and
then<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:10.210> have<00:01:10.330> this<00:01:10.450> grit<00:01:10.780> control<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.770> built

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
then you have this grit control so built

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.760 
then you have this grit control so built
into<00:01:12.369> this<00:01:12.490> pedal<00:01:12.910> you<00:01:13.149> have<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.780> smooth<00:01:14.229> diode

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
into this pedal you have a smooth diode

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.350 
into this pedal you have a smooth diode
distortion<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:16.540> it's<00:01:16.960> kind<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.350> like<00:01:17.560> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
distortion so it's kind of like a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.170 
distortion so it's kind of like a
distortion<00:01:19.360> pedal<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.990> compressor<00:01:20.560> in<00:01:20.649> one

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
distortion pedal and compressor in one

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.540 
distortion pedal and compressor in one
now<00:01:22.180> as<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.450> distortion<00:01:22.930> pedal<00:01:23.110> itself<00:01:23.770> this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
now as a distortion pedal itself this

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.340 
now as a distortion pedal itself this
stands<00:01:24.880> pretty<00:01:25.119> well<00:01:25.360> on<00:01:25.509> its<00:01:25.660> own<00:01:25.840> but<00:01:26.259> it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
stands pretty well on its own but it

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.779 
stands pretty well on its own but it
also<00:01:26.530> could<00:01:26.890> be<00:01:26.920> married<00:01:27.399> with<00:01:27.580> other

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
also could be married with other

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.120 
also could be married with other
overdrive<00:01:28.360> or<00:01:28.509> distortion<00:01:28.960> pedals<00:01:29.289> and<00:01:29.530> you

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
overdrive or distortion pedals and you

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.529 
overdrive or distortion pedals and you
can<00:01:30.280> really<00:01:30.490> get<00:01:30.580> some<00:01:30.640> great<00:01:30.910> tones<00:01:31.270> out<00:01:31.479> of

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
can really get some great tones out of

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.150 
can really get some great tones out of
it<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:31.960> as<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.380> can<00:01:32.560> see<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.369> runs<00:01:34.000> on<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:35.039> 12<00:01:36.039> to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
it and as you can see it runs on a 12 to

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.520 
it and as you can see it runs on a 12 to
18<00:01:36.399> volt<00:01:36.610> power<00:01:36.759> supply<00:01:37.209> so<00:01:37.539> let's<00:01:38.200> see<00:01:38.380> what

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
18 volt power supply so let's see what

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.290 
18 volt power supply so let's see what
kind<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.860> tones<00:01:39.580> we<00:01:39.759> can<00:01:39.880> get<00:01:40.000> out<00:01:40.119> of<00:01:40.240> this

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
kind of tones we can get out of this

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.990 
kind of tones we can get out of this
thing<00:01:40.770> okay<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:41.800> we're<00:01:42.280> going<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.429> see<00:01:42.640> we<00:01:42.819> can

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
thing okay so we're going to see we can

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.580 
thing okay so we're going to see we can
do<00:01:43.119> with<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.360> Philosopher's<00:01:43.990> tone<00:01:44.229> here

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
do with the Philosopher's tone here

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.410 
do with the Philosopher's tone here
let's<00:01:44.830> listen<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:46.319> reference<00:01:47.319> sound<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:48.729> the

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
let's listen to a reference sound on the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.540 
let's listen to a reference sound on the
amp<00:01:49.599> and<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.810> guitar<00:01:50.050> here<00:01:50.349> we<00:01:50.500> got<00:01:50.649> a<00:01:50.679> Fender

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.089 

it's<00:04:18.759> subtle<00:04:19.030> but<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.359> there<00:04:19.709> if<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:20.829> come<00:04:21.069> up

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
it's subtle but it's there if I come up

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.129 
it's subtle but it's there if I come up
with<00:04:21.400> that

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.439 

becomes<00:04:26.069> more<00:04:26.280> pronounced<00:04:26.699> now<00:04:26.969> if<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.210> take

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
becomes more pronounced now if I take

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.739 
becomes more pronounced now if I take
the<00:04:27.659> blend<00:04:27.930> control<00:04:29.419> where<00:04:30.419> I<00:04:30.449> can<00:04:30.629> get<00:04:30.689> even

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:30.749 
the blend control where I can get even

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:58.629 
the blend control where I can get even
more<00:04:30.930> overdrive<00:04:31.530> out<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.830> pedal

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.149 

so<00:04:59.569> you<00:04:59.689> see<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.110> amount<00:05:00.289> of<00:05:00.409> sustain<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:01.039> can

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
so you see the amount of sustain you can

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:02.499 
so you see the amount of sustain you can
get<00:05:01.310> out<00:05:01.430> of<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:01.639> pedal<00:05:01.849> it's<00:05:02.090> pretty<00:05:02.330> much

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
get out of this pedal it's pretty much

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:11.630 
get out of this pedal it's pretty much
endless

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:28.030 

it's<00:05:12.640> almost<00:05:12.760> like<00:05:12.970> a<00:05:13.000> violin<00:05:13.600> like<00:05:13.810> tone

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.230 

and<00:05:29.040> if<00:05:29.190> you're<00:05:29.310> using<00:05:29.430> any<00:05:29.700> kind<00:05:29.760> of<00:05:30.090> guitar

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
and if you're using any kind of guitar

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.290 
and if you're using any kind of guitar
synth<00:05:30.810> or<00:05:31.050> anything<00:05:32.040> like<00:05:32.640> a<00:05:32.700> harmonizer

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
synth or anything like a harmonizer

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.990 
synth or anything like a harmonizer
where<00:05:34.170> no<00:05:34.470> tracking<00:05:35.040> is<00:05:35.160> very<00:05:35.340> important<00:05:35.880> this

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
where no tracking is very important this

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.220 
where no tracking is very important this
pedal<00:05:36.300> works<00:05:36.480> great<00:05:36.720> because<00:05:36.810> it<00:05:37.050> really

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
pedal works great because it really

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.280 
pedal works great because it really
focuses<00:05:37.500> the<00:05:38.220> pitch<00:05:38.640> of<00:05:38.790> the<00:05:38.880> note<00:05:38.960> making<00:05:39.960> it

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
focuses the pitch of the note making it

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.260 
focuses the pitch of the note making it
a<00:05:40.380> lot<00:05:40.560> easier<00:05:41.010> for<00:05:41.040> Harmonizers<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.150> the

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
a lot easier for Harmonizers and the

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.500 
a lot easier for Harmonizers and the
cisors<00:05:42.600> to<00:05:42.810> track<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.830> notes<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.390> tell<00:05:45.390> it

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
cisors to track the notes and tell it

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.130 
cisors to track the notes and tell it
what<00:05:45.630> to<00:05:45.780> do

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
what to do

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.200 
what to do
so<00:05:46.500> that's<00:05:46.710> something<00:05:47.400> this<00:05:47.490> pedal<00:05:47.760> also<00:05:48.030> does

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
so that's something this pedal also does

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.000 
so that's something this pedal also does
really<00:05:48.390> well<00:05:48.600> in<00:05:48.870> addition<00:05:49.290> to<00:05:49.470> being<00:05:49.560> a<00:05:49.800> great

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
really well in addition to being a great

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.650 
really well in addition to being a great
compression<00:05:50.400> pedal<00:05:50.670> and<00:05:51.000> a<00:05:51.180> great<00:05:51.390> sounding

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
compression pedal and a great sounding

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.870 
compression pedal and a great sounding
distortion<00:05:52.110> pedal<00:05:52.350> so<00:05:53.100> there<00:05:53.460> you<00:05:53.580> have<00:05:53.760> it

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
distortion pedal so there you have it

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.460 
distortion pedal so there you have it
that's<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.120> philosopher's<00:05:54.810> tone<00:05:55.020> from<00:05:55.260> pig

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
that's the philosopher's tone from pig

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.860 
that's the philosopher's tone from pig
