00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
definitely big the windows first and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.149 
definitely big the windows first and
second<00:01:25.049> downs<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.470> mean<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.830> push<00:01:26.040> them

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
second downs I mean when you push them

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.710 
second downs I mean when you push them
back<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> put<00:01:26.880> them<00:01:26.939> back<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.360> third<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
back and you put them back in third and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
back and you put them back in third and
long<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.080> things<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:29.159> kind<00:01:29.220> of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
long and things like that it kind of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.890 
long and things like that it kind of
makes<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.790> harder<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> offensive<00:01:30.600> coach

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
makes it harder for the offensive coach

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.200 
makes it harder for the offensive coach
to<00:01:31.049> call<00:01:31.229> plays<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.829> they<00:01:31.950> only<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.790> they

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
to call plays so they only you know they

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.550 
to call plays so they only you know they
can<00:01:33.329> only<00:01:33.390> pick<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> couple<00:01:33.810> players<00:01:34.079> passing

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
can only pick a couple players passing

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
can only pick a couple players passing
plays<00:01:34.740> majority<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.970> when<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> let<00:01:36.360> them<00:01:36.390> get

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
plays majority but when you let them get

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.060 
plays majority but when you let them get
third<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> short<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.470> always<00:01:37.740> switch

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
third and short they can always switch

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.520 
third and short they can always switch
it<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.610> short<00:01:39.150> runs<00:01:39.390> or<00:01:39.720> screens<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it up and do short runs or screens and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.969 
it up and do short runs or screens and
things<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:42.049> seems<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.229> those<00:01:43.740> young
