bucks<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.599> like<00:02:16.840> four<00:02:17.470> GT<00:02:17.920> city<00:02:18.220> down

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
bucks so it's like four GT city down

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.790 
bucks so it's like four GT city down
there<00:02:18.490> how<00:02:19.180> many<00:02:19.240> different<00:02:19.630> like<00:02:20.319> design

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
there how many different like design

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.520 
there how many different like design
iterations<00:02:21.490> for<00:02:21.730> GT<00:02:22.090> are<00:02:22.330> there<00:02:22.480> could<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> GT

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
iterations for GT are there could the GT

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.350 
iterations for GT are there could the GT
have<00:02:23.770> looked<00:02:24.040> radically<00:02:24.700> different<00:02:25.120> than<00:02:25.270> it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
have looked radically different than it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.250 
have looked radically different than it
actually<00:02:25.540> does<00:02:27.209> early<00:02:28.209> on<00:02:28.390> there<00:02:28.660> were<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:28.959> I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
actually does early on there were like I

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.550 
actually does early on there were like I
think<00:02:29.590> three<00:02:30.040> main<00:02:30.340> themes<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.180> then<00:02:31.959> when

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
think three main themes and then when

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.010 
think three main themes and then when
the<00:02:32.739> whole<00:02:32.770> fuselage<00:02:33.610> theme<00:02:34.450> came<00:02:34.810> out

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
the whole fuselage theme came out

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.500 
the whole fuselage theme came out
everyone<00:02:35.500> looked<00:02:35.680> at<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:35.950> like<00:02:36.220> oh<00:02:36.489> my<00:02:37.270> god

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
everyone looked at that like oh my god

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.610 
everyone looked at that like oh my god
get<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.050> in<00:02:38.260> CFD<00:02:38.680> right<00:02:39.160> now<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.690> and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
get that in CFD right now and so and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.790 
get that in CFD right now and so and
then<00:02:42.010> CFD<00:02:42.790> developed<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.450> lot<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.440> taper

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
then CFD developed a lot of that taper

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.640 
then CFD developed a lot of that taper
and<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.550> pontoon<00:02:46.090> fenders<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
and the pontoon fenders and and the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.470 
and the pontoon fenders and and the
buttresses

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
buttresses

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.810 
buttresses
the<00:02:49.870> movable<00:02:50.350> rear<00:02:50.560> wing<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.100> everything<00:02:51.520> so

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
the movable rear wing and everything so

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.740 
the movable rear wing and everything so
it<00:02:52.030> was<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:53.140> car<00:02:53.380> was<00:02:53.680> probably<00:02:54.750> developed

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
it was that car was probably developed

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.390 
it was that car was probably developed
as<00:02:55.960> much<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.470> CFD<00:02:59.280> computational<00:03:00.280> fluid

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
as much in CFD computational fluid

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.540 
as much in CFD computational fluid
dynamics<00:03:01.150> as<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:01.810> was<00:03:02.020> in<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:03.010> studio<00:03:03.340> on

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
dynamics as it was in a in a studio on

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.090 
dynamics as it was in a in a studio on
clay<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.780> GT<00:03:05.230> was<00:03:05.470> all<00:03:05.740> about<00:03:06.310> efficiency<00:03:06.670> and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
clay the GT was all about efficiency and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.370 
clay the GT was all about efficiency and
aerodynamic<00:03:09.100> efficiency<00:03:09.570> fuel<00:03:10.570> efficiency

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
aerodynamic efficiency fuel efficiency

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.640 
aerodynamic efficiency fuel efficiency
everything<00:03:12.130> was<00:03:12.430> how<00:03:13.030> sharp<00:03:13.780> can<00:03:14.110> we<00:03:14.260> make<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
everything was how sharp can we make the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.980 
everything was how sharp can we make the
efficiency<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.640> engine<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:16.900> a

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
efficiency of the engine so it's a

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.320 
efficiency of the engine so it's a
little<00:03:17.200> bit<00:03:17.350> different<00:03:17.590> philosophy<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:19.120> it's

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
little bit different philosophy and it's

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.090 
little bit different philosophy and it's
it's<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:19.990> a<00:03:20.020> it's<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.590> radically<00:03:21.070> different

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
it's it is a it's a radically different

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.610 
it's it is a it's a radically different
car
