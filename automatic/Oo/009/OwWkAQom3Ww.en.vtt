and not go through the whole flight on
the<00:02:21.890> process<00:02:22.340> because<00:02:22.520> I<00:02:22.730> can't<00:02:22.940> get<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.210> as

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
the process because I can't get it as

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.990 
the process because I can't get it as
smooth<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:24.050> as<00:02:24.170> straight<00:02:24.560> as<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.250> salon<00:02:25.610> hand

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
smooth and as straight as the salon hand

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.850 
smooth and as straight as the salon hand
so<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.780> no<00:02:26.900> need<00:02:27.110> for<00:02:27.230> me<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.350> attempt<00:02:27.710> that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
so it's no need for me to attempt that

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.930 
so it's no need for me to attempt that
and<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.070> think<00:02:28.100> that's<00:02:28.460> where<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.610> lot<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.760> people

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
and I think that's where a lot of people

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.940 
and I think that's where a lot of people
may<00:02:29.150> be<00:02:29.210> getting<00:02:29.390> trouble<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:30.500> they<00:02:30.680> keep

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
may be getting trouble is they keep

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.700 
may be getting trouble is they keep
trying<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.850> attempt<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.510> then<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.560> gets

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
trying to attempt it and then it gets

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.340 
trying to attempt it and then it gets
out<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:33.980> hand<00:02:34.070> so<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.910> know<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:36.140> will<00:02:36.320> work

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
out of hand so I know it that will work

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.560 
out of hand so I know it that will work
I<00:02:36.710> mean<00:02:36.920> cuz<00:02:37.130> alone<00:02:37.460> if<00:02:37.760> when<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.120> was<00:02:38.300> trying<00:02:38.540> to

I mean cuz alone if when I was trying to

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.790 
I mean cuz alone if when I was trying to
do<00:02:38.660> my<00:02:38.810> back<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.410> mean<00:02:40.040> imagine<00:02:40.310> trying<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:41.800> get

all any fear and everything by yourself

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.950 
all any fear and everything by yourself

like to live now i'm gonna figure out

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.920 
like to live now i'm gonna figure out
ways<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.240> do<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.810> maybe<00:02:57.050> in<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:58.030> less<00:02:59.030> heat<00:02:59.360> way<00:02:59.630> i

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
ways to do it maybe in a less heat way i

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.350 
ways to do it maybe in a less heat way i
would<00:03:00.260> love<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:00.770> find<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.490> golden<00:03:01.790> way<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.090> do

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
would love to find a golden way to do

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.860 
would love to find a golden way to do
that<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:02.840> hopefully<00:03:03.230> i<00:03:03.440> find<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.100> but<00:03:04.520> i

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870

so um i just kind of want to see how

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.949 
so um i just kind of want to see how
long<00:03:52.100> it'll<00:03:52.489> go<00:03:52.760> now<00:03:53.239> is<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.660> getting<00:03:53.870> more

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
long it'll go now is it getting more

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.620 
long it'll go now is it getting more
difficult<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.560> maintain<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.580> deal<00:03:56.390> with

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
difficult to maintain and to deal with

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.570 
difficult to maintain and to deal with
yes<00:03:56.930> it<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:57.620> mean<00:03:57.890> because<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.100> haven't<00:03:58.310> dealt

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
yes it is I mean because I haven't dealt

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.729 
yes it is I mean because I haven't dealt
with<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.790> limp<00:03:59.090> like<00:03:59.330> this<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.870> probably<00:04:00.410> since

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
with a limp like this and probably since

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.590 
with a limp like this and probably since
I<00:04:00.830> was<00:04:00.860> in<00:04:01.040> high<00:04:01.100> school<00:04:01.280> in<00:04:01.640> 30<00:04:01.880> years<00:04:02.060> old<00:04:02.360> now

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
I was in high school in 30 years old now

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
I was in high school in 30 years old now

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
so um yeah it is a process to do with

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:17.719 
to imagine I've had it um but usually if

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:19.600 
to imagine I've had it um but usually if
I<00:07:17.810> leave<00:07:17.960> my<00:07:18.080> hair<00:07:18.319> alone<00:07:18.349> in<00:07:18.710> a<00:07:18.770> year's<00:07:19.039> time<00:07:19.129> I

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 
I leave my hair alone in a year's time I

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.640 
I leave my hair alone in a year's time I
have<00:07:19.909> length<00:07:20.599> so<00:07:21.469> I<00:07:23.020> mean<00:07:24.020> that<00:07:24.229> wasn't<00:07:24.409> my

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
have length so I mean that wasn't my

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.529 
have length so I mean that wasn't my
main<00:07:24.800> goal<00:07:25.099> really<00:07:25.400> it<00:07:25.699> was<00:07:25.879> just<00:07:25.909> living

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:26.539 
main goal really it was just living

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:28.209 
main goal really it was just living
without<00:07:26.659> a<00:07:26.840> relaxer<00:07:27.500> and<00:07:27.529> just<00:07:27.830> learn<00:07:27.979> how<00:07:28.009> to

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:28.219 
without a relaxer and just learn how to

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:30.399 
without a relaxer and just learn how to
have<00:07:28.430> really<00:07:28.879> healthy<00:07:29.240> hair<00:07:29.419> with<00:07:29.990> the<00:07:30.199> main

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:30.409 
have really healthy hair with the main

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:33.040 
have really healthy hair with the main
goal<00:07:31.069> of<00:07:31.099> mine<00:07:31.520> so<00:07:32.060> I<00:07:32.330> think<00:07:32.659> that<00:07:32.900> really

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.050 
goal of mine so I think that really

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.679 
goal of mine so I think that really
helped<00:07:33.529> to<00:07:33.650> that<00:07:33.830> mindset<00:07:34.419> because<00:07:35.419> I<00:07:35.629> think

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:35.689 
helped to that mindset because I think

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:37.570 
helped to that mindset because I think
you<00:07:35.960> get<00:07:36.110> so<00:07:36.560> caught<00:07:36.800> up<00:07:36.860> in<00:07:37.069> less<00:07:37.279> and<00:07:37.490> so

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:37.580 
you get so caught up in less and so

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.790 
you get so caught up in less and so
focused<00:07:37.969> on<00:07:38.089> us<00:07:38.270> it<00:07:38.479> really<00:07:38.689> it<00:07:38.839> really<00:07:39.139> kind

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 
focused on us it really it really kind

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.379 
focused on us it really it really kind
of<00:07:39.889> maybe<00:07:40.129> sometimes<00:07:40.729> it<00:07:40.879> kind<00:07:40.969> of<00:07:41.089> takes<00:07:41.240> away

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:41.389 
of maybe sometimes it kind of takes away

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.350 
of maybe sometimes it kind of takes away
from<00:07:41.569> the<00:07:42.080> beauty<00:07:42.979> of<00:07:43.189> the<00:07:43.310> actual<00:07:43.729> journey

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360
