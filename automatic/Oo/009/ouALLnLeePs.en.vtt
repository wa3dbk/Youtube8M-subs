00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.219 
they are going to be two to one in
scores<00:06:38.430> so<00:06:39.430> there<00:06:39.550> we<00:06:39.639> go<00:06:39.669> 320<00:06:40.570> and<00:06:40.840> it's<00:06:40.960> Dom

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
scores so there we go 320 and it's Dom

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:42.629 
scores so there we go 320 and it's Dom
look<00:06:41.560> at<00:06:41.620> the<00:06:41.710> damage<00:06:41.919> outputs<00:06:42.400> that<00:06:42.460> we

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
look at the damage outputs that we

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.700 
look at the damage outputs that we
actually<00:06:42.849> have<00:06:43.150> on<00:06:43.300> screen<00:06:43.599> layer<00:06:44.260> actually

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
actually have on screen layer actually

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.250 
actually have on screen layer actually
only<00:06:44.830> put<00:06:45.010> out<00:06:45.479> 55k<00:06:46.479> damage<00:06:46.870> because<00:06:47.139> the

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
only put out 55k damage because the

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.500 
only put out 55k damage because the
pressure<00:06:47.470> well<00:06:48.340> I<00:06:48.370> don't<00:06:48.699> just<00:06:49.150> walk<00:06:49.300> just

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
pressure well I don't just walk just

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.420 
pressure well I don't just walk just
because<00:06:49.810> of<00:06:49.960> pure<00:06:50.229> control<00:06:50.650> i'd<00:06:50.830> imagine<00:06:51.190> he

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
because of pure control i'd imagine he

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.920 
because of pure control i'd imagine he
was<00:06:51.520> all<00:06:51.760> over<00:06:51.789> and<00:06:52.330> over<00:06:52.419> and<00:06:52.570> over<00:06:52.630> and<00:06:52.840> he

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
was all over and over and over and he

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.170 
was all over and over and over and he
got<00:06:53.020> separated<00:06:53.620> from<00:06:53.650> his<00:06:54.099> friend<00:06:54.639> released<00:06:55.030> a

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
got separated from his friend released a

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.330
