a Mercedes C 200 m reg the vehicles are

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.190 
a Mercedes C 200 m reg the vehicles are
fairly<00:00:08.940> straightforward<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.809> one<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
fairly straightforward this one is the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.129 
fairly straightforward this one is the
petrol<00:00:10.650> model<00:00:11.509> it's<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> tow

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
it's not a bad vehicle list really also

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.979 
it's not a bad vehicle list really also
check<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> tires<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:58.530> um<00:00:58.980> very<00:00:59.989> important

usually that it's both three millimeters
the<00:01:03.480> track<00:01:04.189> let's<00:01:05.189> check<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.460> along<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:07.580> out

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the track let's check all along here out

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.950 
the track let's check all along here out
here<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> also<00:01:11.010> these<00:01:11.159> tend<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.330> little

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
here and also these tend to go a little

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.310 
here and also these tend to go a little
bit<00:01:13.229> around<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.890> lock<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.689> area<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.140> quite

happens little rough spots where the
ground<00:02:15.930> metal<00:02:16.410> occurs<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.980> check<00:02:20.250> this

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
ground metal occurs just check this

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.840 
ground metal occurs just check this
wheel<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:22.200> know<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.580> very

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
wheel and know that this is a very

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.780 
wheel and know that this is a very
pitted<00:02:24.560> brake<00:02:25.560> disc<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.160> could<00:02:26.340> probably<00:02:26.520> do

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
pitted brake disc it could probably do

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.570 
pitted brake disc it could probably do
with<00:02:27.350> grinding<00:02:28.350> down<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.560> bit<00:02:28.830> maybe<00:02:29.100> making<00:02:29.490> a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
with grinding down a bit maybe making a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.440 
with grinding down a bit maybe making a
new<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.980> that's<00:02:32.220> right<00:02:32.459> about<00:02:34.190> silver

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.970 

will<00:02:39.450> also<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> bit<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.140> an<00:02:40.350> interior<00:02:40.739> shot
