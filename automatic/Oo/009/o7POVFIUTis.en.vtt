contact<00:01:28.259> time<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.799> therefore<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.610> gonna

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
contact time and therefore it's gonna

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.160 
contact time and therefore it's gonna
give<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.479> bit<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:30.720> accuracy

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
give you a little bit more accuracy

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.469 
give you a little bit more accuracy
making<00:01:31.619> those<00:01:31.740> passes<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.670> drive<00:01:32.939> zone<00:01:33.270> has

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
making those passes the drive zone has

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.960 
making those passes the drive zone has
evolved<00:01:33.990> since<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> first<00:01:34.619> predator<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.159> 1994

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
evolved since the first predator in 1994

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.760 
evolved since the first predator in 1994
it's<00:01:36.420> all<00:01:36.600> about<00:01:36.810> getting<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.259> material

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it's all about getting the material

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.530 
it's all about getting the material
right<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.280> well<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:38.670> its<00:01:38.880> thickness<00:01:39.150> we've

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
right as well as its thickness we've

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.800 
right as well as its thickness we've
updated<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.140> SL<00:01:40.619> rubber<00:01:40.890> which<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.600> best

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
updated to SL rubber which is the best

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.270 
updated to SL rubber which is the best
way<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.930> explain<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.290> SL<00:01:43.680> rubber<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.100> it's

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
way to explain that SL rubber is it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.410 
way to explain that SL rubber is it's
like<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> type<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> rubber<00:01:45.060> you've<00:01:45.270> seen<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
like the type of rubber you've seen a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.080 
like the type of rubber you've seen a
car<00:01:45.720> tire<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.560> used<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> use<00:01:46.950> TPU<00:01:47.310> this

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
car tire so we used to use TPU this

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.789 
car tire so we used to use TPU this
gives<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> more<00:01:48.570> traction<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.619> more

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
gives you more traction a little more

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.100 
gives you more traction a little more
bounce<00:01:50.130> once<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> ball<00:01:50.759> strikes<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.299> so

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
bounce once the ball strikes it so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.200 
bounce once the ball strikes it so
that's<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> drive<00:01:53.340> zone<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
that's really that the drive zone the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.850 
that's really that the drive zone the

toe and odd concept if you're not a
soccer<00:01:57.960> player<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> pros<00:01:59.219> love<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.790> when

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I'm going to take a touch of the court

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.539 
I'm going to take a touch of the court
in<00:02:04.020> 18<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.469> try<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> spin<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.219> ball<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
in 18 and try to spin that ball to the

lots<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.200> times<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.410> see<00:02:13.530> those

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
lots of times you see those

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.770 
lots of times you see those
you<00:02:14.130> know<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.490> over<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.000> goal<00:02:15.210> into<00:02:15.630> the

you know going over the goal into the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.600 
you know going over the goal into the
crowd<00:02:16.320> but<00:02:16.650> again<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> ones<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.460> are<00:02:17.580> that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
crowd but again the ones that are that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.220 
crowd but again the ones that are that
are<00:02:17.820> being<00:02:17.910> curled<00:02:18.300> up<00:02:18.450> or<00:02:18.600> V<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:19.050> where

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
are being curled up or V that's where

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.930 
are being curled up or V that's where
they're<00:02:19.350> hitting<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:20.070> recessed<00:02:20.460> pockets

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
they're hitting it the recessed pockets

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.180 
they're hitting it the recessed pockets
in<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.180> first<00:02:21.420> touch<00:02:21.660> zone<00:02:21.960> creates<00:02:22.620> ultimate

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
in the first touch zone creates ultimate

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.220 
in the first touch zone creates ultimate
ball<00:02:23.430> control<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:24.300> see<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:24.570> first<00:02:24.810> touch<00:02:25.080> if

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
ball control you see with first touch if

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.690 
ball control you see with first touch if
you<00:02:25.290> really<00:02:25.560> zoom<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:26.010> there's<00:02:26.520> these

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
you really zoom in there's these

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.360 
you really zoom in there's these
recessed<00:02:27.390> pockets<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.470> there's<00:02:28.860> about<00:02:29.010> three

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
recessed pockets so there's about three

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.540 
recessed pockets so there's about three
recessed<00:02:29.760> pockets<00:02:30.150> per<00:02:30.360> rib<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.930> that

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
recessed pockets per rib and that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.950 
recessed pockets per rib and that
creates<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.610> suction<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.510> lots<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.720> times<00:02:33.870> you

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
creates a suction so lots of times you

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.030 
creates a suction so lots of times you
see<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.200> ball<00:02:34.410> come<00:02:34.590> over<00:02:34.740> someone's

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
see that ball come over someone's

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.260 
see that ball come over someone's
shoulder<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.460> they<00:02:35.520> take<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.790> beautiful

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
shoulder and they take that beautiful

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.910 
shoulder and they take that beautiful
first<00:02:36.480> touch<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:37.470> we're<00:02:37.590> doing<00:02:37.740> here<00:02:37.860> is

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
first touch what we're doing here is

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.990 
first touch what we're doing here is
we're<00:02:38.010> trying<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.250> create<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.490> section<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:38.970> that

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
we're trying to create a section so that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.580 
we're trying to create a section so that
ball<00:02:39.270> really<00:02:39.450> sticks<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.200> foot<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
ball really sticks to the foot on the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.860 
ball really sticks to the foot on the
first<00:02:40.860> touch<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.430> past<00:02:41.910> predator<00:02:42.360> models<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
called the dribble zone what we did here

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.260 
called the dribble zone what we did here
was<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:50.010> looked<00:02:50.430> at<00:02:50.550> players<00:02:50.850> when<00:02:51.090> they<00:02:51.209> were

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
dribbling at their top speeds when you

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.350 
dribbling at their top speeds when you

dribble your top speed in order to keep

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.910 
dribble your top speed in order to keep
your<00:02:54.510> stride<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.350> need<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.560> dribble<00:02:55.739> with<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
your stride you need to dribble with the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.830 
your stride you need to dribble with the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
lots of shoes move synthetic we don't

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.370

want the ball slipping off the foot when
you<00:03:01.440> dribble<00:03:01.620> those<00:03:01.800> top<00:03:01.980> speeds<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.820> again<00:03:03.600> we

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you dribble those top speeds so again we

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.930 
you dribble those top speeds so again we
space<00:03:04.020> them<00:03:04.050> out<00:03:04.260> correctly<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.610> added<00:03:05.880> that

it<00:04:27.690> provides<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.110> best<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.470> both<00:04:28.590> worlds<00:04:29.070> so

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
it provides the best of both worlds so

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.640 
it provides the best of both worlds so
you<00:04:29.550> have<00:04:29.670> that<00:04:29.760> suppleness<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.510> leather<00:04:30.720> but

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
you have that suppleness of leather but

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.100 
you have that suppleness of leather but
it<00:04:32.100> has<00:04:32.730> four<00:04:33.030> times<00:04:33.180> less<00:04:33.360> water<00:04:33.600> uptake<00:04:33.810> and

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
it has four times less water uptake and

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.050 
it has four times less water uptake and
it's<00:04:34.230> 40%<00:04:34.830> lighter<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.670> we're<00:04:35.790> really<00:04:35.910> taking

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
it's 40% lighter so we're really taking

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.730 
it's 40% lighter so we're really taking
the<00:04:36.270> best<00:04:36.480> of<00:04:36.630> both<00:04:36.750> worlds<00:04:37.050> from<00:04:37.170> leather<00:04:37.410> and

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
the best of both worlds from leather and

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.170 
the best of both worlds from leather and
synthetic<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.430> we're<00:04:38.520> marrying<00:04:38.910> them

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
synthetic and we're marrying them

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.000 
synthetic and we're marrying them
that's<00:04:39.450> why<00:04:39.630> we've<00:04:39.780> named<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.620> material

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
that's why we've named the material

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.280 
that's why we've named the material
hybrid<00:04:41.400> touch<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:42.420> again<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.870> we're<00:04:42.960> really

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
hybrid touch so again and we're really

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.410 
hybrid touch so again and we're really
probably<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:43.710> material<00:04:44.250> even<00:04:44.970> if<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.150> player

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
probably that material even if a player

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.730 
probably that material even if a player
might<00:04:45.630> say<00:04:45.780> I'd<00:04:45.990> rather<00:04:46.140> have<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.350> leather<00:04:46.500> shoe

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
might say I'd rather have a leather shoe

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.230 
might say I'd rather have a leather shoe
I<00:04:46.950> think<00:04:47.010> when<00:04:47.310> they<00:04:47.400> actually<00:04:47.550> touch<00:04:47.970> and

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
I think when they actually touch and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.200 
I think when they actually touch and
feel<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.480> product<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.170> play<00:04:49.650> in<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:50.210> usually

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
feel the product and play in it usually

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.970 
feel the product and play in it usually
