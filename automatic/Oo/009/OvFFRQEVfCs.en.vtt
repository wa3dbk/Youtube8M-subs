00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.830
 leaf - today I'm here with grimi you do pecking per suite 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.860
 tooth boundaries 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.930
 because they follow in that he is not mine 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.840
 a friend of mine who is good for me 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.910
 I do not know where he got it. 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.170
 it's not the team 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.190
 he lent me near 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.190
 one can make the video game was the cost even more 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.990
 this is where the fish version but I decided to remind myself to release available 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.320
 how far I know besides the pc 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 they are three days over 60 also 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.759
 I just got this version to do the day after I intend to buy the game 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.380
 American 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 I intend to buy the original play prosthetics 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 Sounds like a speedy ward uniform 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.560
 I could not change practically anything in this group of tattoo music 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.510
 so I do not understand course 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.510
 then it gets hard 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.390
 I have no idea 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.310
 what does the menus mean? 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.490
 but because of the little he taught me 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.080
 Click here to give me a run. 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.080
 and that's what I'm going to show 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.460
 the study 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.140
 did not need 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 we have several cases is only open 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 I'll choose the color 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.299
 the game graphics that comes equipped with input of the piece 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.559
 and it's not max here 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.559
 so much so that I do not know how I got it 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.059
 now I stand on my lap 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.059
 the contract is not yet in its bed to study offers 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.759
 the fetus does not help much 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.629
 so come on 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.799
 I'll learn from your buttons now was the worst 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.799
 small play only one keyboard 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.209
 what the eike accelerates 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.019
 in normal banking 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.809
 in this logic against the car 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.809
 and high-level steel this is the basics necessary 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.279
 I did also explain to novartis 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.559
 the border 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:05.559
 people are realizing natural blink 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.239
 edition 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.459
 does not pay attention 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.249
 of cabinda having 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.279
 change the targeted camera and even very interesting milk 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.999
 - that appears the pilot to go to the air 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:36.149
 I do not know why I played it. 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.929
 gave to the Jewish state 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:42.309
 I'm going to show you this one more time to see you guys take a look 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.339
 but I intend to buy the game in 2 to 1 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:47.779
 the consumption 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.419
 I did not like it 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.509
 I do not think I can understand anything from - nothing of what is written 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.319
 he was at the intersection 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.489
 at least I get it 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.489
 let's go 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.829
 the graphics are beautiful 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.829
 and bpi try at maximum 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.279
 there is nothing if the icon will open 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:16.609
 You can only change the resolution 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.840
 River - mossorÃ³ 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.990
 had another option to which I do not know well what is attested in music 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.389
 so I do not know 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.680
 although details 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.659
 the asphalt service car does not 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.070
 I think only within the game and as unanalyzed - method 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.400
 the musician already said 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.080
 Give me the gully there, the lighthouse. 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.080
 the bird part 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.529
 our team would be the colÃ­der said today that it was very good 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.960
 it's very interesting to remember the old days nardoni was inspired by 

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:51.770
 suez 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.770
 I played much lower than the one who was subjected to it 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.259
 that this is the very assis gold 2 silver computer that plays very good 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.270
 This game is 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.270
 more or less at this level there is only one that greatly improves the hotel 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.900
 with better standard of living and better graphics out there 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.990
 nobody deserves everyone is also taller 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:37.699
 will have a rear view mirror over the pce my car coming 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.699
 Carmo was alarming your 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.370
 cameron coming on foot 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.279
 the car 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.279
 in the corridor the paths of what 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.550
 the rear view mirror 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.439
 they are normal car everybody 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.439
 in stores here 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.650
 but it's alright 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.700
 I still want to buy a camera with the camera if I do not suffer from the aek 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.099
 but for years the assistant was 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.050
 get used to it 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.689
 when the right there 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.689
 valim has had the map 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.960
 including him the orange background honey beetles of his rivals 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.469
 on the right side 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:32.119
 He also mentioned if he has a speedometer 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.240
 which marks highest in the magic basket 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.520
 speed of the winds and 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.779
 is correct 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:44.179
 in this dam I think it's in the unita uea red is the motorcycle of the car I believe 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.819
 but if you have a classic target 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:50.770
 I got to win my 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.369
 and I could not explain what I had 

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:55.349
 finally up and there u 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:56.360
 the rear view mirror 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.399
 for you look back god car that 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:02.259
 behind the other things do not pay attention I think it's 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:03.379
 time 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.379
 There's something of the kind. 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.550
 katy will appear opens a car x 8 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.699

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.699
 That's all I wanted to show you guys. 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.680
 after I got it, they are 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.169

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.550

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:30.629
