theories or areas will be discussed the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.340 
theories or areas will be discussed the
first<00:00:46.140> being<00:00:46.640> how<00:00:47.870> cell<00:00:48.870> phones<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.230> mobile

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
first being how cell phones and mobile

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.590 
first being how cell phones and mobile
devices<00:00:49.770> change<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> concept<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.180> social

relationships and interactions secondly

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.090 
relationships and interactions secondly
is<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.910> kind<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> explore<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.469> idea<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> cell

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
is to kind of explore the idea of cell

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.910 
is to kind of explore the idea of cell
phone<00:00:59.309> dependency<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.449> thirdly<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.800> look

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
phone dependency and thirdly is to look

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
phone dependency and thirdly is to look
at<00:01:02.160> text<00:01:03.000> messaging<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.899> social

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
interaction part of the reason why I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.280 
interaction part of the reason why I
decided<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.869> select<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.310> topic<00:01:11.880> is

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
decided to select this this topic is

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
decided to select this this topic is
it's<00:01:13.290> pretty<00:01:13.680> relevant<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:15.090> interact

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it's pretty relevant as we just interact

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.440 
it's pretty relevant as we just interact
with<00:01:15.689> society<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> daily<00:01:16.619> basis<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.580> go

it's<00:01:32.470> kind<00:01:33.280> of<00:01:33.340> prompting<00:01:33.730> you<00:01:33.850> explore<00:01:34.300> us<00:01:34.420> a

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
it's kind of prompting you explore us a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.069 
it's kind of prompting you explore us a
little<00:01:34.690> bit<00:01:34.840> more

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.249 

basically<00:01:39.079> getting<00:01:39.289> to<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:41.390> first<00:01:41.630> artist

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.590 

the<00:01:45.259> first<00:01:45.500> way<00:01:45.710> that<00:01:45.969> cellular<00:01:46.969> phones<00:01:47.240> and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
the first way that cellular phones and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.809 
the first way that cellular phones and
mobile<00:01:47.780> devices<00:01:48.200> are<00:01:48.710> in<00:01:48.920> testing<00:01:49.340> social

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
mobile devices are in testing social

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.350 
mobile devices are in testing social
interaction<00:01:50.539> is<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:52.369> changing<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.880> concept

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
interaction is it's changing the concept

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.770 
interaction is it's changing the concept
of<00:01:53.659> social<00:01:54.350> space<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:55.039> time<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:55.640> love<00:01:56.329> social

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
of social space and time I love social

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.330 
of social space and time I love social
relationships<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.890> interaction<00:02:00.340> within

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
relationships and interaction within

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.910 
relationships and interaction within
this<00:02:01.579> there's<00:02:01.850> kind<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.149> two<00:02:02.209> dynamics<00:02:03.109> going

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
this there's kind of two dynamics going

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.199 
this there's kind of two dynamics going
on<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:05.719> first<00:02:05.990> one<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.709> guess<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.850> start<00:02:07.909> off

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
on the first one is I guess to start off

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.080 
on the first one is I guess to start off
social<00:02:08.539> interaction<00:02:09.670> signifies<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.700> we<00:02:10.940> are

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
social interaction signifies that we are

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.940 
social interaction signifies that we are
aware<00:02:11.329> of<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.569> existence<00:02:12.049> of<00:02:12.200> others<00:02:12.470> as<00:02:12.890> well

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
aware of the existence of others as well

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.059 
aware of the existence of others as well
as<00:02:13.280> implies<00:02:13.720> active<00:02:14.720> engagement<00:02:15.290> between<00:02:15.410> two

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
as implies active engagement between two

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.089 
as implies active engagement between two
or<00:02:16.220> more<00:02:16.250> parties<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:18.110> cell<00:02:18.349> phones<00:02:18.620> have<00:02:19.069> a

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
or more parties so cell phones have a

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.130 
or more parties so cell phones have a
lot<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> individuals<00:02:19.579> to<00:02:20.120> surpass<00:02:20.480> time<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
lot of individuals to surpass time and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.100 
lot of individuals to surpass time and
space<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:22.720> essentially<00:02:23.720> have<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.870> lot<00:02:24.079> of

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
space and essentially have a lot of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.900 
space and essentially have a lot of
people<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.860> have<00:02:24.980> any<00:02:25.129> conversation<00:02:25.879> that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
people to have any conversation that

with them on a daily basis and this is

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.630 
with them on a daily basis and this is
basically<00:07:03.760> the<00:07:04.210> result<00:07:04.570> of<00:07:05.520> forming<00:07:06.520> an
