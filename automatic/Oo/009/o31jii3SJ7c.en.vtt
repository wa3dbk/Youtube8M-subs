00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
plates off each side in order to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.970 
plates off each side in order to
straighten<00:02:33.110> up<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.590> as<00:02:34.310> well<00:02:34.910> as<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.710> fitness<00:02:36.710> is

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
drinks on it yes a lot better angle you

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.279 
drinks on it yes a lot better angle you
I<00:04:18.120> think<00:04:18.570> if<00:04:18.750> you've<00:04:18.930> having<00:04:19.289> problems<00:04:19.949> going

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
I think if you've having problems going

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.290 
I think if you've having problems going
parallel<00:04:22.289> I<00:04:22.620> think<00:04:22.949> it's<00:04:23.280> mobile<00:04:23.699> a<00:04:23.880> walk<00:04:24.090> and

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
parallel I think it's mobile a walk and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.629 
parallel I think it's mobile a walk and
also<00:04:25.199> I<00:04:25.229> think<00:04:25.470> on<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.770> door<00:04:25.949> stands<00:04:26.310> hails

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
also I think on a door stands hails

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.700 
also I think on a door stands hails
Diggle<00:04:27.479> parallel<00:04:27.900> because<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.320> stayed<00:04:28.500> more

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
Diggle parallel because you stayed more

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.980 
Diggle parallel because you stayed more
upright<00:04:29.000> however<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:31.520> can't<00:04:32.520> win<00:04:32.850> over<00:04:33.180> when

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
upright however I can't win over when

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.909 
upright however I can't win over when
i'm<00:04:34.139> doing<00:04:34.260> like<00:04:34.639> icsi<00:04:35.639> I<00:04:35.940> as<00:04:36.690> if<00:04:36.990> i<00:04:37.169> was<00:04:37.380> little

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
i'm doing like icsi I as if i was little

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.100 
i'm doing like icsi I as if i was little
box<00:04:38.130> court<00:04:38.780> but<00:04:39.780> that's<00:04:40.500> one<00:04:40.740> works<00:04:40.979> for<00:04:41.220> me<00:04:41.370> so

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
box court but that's one works for me so

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.600 
box court but that's one works for me so
also<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.320> think<00:04:43.560> Lane<00:04:43.830> not<00:04:44.039> news<00:04:44.310> that's

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
also I think Lane not news that's

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.760 
also I think Lane not news that's
similar<00:04:45.000> form<00:04:45.330> however<00:04:45.840> he<00:04:46.199> goes<00:04:46.380> he's<00:04:46.560> got

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
similar form however he goes he's got

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.189 
similar form however he goes he's got
much<00:04:46.979> better<00:04:47.220> my<00:04:47.490> spelling<00:04:47.910> goes<00:04:48.120> deeper<00:04:48.479> but

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
much better my spelling goes deeper but

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.800 
much better my spelling goes deeper but
yeah<00:04:49.410> I<00:04:49.440> think<00:04:49.800> he's<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.340> high<00:04:50.669> bar<00:04:50.940> was<00:04:51.389> over<00:04:51.780> a

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
yeah I think he's a high bar was over a

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.400 
yeah I think he's a high bar was over a
lot<00:04:52.080> more<00:04:52.550> sure<00:04:53.550> I'd<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:55.080> think<00:04:55.260> it's

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
lot more sure I'd I just think it's

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.100 
lot more sure I'd I just think it's
easier<00:04:55.710> but<00:04:55.949> staying<00:04:56.400> upright<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.940> China<00:04:57.270> and

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
easier but staying upright of China and

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.640 
easier but staying upright of China and
I<00:04:58.139> just<00:04:58.470> feel<00:04:58.620> weak<00:04:59.150> so<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.900> I've<00:05:01.110> got<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.380> lot

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
I just feel weak so and I've got a lot

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.339 
I just feel weak so and I've got a lot
tight<00:05:01.889> or<00:05:02.070> doing<00:05:02.430> this<00:05:02.610> one<00:05:03.020> that's<00:05:04.020> why<00:05:04.199> I<00:05:04.229> use

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
tight or doing this one that's why I use

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.060 
tight or doing this one that's why I use
it<00:05:05.030> but<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.660> for<00:05:06.930> me<00:05:07.110> know<00:05:07.260> what<00:05:07.470> for<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.860> and

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.689 
it but that for me know what for you and
my<00:05:08.550> for<00:05:08.789> me<00:05:08.940> not<00:05:09.090> work<00:05:09.270> for<00:05:09.479> you<00:05:09.650> quick<00:05:10.699> your

if<00:05:16.590> that's<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.370> last<00:05:17.520> flip<00:05:17.849> I<00:05:18.000> think<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.440> I'm

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
if that's the last flip I think that I'm

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.520 
if that's the last flip I think that I'm
not<00:05:19.650> really<00:05:19.770> kidding<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.340> rapes<00:05:20.550> here<00:05:20.789> so

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
gonna pop so squat and I think as a hard

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.009 
gonna pop so squat and I think as a hard
exercise<00:05:56.159> bar<00:05:57.159> none<00:05:57.189> if<00:05:57.789> you're<00:05:58.509> gonna<00:05:58.749> have<00:05:58.989> a

00:05:59.009 --> 00:05:59.019 
exercise bar none if you're gonna have a

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:02.579 
exercise bar none if you're gonna have a
high<00:05:59.439> rate<00:05:59.759> then<00:06:00.759> that<00:06:01.659> really<00:06:01.869> taxes<00:06:02.469> you

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:02.589 
high rate then that really taxes you

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:04.499 
high rate then that really taxes you
that's<00:06:02.860> why<00:06:03.009> I<00:06:03.039> only<00:06:03.129> scored<00:06:03.699> once<00:06:03.909> a<00:06:04.059> week<00:06:04.239> I

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
that's why I only scored once a week I

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.169 
that's why I only scored once a week I
don't<00:06:05.229> I<00:06:05.499> couldn't<00:06:05.799> do<00:06:05.949> that<00:06:05.979> twice<00:06:06.369> a<00:06:06.429> week<00:06:06.699> it

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:07.179 
don't I couldn't do that twice a week it

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:11.249 
don't I couldn't do that twice a week it
just<00:06:07.449> takes<00:06:07.629> too<00:06:07.869> much<00:06:08.019> out<00:06:08.199> of<00:06:08.259> me<00:06:08.409> so<00:06:10.259> that's

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259
