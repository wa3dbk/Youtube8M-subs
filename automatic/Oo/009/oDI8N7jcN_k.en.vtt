try some bio-forge and this and that so
what<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.000> did<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> bio-forge<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.500> use

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
what we did with the bio-forge we use

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.920 
what we did with the bio-forge we use
that<00:01:19.860> as<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> seed<00:01:20.400> treatment<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.750> had

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that as a seed treatment which we had

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
that as a seed treatment which we had
massive<00:01:22.380> roots<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.189> best<00:01:23.400> part<00:01:23.670> about

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
massive roots and the best part about

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.950 
massive roots and the best part about
the<00:01:23.909> whole<00:01:24.030> deal<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.540> very<00:01:24.570> inexpensive

most<00:01:25.740> impressive<00:01:26.369> thing<00:01:26.549> I've<00:01:26.759> seen<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:27.060> year

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
most impressive thing I've seen all year

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
most impressive thing I've seen all year
long<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.350> started<00:01:28.710> modulating<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
long was as we started modulating at the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.660 
long was as we started modulating at the
unified<00:01:30.720> state<00:01:30.840> which<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.770> amazing<00:01:32.549> because

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
unified state which is amazing because

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
unified state which is amazing because
most<00:01:33.000> soy<00:01:33.180> beans<00:01:33.390> won't<00:01:33.570> ever<00:01:33.720> start<00:01:34.020> module<00:01:34.380> 8

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
most soy beans won't ever start module 8

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
most soy beans won't ever start module 8
until<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:34.950> they're<00:01:35.130> up<00:01:35.220> here<00:01:35.430> probably

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
until you know they're up here probably

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.390 
until you know they're up here probably
third<00:01:36.329> chart<00:01:36.600> folio<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.920> came<00:01:38.130> in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
third chart folio and then we came in

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.120 
third chart folio and then we came in
there<00:01:38.640> at<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.960> two<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> half<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
there at about be two and a half and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.590 
there at about be two and a half and
what<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.460> did<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.729> burnt<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> top<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
what we did we burnt the top of the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.060 
what we did we burnt the top of the
plants<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.439> trying<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.860> kill

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
plants what we was trying to do is kill

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.440 
plants what we was trying to do is kill
the<00:01:44.159> main<00:01:44.310> growing<00:01:44.610> point<00:01:44.850> basically<00:01:45.210> we

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the main growing point basically we

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.730 
the main growing point basically we
desiccated<00:01:46.020> these<00:01:46.140> plants<00:01:46.560> something

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
desiccated these plants something

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.760 
desiccated these plants something
nervous<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.939> was<00:01:48.000> brown<00:01:48.360> went<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> field

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
nervous it was brown went in the field

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
nervous it was brown went in the field
that<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.159> looked<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.460> could<00:01:50.670> kill<00:01:50.850> him<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.149> came

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that it looked I could kill him we came

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.550 
that it looked I could kill him we came
back<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.869> hit<00:01:51.990> him<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> bio-forge

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
back and we hit him with the bio-forge

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
back and we hit him with the bio-forge
to<00:01:52.979> help<00:01:53.189> recover<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.240> recovered<00:01:54.750> past

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
to help recover and they recovered past

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.990 
to help recover and they recovered past
I<00:01:55.290> mean<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.560> went<00:01:55.740> back<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> growing<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.909> we

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
I mean we went back to growing and so we

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
I mean we went back to growing and so we
continued<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.659> build<00:01:57.869> those<00:01:58.079> roots<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.829> then

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
continued to build those roots so then

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
continued to build those roots so then
we<00:01:59.219> came<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> frame<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.659> use<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
we came in with the frame we use the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
we came in with the frame we use the
framed<00:02:01.290> also<00:02:01.710> helped<00:02:01.920> control<00:02:02.280> light<00:02:02.579> mold

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
framed also helped control light mold

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.880 
framed also helped control light mold
and<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.409> build<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.799> plant<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.430> then

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
and in the build that plant and then

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.950 
and in the build that plant and then
remover<00:02:06.370> will<00:02:06.729> use<00:02:06.909> sugar<00:02:07.300> move<00:02:07.479> around<00:02:07.720> these

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
remover will use sugar move around these

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.230 
remover will use sugar move around these
a<00:02:07.990> couple<00:02:08.229> times<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.890> our<00:02:08.920> soybeans<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.729> what

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
a couple times on our soybeans and what

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.970 
a couple times on our soybeans and what
the<00:02:10.360> sugar<00:02:10.539> mover<00:02:10.840> does<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.410> moves<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.709> sugar

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
the sugar mover does it moves the sugar

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.550 
the sugar mover does it moves the sugar
up<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.490> pods<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.940> help<00:02:13.150> set<00:02:13.450> more<00:02:13.750> pods

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
up to the pods and help set more pods

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.860 
up to the pods and help set more pods
you<00:02:14.920> know<00:02:15.040> retain<00:02:15.640> those<00:02:15.850> pods<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.569> we<00:02:16.690> was

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
you know retain those pods so we was

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.300 
you know retain those pods so we was
actually<00:02:17.020> able<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.500> accomplish<00:02:17.800> both<00:02:18.130> four

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
actually able to accomplish both four

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.710 
actually able to accomplish both four
goals<00:02:18.490> we've<00:02:18.700> shortened<00:02:19.060> our<00:02:19.180> beans<00:02:19.360> up<00:02:19.569> or

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
goals we've shortened our beans up or

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.270 
goals we've shortened our beans up or
beans<00:02:19.900> are<00:02:20.020> only<00:02:20.110> about<00:02:20.319> this<00:02:20.530> tall<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:21.010> year

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
beans are only about this tall this year

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.890 
beans are only about this tall this year
and<00:02:21.580> we<00:02:21.880> don't<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:22.240> any<00:02:22.360> white<00:02:22.540> mold

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
and we don't have any white mold

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.020 
and we don't have any white mold
we've<00:02:23.080> got<00:02:23.260> just<00:02:23.709> as<00:02:23.800> much<00:02:23.980> not<00:02:24.280> pods<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
we've got just as much not pods in the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.640 
we've got just as much not pods in the
bottom<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.540> half<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.959> plant<00:02:26.200> as<00:02:26.380> we<00:02:26.500> do

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
bottom of the half of the plant as we do

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.860 
bottom of the half of the plant as we do
the<00:02:26.800> top<00:02:26.980> half<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.430> plant<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.090> our<00:02:28.240> branches

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
the top half the plant so our branches

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.170 
the top half the plant so our branches
you<00:02:29.140> know<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.440> size<00:02:29.830> your<00:02:30.100> index<00:02:30.430> finger<00:02:30.790> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
you know the size your index finger and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.600 
you know the size your index finger and
we<00:02:31.390> have<00:02:31.540> branches<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.320> branches<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.250> each<00:02:33.430> one

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
we have branches on branches so each one

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.979 
we have branches on branches so each one
of<00:02:33.700> these<00:02:33.790> branches<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.480> basically<00:02:34.810> about

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
of these branches is basically about

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.900 
of these branches is basically about
like<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> normal<00:02:35.650> soybean<00:02:36.040> plant<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:36.790> had

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
like a normal soybean plant and we had

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.550 
like a normal soybean plant and we had
stocks<00:02:37.239> out<00:02:37.510> there<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.870> know<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.140> size<00:02:38.410> of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
stocks out there you know the size of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.290 
stocks out there you know the size of
the<00:02:38.620> corn<00:02:38.890> stock<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.670> only<00:02:39.820> way<00:02:40.030> you're<00:02:40.180> in

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
the corn stock the only way you're in

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.940 
the corn stock the only way you're in
vail<00:02:40.450> accomplish<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:41.320> with<00:02:41.560> large

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
vail accomplish that is with large

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.920 
vail accomplish that is with large
massive<00:02:42.640> roots<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.180> know<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.360> goes<00:02:43.510> back<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
massive roots you know it goes back to

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.550 
massive roots you know it goes back to
that<00:02:44.080> same<00:02:44.320> deal<00:02:44.769> you're<00:02:45.519> pulling<00:02:46.470> 95%<00:02:47.470> of

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
that same deal you're pulling 95% of

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.110 
that same deal you're pulling 95% of
your<00:02:47.680> nutrients<00:02:48.190> out<00:02:48.310> top<00:02:48.580> four-inch<00:02:48.940> low

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
your nutrients out top four-inch low

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.540 
your nutrients out top four-inch low
profile<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.320> more<00:02:50.530> feeder<00:02:50.920> roots<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.370> can

profile so the more feeder roots you can

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.280 
profile so the more feeder roots you can

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
take up the nutrients and anytime you

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.509 
take up the nutrients and anytime you
can<00:02:55.269> build<00:02:55.450> roots<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.620> know<00:02:56.650> that's<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.280> big

this year was by adding the bio-forge in
there<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.070> I<00:03:15.160> guarantee<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.880> we<00:03:16.360> picked<00:03:16.630> up
