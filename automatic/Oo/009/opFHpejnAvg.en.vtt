in less than an hour yeah less than an
hour<00:01:48.450> now<00:01:49.049> obviously<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> company<00:01:50.159> that's

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
hour now obviously for a company that's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.980 
hour now obviously for a company that's
currently<00:01:50.759> abetting<00:01:51.180> batteries<00:01:51.750> all

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
currently abetting batteries all

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.810 
currently abetting batteries all
together<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.950> does<00:01:53.250> make<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> lot<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
together then this does make a lot of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.310 
together then this does make a lot of
senses<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.720> can't<00:01:54.930> replace<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
senses you really can't replace the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.679 
senses you really can't replace the
battery<00:01:55.649> anyways<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.850> only<00:01:57.090> catch<00:01:57.360> here

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
battery anyways but the only catch here

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.330 
battery anyways but the only catch here
is<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.899> savio<00:01:58.320> technology<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.009> ready

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
is that savio technology will be ready

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.819 
is that savio technology will be ready
until<00:01:59.490> 2014<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.719> not<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.350> early

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
until 2014 and not for the early

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
until 2014 and not for the early
high-end<00:02:02.250> lineup<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.909> smartphones<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.509> gets

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
probably what we will be getting at

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.559 
probably what we will be getting at

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
technology is coming I just do not think

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.410 
technology is coming I just do not think
it'll<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.090> backwards<00:02:12.720> compatible

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420

phones<00:02:42.910> at<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.300> moment<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:43.959> let's<00:02:44.260> hope<00:02:44.830> that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
phones at the moment so let's hope that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.949 
phones at the moment so let's hope that
this<00:02:45.099> does<00:02:45.340> not<00:02:45.610> become<00:02:45.850> another<00:02:46.180> soap<00:02:46.480> opera

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
this does not become another soap opera

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.840 
this does not become another soap opera
but<00:02:47.200> obviously<00:02:47.680> Tim<00:02:47.890> Cook<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.280> not<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.670> same

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
but obviously Tim Cook is not the same

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.000 
but obviously Tim Cook is not the same
guy<00:02:49.090> Steve<00:02:49.420> Jobs<00:02:49.690> was<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:50.230> let's<00:02:50.739> see<00:02:50.860> how<00:02:50.890> that

guy Steve Jobs was so let's see how that

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.250 
guy Steve Jobs was so let's see how that
goes<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.819> finally<00:02:52.480> for<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.720> hot<00:02:52.840> news<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.170> the
