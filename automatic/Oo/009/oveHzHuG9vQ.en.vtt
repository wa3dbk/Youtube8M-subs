back<00:03:13.140> well<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.670> we<00:03:15.209> try<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.420> take<00:03:15.660> every

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.190 
possible approach I think the most
important<00:03:18.120> thing<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.450> get<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.870> get<00:03:19.110> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
important thing is to get it get the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.360 
important thing is to get it get the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
word out there that this stuff is really

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.699 
word out there that this stuff is really
happening<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.030> its<00:03:21.420> students<00:03:22.080> actually<00:03:22.260> do

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
happening and its students actually do

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.050
