00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.040
 Well, as I promised here, I'm with 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:08.030
 the unboxing of the iphone 5 so if you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.030
 namely be interested 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.790
 Y 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.630
 Well, the model that I have chosen 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.880
 for buying has been the iphone 5 of 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:29.660
 black color so there you see the iphone 5 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.119
 here I am taking out the box where is the 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.120
 typical about that comes with information and 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.640
 the sticker and also includes the wire 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.489
 with which we can take out the slot in 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.830
 which will be integrated the new nano yes 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.010
 that we know is specific to the iphone 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.680
 5 below we can see the new 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.949
 lightning cable that apart from being more 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.030
 small for the part of usb you have changed 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.370
 from 30 pins to 8 years the entrance to 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.559
 current by which we will connect 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.690
 our lighting cable to be able to charge 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.700
 our iphone 5 devices 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.240
 and last but not least 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.530
 the new ipods that although they have a 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.380
 pretty atypical way or can I promise 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.850
 that they listen quite well and give a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.850
 pretty good quality 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.620
 now finally let's talk about the iphone 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 on top of the other buttons or 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.390
 less volume silence or blocking and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 unlocking you have to talk about the finish 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.810
 of the phone the edges of the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.580
 design screen at the end of the cape 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.890
 which it is what Apple wins another 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.960
 terminals 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.720
 we also have to highlight the new 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.360
 port for the line connector and the new one 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.909
 situation for the jack output of the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.040
 headphones and the three microphones that 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.680
 includes the phone which are placed 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.170
 under the front camera in the part 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.720
 below the phone and in the part 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.240
 back next to the camera the camera 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.640
 back of the iphone 5 is 8 megapixels 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.040
 able to record 1080p video while 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.920
 that the front is 12 megapixels 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.819
 able to record 720p videos I leave you with 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.819
 some samples 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.790
 now I leave with a sample of two games 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.730
 for the one-to- one iphone optimized to the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.150
 4 inch screen of iphone 5 and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.150

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.910

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.879

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.879
 the old street and watching videos 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.390

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.760
 defect in them has also changed 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.209

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.209
 iphone sim 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.230
 this is where 44 is really written down 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.090
 percent more saturation in the 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.090
 screen respect to its predecessor 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.710

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.010

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.120

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.479
 and then some sample of the 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.750
 next voice of them 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.750
