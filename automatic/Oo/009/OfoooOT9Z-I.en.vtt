he<00:03:52.310> can<00:03:52.460> level<00:03:52.790> off<00:03:53.530> but<00:03:54.530> yeah<00:03:54.710> we<00:03:54.980> should

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
he can level off but yeah we should

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.940 
he can level off but yeah we should
really<00:03:55.370> get<00:03:55.640> meatlug<00:03:56.380> but<00:03:57.380> we'll<00:03:57.530> do<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.800> in

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
really get meatlug but we'll do that in

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.560 
really get meatlug but we'll do that in
the<00:03:58.040> next<00:03:58.280> video<00:03:58.460> first<00:03:59.030> we're<00:03:59.270> going<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.510> be

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
the next video first we're going to be

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.260 
the next video first we're going to be
looking<00:03:59.990> at<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.200> deadly<00:04:00.710> Nadder<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:01.400> know<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.880> I

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
looking at the deadly Nadder I know I I

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.780 
looking at the deadly Nadder I know I I
skipped<00:04:02.960> along<00:04:03.290> there<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.560> got<00:04:03.890> sidetracked<00:04:04.220> it

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
skipped along there I got sidetracked it

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.980 
skipped along there I got sidetracked it
but<00:04:05.000> here<00:04:05.270> it<00:04:05.390> is<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:09.910> purplish<00:04:10.990> dark

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
but here it is this is a purplish dark

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.230 
but here it is this is a purplish dark
purplish<00:04:12.740> kind<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.790> color

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
purplish kind of color

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.479 
purplish kind of color
I<00:04:14.270> think<00:04:14.810> it's<00:04:14.960> purplish<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.500> my<00:04:15.830> opinion<00:04:16.280> is

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
I think it's purplish in my opinion is

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.650 
I think it's purplish in my opinion is
purplish<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.180> mean<00:04:17.360> you<00:04:17.570> can<00:04:17.750> say<00:04:17.989> it's<00:04:18.580> black

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
purplish I mean you can say it's black

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.810 
purplish I mean you can say it's black
well<00:04:20.660> it's<00:04:21.170> probably<00:04:21.440> like<00:04:21.830> a<00:04:21.860> shade<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.490> dark

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
well it's probably like a shade of dark

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.940 
well it's probably like a shade of dark
purple<00:04:23.180> or<00:04:23.540> something<00:04:23.570> like<00:04:24.140> that<00:04:24.380> but<00:04:25.070> yeah

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
purple or something like that but yeah

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.690 
purple or something like that but yeah
we're<00:04:27.950> going<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.130> level<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.550> off<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:31.310> feed<00:04:31.550> him

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
we're going to level it off so feed him

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.770 
we're going to level it off so feed him
some<00:04:31.970> food<00:04:32.240> or<00:04:33.010> her<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.280> there<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.330> alright

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
some food or her and there it is alright

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.530 
some food or her and there it is alright
so<00:04:36.020> it's<00:04:36.170> much<00:04:36.380> bigger<00:04:36.740> now<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.370> we're<00:04:38.360> just

just<00:04:59.000> moving<00:04:59.330> on<00:04:59.540> here<00:04:59.930> I<00:04:59.960> know<00:05:00.140> I've<00:05:00.410> I

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
just moving on here I know I've I

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.580 
just moving on here I know I've I
haven't<00:05:01.400> been<00:05:01.640> like<00:05:01.910> playing<00:05:02.240> every<00:05:03.110> single

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
haven't been like playing every single

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.040 
haven't been like playing every single
minute<00:05:03.830> if<00:05:04.160> you<00:05:04.880> do<00:05:05.120> play<00:05:05.390> every<00:05:05.720> single

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
minute if you do play every single

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.110 
minute if you do play every single
minute<00:05:06.200> only<00:05:06.470> this<00:05:06.800> game<00:05:07.130> I'm<00:05:07.430> pretty<00:05:07.970> sure

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
minute only this game I'm pretty sure

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.540 
minute only this game I'm pretty sure
you'll<00:05:08.270> get<00:05:08.420> farther<00:05:08.840> than<00:05:09.050> me<00:05:12.400> all<00:05:13.400> right

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
you'll get farther than me all right

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.950 
you'll get farther than me all right
probably<00:05:14.180> you'll<00:05:14.720> get<00:05:14.990> up<00:05:15.110> -<00:05:15.730> yeah<00:05:16.730> it<00:05:17.180> isn't

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
probably you'll get up - yeah it isn't

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.130 
probably you'll get up - yeah it isn't
that<00:05:18.020> long<00:05:18.530> ice<00:05:19.220> I'm<00:05:20.210> thinking<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.900> game

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
that long ice I'm thinking the game

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.580 
that long ice I'm thinking the game
could<00:05:21.860> be<00:05:22.100> done<00:05:22.400> quicker<00:05:22.880> it's<00:05:23.330> just<00:05:23.630> that<00:05:23.900> you

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
could be done quicker it's just that you

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.250 
could be done quicker it's just that you
have<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.950> be<00:05:25.130> on<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.930> if<00:05:26.930> you're<00:05:27.140> not

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
have to be on it and if you're not

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.350 
have to be on it and if you're not
making<00:05:27.680> videos<00:05:27.800> it's<00:05:28.460> much<00:05:28.670> easier<00:05:29.150> because

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
making videos it's much easier because

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.570 
making videos it's much easier because
you<00:05:29.660> don't<00:05:29.690> have<00:05:29.930> to<00:05:30.080> document<00:05:30.320> every<00:05:30.920> step<00:05:31.430> of

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
you don't have to document every step of

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.200 
you don't have to document every step of
the<00:05:31.760> way

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
the way

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.510 
the way
and<00:05:32.300> that<00:05:32.840> stuff<00:05:33.470> but<00:05:33.920> we<00:05:34.070> should<00:05:34.310> definitely

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
and that stuff but we should definitely

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.390 
and that stuff but we should definitely
buy<00:05:35.120> meatlug<00:05:38.470> alright<00:05:39.470> we'll<00:05:39.650> do<00:05:39.800> that<00:05:39.980> in<00:05:40.250> a

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
buy meatlug alright we'll do that in a

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.760 
buy meatlug alright we'll do that in a
minute<00:05:40.700> in<00:05:40.850> another<00:05:41.120> video<00:05:41.510> because<00:05:41.930> this<00:05:42.530> one

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
minute in another video because this one

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.810 
minute in another video because this one
is<00:05:42.950> more<00:05:43.160> about<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.580> deadly<00:05:44.000> Nadder

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
is more about the deadly Nadder

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.480 
is more about the deadly Nadder
just<00:05:44.970> wanted<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:45.450> say<00:05:45.930> that<00:05:46.290> this<00:05:47.070> is<00:05:47.220> what<00:05:47.370> it

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
just wanted to say that this is what it

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.730 
just wanted to say that this is what it
looks<00:05:47.670> like<00:05:47.880> and<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.270> stormfly's<00:05:48.960> friend<00:05:49.470> and

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
looks like and a stormfly's friend and

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.150 
looks like and a stormfly's friend and
then<00:05:50.040> you<00:05:50.730> can<00:05:50.910> go<00:05:51.060> search<00:05:51.390> for<00:05:51.420> things<00:05:52.290> which

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
then you can go search for things which

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.640
