00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The weight is 
unbearable

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Theses waves are coming straight from my soul

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The ice that's staring back at me

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Is not the one that I should have seen

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Everything tells me I should break
Never to wake

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But I just can't believe this would be the way it ends now (the way it ends now)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Oh really can't you see, in your hands is the urgency (the urgency)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It feels like drowning
Gasping for your last breath (you're last breath)

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.500
Stop surrendering
And fuel yourself with inner wrath

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.000
While there's still time

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But I just can't believe this would be the way it ends now (the way it ends now)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.500
Oh really can't you see, in your hands is the urgency (the urgency)

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.000
You can't ignore it!
You have face it!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Can you feel it?
The urgency!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.500
You can't ignore it!
You're gon na have face it!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.000
Can you feel it?
The urgency!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The urgency!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I just can't believe this would be the way it ends now (the way it ends now)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Oh really can't you see, in your hands is the urgency (the urgency)

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Cause I said no, no one is stopping me.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Cause I said no, no one is stopping me.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I just can't understand why
I could lose it from my sight

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.500
We keep making things so complicated, oh no

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.000
You're still always on my mind
Perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This ain't the girl I used to know no not anymore

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
TKO, I'm out for the count, yeah girl you knock me out
