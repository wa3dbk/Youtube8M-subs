00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hey people 64 inches and full hd that should 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.010
 but we can see a lot 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.250
 Just give us the display 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.440
 on 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.830
 yes I believed full hd resolution must 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 I do not say much 1920 x 1080 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.740
 pixel 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.710
 we have a lcd display with mobile 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.490
 bravia engine 2 should be very nice 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.410
 looks 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.600
 I 've made it look dark 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.369
 Just say exactly what can I do 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 tell him the colors are all very 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.230
 of course very nice as they are 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 should of course what LCD displays 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.800
 always the case is that we 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.690
 below and above this little one 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.300
 frame here if not have the photo 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.160
 completely fits in the display or not 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.690
 perfect display resolution has it say 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.879
 rather so here you can see that straight 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.350
 not yet now he is up there and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.270
 Below we have about one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.620
 centimeter frame if you have the whole in 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.050
 portrait format is quite natural 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.270
 still a number proper so a number 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.890
 bigger you have to disturb it 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.690
 but not to the colors I can 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.920
 once again they say absolutely look 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.969
 beautiful from absolutely lifelike wonderful 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.710
 Of course we can talk a lot 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.470
 look at the whole time in blue 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.570
 that is blue tone 11 everywhere evenly 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.510
 Illuminated has a nice color there 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.680
 There is not much to complain about 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.400
 no, we do not want to be behind us 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.460
 want to go to the gate 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.659
 that's a very strong yellow one though 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.610
 very nice that reminds me 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.280
 somehow a little bee and flowers me 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.229
 it also does not look very good 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 Of course, I have the highest 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.689
 brightness hofer set that show 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.090
 I'll see you again 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.540
 even the green one is absolutely convincing 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.650
 very very nice 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.939
 no it is not all the same now 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.130
 next, of course, we'll go soon 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.170
 more in the right life of the red 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.540
 Almost reminds me of amoled panel 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.070
 two of the really very extreme and very 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.710
 it is very good so it is summer so 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.540
 Here we come exactly to the grill stuff 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.540
 grill stuff 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.909
 yes there it is already there it is 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.880
 delicious the jute meat it looks 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.590
 that's awesome 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.290
 actually amazes me 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.970
 I am not incredibly hot 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.890
 I have never seen the form 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.000
 we are actually the viewpoint 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.900
 Let's just take a look inside 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.209
 turn the display 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.800
 You can tell right away it's getting darker 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.510
 in between, I just had one 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.370
 small 3d effect as i would that 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.690
 But meat can move that can do with it 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.380
 I'm not satisfied enough today 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.080
 So drunk can absolutely be drunk 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.049
 awesome brightness brightness super 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.819
 convincing details I think I see 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.630
 even down in the grill grate a little 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.180
 fly sit that's really great 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.890
 The rolls look delicious 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.650
 I would not be pure white 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.060
 because it tastes like coffee this glass 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.370
 otherwise great again 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.790
 details absolutely ingenious sharpness 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.890
 I just fell in love with the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.690
 present looks green and tasty 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.579
 and also people who do not eat salad 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:08.170
 will be up on it 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:09.910
 Potato salad ok ok nice yellow 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.590
 beautiful red for the orange is beautiful 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.180
 green absolutely ingenious 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.329
 color scheme and that looks up 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.910
 This display is incredibly beautiful 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.829
 I just fell in love yes we are in 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.540
 garden arrived from the top right one 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.880
 strong light source over the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.320
 picture looks but I have with others 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.459
 displays worse than there 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.380
 you do not really recognize much anymore 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.079
 here in this area it is here 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.930
 absolutely no problem 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.820
 the pond beautiful green, smart 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.380
 just as I flower you hereby 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.140
 because you always want to give 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.579
 turn on you are wonderful the nuk 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.989
 romance for today we still do 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.690
 continue with this flower here 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.829
 and yes the picture is not mine 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.750
 let's leave that once 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.760
 but we could do a bit of that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.549
 display brightness is what we are turning right now 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.079
 These three have looked nice here 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.780
 So naturally disappear run 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.049
 Applications home and back 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.470
 settings 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:07.360
 we go to the display and we do the 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.980
 brightness once go down yes but 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.650
 of course back in the pictures and this 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.150
 times in the fast run thereby so 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:21.609
 just beautiful, it still looks pretty 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:24.040
 garden yes yes the colors always 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:29.410
 still very nice so the display of the 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:32.650
 sony xperia is crisp hot full 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:36.340
 details and great colors also has something 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.870
 I should say so we go to the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.780
 colors and look again 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.000
 of course in portrait format, that is the blue 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.740
 It still looks really nice 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.510
 I did not really do much here 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.250
 I think it's really very much 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.199
 pleasant at night on this display too 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.720
 Just because it's big and big 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.389
 bright but not so is one at night 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.130
 the envious eyes away or so this is 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.370
 is just a bit gray 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.860
 I have to say that yellow or olive green 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.250
 Gray I do not know the green you 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.410
 wonderful from the red of the dark and 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.169
 very very angry from not so amoled anymore 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.260
 bang colored as well but still 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.150
 very chic, yes, we will go back to 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.389
 this scheme with all the colors look 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.810
 the perspective 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:25.680
 yes that was it so clearly again 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.020
 everything looks good 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.599
 it gets darker but the whole thing only 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.700
 So far from here it stays stable 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.310
 the sharpness of the details all remain 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.820
 yes that was my display test 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.830
 of the absolutely gigantic sony xperia az 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.830
