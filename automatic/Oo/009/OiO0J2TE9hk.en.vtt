with granola because a lot of times

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.570 
with granola because a lot of times
people<00:02:58.560> think<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.860> granola<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.310> really

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
people think that granola is really

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.600 
people think that granola is really
healthy<00:02:59.850> but<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.840> packs<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.350> big<00:03:01.740> calorie<00:03:02.310> punch

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
healthy but it packs a big calorie punch

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.190 
healthy but it packs a big calorie punch
so<00:03:02.820> definitely<00:03:03.150> pay<00:03:03.300> attention<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> serving

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
so definitely pay attention to a serving

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200 
so definitely pay attention to a serving
size<00:03:04.350> don't<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.800> like<00:03:04.950> put<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> lot<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.030> for

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
size don't just like put a lot but for

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.520 
size don't just like put a lot but for

so much to crunch and sweetness I

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.810 
so much to crunch and sweetness I
figured<00:03:07.920> why<00:03:08.040> not<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.280> don't<00:03:08.430> know<00:03:08.520> what<00:03:08.670> we're

definitely<00:03:16.830> isn't<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.400> prettiest<00:03:17.880> thing

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
definitely isn't the prettiest thing

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.690 
definitely isn't the prettiest thing
I've<00:03:18.330> ever<00:03:18.360> made<00:03:18.840> or<00:03:19.080> ever<00:03:19.350> ate<00:03:19.590> eaten<00:03:19.980> but

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
I've ever made or ever ate eaten but

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.270 
I've ever made or ever ate eaten but
it's<00:03:20.910> pretty<00:03:21.120> um<00:03:21.600> good<00:03:21.959> actually<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.500> I'm<00:03:23.100> just

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
it's pretty um good actually so I'm just

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.790 
it's pretty um good actually so I'm just
super<00:03:23.760> hungry<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.510> was<00:03:24.750> really<00:03:24.930> lazy<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.740> I

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
super hungry but I was really lazy and I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.110 
super hungry but I was really lazy and I
didn't<00:03:26.040> really<00:03:26.220> want<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.400> make<00:03:26.550> anything<00:03:26.790> I

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
didn't really want to make anything I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.600 
didn't really want to make anything I
was<00:03:27.300> this<00:03:27.900> close<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.620> ordering<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:29.010> pizza<00:03:29.160> but

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
was this close to ordering a pizza but

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.040 
was this close to ordering a pizza but
that<00:03:29.760> my<00:03:29.850> mom's<00:03:30.030> like<00:03:30.240> we<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.450> leftover<00:03:30.900> rice

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
that my mom's like we have leftover rice

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.500 
that my mom's like we have leftover rice
and<00:03:31.260> leftover<00:03:31.620> chicken<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.180> decided

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
and leftover chicken so I just decided

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.050 
and leftover chicken so I just decided
to<00:03:33.660> heat<00:03:34.380> up<00:03:34.410> some<00:03:34.800> rice<00:03:34.980> brown<00:03:35.490> rice<00:03:35.520> and

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
to heat up some rice brown rice and

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.120 
to heat up some rice brown rice and
grilled<00:03:36.330> chicken<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.290> bowl<00:03:37.500> with<00:03:37.950> some

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.610 
grilled chicken in a bowl with some
salsa<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.880> then<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.630> heated<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.110> up<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.500> then

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
salsa and then I heated that up and then

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.710 
salsa and then I heated that up and then
I<00:03:40.709> just<00:03:40.860> melted<00:03:41.250> some<00:03:41.520> low-fat<00:03:41.970> mozzarella<00:03:42.209> on

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
top and add some sauce on top so that's

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.600 
top and add some sauce on top so that's
dinner<00:03:45.300> good<00:03:45.720> carbs<00:03:46.200> good<00:03:46.620> protein<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.459> some

figure<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.260> was<00:03:52.440> better<00:03:52.620> than<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> pizza<00:03:53.100> so

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
figure this was better than a pizza so

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.040 
figure this was better than a pizza so
that<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.850> what's<00:03:54.030> for<00:03:54.180> dinner<00:03:54.300> -<00:03:54.570> for<00:03:54.750> dessert

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050
