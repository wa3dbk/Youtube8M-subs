one<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.630> hardest<00:02:22.990> things<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.380> we<00:02:23.470> had<00:02:23.710> to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
one of the hardest things that we had to

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.430 
one of the hardest things that we had to
be<00:02:24.190> able<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.430> reproduce<00:02:24.880> was<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.960> original

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
be able to reproduce was the original

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.350 
be able to reproduce was the original
Seminole<00:02:26.920> head<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.820> delicate

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
Seminole head and the the delicate

of<00:02:31.720> details<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.740> was<00:02:32.860> really<00:02:33.160> something<00:02:33.400> that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
of details it was really something that

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.310 
of details it was really something that
we<00:02:33.790> wanted<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.240> make<00:02:34.690> sure<00:02:34.960> that<00:02:35.140> it's

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
we wanted to make sure that it's

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.190 
we wanted to make sure that it's
reproducible<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:36.940> get<00:02:37.180> consistency<00:02:37.870> in

your building equity we are having to

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.630 
your building equity we are having to
turn<00:02:40.120> down<00:02:40.390> things<00:02:40.720> because<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.040> floors<00:02:42.489> a

turn down things because the floors a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.310 
turn down things because the floors a
logo<00:02:42.940> wouldn't<00:02:43.239> reproduce<00:02:43.660> correctly<00:02:44.110> and

logo wouldn't reproduce correctly and
our<00:02:44.590> coaches<00:02:44.980> had<00:02:45.130> stopped<00:02:45.340> putting<00:02:45.550> the

Seminole head on their uniforms because
it<00:02:47.320> didn't<00:02:47.500> reproduce<00:02:47.950> exactly

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
it didn't reproduce exactly

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.020 
it didn't reproduce exactly
we<00:02:49.650> needed<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.010> change<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.520> we<00:02:50.700> want<00:02:50.819> that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
we needed to change that we want that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.820 
we needed to change that we want that
Seminole<00:02:51.390> head<00:02:51.599> which<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.900> already<00:02:52.200> as<00:02:52.410> iconic

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
Seminole head which is already as iconic

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.740

as<00:02:53.010> India<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.370> country<00:02:53.730> who<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.180> am<00:02:54.450> plafond

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
as India in the country who I am plafond

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.869 
as India in the country who I am plafond
or<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.560> think<00:02:55.769> we'll<00:02:55.920> weeks<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.640> we

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
or and I think we'll weeks that that we

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.729 
or and I think we'll weeks that that we
wanted<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> Seminole<00:02:57.660> head<00:02:57.840> more<00:02:58.140> expose<00:02:58.530> I

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
wanted the Seminole head more expose I

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.750 
wanted the Seminole head more expose I
think<00:02:58.920> sort<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.250> there's<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.489> thought<00:02:59.730> out

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
think sort of there's a thought out

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.070 
think sort of there's a thought out
there<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.180> maybe<00:03:00.330> were<00:03:00.540> trying<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.840> get<00:03:00.930> rid

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
there that maybe were trying to get rid

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.660 
there that maybe were trying to get rid
of<00:03:01.110> all<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.560> nothing<00:03:02.099> could<00:03:02.220> be<00:03:02.310> further<00:03:02.489> from

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
of all it nothing could be further from

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.699 
of all it nothing could be further from
the<00:03:02.879> truth<00:03:02.910> we've<00:03:03.629> refined<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.170> Seminole<00:03:04.530> head

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
the truth we've refined a Seminole head

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.430 
the truth we've refined a Seminole head
by<00:03:05.519> flower<00:03:05.790> states<00:03:06.090> desire<00:03:06.480> we've<00:03:07.140> changed

by flower states desire we've changed

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.410 
by flower states desire we've changed
the<00:03:07.620> look<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.040> some<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.400> much<00:03:08.849> cleaner<00:03:09.239> in

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the look of it some it's much cleaner in

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.390 
the look of it some it's much cleaner in
terms<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.750> how<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.080> reproduce<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:11.099> mark

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
terms of how you can reproduce the mark

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.900 
terms of how you can reproduce the mark
had<00:03:11.700> been<00:03:12.000> kind<00:03:12.300> of<00:03:13.489> fragmented<00:03:14.489> over<00:03:14.700> time

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910

been in use for many many years but we

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.250 
been in use for many many years but we
were<00:03:19.739> able<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.090> kind<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.209> refine<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.080> make

were able to kind of refine it and make

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.380 
were able to kind of refine it and make
it<00:03:22.290> more<00:03:22.620> graphic<00:03:23.160> something<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.030> speaks<00:03:24.239> to

it more graphic something that speaks to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.050 
it more graphic something that speaks to

kind of the future in the future of

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
pretty much the same mark it's just done

yard lines where and so that was one of
our<00:04:27.620> top<00:04:27.680> goals<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.940> shading<00:04:29.360> had<00:04:29.540> changed

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
our top goals so the shading had changed

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.600 
our top goals so the shading had changed
and<00:04:30.140> we<00:04:30.230> just<00:04:30.440> wanted<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.890> put<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.100> stop<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.430> that

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
and we just wanted to put a stop to that
