them<00:01:30.659> looking<00:01:31.140> kind<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.770> data<00:01:32.009> ships<00:01:32.280> as

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
them looking kind of like data ships as

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
them looking kind of like data ships as
well<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.270> having<00:01:33.600> individual<00:01:34.140> designs<00:01:34.439> which

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
well as having individual designs which

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.069 
well as having individual designs which
leads<00:01:35.040> me<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.220> believe<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:35.880> are

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
leads me to believe that these are

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.480 
leads me to believe that these are
unlockable<00:01:37.079> through<00:01:37.290> either<00:01:37.409> final<00:01:37.799> stand<00:01:38.189> or

unlockable through either final stand or

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.640 
unlockable through either final stand or
the<00:01:38.520> phantom<00:01:39.119> program<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.350> let's<00:01:40.470> take<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the phantom program so let's take a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.190 
the phantom program so let's take a
closer<00:01:40.860> look<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.189> each<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.430> them<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.930> first

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
closer look at each of them the first

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.230 
closer look at each of them the first
one<00:01:43.409> has<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> tribal<00:01:43.890> eye<00:01:44.189> design<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.149> as

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
one has a tribal eye design on it and as

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.670 
one has a tribal eye design on it and as
well<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.720> appears<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.259> light<00:01:46.500> blue

well as what appears to be a light blue
feather<00:01:46.979> pattern<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.210> one<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.479> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
feather pattern this is one I think is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.940 
feather pattern this is one I think is
unlocked<00:01:49.079> through<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> phantom<00:01:49.649> program

unlocked through the phantom program

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.620 
unlocked through the phantom program
because<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.310> how<00:01:50.759> different<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.420> looks

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
because of how different it really looks

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.840
