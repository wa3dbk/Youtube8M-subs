00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.720
 imagine that we catch a few guys 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 of jce we put them together with others from 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.920
 criteria we put everything in a 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.660
 shaker and bumps a uterus nexgen then the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 son that comes out of there can not be more 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.140
 that a child with many desires of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.390
 speed 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.390
 welcome to my for speed rail balls 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.250
 as when you are hungry you eat for the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.870
 eyes the longing for the annexation 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.700
 they made this game one of the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.140
 few that entered me there by 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.910
 the eyes and is that the truth be said 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.620
 many titles that we have seen in 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.330
 versions of playstation 4 xbox one 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.160
 we had to see the lower version 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.870
 next to realize the change 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.760
 but neither for speed rail valls does not have 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.739
 nothing to see because it impresses from the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.300
 minute one maybe one faces and three or 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.860
 because I know because I had many 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.750
 want to take it out maybe because it's a 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.100
 fucking point and point 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.960
 or maybe I'm perusing because 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.760
 I really want to play the game 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.890
 next generation of consoles there 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.710
 apart from everything spectacular that is seen 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.659
 really highlight the light the water and the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.310
 the climate that is changing depending on 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.140
 how do you like mario piezo and is 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.940
 that suddenly it starts to rain and you 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.670
 culÃ© to the car and you print you are seen 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.640
 all the policemen above and they go enough 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.619
 jets and I insist this is captured in 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.210
 1080p but of course that does not make 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.010
 justice and that is after stack of valls 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.930
 you have to see it with your own eyes in 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.970
 the TV in your console you have to truth 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.330
 you have to see it because it is an authentic 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.330
 delight 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.399
 at the level of playability evidently that 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.990
 speed premium over the 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.759
 simulation because the proper name 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.380
 name indicate it and by espn and espn of 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.520
 there the spirit points redeemable for 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.170
 get new car improvements 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 devices to fuck the opposites 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.899
 let's go that while a cop with his car 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.310
 all your unit or we can 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.780
 put an electroshock that to take little 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.159
 it is managed constructura is not necessary 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.330
 take many hours to have a 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.920
 minimum dexterity which is of 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.320
 thank you because the cops of the already 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.119
 he has a bad one he has no idea 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.500
 the first time you leave the garage if you 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.950
 can go on the air the level of 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.900
 heat get ready you can choose between 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.860
 runner and policeman at the beginning but 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.450
 You can also change in any 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.640
 moment and progress with the one you most 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.040
 I would like to say today I feel good 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.019
 good looking to the inside and I feel 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.610
 good torrent better that you do not feel 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.830
 I challenge you have managed to introduce 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.239
 tension to or to a car game how is 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.340
 possible because you really want if you go 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.140
 two hours playing and you have not gone through the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.420
 garage or by any point or point to 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.280
 save your game so you can lose 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.230
 all the progress if you get to catch the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.670
 police which is great and not only the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.290
 police because it can be the guide that to 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.040
 Starting from level 6 is super complicated 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.500
 if not 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.719
 any friend to drive through all the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.250
 drive is what many can think what 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.019
 typical that you put a name to give 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.549
 an icon is really knocking down the 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.290
 barriers between online and offline and 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.569
 is that you play a game and you can 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.189
 put any friend to get into how 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.019
 police to chase or get in like 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.150
 runner to spoil you the race or 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.280
 to compete with you with you is 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.569
 precious so in short guys from 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.980
 the games that have captured the most 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.750
 attention of the players in this new 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.400
 generation is need for speed rail valls 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.290
 and not just because of the visual section that 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.150
 it's brutal but because it recovers 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.010
 feeling of speed lost years ago 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.540
 Car game and I think that's what 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.579
 the fans asked I think that is what all 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.439
 we need and it's a must buy in 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.030
 this first batch I'm tom jones and I 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.919
 you can follow on twitter on facebook and 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.919
 can you try to catch me in the king pee 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:45.840
 yes if you want you can write no 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:48.500
 There is nothing that makes me happier 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.500
 two
