00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.120
 "Yindyamarra Winhanganha" (Australian Aboriginal Quotes) 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.800
 Refers to "the wisdom that will live a good life in a world worth living" 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.400
 At Charles Sturt University 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.080
 We believe that wisdom is shared 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.000
 The meaning of learning is far more than a paper degree 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.920
 Is the relationship you built 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.840
 Is your bold step 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.760
 And the traces you left behind 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.480
 We know 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.200
 The best way to build knowledge is based on strong relationships 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.520
 Use your time to expand 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.840
 Learn in your own way 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.560
 At the same time, there must be team support 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.840
 As a student at Charles Sturt University 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.920
 You will learn from experts 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.880
 You will exercise skills at the workplace 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 Has consistently ranked among the top graduates in the national employment rate 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.840
 It is also a strong backing to support your degree. 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.920
 But a good life has a richer connotation 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.000
 Means to get in touch with people around you 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.480
 Means that every step of the journey of life will find joy 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.840
 Means arriving at your chosen destination 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.360
 Because people who make this a world worth living 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.120
 Their motivation is curious 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.800
 Is passion 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 They turned the possibility into reality 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.240
 We believe that all difficulties can be overcome 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.080
 The most important thing is your investment, your life experience. 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.040
 Only one person will decide how far you can go 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.320
 How high can fly 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.840
 And how much to pay 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.760
 This person is you 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.680
