00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello my name is light and today 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.170
 I want to record a budget video for you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.209
 cosmetics or cosmetic bag for a beginner and 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.219
 I want to show you all the products that 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.859
 always work on none the less 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.690
 cheap enough everywhere you can find them and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.449
 they are not inferior to luxury cosmetics 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.339
 in general my budget most cream and so 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.679
 let's start my favorite foundation 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.220
 which I recommend this bibi cream from 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.839
 garnier 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.730
 and despite the fact that it is cheap it is 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.470
 always handing me always i will choose 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.790
 if I go somewhere because I know for sure 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.890
 that he does not suit me 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.330
 he doesn't look on his face like a mask not 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.370
 emphasizes flaking 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.700
 but nevertheless he somehow removes everything 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.640
 acne hides redness evens 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 tone of the face and at the same time he somehow removes 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.810
 greasy luster if necessary and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.210
 keeps it all day its super easy 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.130
 apply and beauty blender and finger 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 nose and the main plus is that when you 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.550
 it's impossible to buy it our benz 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.040
 because it is presented first 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.320
 just two shades lighter and 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.900
 darker and presented just for 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.170
 two skin types for normal which 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.820
 suitable for both dry skin and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.100
 combined and fat like in my case 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 so if you save it, itâ€™s definitely not 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.929
 disappointed besides he fits and on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.729
 winter and summer as a concealer i can 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.859
 recommend you roller concealer 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.829
 my side dish is a light beige shade 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.830
 and he perfectly covers the bags under 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.320
 eyes any redness on whether 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.330
 and even some small pimples he does not 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.430
 rolls not going to crease and not 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.110
 underline fine wrinkles when you 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.240
 you put it then it is practically not 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.370
 noticed therefore go even for school 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.710
 just need to unscrew the cap somehow 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.660
 distribute this roller in your eyes 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.270
 or where you need to shade another 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.190
 fingers everything is ready and he is very 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.200
 compact so you can carry it with 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.390
 yourself in your purse and use it by 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.700
 need as a facial correction 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.300
 also like blush dash bronzer i can you 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.360
 give advice 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.700
 rouge bourgeois is 11 shade i paint 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.160
 these blush cheekbones somehow dimming 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.710
 fishing opus is my chin naturally 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.630
 I wear them as blush and it contains 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.670
 such a microscopic delicate 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.800
 schwimmer who could highlight your 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.620
 skin and in general these blush make your 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.870
 face brighter more healthy and more 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 rested and besides these rouge are very 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.800
 economical as pencils for 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.410
 eyebrows i can advise you two 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.959
 a pencil is cheaper than another 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.850
 what is more expensive on this pencil from pupa 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.170
 I used it so often that I have 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.959
 there was one stub 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.110
 if you pick the right one for you 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.060
 the shade of this pencil from pupa then your 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.739
 eyebrows will be so natural 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.840
 so natural that no one even 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.020
 noticed that you tinted them but they 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.120
 will be very as bright as guiding 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.580
 your eyes but if you don't want to spend 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.980
 300 rubles for eyebrow pencil 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.720
 I advise you a pencil from with and its plus in 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.010
 the fact that in the first he has clearly 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.340
 which can be combed eyebrows 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.870
 stack to shape them and how 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.760
 shade a little if you 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.830
 overdo it when they painted eyebrows 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.080
 besides myself this little bit 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.000
 wax you and when you paint eyebrows then 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.459
 at the same time you stack them 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.620
 so all day your eyebrows 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.200
 remain in the form in which were 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.630
 let's say in the morning and in the evening does not look 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.090
 how not to understand what this pencil is worth 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.709
 only there 100 rubles plus or minus 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.260
 among the mascara I have only one 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 Favorite is mara from maibellin define a 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.569
 lash 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.730
 if you need infinitely long 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.950
 eyelashes but still so voluminous 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.500
 fluffy enough and there too 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.569
 do not hesitate take this mascara this 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.610
 the mascara does not crumble throughout the day and 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.319
 when you come home in the evening then no 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.440
 such a feeling of what's about on the roots 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.660
 also stayed off the tips she crumbled and 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.220
 disappeared somewhere besides with all 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.500
 I have the rest of the carcass 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.340
 the problem is that with a brush I somehow wad 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.739
 century 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.660
 and this carcass is so delicate and 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.150
 small tassel, which is convenient 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.519
 stain both upper eyelids and lower 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.380
 eyelids and then do not need to wipe anything from 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.980
 budget on the wall can not advise here 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.650
 such a shadow from from the shadow and with a squadra 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.590
 and such shadows that will fit on 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.470
 everyday 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.450
 they can make some kind of smokey ice they 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.950
 don't crumble for a long time and not 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.590
 looks kind of so dark 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.569
 Incomprehensible blot like bruise on eyes 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.310
 also all these shades can 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.470
 there is no use of their direct 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.660
 purpose such as this dark 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.090
 Matt can be done and 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.070
 make out your eyebrows and this brown 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.229
 shimmer us color you can draw cheekbones 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.090
 and two light shades can 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.220
 use as highlighter that I and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.020
 do among the lip liner and the most 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.930
 favorite pencil is a pencil from letual 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.630
 and there all shades are very realistic 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.669
 very worthy and want not very long 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.070
 holding onto me sorry that this pencil 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.800
 very soft it does not scratch not 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.840
 spreads throughout the day and you can 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.580
 not only to encircle your lips to make them 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.460
 visually more such dolls 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.430
 but also completely fill with color and not 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.830
 It turns out such a matte lipstick in general 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.690
 two in one for a very small price 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.030
 I also think that the ideal option for 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.220
 every day will not lipstick namely 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.289
 balms and the best balm 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.150
 this balm from meybellin baby lips 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.430
 because it really moisturizes in 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.070
 the form of the act feeds as it turns out 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.139
 such a pleasant feeling and such 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.030
 light shine is created but not like 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.789
 the fact that you smeared your lips with some fat 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.620
 as happens with other balms while doing so 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.919
 it makes your lips visually more 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.080
 plump somehow so more healthy 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.380
 more alive it seems to me perfect 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.599
 option to study and even to work and order 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.760
 more for the winter but if you want something 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.990
 brighter, I advise you to balm from 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.690
 meybellin pub persons called 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.420
 the movie is such a crimson cherry 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.550
 shade and know with the rest of the flowers 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.650
 meybellin baby lips there are shoals because 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.760
 that some of them somehow emphasize 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.100
 peeling lips 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.200
 and the same balm is doing the same thing 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.860
 that the colorless balsam is very good 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.900
 moisturizes 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.930
 but it makes your lips so 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.080
 bright juicy and seductive if 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.570
 do you like yet more brilliance then i 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.900
 I advise the brilliance that will fit on 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.610
 evening and day and the most such 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.840
 universal shine in my opinion this 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.510
 close treble he's with me he is in a shade of 205 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.820
 and I can safely carry the luster of such 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.010
 the golden middle seems to make up lips 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.650
 feature so not very bright not very 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.570
 conspicuous but nonetheless they chain 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.940
 views of others because they 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.900
 look very much alive and very 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.670
 seductively 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.740
 and finally, I want to talk to you about 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.140
 brushes and if those don't seem to me 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.270
 It can be applied to the fingers kraynyak 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.310
 the rest will be much harder for me 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.530
 it seems that with the most versatile brush 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.180
 this is a kabuki brush because 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.020
 you can somehow adjust the corner 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:49.870
 cheekbones apply bronzer main part 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.550
 can be applied rouge and also you brush 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.590
 perfect to 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.810
 powder just so colorless 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.700
 transparent veil is acceptable if you have 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.440
 be very fat cats during the day you 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.000
 you often have to use but you 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.740
 do not want to in the evening 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.350
 the amount of powder on your face 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.760
 turned into such a layer of plaster then I 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.370
 I highly recommend you to use 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.890
 it is this brush because it does 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.900
 a layer of powder inconspicuous and very so 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.640
 light unobtrusive in general i 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.320
 forked on such a brush from mac 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.480
 certainly far from budget 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.220
 that firms like ressens and catrice 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.230
 there are kabuki brushes too 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.150
 the most important thing is to watch them 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.130
 tightly packed just need not be 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.710
 to work correctly because if the brush 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:33.590
 Kabuki drink is not very so tight then with 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.900
 time she know so disintegrate and already 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.000
 little can and want to do so 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.100
 it was all my budget 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.170
 I hope this video was helpful to you
