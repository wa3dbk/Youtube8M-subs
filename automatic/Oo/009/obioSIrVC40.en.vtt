00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.590
 thanks to you you you you bounced 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.080

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.590
 I bring one more prescription for this 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.230
 Today's revenue is also a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.660
 Special recipe for winter is a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.420
 thing that everyone loves 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.910
 Only I decided to make this recipe. 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.070
 super famous only of another taste 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.600
 to be a bit different from 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.120
 videos we've seen here in the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.290
 YouTube you already see there is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.660
 today I told you a sweet fondue 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.110
 but it's not chocolate fuse we're going 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.230
 to make a fund of dulce de leche are 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.390
 sits on the couch of truth does not sit 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.739
 gets raised because the revenue is fast 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.270
 already picks up the paper to 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.609
 ingredients to run around the market 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.109
 to buy to do even today is 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.989
 so if you want to learn how to make a 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.729
 delicious sweet milk fondue is just 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.140
 continue watching this video though 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.710
 to the kitchen 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 I started to record without being recording and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.900
 I started kind of wrong it's wrong people order 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.549
 certain is to start with the milk 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.990
 So let's put the dulce de leche in the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.259
 panela chooses the dulce de leche 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.630
 quality is how we are 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.159
 simple recipe a recipe theoretically 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.220
 dirt cheap try not to save 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.960
 very much at least one dulce de leche is the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.689
 that you can do that too I walked 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.060
 reading that it gets very very crazy is 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.280
 I have a little fear is you 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.590
 make your sweet milk with a milk 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.899
 condensed in the pressure cooker and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.329
 You do not look well, do not look well. 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:00.990
 And even there you wear it instead. 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:05.960
 of the milk candy bought is cheaper 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.459
 Even though I'm going to start my low fire. 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.349
 I'll start messing this up here. 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.629
 just a little cream here 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.310
 The pot that I forgot to tell you 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.349
 the cream we put on 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.760
 gradually the ideal is that you 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.670
 rita 1ยบ or dulce de leche are seeing that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.709
 It's already very quickly here, I'm going 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.519
 make a small portion because today 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.610
 Unfortunately I'm alone. 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.970
 so there I put what the two 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.510
 little fingers of three of milk more or less 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.510
 that 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.170
 the complete list of ingredients 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.090
 while and amount I'll leave in the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.590
 blog because you can take everything 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:54.720
 right now to fight calmly now that the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.280
 dulce de leche already gave a good melted 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.760
 I can come back with a little more 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.760
 milk cream 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:08.560
 I'm going to use almost 6 box of cream of 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.569
 milk is the most difficult recipe 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.260
 It's been a long time since you've seen it here. 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.540
 on the channel are ending people not all 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.709
 year is true the recipe is basically 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.329
 this you melt the sweet milk candy 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.720
 quality milk 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.180
 mix the sour cream and let it 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.579
 they incorporate well let it be well 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.870
 Toasty in the pan to just take 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:37.120
 by split on the table and serve're going 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.790
 a solid developer 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.609
 I'm going to hang up and I'm going to 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.980
 blow to my little pot that goes to the 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.290
 and we'll see if we can 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.690
 good will not be an easy game more person 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.669
 which then is yummy network will 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:57.730
 move to another clique and we'll go 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:59.199
 see if it's good and you do not have to 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.419
 show you 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.250
 calm recipe did not go wrong I say that 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.959
 I do not have to what to show you 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.569
 Actually, I can not show it to you. 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.449
 You holding hands now. 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.940

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.019
 ugly a tragedy 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.850
 Then I 'm only going to get one for 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.620
 You can have a look like 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.780
 It's just a little bit, you go. 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:31.500

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:35.000
 but now they go and tam here's 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:39.020

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.400
 how to follow we have strawberries 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:47.090
 oach cookies that is a dodge of 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.640
 like fado we have a chocolate example 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.910
 mini carolinas I searched those mini 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.760
 churros but I do not think so, is that 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.920
 is our fan of beautiful and wonderful 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.920
 now it remains to know if it's good 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.420
 prove then you have already seen the affection 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.060
 The time has come for the fan to prove 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.890
 to see if it was really tasty 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.200
 so I 'll stay a little aside 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.060
 middle back will be kind of weird 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.980
 this part of the video because I do not 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.660
 I could think of nothing a way 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.340
 different so I can eat record to 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.350
 You, at the same time, I hope that you 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.500

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.450
 we will prove money with the basics that is 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:32.250

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:11.990
 turn of the mini churros that I do not

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:22.260

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:28.980

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.760
 It's because I was the one who did it, it's not because 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.180
 It's super easy to say, no, it's not us. 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:49.020
 It is very tasty real 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.540
