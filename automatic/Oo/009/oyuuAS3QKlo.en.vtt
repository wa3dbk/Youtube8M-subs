00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.660
 What are you doing? 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.560
 He likes this song 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.420
 How can you know that? 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.960
 Check your Facebook page. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.000
 I mean, you can hear everything right? 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.160
 The auditory functions are the last 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.020
 sensory faculties in deteriorating. 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.320
 OMG! 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.180
 Where I am? 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.880
 Is awake. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.060
 Dr. Wells, get down to the cortex, right now. 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.920
 Pulse 120 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.400
 Both pupils react to light. 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.660
 Look at me. 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.400
 Look at me. 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.480
 just relax 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.280
 Everything is fine, man. 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.540
 You are at STAR Laboratories 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.600
 STAR Laboratories? Who you are? 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.800
 I'm Cisco Ramon. 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.060
 She is Caitlin ... Dr. Snow. 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.660
 I need you to piss here. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.560
 Not now. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720
 What ... What is happening? What happened? 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.980
 You were struck by lightning, friend. 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.240
 What? 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 Has lightning given me abs? 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.120
 Your muscles should be atrophied 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.020
 but instead they are in a chronic and inexplicable state of cellular regeneration 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.520
 Come here. Sit down. 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.960
 You were in a coma 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 For how long? 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.680
 Nine months. 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.520
 Welcome again, Mr. Allen 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.420
 We have a lot to talk. 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.760
 Iris? 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.540
 Iris, yes 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.340
 She came to see you quite a lot. 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.300
 He talks a lot 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.000
 Also, it's sexy 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.740
 I have to go 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.560
 No, You can not. 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.780
 No no no. Caitlin is right. 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 No, now that you're awake we need to do more tests. 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.560
 You are still going through changes and there is much we do not know. 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.060
 I'm fine, really. 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.140
 I feel normal 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.240
 Thanks for saving my life. 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.180
 Seriously? 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.620
 Can I keep the sweatshirt? 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.480
 Yes, keep it 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.160
 In agreement 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.260
 What? 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.880
 Nothing 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.180
 I have noticed that you do not smile much 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.960
 My promising career in Bioengineering is over 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.580
 My boss is in a wheelchair for life 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.500
 The explosion that put you in a coma 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.740
 He also killed my fiancÃ© 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 So this empty expression feels like the right one 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.580
 It's not possible 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.800
 You have had a distal radius fracture 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.700
 I had? 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.080
 He was cured ... in three hours 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.880
 How is that even possible? 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.680
 We do not know ..... Still 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.960
 When I was 11 my mother was murdered 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.620
 Meta-humans? 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040
 That's how we call them 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.700
 I saw one today 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.280
 He is a bank robber 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.220
 And you can control the weather 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.180
 This is getting more and more great 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.360
 This is not great! 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.580
 In agreement? One man died 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.200
 I have been seeing the unresolved cases of the last 9 months .... 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.240
 and there was an increase in deaths and missing without explanation 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.180
 Your meta-humans have been busy 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.360
 I do not blame them, I know they did not want any of this to happen 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.580
 I know that everyone has lost something 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.400
 But I need your help to catch Mardon and others like him out there 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.280
 But I can not do it without you 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.500
 I thought that if the STAR Laboratories 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.660
 could do something good for the community 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.600
 Maybe people would not be so angry with Dr. Wells 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.080
 How do I find Mardon? 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.880
 I have repormed the STAR Laboratories satellite 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.400
 to track weather anomalies about Central City 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.280
 We just received something 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.240
 The atmospheric pressure was reduced 20 millibars in a matter of seconds 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.100
 I've tracked him down to a farm west of the city 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.560
 What if I undo it? 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.520
 How the hell are you going to do that? 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.900
 I will run around in the opposite direction 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.760
 cutting his legs 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.020
 I would have to run over 1000 km / h to do that 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.280
 Your body may not resist that speed 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.020
 You will die 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.100
 I must try 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.120
 The suit is holding 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.620
 But he not 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.240
 Can do it. I know you can do it 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.280
 It is too strong 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.480
 Barry? 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.580
 Barry? 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.560
 It's over 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.760
 I'm fine
