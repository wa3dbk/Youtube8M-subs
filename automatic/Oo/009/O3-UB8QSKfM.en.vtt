00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 Good folks went to make a video lesson. 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.420
 here my first video lesson right because 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.840
 I'm just testing the application 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.930
 install the display and corner 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.990
 so it 's today I'm going to teach you how 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:25.470
 customize your keyboard so do it 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.619
 then change it short then first 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.130
 very important first thing is you 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 have the site because it basically brings you 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.020
 does everything for the site right? 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:43.520
 So you come to the waiting place. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.520
 charge as usual 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:07.330
 Good, he's still there when 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 finish loading your you click here 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:16.920
 to be and there in that little bar up here 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:29.650
 cyclic can write is you write 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:32.350
 Collor who saves haidÃª presses to search there 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.350
 in case of eva it will not load 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.310
 and you will see some options here that 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.310
 I'll show you now 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.170
 powder 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.270
 so hoping to load mine in case 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.200
 take a little longer because he is 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.200
 full of things, huh? 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.520
 good in case you will not show up 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.870
 that's because you're not giving a mill 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.550
 here I think and know what it is 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:37.450
 I probably have to take in the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:40.450
 then if I can not fall waiting 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.450
 rounds 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.920
 and sorry staff but if none here 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.200
 What are you doing because I 'm going to have to 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.740
 solve this problem seriously because 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.720
 future or other videos that right 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.390
 I 'm going to record it's not going to sound like this 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.230
 even because this sim is the one carrying 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.230
 that appears takes a little bit then 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:44.580
 then it will appear these applications 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:53.470
 here these applications are not those 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:56.790
 drinks there normally staff is e 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.790
 second here 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.790
 in the box is this second because second is the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:10.360
 which usually does not pay here in the corner 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.380
 which is changing the way will fai 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.489
 appears and is open to install and this 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.940
 given confirm and then install everything 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.510
 I think it's going to be the thorn right 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:29.170
 then there or not I think that there 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.750
 after it probably starts 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:41.590
 almost appeared after it started 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:45.610
 You come here in the adjustments and down here. 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.830
 this icon will come up I come here is 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:54.820
 cyclic and nicola and try like this and nothing 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.520
 because it is not going to be activated at 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.800
 colors and such 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.460
 so then you feel select themes 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:11.740
 there's going to have to be black on the upe that 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:13.690
 swam in semnan of the book and such goes 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.440
 do these things here 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:23.460
 these issues actually only this is for 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:27.010
 only for the little children that will appear 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.190
 Now these are paulo when you 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:34.660
 clicking on the agreement letter will appear 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.289
 so in my case of blue here and here 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.779
 in this first one here 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.819
 lyrics are think here is the blue in 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:45.020
 black 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:46.729
 then and here that customize I never know 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:53.270
 Why do you think I'm going to put a photo? 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:56.770
 as background or I do not know if I know it there 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.110
 it's something like that 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:04.639
 so from here I think this common sense 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:08.719
 deficits thing there is explained there and 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:11.899
 Then try six then select the themes 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:14.029
 sometimes colors appear will save 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:16.490
 show up and spring in case I 'm not going 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:20.649
 risk and me because to me the 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:29.979
 record and one that I no longer want to change 

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:29.979
 So that's all folks for today and 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:37.879
 we stay here with another one with a 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:43.669
 First video vibe is how to change 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:51.729
 the color of your iphone ipad ipod keyboard 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:51.729
 And car, then, bye.
