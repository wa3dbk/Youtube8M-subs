00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 so and so hello finally comes to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.779
 another video today again 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.490
 one looks at times again 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.110
 really long time I hope you can 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.550
 that start with the song and we see 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.550
 us after the intro to the same 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.099
 so and so hello and come now 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.320
 I want you this now for the intro 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.640
 imagine beautiful little draws 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.839
 currently that is the 1.8 as you can see 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.030
 grant top right motivation 1.8 so that 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:40.379
 set is the here is of course synonymous 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.730
 still like the video description with it 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.760
 you that you do not pull her out of here 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.900
 must tap the first thing we want 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.690
 so here in this beautiful 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.610
 height area has as mentioned many height 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.470
 seeing differently is my theory 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.510
 Is that what I think is different 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.489
 granit I need a bit more 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.110
 until I can tell the three apart 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.129
 Well, in any case you have spontaneous 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.640
 son of the environment right then here even 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.800
 because she is not a bit to the right of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.780
 spawn point we have not here 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.119
 quite a big jungle but stupid 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.220
 good times it is extremely rare 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.590
 become animal in there we have a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.440
 jungle temple so really here 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.289
 we can stretch over the gorge 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.259
 yes, just have a look 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.300
 go down here to there on the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.580
 password widest senses 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.360
 Although I think earlier you could 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.709
 with this code solve all and the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.090
 is still going on so if you man 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.789
 such a dom with the work gives easy 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.670
 then code this code a broad sense 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.020
 you get the blood on normal 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.940
 so here if we are the same now 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.369
 shot down or not and hereby 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.890
 another drug is not that right now 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.130
 good may but it is definitely in 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.380
 order for the beginning so fly then 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.989
 I mean , I'll go over there 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.750
 the jungle here where many melons 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:02.880
 are also curious are there are millions 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.619
 Here is a new feature since the 1.8 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.750
 there was a lot to add now I want 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.399
 like to go into the spectator mode 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.170
 we can do it with the space mausrad 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.220
 can then change speed 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.959
 we fly a bit faster 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.989
 and that we have here then it was 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.270
 that bonn we have a right here 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.230
 big even deserts mpc village have here 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.500
 so we carrots yet we still have 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.040
 Potatoes somewhere, yes, here are too 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.579
 potatoes ear 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.260
 Well, here is lava source so it is 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.819
 Unfortunately, they are not very neat 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.189
 but we can do that now 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.439
 just change from pc to 4 in 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.849
 fly in this direction 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.109
 Here we have to wait for every moment 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.969
 a vaccine cans 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.609
 it starts here lower left 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.890
 yes, this is exactly what I would say 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.409
 even similar in size, I'll go into the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.939
 Creative mode and then in the forge 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.280
 in here we have another one of books 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.349
 to get a library here 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.299
 I'll just go here so roughly 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.819
 in there we have iron saddles 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.040
 and and bread so that's it 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.079
 not bad two ovens here so 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.000
 the load is not so nice now 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.379
 not so bad but yes i think so 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.569
 looks very cool especially because of the 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.700
 jungle jungle that is very 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.859
 rare advertising is still two busts 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.959
 well know, or how sometimes 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.639
 Only here is one at that time one 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.730
 if you are still here 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:32.000
 are also flying over this gorge 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.430
 as epic from having a pc software 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.699
 but it would have to fly here 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.169
 It's also a really extreme 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.479
 Generate big gulp 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:45.169
 Here we also have horses for horses 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:48.560
 The gorge must be here somewhere 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:50.419
 here's that right here are even two 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.459
 open shows take then was again a 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.470
 creative and cool 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.019
 Here you also have gold on the right side 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.750
 So here it is also pure 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.239
 This really has a big one here 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.060
 Cave system here namely there 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.940
 There is still a lava bordering in the lava 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.560
 other gorge with rats so if it is 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.720
 there are no diamonds then it is 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.879
 but I believe a broom because that is 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.680
 really highest probability like that 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.109
 you are still a chopper here 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.370
 somehow 45 gorges into each other like that 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.079
 that it is already extreme 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.370
 Maybe I can find it right now 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.620
 here diamonds yes and I am 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.849
 good i am a good diamond for one 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.849
 1 2344 year four diamonds in these 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.680
 coordinates but those are because the 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.969
 Customers themselves check who the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.120
 coordinates and so maybe write 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.490
 I also describe a video 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.090
 but if you keep playing, then you have 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.790
 you need that less 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.380
 do you need that then yes I think so 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.660
 But there are certainly still there 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.680
 even more diaz i just go now 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.660
 go up again and we'll do it 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.400
 even at the end, so more gives up 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.750
 nothing really looks good to him 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.520
 Seeing that was really cool looks 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.530
 I hope you have this little steve 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.080
 Idea please if so then let 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.130
 also like there last an abo da and man 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.130
 looks in and out
