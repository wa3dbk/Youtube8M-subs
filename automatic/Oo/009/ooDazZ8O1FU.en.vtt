00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.610
 important reminder obligations 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.960
 regulatory environment code 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.280
 to intervene on a circuit 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.960
 refrigerating it is necessary 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.790
 yes, hold the certificate of 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.410
 capacity and that the intervener is 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.310
 holder of the certificate at 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.310
 handling of refrigerants 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.220
 for equipment 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.660
 individual is necessary for 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.140
 intervene on the electrical circuit 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.140
 horrifying effects 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.410
 so here we have the fan running 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.940
 but we see that and not turn very hard 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.680
 we will see on another skin field 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
 cold 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.340
 there we see it is a hotel operators 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.420
 so we see it's a youyou 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.630
 noise and that blows a lot more is 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.210
 so there 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.130
 is that the capacitor inf so on 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.360
 the other one we think capacitors and hs 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.180
 in any case he was able to value its value 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.150
 basic and we will dismount it 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.340
 we will change it so we see it on 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:20.210
 condo also these five there we see the condo 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:22.310
 single-phase motor here is where we see 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.140
 that they slowly turn on a very 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.630
 largely you see it is spinning largely 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.220
 slower does not kill our problems our 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.869
 Capacitors camps sense raised rich 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.160
 and so the candelon laon the cut and one 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.610
 removed it we will replace it with 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.610
 that one 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.759
 the f22 micro farhad we see the control 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.759
 before 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.409
 it's a permanent capacitor 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.679
 there is no 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.679
 sense it's not for the laughing what 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.850
 so the wind is measuring the capacitor and 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.069
 we measure a farhad micro good game by 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.190
 a micro farah finger that's it was 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.600
 planned two farhad microphones you do not see who 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.670
 he lost 50% of its capacity 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.450
 then we will measure the 9 see as he 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.420
 so here is the new one and we 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.100
 measure 2 farhad microphones you see two 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.660
 farhad microphones that's why they 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.819
 turned half the speed at 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.180
 more than half as fast elsewhere 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.180
 badly we'll show them 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:52.830
 so we go up the chain I do not know 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.840
 not so as was worth as mules in 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.280
 decline can be found as the bar 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.329
 that she was not seen in a good 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.709
 smooth intervention after then already 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.459
 if a change in speed 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.459
 fan rotation 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.650
 the capacitor and exchangers the 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.650
 back up the engine in case the image 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.360
 to see as soon as possible 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.220
 but the arms to ferret that's it's a 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.110
 to have 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.440
 here is our child when we must 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.430
 been changed we see that same when we 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.820
 is very different a worker and then 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.820
 quiet
