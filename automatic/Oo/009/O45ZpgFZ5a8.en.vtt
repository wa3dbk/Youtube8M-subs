jimping this one's even more stylized
that<00:01:54.990> cold<00:01:55.350> steel<00:01:55.590> does<00:01:55.830> they<00:01:56.070> kind<00:01:56.550> of<00:01:56.610> just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that cold steel does they kind of just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.540 
that cold steel does they kind of just
do<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.150> as<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> visual<00:01:58.020> thing<00:01:58.260> really<00:01:58.530> i<00:01:58.680> mean<00:01:58.830> is

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
do it as a visual thing really i mean is

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.190 
do it as a visual thing really i mean is
probably<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.119> least<00:02:03.540> functional

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
probably the you know least functional

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.630 
probably the you know least functional
the<00:02:04.290> thing<00:02:04.440> i've<00:02:04.590> seen<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.920> any<00:02:05.070> cold<00:02:05.369> steel

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the thing i've seen on any cold steel

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.660 
the thing i've seen on any cold steel
knives<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.150> doesn't<00:02:06.479> even<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.780> mean<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.050> liner

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
knives it doesn't even I mean the liner

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
knives it doesn't even I mean the liner
is<00:02:08.670> actually<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> little<00:02:09.300> raised<00:02:09.660> above<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
is actually a little raised above the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.850 
is actually a little raised above the
middle<00:02:11.340> there<00:02:11.520> see<00:02:11.730> actually<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:13.830> I

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
middle there see actually you know I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.040 
middle there see actually you know I
mean<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.130> might<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.459> somewhat<00:02:14.880> Griffey<00:02:15.270> if

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
mean this might be somewhat Griffey if

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.170 
mean this might be somewhat Griffey if
that<00:02:16.290> lighter<00:02:16.560> was<00:02:16.800> sunk<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:17.580> as<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.060> can

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that lighter was sunk in but as you can

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.780 
that lighter was sunk in but as you can
see<00:02:18.440> not<00:02:19.440> at<00:02:19.590> all<00:02:19.709> perfectly<00:02:20.130> smooth<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.610> looks

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
see not at all perfectly smooth it looks

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.640 
see not at all perfectly smooth it looks
cool<00:02:21.000> though<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.180> don't<00:02:21.480> need<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.020> mean

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
cool though you don't need it I mean

here i'm not sure what the the proper
term<00:03:04.500> for<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:05.040> grind<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:06.739> where<00:03:07.739> as<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.280> know

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
term for that grind is where as you know

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.650 
term for that grind is where as you know
this<00:03:08.519> has<00:03:08.700> more<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.030> typical

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.940 

hollow<00:03:12.380> grind<00:03:13.210> on<00:03:14.210> it<00:03:15.790> weight-wise<00:03:17.680> I'd<00:03:18.680> say

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
hollow grind on it weight-wise I'd say

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.540 
hollow grind on it weight-wise I'd say
they're<00:03:19.100> about<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.430> same<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:21.140> Recon<00:03:22.070> one<00:03:22.310> is

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
they're about the same the Recon one is

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.690 
they're about the same the Recon one is
quite<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.850> bit<00:03:23.090> thinner<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.310> would<00:03:25.460> lend

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
quite a bit thinner so it would lend

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.910 
quite a bit thinner so it would lend
itself<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.150> carrying<00:03:26.810> more<00:03:27.080> so<00:03:27.320> than<00:03:27.470> this<00:03:27.650> and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
itself to carrying more so than this and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.910 
itself to carrying more so than this and
they're<00:03:28.130> both<00:03:28.250> big<00:03:28.550> bulky<00:03:28.970> knives<00:03:29.210> but<00:03:29.920> recon

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
they're both big bulky knives but recon

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.970 
they're both big bulky knives but recon
one<00:03:31.190> would<00:03:32.060> lend<00:03:32.540> itself<00:03:32.870> more<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.740> I

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
one would lend itself more to that I

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.770 
one would lend itself more to that I
like<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:34.550> pocket<00:03:34.880> clip<00:03:35.030> better<00:03:35.240> on<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.450> Recon

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
like the pocket clip better on the Recon

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.350 
like the pocket clip better on the Recon
ones<00:03:36.050> a<00:03:36.200> little<00:03:36.230> smaller<00:03:37.180> for<00:03:38.180> those<00:03:38.330> that

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
ones a little smaller for those that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.960 
ones a little smaller for those that
don't<00:03:38.900> need<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.170> huge<00:03:39.920> pocket<00:03:40.190> clip<00:03:40.520> sticking

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
don't need a huge pocket clip sticking
