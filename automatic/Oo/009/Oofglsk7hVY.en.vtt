let's<00:02:07.179> see<00:02:07.479> if<00:02:08.019> this<00:02:08.170> piece<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.099> kit<00:02:09.310> actually

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.579 
let's see if this piece of kit actually

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.320 
let's see if this piece of kit actually
works

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
works

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.309 
works
Ready<00:02:11.930> Steady<00:02:12.560> Go

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.800 

and<00:02:15.829> there<00:02:16.010> we<00:02:16.099> go<00:02:16.249> you<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.400> see<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:17.689> can

and there we go you can see the you can
see<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.109> infrared<00:02:19.749> cameras<00:02:20.749> come<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:21.019> look<00:02:21.170> at

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
see the infrared cameras come on look at

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.839 
see the infrared cameras come on look at
that<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.680> see<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.920> road<00:02:22.159> there's<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.459> huge

that you can see the road there's a huge
wall<00:02:23.150> off<00:02:23.359> to<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.659> left<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.739> really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
wall off to the left this is really

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.839 
wall off to the left this is really
weird

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
weird

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.160

clear it is unbelievable you can see the

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.909 
clear it is unbelievable you can see the
road<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:44.000> if<00:02:44.359> you're<00:02:44.510> driving<00:02:44.840> with<00:02:45.439> at<00:02:45.739> least

of times already today in daylight but

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.300 
of times already today in daylight but
nothing<00:02:59.030> like<00:02:59.299> this<00:02:59.799> this<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:01.010> quite

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
nothing like this this is quite

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.589 
nothing like this this is quite
phenomenal<00:03:01.549> now<00:03:02.000> there's<00:03:02.180> definitely<00:03:02.569> a

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
phenomenal now there's definitely a

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.699 
phenomenal now there's definitely a
little<00:03:02.689> bit<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.989> light<00:03:03.139> coming<00:03:03.379> out<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.650> the

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
little bit of light coming out of the

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.770 
little bit of light coming out of the
front<00:03:03.949> that's<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.370> infrared<00:03:05.239> bulb<00:03:05.540> and

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
front that's the infrared bulb and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.780 
front that's the infrared bulb and
without<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.230> we<00:03:06.379> wouldn't<00:03:06.560> see<00:03:06.680> anything<00:03:07.489> so

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
without that we wouldn't see anything so

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.879 
without that we wouldn't see anything so
it's<00:03:08.599> not<00:03:08.750> like<00:03:08.930> we're<00:03:09.109> cheating<00:03:09.349> and<00:03:09.620> haven't

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889

covered<00:03:10.159> up<00:03:10.280> all<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.639> bulbs<00:03:10.879> but<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.389> do<00:03:11.569> move

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
covered up all the bulbs but you do move

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.559 
covered up all the bulbs but you do move
that<00:03:12.019> infrared<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.680> be<00:03:12.829> able<00:03:12.889> to<00:03:13.040> pick<00:03:13.969> out<00:03:14.180> all

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
that infrared to be able to pick out all

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.809 
that infrared to be able to pick out all
the<00:03:15.019> markings<00:03:15.379> we<00:03:15.590> look<00:03:15.769> at<00:03:15.889> the<00:03:15.980> screen<00:03:16.340> you

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
the markings we look at the screen you

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
is about a 300-foot drop and beyond that

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.069 
is about a 300-foot drop and beyond that
another<00:03:28.159> 300<00:03:28.669> foot<00:03:28.790> drop<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.239> another<00:03:29.540> 300

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
another 300 foot drop and another 300

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.719 
another 300 foot drop and another 300
foot<00:03:30.229> drop<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:30.949> going<00:03:31.159> through<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.549> wall

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:31.729 
foot drop so going through the wall

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.210 
foot drop so going through the wall
would<00:03:32.599> end<00:03:32.810> up<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.109> a<00:03:33.319> really<00:03:33.470> rather<00:03:33.859> nasty

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
would end up in a really rather nasty

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.750 
would end up in a really rather nasty
sticky<00:03:34.699> mess

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
sticky mess

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.339 
sticky mess
and<00:03:37.239> here<00:03:37.420> we<00:03:37.480> are<00:03:37.540> we're<00:03:37.720> doing<00:03:37.780> about<00:03:37.959> 40

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
and here we are we're doing about 40

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.149 
and here we are we're doing about 40
kilometers<00:03:38.769> now<00:03:38.980> it's<00:03:39.129> 25<00:03:39.549> miles<00:03:39.879> an<00:03:40.060> hour<00:03:41.159> the

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
kilometers now it's 25 miles an hour the

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.009 
kilometers now it's 25 miles an hour the
vision<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.610> really<00:03:43.090> quite<00:03:43.390> impressive<00:03:43.659> now

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
vision is really quite impressive now

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.920 
vision is really quite impressive now
the<00:03:44.079> original<00:03:44.680> idea<00:03:45.400> for<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.790> is<00:03:46.060> not<00:03:46.629> so

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
the original idea for this is not so

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.780 
the original idea for this is not so
that's<00:03:47.079> idiots<00:03:47.530> like<00:03:47.680> us<00:03:47.739> driving<00:03:48.310> around<00:03:48.579> in
