begin to write an essay I've always had
a<00:00:22.750> few<00:00:23.110> arguments<00:00:24.010> in<00:00:24.699> my<00:00:24.940> mind<00:00:25.180> about<00:00:25.360> how

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
a few arguments in my mind about how

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.330 
a few arguments in my mind about how
this<00:00:25.810> has<00:00:25.990> worked<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.779> relation<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
this has worked so in relation to the

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.519 
this has worked so in relation to the
syllabus<00:00:30.670> so<00:00:31.359> in<00:00:31.480> relation<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:32.050> syllabus

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
syllabus so in relation to the syllabus

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.099 
syllabus so in relation to the syllabus
you've<00:00:32.710> always<00:00:32.890> been<00:00:32.980> exactly<00:00:33.609> with<00:00:33.879> this<00:00:34.109> and

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:35.109 
you've always been exactly with this and

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.049 
you've always been exactly with this and
that's<00:00:35.350> like<00:00:35.530> they<00:00:35.679> can't<00:00:35.949> deviate<00:00:36.370> that<00:00:36.819> far

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
that's like they can't deviate that far

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.639 
that's like they can't deviate that far
from<00:00:37.149> the<00:00:37.269> syllabus<00:00:37.539> when<00:00:37.839> they're<00:00:38.050> writing

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
from the syllabus when they're writing

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.020 
from the syllabus when they're writing
as<00:00:39.460> their<00:00:39.670> questions<00:00:40.089> but<00:00:41.429> black<00:00:42.429> stolen<00:00:42.850> the

when<00:00:49.269> I<00:00:49.299> was<00:00:49.479> studying<00:00:49.629> for<00:00:49.899> module<00:00:50.199> baby

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
when I was studying for module baby

when I was studying for module baby
in<00:00:50.620> English<00:00:50.829> advanced<00:00:51.129> it<00:00:51.940> was<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:54.219> I<00:00:54.339> still

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:54.549 
in English advanced it was like I still

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.169 
in English advanced it was like I still
didn't<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:56.159> always<00:00:57.159> thought<00:00:57.459> that<00:00:57.519> Hamlet<00:00:57.969> was

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
didn't I always thought that Hamlet was

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:59.699 
didn't I always thought that Hamlet was
much<00:00:58.359> more<00:00:58.569> interesting<00:00:59.019> in<00:00:59.139> terms<00:00:59.379> of<00:00:59.559> life

00:00:59.699 --> 00:00:59.709 
much more interesting in terms of life

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:02.250 
much more interesting in terms of life
if<00:01:00.639> it<00:01:00.819> feels<00:01:00.969> awfully<00:01:01.389> cool<00:01:01.510> like<00:01:01.749> question

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
if it feels awfully cool like question

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.569 
if it feels awfully cool like question
meaning<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.769> main<00:01:02.920> character<00:01:03.399> goes

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
meaning that the main character goes

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.130 
meaning that the main character goes
through<00:01:03.609> than<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.180> was<00:01:04.360> necessarily<00:01:04.839> play

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
through than it was necessarily play

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.280 
through than it was necessarily play
about<00:01:05.350> politics<00:01:06.310> per<00:01:06.580> se<00:01:06.820> or<00:01:07.390> just<00:01:07.780> about<00:01:08.020> you

about politics per se or just about you

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
know a particular point in time like I

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.810 
know a particular point in time like I
thought<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.480> was<00:01:10.570> more<00:01:11.490> along<00:01:12.490> instead<00:01:12.730> the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
thought it was more along instead the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.500 
thought it was more along instead the
word<00:01:12.880> Universal<00:01:13.510> because<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.330> was<00:01:16.420> one

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
word Universal because because I was one

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.750 
word Universal because because I was one
of<00:01:16.540> my<00:01:16.660> English<00:01:16.780> lecturers<00:01:17.320> at<00:01:17.440> uni<00:01:17.710> said<00:01:17.920> if

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
of my English lecturers at uni said if

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.000 
of my English lecturers at uni said if
it<00:01:18.910> takes<00:01:19.090> is<00:01:19.240> universal<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:19.960> why<00:01:20.740> is<00:01:20.800> it<00:01:20.920> even

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
it takes is universal and why is it even

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.920 
it takes is universal and why is it even
worth<00:01:21.280> saying<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.700> because<00:01:22.120> like<00:01:22.390> it's<00:01:22.750> always

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
worth saying it because like it's always

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.510 
worth saying it because like it's always
it's<00:01:23.230> already<00:01:23.620> self-evident<00:01:24.160> that<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.280> tense

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
it's already self-evident that the tense

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.890 
it's already self-evident that the tense
of<00:01:24.640> universal<00:01:25.120> if<00:01:25.210> you're<00:01:25.300> talking<00:01:25.450> about<00:01:25.630> it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
of universal if you're talking about it

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.290 
of universal if you're talking about it
and<00:01:26.110> pausing<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:26.980> saying<00:01:27.190> how<00:01:27.850> important

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
and pausing it and saying how important

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.650 
and pausing it and saying how important
it<00:01:28.360> is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
it is

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.150 
it is
so<00:01:30.570> last<00:01:31.570> one<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.930> yeah<00:01:32.140> like<00:01:32.470> in<00:01:32.740> terms<00:01:33.070> of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
so last one is yeah like in terms of

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.310 
so last one is yeah like in terms of
Hamlet<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.640> understood<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.570> more<00:01:34.720> like<00:01:35.050> from

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
Hamlet I understood it more like from

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.810 
Hamlet I understood it more like from
where<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:35.530> was<00:01:35.740> coming<00:01:35.920> from<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:36.460> like<00:01:36.670> to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
where I was coming from I so like to

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.280 
where I was coming from I so like to
think<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.180> more<00:01:37.300> as<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.480> philosophical<00:01:37.840> play

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
think of it more as a philosophical play

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.990 
think of it more as a philosophical play
more<00:01:38.470> than<00:01:38.530> anything<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:39.070> think<00:01:39.550> that<00:01:39.820> that's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
more than anything I think that that's

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.630 
more than anything I think that that's
hard<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.270> argue<00:01:40.450> against<00:01:40.840> but<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:42.100> lot<00:01:42.610> of

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
hard to argue against but a lot of

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.160 
hard to argue against but a lot of
people<00:01:42.970> would<00:01:43.060> sort<00:01:43.210> of<00:01:43.300> look<00:01:43.420> at<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.750> spot

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
people would sort of look at the spot

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.560 
people would sort of look at the spot
notes<00:01:44.409> version<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.860> how<00:01:44.980> or<00:01:45.130> anything<00:01:45.340> oh<00:01:45.640> okay

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
notes version of how or anything oh okay

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.090 
notes version of how or anything oh okay
so<00:01:46.630> it's<00:01:46.870> just<00:01:47.020> about<00:01:47.350> like<00:01:47.530> these<00:01:47.740> power

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
so it's just about like these power

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.190 
so it's just about like these power
struggles<00:01:48.400> leaving<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.300> Danish<00:01:49.900> where

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
struggles leaving the Danish where

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.890 
struggles leaving the Danish where
it's<00:01:50.350> really<00:01:50.590> much<00:01:50.860> more<00:01:51.070> about<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.630> this

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
it's really much more about the this

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.310 
it's really much more about the this
this<00:01:55.900> like

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
this like

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.719 
this like
philosophical<00:01:56.950> line<00:01:57.070> of<00:01:57.220> questioning<00:01:57.610> that

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
philosophical line of questioning that

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.860 
philosophical line of questioning that
the<00:01:57.790> main<00:01:57.909> character<00:01:58.270> goes<00:01:58.420> through<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.840> I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
the main character goes through and I

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.649 
the main character goes through and I
think<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.200> was<00:01:59.610> how<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.640> sort<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.060> tried<00:02:01.540> to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
think that was how I sort of tried to

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.270 
think that was how I sort of tried to
approach<00:02:01.870> it<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.260> for<00:02:02.409> example<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.950> HSC

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
approach it so for example in the HSC

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.610 
approach it so for example in the HSC
when<00:02:03.610> there<00:02:04.150> was<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> question<00:02:04.420> about<00:02:04.720> Hamlet

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
when there was a question about Hamlet

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.669 
when there was a question about Hamlet
is<00:02:05.890> all<00:02:06.010> about<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:07.690> concept<00:02:08.019> of<00:02:08.110> loyalty<00:02:08.530> and

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
is all about the concept of loyalty and

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.319 
is all about the concept of loyalty and
then<00:02:09.190> through<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> lot<00:02:09.549> of<00:02:09.579> people<00:02:09.879> off<00:02:09.939> guard

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
then through a lot of people off guard

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.130 
then through a lot of people off guard
where

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
where

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.530 
where
I<00:02:11.170> thought<00:02:11.940> okay<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.000> I'm<00:02:13.180> going<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.390> talk

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
I thought okay so I'm going to talk

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.290 
I thought okay so I'm going to talk
about<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.950> philosophy<00:02:15.130> aspect<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> play

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
about the philosophy aspect of the play

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.210 
about the philosophy aspect of the play
how<00:02:17.020> can<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.260> sort<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.530> make<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:17.830> into<00:02:18.160> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
how can I sort of make that into the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.949 
how can I sort of make that into the
loyalty<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.760> sort<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.030> thought<00:02:19.209> well<00:02:21.959> if

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
loyalty and I sort of thought well if

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.610 
loyalty and I sort of thought well if
Hamlet's<00:02:23.560> like<00:02:24.550> if<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.880> foundation<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
Hamlet's like if the foundation of the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.380 
Hamlet's like if the foundation of the
Danish<00:02:26.920> Court<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.090> really

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
Danish Court is that like is really

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.470 
Danish Court is that like is really
founded<00:02:28.660> upon<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.320> loyalty<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.480> honesty

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
founded upon like a loyalty and honesty

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.190 
founded upon like a loyalty and honesty
and<00:02:31.840> all<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.230> then<00:02:33.100> when<00:02:33.250> they<00:02:33.370> sort<00:02:33.580> of

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
and all that then when they sort of

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.870 
and all that then when they sort of
crumble<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:35.320> they<00:02:35.440> do<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.709> us<00:02:35.740> as<00:02:36.220> they<00:02:36.610> do<00:02:36.670> at

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
crumble as they do to us as they do at

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.220 
crumble as they do to us as they do at
the<00:02:36.940> start<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.360> play<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.870> that's<00:02:38.020> when

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
the start of the play and that's when

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.110 
the start of the play and that's when
Hamlet<00:02:38.410> starts<00:02:38.770> questioning<00:02:38.950> then<00:02:39.760> how<00:02:39.940> much

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
Hamlet starts questioning then how much

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.460 
Hamlet starts questioning then how much
line<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.450> questioning<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:40.840> really<00:02:41.080> tied<00:02:41.290> in

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
line of questioning is really tied in

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.809 
line of questioning is really tied in
with<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.770> because<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.190> like<00:02:42.310> this

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
with that because it's like this

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.840 
with that because it's like this
foundation<00:02:44.040> upon<00:02:45.040> which<00:02:45.100> everything<00:02:45.550> his

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
foundation upon which everything his

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.220 
foundation upon which everything his
life<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.209> built<00:02:46.330> beforehand<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.050> sort<00:02:47.200> of

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
life was built beforehand is sort of

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.590 
life was built beforehand is sort of
probable<00:02:47.620> at<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.860> swing<00:02:48.239> this<00:02:49.239> line<00:02:49.450> of

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
probable at that swing this line of

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.530 
probable at that swing this line of
questioning<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.050> sort<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.320> went<00:02:50.709> into

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
questioning is sort of went into

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.910 
questioning is sort of went into
perspective<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:53.470> sense

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
perspective that sense

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.330 
perspective that sense
so<00:02:55.080> especially<00:02:56.080> than<00:02:56.680> what<00:02:56.860> you're<00:02:57.040> doing<00:02:57.070> to

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
so especially than what you're doing to

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.060 
so especially than what you're doing to
develop<00:02:58.000> an<00:02:58.120> argument<00:02:58.269> is<00:02:59.050> you're<00:02:59.650> becoming

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
develop an argument is you're becoming

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.509 
develop an argument is you're becoming
extremely<00:03:00.610> familiar<00:03:01.080> with<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.290> text<00:03:02.500> yep<00:03:03.100> and

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
extremely familiar with the text yep and

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.100 
extremely familiar with the text yep and
you're<00:03:03.760> developing<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.420> personal<00:03:04.870> reflection

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
you're developing a personal reflection

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.620 
you're developing a personal reflection
yes<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:06.489> quite<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:06.970> in<00:03:07.090> itself<00:03:07.390> is

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
yes it's quite and that in itself is

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.800 
yes it's quite and that in itself is
what<00:03:07.959> helped<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.100> develop<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.480> sort<00:03:10.720> of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
what helped you develop that sort of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.300 
what helped you develop that sort of
thesis<00:03:11.200> for<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.410> general<00:03:11.739> argument<00:03:12.220> that

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
thesis for that general argument that

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.520 
thesis for that general argument that
you<00:03:12.430> were<00:03:12.610> hoping<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.390> be<00:03:13.570> able<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.900> write<00:03:14.230> and

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
you were hoping to be able to write and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.810 
you were hoping to be able to write and
then<00:03:14.680> yet<00:03:14.830> match<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.280> with<00:03:15.459> your<00:03:15.549> question

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
then yet match that with your question

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.550 
then yet match that with your question
yeah<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:16.060> thought<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:16.930> about<00:03:17.200> finding

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
yeah I thought of it is about finding

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.630 
yeah I thought of it is about finding
your<00:03:17.799> angle<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.400> suppose<00:03:18.790> because<00:03:20.640> agency

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
your angle I suppose because agency

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.680 
your angle I suppose because agency
markers<00:03:21.970> do<00:03:22.090> get<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.299> lot<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.600> those

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
markers do get a lot of those

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.440 
markers do get a lot of those
pre-prepared<00:03:23.430> spikenard<00:03:24.430> type<00:03:24.910> responses

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
pre-prepared spikenard type responses

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.940 
pre-prepared spikenard type responses
and<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.049> think<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.290> way<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.410> avoid<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.799> is

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
and I think the way to avoid that is

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.789 
and I think the way to avoid that is
definitely<00:03:27.720> appreciating<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.840> text<00:03:29.170> in

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
definitely appreciating the text in

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.900 
definitely appreciating the text in
order<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.190> arrive<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.860> definitely<00:03:33.549> as<00:03:33.760> you

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
order to arrive and definitely as you

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.360 
order to arrive and definitely as you
said<00:03:34.060> like<00:03:34.239> they're<00:03:34.420> just<00:03:34.769> not<00:03:35.769> anything<00:03:36.010> it's

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
said like they're just not anything it's

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.800 
said like they're just not anything it's
difficult<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:36.910> explain<00:03:37.120> how<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.600> concrete

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
difficult to explain how in a concrete

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.930 
difficult to explain how in a concrete
way<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.260> does<00:03:38.410> but<00:03:38.620> if<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.920> just<00:03:39.070> know<00:03:39.640> how<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
way it does but if you just know how a

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.580 
way it does but if you just know how a
text<00:03:40.180> works<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.720> how<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.870> characters<00:03:41.410> fit

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
text works and how the characters fit

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.170 
text works and how the characters fit
together<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.070> how<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.310> kernel<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.850> you<00:03:42.970> works

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
together and how the kernel is you works

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.630 
together and how the kernel is you works
and<00:03:43.390> stuff<00:03:43.510> like<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:44.200> stuff<00:03:44.440> like<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.799> it's

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
and stuff like and stuff like that it's

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.660 
and stuff like and stuff like that it's
just<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.209> just<00:03:46.239> gives<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.870> an<00:03:47.110> extra<00:03:47.290> depth<00:03:47.670> to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
just it just gives you an extra depth to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.729 
just it just gives you an extra depth to
your<00:03:48.700> argument<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.079> allows<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.650> to

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
your argument and it just allows you to

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.860 
your argument and it just allows you to
make<00:03:50.860> arguments<00:03:51.220> more<00:03:51.910> easier<00:03:52.239> because<00:03:52.600> if

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
make arguments more easier because if

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.390 
make arguments more easier because if
you're<00:03:52.959> trying<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.230> back<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.709> lot<00:03:54.130> of<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.310> it's

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
you're trying to back a lot of it it's

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.890 
you're trying to back a lot of it it's
about<00:03:54.430> backing<00:03:54.820> up<00:03:55.000> your<00:03:55.150> points<00:03:55.450> as<00:03:55.540> well<00:03:55.690> so

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
about backing up your points as well so

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.090 
about backing up your points as well so
if<00:03:55.989> you<00:03:56.079> never<00:03:56.260> stasis<00:03:56.680> you're<00:03:56.829> gonna<00:03:56.980> have

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
if you never stasis you're gonna have

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.069 
if you never stasis you're gonna have
techniques<00:03:58.030> quotes<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.660> all<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.019> you

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
techniques quotes and all that and you

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.210 
techniques quotes and all that and you
go<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.230> look<00:03:59.410> like<00:03:59.500> sort<00:03:59.739> of<00:03:59.799> put<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.130> all

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
go to look like sort of put it all

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.069 
go to look like sort of put it all
together<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.730> just<00:04:01.329> having<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:01.690> depth<00:04:01.959> of

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
together and just having that depth of

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.590 
together and just having that depth of
knowledge<00:04:02.230> really<00:04:03.000> allows<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.299> do<00:04:04.420> that

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
knowledge really allows you to do that

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.930 
knowledge really allows you to do that
in<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.870> way<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.440> can't<00:04:06.070> really<00:04:06.190> explain<00:04:06.340> but

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
in a way that I can't really explain but

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.770 
in a way that I can't really explain but
it<00:04:07.150> just<00:04:07.359> does<00:04:08.190> make<00:04:09.190> sense<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.850> so<00:04:10.209> the

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
it just does make sense and so the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.000 
it just does make sense and so the
minutes<00:04:11.049> of<00:04:11.230> thesis<00:04:11.590> we're<00:04:11.739> going<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:11.920> talk

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
minutes of thesis we're going to talk

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.430 
minutes of thesis we're going to talk
about<00:04:12.070> how<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.400> get<00:04:12.640> yeah

faces how do you sort of construct your

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.710 
faces how do you sort of construct your
SME<00:04:16.890> wasn't<00:04:17.280> pulling<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.420> lot<00:04:18.510> of<00:04:18.570> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
certain formulas that students use to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.570 
certain formulas that students use to
construct<00:04:25.260> paragraph<00:04:25.890> did<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.190> use<00:04:26.370> one

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
construct paragraph did you use one

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.870 
construct paragraph did you use one
yourself<00:04:26.730> I<00:04:28.280> mean<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:31.680> depends<00:04:32.310> what<00:04:32.550> level<00:04:32.850> of

yourself I mean it depends what level of

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.190 
yourself I mean it depends what level of
English<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.420> feel<00:04:33.630> you're<00:04:33.810> at<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.140> how

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
lot of people do find it easier just to

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.920 
lot of people do find it easier just to
think<00:04:37.890> of<00:04:38.100> in<00:04:38.340> terms<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.540> I've<00:04:39.630> got<00:04:39.810> my

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
think of in terms of so I've got my

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.470 
think of in terms of so I've got my
introduction<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.980> have<00:04:41.640> like<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:42.030> general

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
introduction I have like a general

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.510 
introduction I have like a general
statement<00:04:42.780> which<00:04:43.380> introduces<00:04:43.800> my<00:04:44.040> argument

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
statement which introduces my argument

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.850 
statement which introduces my argument
then<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.060> sort<00:04:45.420> of<00:04:45.510> least<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.350> arguments<00:04:46.800> I'm

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
then I sort of least the arguments I'm

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.280 
then I sort of least the arguments I'm
going<00:04:47.010> to<00:04:47.070> make<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:48.420> then<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:48.990> say<00:04:49.140> the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
going to make and I and then I say the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.810 
going to make and I and then I say the
conclusion<00:04:49.680> we're<00:04:49.830> going<00:04:49.980> to<00:04:50.040> make<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.370> then

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
conclusion we're going to make and then

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.940 
conclusion we're going to make and then
I<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.000> know<00:04:51.210> it's<00:04:51.480> topic<00:04:51.810> sentence<00:04:52.230> point

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
I you know it's topic sentence point

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.190 
I you know it's topic sentence point
point<00:04:53.340> point<00:04:53.720> conclusion<00:04:54.720> for<00:04:54.900> each<00:04:54.960> that

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
point point conclusion for each that

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.240 
point point conclusion for each that
many<00:04:56.070> paragraphs<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.180> body<00:04:57.920> but<00:04:58.920> I<00:04:58.980> think

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
many paragraphs in the body but I think

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.860 
many paragraphs in the body but I think
that's<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.460> really<00:04:59.640> useful<00:04:59.880> type<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.450> scaffold

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
that's a really useful type of scaffold

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.250 
that's a really useful type of scaffold
to<00:05:00.960> use<00:05:01.230> for<00:05:01.500> what's<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.740> students<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:03.300> think

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
to use for what's the students I think

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.070 
to use for what's the students I think
that<00:05:04.500> once<00:05:04.950> you<00:05:05.150> practice<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.540> more<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:06.900> more

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
that once you practice it more and more

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.890 
that once you practice it more and more
you<00:05:07.830> can<00:05:07.860> sort<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.760> allow<00:05:09.180> your<00:05:09.420> essay<00:05:09.690> writing

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
you can sort of allow your essay writing

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.290 
you can sort of allow your essay writing
themselves<00:05:10.200> become<00:05:10.950> more<00:05:11.100> fluid<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.610> think

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
themselves become more fluid I think

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.510 
themselves become more fluid I think
that<00:05:12.540> when<00:05:13.440> you're<00:05:13.590> more<00:05:13.740> comfortable<00:05:14.100> in

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
that when you're more comfortable in

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.580 
that when you're more comfortable in
your<00:05:14.580> own<00:05:14.790> skin<00:05:14.910> as<00:05:15.420> an<00:05:15.630> essay<00:05:15.870> writer<00:05:16.110> you<00:05:16.440> can

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
your own skin as an essay writer you can

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.750 
your own skin as an essay writer you can
sort<00:05:16.860> of<00:05:17.030> tend<00:05:18.030> to<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:19.460> mean<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.520> don't<00:05:20.610> think

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
sort of tend to I mean I don't think

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.250 
sort of tend to I mean I don't think
it's<00:05:20.910> such<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.030> bad<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.630> if<00:05:21.750> you<00:05:21.840> just<00:05:22.020> cut

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
it's such a bad and if you just cut

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.720 
it's such a bad and if you just cut
paragraphs<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:22.890> are<00:05:23.070> sometimes<00:05:23.490> because<00:05:23.669> I

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
paragraphs and are sometimes because I

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.400 
paragraphs and are sometimes because I
don't<00:05:24.360> think<00:05:24.630> mark<00:05:24.780> is<00:05:24.900> always<00:05:25.080> like<00:05:25.380> you

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
don't think mark is always like you

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.680 
don't think mark is always like you
having<00:05:26.340> like<00:05:26.430> page<00:05:26.760> long<00:05:27.090> paragraphs<00:05:27.540> in

having like page long paragraphs in

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.580 
having like page long paragraphs in
stuff<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:28.110> just<00:05:28.260> makes<00:05:28.380> it<00:05:28.470> more

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
stuff and it just makes it more

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.790 
stuff and it just makes it more
manageable<00:05:28.800> for<00:05:29.160> them<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.580> mark<00:05:29.790> but<00:05:30.630> also<00:05:30.800> it

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
manageable for them to mark but also it

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.000 
manageable for them to mark but also it
just<00:05:32.070> makes<00:05:32.250> your<00:05:32.400> essay<00:05:33.320> glow<00:05:34.320> Moss<00:05:34.620> moodily

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.500 
just makes your essay glow Moss moodily
sometimes<00:05:35.430> if<00:05:35.669> you<00:05:35.790> were<00:05:35.880> able<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.150> break<00:05:36.300> it

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
sometimes if you were able to break it

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.650 
sometimes if you were able to break it
up<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.840> think<00:05:37.110> about<00:05:37.380> just<00:05:38.270> in<00:05:39.270> your<00:05:39.390> hand

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
up and think about just in your hand

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.970 
up and think about just in your hand
that<00:05:39.810> I<00:05:39.870> said<00:05:40.080> is<00:05:40.200> to<00:05:40.350> print<00:05:40.530> sometimes

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
that I said is to print sometimes

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.620 
that I said is to print sometimes
basically<00:05:41.640> as<00:05:41.820> opposed<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.240> just<00:05:42.450> like

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
basically as opposed to just like

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.320 
basically as opposed to just like
following<00:05:43.050> this<00:05:43.290> really<00:05:43.650> rigid<00:05:43.950> formula<00:05:44.330> but

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
following this really rigid formula but

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.840 
following this really rigid formula but
the<00:05:45.480> formulas<00:05:45.960> are<00:05:46.020> useful<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.710> in<00:05:47.460> terms<00:05:47.730> of

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
the formulas are useful and in terms of

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:48.590 
the formulas are useful and in terms of
how<00:05:47.970> I<00:05:48.000> read<00:05:48.390> it

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
how I read it

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.260 
how I read it
I<00:05:48.690> mean<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:50.550> really<00:05:50.940> does<00:05:51.210> just<00:05:51.480> depend<00:05:51.780> about

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
I mean it really does just depend about

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.360 
I mean it really does just depend about
what<00:05:54.620> English<00:05:55.620> chocolate<00:05:56.040> we're<00:05:56.160> talking

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
about in particular because I thought I

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.340 
about in particular because I thought I
sort<00:05:58.140> of<00:05:58.200> found<00:05:58.380> that<00:05:59.450> why<00:06:01.400> for<00:06:03.350> belonging

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
sort of found that why for belonging

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.000 
sort of found that why for belonging

cultural patrimony my two texts and

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.059 
cultural patrimony my two texts and
football<00:06:22.199> game<00:06:22.349> particular<00:06:22.619> it's<00:06:22.919> about

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:23.069 
football game particular it's about

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:24.799 
football game particular it's about
being<00:06:23.489> able<00:06:23.579> to<00:06:23.759> integrate<00:06:23.969> away<00:06:24.329> to<00:06:24.389> take<00:06:24.569> so

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:24.809 
being able to integrate away to take so

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:27.679 
being able to integrate away to take so
if<00:06:24.929> you've<00:06:25.019> got<00:06:25.169> your<00:06:26.179> main<00:06:27.179> text<00:06:27.539> in<00:06:27.599> the

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:27.689 
if you've got your main text in the

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.779 
if you've got your main text in the
nursery<00:06:27.959> related<00:06:28.349> text<00:06:28.589> I<00:06:28.919> thought<00:06:29.429> that<00:06:29.669> this

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
nursery related text I thought that this

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.569 
nursery related text I thought that this
applies<00:06:30.119> for<00:06:30.149> I<00:06:30.839> know<00:06:31.769> module<00:06:32.159> C<00:06:32.309> in<00:06:32.459> the

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:32.579 
applies for I know module C in the

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:34.189 
applies for I know module C in the
Advanced<00:06:32.909> Course<00:06:32.969> also<00:06:33.389> has<00:06:33.539> related<00:06:33.839> text

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
Advanced Course also has related text

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.129 
Advanced Course also has related text
and<00:06:34.529> I<00:06:34.619> know<00:06:34.909> that<00:06:35.909> English<00:06:36.719> attention

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
and I know that English attention

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.869 
and I know that English attention
obviously<00:06:37.619> you<00:06:37.739> have<00:06:37.919> to<00:06:37.949> have<00:06:38.069> related<00:06:38.519> texts

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:38.879 
obviously you have to have related texts

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:42.169 
obviously you have to have related texts
so<00:06:39.509> I<00:06:39.539> think<00:06:39.689> it's<00:06:40.019> definitely<00:06:40.939> about<00:06:41.939> being

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:42.179 
so I think it's definitely about being

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:43.489 
so I think it's definitely about being
able<00:06:42.269> to<00:06:42.449> integrate<00:06:42.659> your<00:06:42.989> argument<00:06:43.349> because

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:43.499 
able to integrate your argument because

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:44.659 
able to integrate your argument because
I<00:06:43.559> think<00:06:43.709> a<00:06:43.739> lot<00:06:43.889> of<00:06:43.919> students<00:06:44.249> fall<00:06:44.399> into<00:06:44.579> this

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
I think a lot of students fall into this

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.179 
I think a lot of students fall into this
trap<00:06:44.729> of<00:06:44.969> I'm<00:06:45.929> going<00:06:46.169> to<00:06:46.229> talk<00:06:46.349> about<00:06:46.469> one<00:06:46.739> text

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:47.189 
trap of I'm going to talk about one text

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.489 
trap of I'm going to talk about one text
I'm<00:06:48.149> going<00:06:48.239> to<00:06:48.389> talk<00:06:48.479> about<00:06:48.569> my<00:06:48.749> main<00:06:48.959> text<00:06:49.379> and

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:49.499 
I'm going to talk about my main text and

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:50.959 
I'm going to talk about my main text and
make<00:06:49.589> that<00:06:49.709> a<00:06:49.769> part<00:06:50.009> of<00:06:50.189> my<00:06:50.309> essay<00:06:50.639> and<00:06:50.819> then

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:50.969 
make that a part of my essay and then

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:53.899 
make that a part of my essay and then
just<00:06:51.119> I'd<00:06:51.209> like<00:06:51.360> to<00:06:51.959> 25%<00:06:52.579> sections<00:06:53.579> of<00:06:53.729> life

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909 
just I'd like to 25% sections of life

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:55.939 
just I'd like to 25% sections of life
here<00:06:54.599> is<00:06:54.749> my<00:06:54.899> live<00:06:55.139> related<00:06:55.349> text<00:06:55.649> and<00:06:55.829> he's

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
here is my live related text and he's

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.789 
here is my live related text and he's
the<00:06:56.099> third<00:06:56.249> one<00:06:56.489> but<00:06:56.969> I<00:06:57.179> think<00:06:57.239> it's<00:06:57.599> just<00:06:57.839> it

00:06:58.789 --> 00:06:58.799 
the third one but I think it's just it

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:01.669 
the third one but I think it's just it
really<00:06:59.069> raises<00:06:59.489> it<00:06:59.879> to<00:06:59.909> that<00:07:00.119> a<00:07:00.360> level<00:07:00.989> if

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:01.679 
really raises it to that a level if

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:03.199 
really raises it to that a level if
you're<00:07:01.889> able<00:07:02.039> to<00:07:02.159> integrate<00:07:02.429> your<00:07:02.729> arguments

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:03.209 
you're able to integrate your arguments

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:04.969 
you're able to integrate your arguments
and<00:07:03.329> sort<00:07:03.599> of<00:07:03.659> think<00:07:03.869> about<00:07:04.079> it<00:07:04.259> in<00:07:04.739> a<00:07:04.799> more

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
and sort of think about it in a more

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.100 
and sort of think about it in a more
unified<00:07:05.429> way<00:07:05.639> so<00:07:05.879> think<00:07:06.089> about<00:07:06.179> it<00:07:06.479> and<00:07:06.629> that's

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
unified way so think about it and that's

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.389 
unified way so think about it and that's
how<00:07:07.199> I<00:07:07.259> did<00:07:07.409> it<00:07:07.529> for<00:07:07.709> blowing<00:07:07.889> so<00:07:08.189> I<00:07:08.219> have<00:07:08.369> a

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:08.399 
how I did it for blowing so I have a

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:10.779 
how I did it for blowing so I have a
cinematic<00:07:08.849> expressive<00:07:09.479> culture<00:07:10.169> blowing

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
cinematic expressive culture blowing

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.579 
cinematic expressive culture blowing
cortex<00:07:11.789> to<00:07:12.239> our<00:07:12.389> map<00:07:12.629> and<00:07:12.869> so<00:07:12.959> I<00:07:12.989> can<00:07:13.349> commute

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:13.589 
cortex to our map and so I can commute

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:15.679 
cortex to our map and so I can commute
all<00:07:13.679> together<00:07:13.829> and<00:07:14.519> then<00:07:14.699> like<00:07:14.909> family<00:07:15.539> need

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:15.689 
all together and then like family need

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:17.919 
all together and then like family need
general<00:07:15.959> generationally<00:07:16.860> and<00:07:17.159> then<00:07:17.309> sort<00:07:17.579> of

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:17.929 
general generationally and then sort of

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:20.899 
general generationally and then sort of
my<00:07:18.929> cortex<00:07:19.799> and<00:07:20.039> then<00:07:20.129> the<00:07:20.219> two<00:07:20.369> related<00:07:20.729> text

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:20.909 
my cortex and then the two related text

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:23.329 
my cortex and then the two related text
and<00:07:21.149> so<00:07:21.239> I<00:07:21.299> think<00:07:21.389> that's<00:07:21.659> why<00:07:22.219> choosing<00:07:23.219> your

00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:23.339 
and so I think that's why choosing your

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:25.519 
and so I think that's why choosing your
related<00:07:23.699> text<00:07:23.939> can<00:07:24.059> be<00:07:24.149> really<00:07:24.389> important<00:07:24.869> and

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:25.529 
related text can be really important and

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:26.929 
related text can be really important and
it<00:07:25.679> has<00:07:25.709> to<00:07:26.339> be<00:07:26.369> something<00:07:26.669> that's<00:07:26.729> done

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:26.939 
it has to be something that's done

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:30.860 
it has to be something that's done
really<00:07:27.719> early<00:07:28.110> on<00:07:28.139> in<00:07:28.409> your<00:07:28.439> HSC
