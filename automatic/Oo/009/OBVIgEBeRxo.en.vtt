the match nine tails is going to die
pretty<00:00:56.969> early<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.079> already<00:00:58.379> saw<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
pretty early but I already saw in the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.110 
pretty early but I already saw in the
beginning<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> match<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.670> he<00:00:59.789> didn't

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
beginning of the match that he didn't

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.299 
beginning of the match that he didn't
have<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.300> single<00:01:00.719> Pokemon<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.469> change<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
have a single Pokemon to change the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.219 
have a single Pokemon to change the
weather<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> kind<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.629> figured<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.019> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
weather so I kind of figured that it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
weather so I kind of figured that it
wouldn't<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> waste<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> let<00:01:05.250> him<00:01:05.400> die<00:01:05.580> I'm

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
wouldn't be a waste to let him die I'm

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.969 
wouldn't be a waste to let him die I'm
going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> switch<00:01:06.630> into<00:01:06.750> Venus<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.770> going

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
going to switch into Venus or I'm going

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.039 
going to switch into Venus or I'm going
to<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> growth<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.939> both<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:09.810> attack

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
to go for a growth and both my attack

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.630 
to go for a growth and both my attack
and<00:01:10.260> special<00:01:10.710> attack<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> be

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and special attack are going to be

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.219 
and special attack are going to be
doubled<00:01:12.030> while<00:01:12.240> he's<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> Sun<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.049> that's

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
doubled while he's in the Sun so that's

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
doubled while he's in the Sun so that's
actually<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.680> great<00:01:14.010> move<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.520> Venus<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.000> he

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
actually a great move on Venus or he

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.749 
actually a great move on Venus or he
also<00:01:16.049> gets<00:01:16.409> chlorophyll<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.490> why<00:01:17.670> I'm

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
also gets chlorophyll so that's why I'm

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.910

good pokemon

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.949 
good pokemon
but<00:02:14.459> most<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.910> things<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.240> they<00:02:15.510> do<00:02:15.569> are

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
but most of the things that they do are

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.720 
but most of the things that they do are
like<00:02:16.140> toxic<00:02:16.530> everything<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.340> comes<00:02:17.580> into

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
like toxic everything that comes into

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.120 
like toxic everything that comes into
their<00:02:17.910> way<00:02:18.150> roost<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.290> damage<00:02:19.620> they<00:02:19.830> get

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
their way roost of the damage they get

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.600 
their way roost of the damage they get
and<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:21.239> whirlwind<00:02:21.780> around<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:23.010> that's<00:02:23.459> what

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and just whirlwind around so that's what

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.790 
and just whirlwind around so that's what
I<00:02:23.640> predict<00:02:24.060> predicted<00:02:24.540> toxic<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.110> going<00:02:25.709> to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
I predict predicted toxic and going to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.470 
I predict predicted toxic and going to
my<00:02:25.920> heater<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.430> obviously<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.209> going

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
my heater and obviously it's not going

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.240 
my heater and obviously it's not going
to<00:02:27.599> do<00:02:27.690> anything<00:02:28.020> due<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> immunity<00:02:29.069> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
to do anything due to the immunity and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.640 
to do anything due to the immunity and
he's<00:02:29.880> going<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.270> break<00:02:30.600> my<00:02:30.660> balloon<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.440> with

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
he's going to break my balloon and with

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.890 
he's going to break my balloon and with
a<00:02:31.680> brave<00:02:32.040> bird<00:02:32.340> which<00:02:32.610> wasn't<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.270> bad<00:02:33.600> play

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
a brave bird which wasn't the bad play

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.600 
a brave bird which wasn't the bad play
on<00:02:34.020> his<00:02:34.140> part<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.800> was<00:02:34.920> actually<00:02:35.040> pretty<00:02:35.280> good

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
on his part it was actually pretty good

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.699 
on his part it was actually pretty good
and<00:02:35.850> he<00:02:36.660> switches<00:02:36.930> out<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.410> Garchomp

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
and he switches out it to Garchomp

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.080 
and he switches out it to Garchomp
because<00:02:38.190> he<00:02:38.280> knows<00:02:38.489> he<00:02:38.520> can't<00:02:38.850> stay<00:02:39.060> in

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
because he knows he can't stay in

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.210 
because he knows he can't stay in
against<00:02:39.569> my<00:02:39.690> heatran<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.739> I'm<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.100> go

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
against my heatran so I'm going to go

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.830 
against my heatran so I'm going to go
for<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.459> final<00:02:41.819> blast<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.209> as<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.450> guys<00:02:42.510> saw

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
for a final blast and as you guys saw

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.690 
for a final blast and as you guys saw
that<00:02:43.019> did<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.319> ton<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.830> damage<00:02:44.099> because<00:02:44.670> it's

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that did a ton of damage because it's

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.820 
that did a ton of damage because it's
tab<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.360> because<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.959> Sun<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.590> I'm

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
tab and because it's in the Sun so I'm

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.290 
tab and because it's in the Sun so I'm
going<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.130> switch<00:02:47.370> out<00:02:47.550> into<00:02:47.790> cresselia

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
going to switch out into cresselia

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.520 
going to switch out into cresselia
because<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.720> don't<00:02:48.930> want<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.230> take<00:02:49.380> an

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
because I don't want to take an

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.350 
because I don't want to take an
earthquake<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.130> face<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.610> he<00:02:50.940> decides<00:02:51.269> to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
earthquake to the face and he decides to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.140 
earthquake to the face and he decides to
go<00:02:51.540> for<00:02:51.569> aspects<00:02:52.260> Draco<00:02:52.830> meteor<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.400> that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
go for aspects Draco meteor and that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.640 
go for aspects Draco meteor and that
actually<00:02:54.390> did<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.810> lot<00:02:55.110> because<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.440> was

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
actually did a lot because I was

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.009 
actually did a lot because I was
expecting<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.220> physical<00:02:56.640> move<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.090> because

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
expecting a physical move and because

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.660 
expecting a physical move and because
most<00:02:58.260> garchomps<00:02:58.799> are<00:02:58.890> physical<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.489> that's

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
most garchomps are physical so that's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.400 
most garchomps are physical so that's
another<00:03:00.000> nice<00:03:00.239> novelty<00:03:00.690> sat<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:00.989> his<00:03:01.140> part

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
another nice novelty sat on his part

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.160 
another nice novelty sat on his part
