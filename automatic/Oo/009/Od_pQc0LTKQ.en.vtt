00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.680
 hello friends I'm the moss antibody 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.370
 and I was watching some videos and I found some condorito 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.640
 I saw them and I liked them since I have a large series of magazines and just today 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.579
 we will talk about its history 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.710
 condorito appeared for the first time in the magazine or that today in 1948 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.140
 when pep or he invented it he had in mind to represent the average Chilean a Chilean 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.840
 with a size in the mouth half patiperro working in a thousand and one different things and 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.169
 insists a lot on league with piolita 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.579
 but he's never going to marry her because according to pepo the cartoon would end 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.880
 the truth is that when you invent a character you declare sin never think 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.030
 much in what is going to be what ideology is going to project or what will be its 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.630
 world of relationships 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.230
 condorito was forming as it began to appear in the magazine ok there 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.010
 at the beginning it was much flatter and skinny 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.330
 it was more condor 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.940
 however he lived among humans 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.770
 I think this was the trait that set him apart from the disney characters 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.640
 who live in a world apart from the unreal world 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 Condorito is a landmark roth who lives funny situations in his neighborhood 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.250
 in your chalet in the countryside on the beach or in the high district 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.110
 anywhere 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.690
 I believe that the merit that condorito has is never to get into 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.930
 policy and in service who does not 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.590
 suddenly a series of characters began to populate their world 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.770
 that remain in the cartoon today 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.970
 many of them 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.520
 inspired by the people that pepo knew 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.829
 eating everything for example was a fisherman from the caldera port with a 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.200
 face of a cat that could not and that fed on cats 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.290
 He was a great friend of Pepo and died in 1964 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.150
 the compadre chuma 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.729
 one always has a compadre who in the hard times holds out his hand 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.290
 Don Chuma existed at a time in Pepo's life 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.560
 the washcloth was neither the bride nor the lady of pepo 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.840
 the only thing he took from a relative 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.230
 of his sister-in-law was his name 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.240
 and the broken that's missing now that's a well-known story and quite 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.290
 unpleasant 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.630
 the broken that zada was an official of the military club casino 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.500
 one day he went to eat there with his wife and this man insulted her 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.879
 there was a very embarrassing incident and from that moment he decided to take revenge on him 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.650
 die the broken that was the slogan that persecuted the military until the day of 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.609
 today 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:23.229
 good friends that was the story of condorito already hurt my fingers fuck 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.449
 now the joke of highs 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.429
 which is the height of a mafioso ghost 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.569
 I told the police not to keep me alive 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.129
 hahaha good friends 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.379
