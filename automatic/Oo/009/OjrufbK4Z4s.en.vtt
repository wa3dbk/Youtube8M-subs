00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.590
 Haa 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.800
 Oh 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.800
 Big 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.910
 me 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:19.140
 It runs as usual in monorail Japan, but from the perspective of foreigners 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.369
 It does not seem strange that the train is floating 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.419
 Some wonder if this is the future world 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:32.020
 Below is a blog post introducing overseas reactions 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:36.710
 It is a reaction of the foreigner who saw the monorail which runs in Chiba city this time 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:42.130
 Suspension type Chiba city monorail that opened in 1988 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:46.490
 The total operating distance is 15.2km, which is the longest suspension monorail in the world 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:50.690
 Guinness World Record in 2001 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:55.580
 When including Ozashiki, Japan's longest is Osaka monorail 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:00.710
 Monorail number of small suspended, compared to the parlor even in the world 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:05.830
 Foreigners have responded to the near- future scene 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:11.170
 Because the monorail can respond to a sharp curve , the passing land is very quiet 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:16.240
 It seems that the cost for acquiring the site will be low, so it is suitable for urban areas 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:20.560
 The people of the suspension expression, but I like the construction cost itself increase than the small parlor 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.000
 Suspended, it is not because it has a structure that can respond to a steeper curve 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.800
 It seems that a suspension ceremony was chosen in Chiba City, where there are many Phil 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.200
 Here are some of the videos 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.440
 If you want to see it all, I will put a link in the video description column so I will look from there 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.190
 Please give me 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.190
 Then please 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.460
