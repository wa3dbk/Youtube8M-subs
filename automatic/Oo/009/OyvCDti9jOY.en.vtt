to<00:00:15.599> hopefully<00:00:15.750> show<00:00:15.929> off<00:00:16.320> some<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> red

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
to hopefully show off some of the red

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.510 
to hopefully show off some of the red
paint<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.340> there<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.789> also<00:00:18.690> got<00:00:19.020> some<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.380> these

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
paint in there I also got some of these

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.130 
paint in there I also got some of these
LED<00:00:20.520> lighted<00:00:21.439> acrylic<00:00:22.439> feet<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.609> case

LED lighted acrylic feet for the case
he's<00:00:25.140> supposed<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> put<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> bottom

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
he's supposed to put them on the bottom

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.570 
he's supposed to put them on the bottom
of<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> case<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:27.000> will<00:00:27.180> light<00:00:27.390> up<00:00:27.630> and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
of the case and they will light up and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.919 
of the case and they will light up and
show<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> little<00:00:29.820> red<00:00:30.060> light<00:00:30.269> underneath<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
show a little red light underneath the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.630 
show a little red light underneath the
computer<00:00:31.349> anyway<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.219> little<00:00:32.309> added

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.209 

the<00:00:35.640> fact<00:00:35.969> i<00:00:36.180> guess<00:00:36.559> probably<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.890> worth<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the fact i guess probably not worth the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.560 
the fact i guess probably not worth the
money<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.910> thought<00:00:39.149> we'd<00:00:39.329> give<00:00:39.450> them<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
money but we thought we'd give them a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.380 
money but we thought we'd give them a
try<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:40.079> how<00:00:40.170> hard<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.680> put<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.390> ok

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
try see how hard they are to put in ok

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.209 
try see how hard they are to put in ok
well<00:00:42.690> let's<00:00:43.020> start<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.739> burqa<00:00:44.040> case

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
well let's start here in a burqa case

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.279 
well let's start here in a burqa case
and<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:45.180> where<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.660> find<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.020> spot<00:00:46.260> for

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and see where if we can find a spot for

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.869 
and see where if we can find a spot for
the<00:00:46.530> lights<00:00:48.350> ok<00:00:49.350> we're<00:00:49.559> doing<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.010> feet<00:00:50.610> on

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the lights ok we're doing the feet on

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.830 
the lights ok we're doing the feet on
the<00:00:51.059> case<00:00:51.270> first<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.110> lighted<00:00:52.800> LEDs<00:00:53.840> these

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the case first the lighted LEDs these

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.060 
the case first the lighted LEDs these
come<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.289> double-sided<00:00:55.890> tape<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
come with a double-sided tape that you

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.680 
come with a double-sided tape that you
stick<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> foot<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> sticks

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
stick on to the foot and then it sticks

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.020 
stick on to the foot and then it sticks
onto<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> bottom<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> case<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.190> you're

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
onto the bottom of the case if you're

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.740 
onto the bottom of the case if you're
using<00:01:03.359> antec<00:01:04.350> 900<00:01:05.159> case<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.939> you'll

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
using antec 900 case like this you'll

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.390 
using antec 900 case like this you'll
find<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> feet<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.220> were

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
find out that the feet that were

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.310 
find out that the feet that were
originally<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.299> don't<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.840> any<00:01:10.020> hole

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
originally on it don't have any hole

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.770 
originally on it don't have any hole
through<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> case<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> will<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
through the case so you will have to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
through the case so you will have to
drill<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> hole<00:01:13.200> big<00:01:13.740> enough<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.280> stick<00:01:14.549> these

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
drill a hole big enough to stick these

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.330 
drill a hole big enough to stick these
through<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.320> LED<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.100> come

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
through and then your LED will come

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.630 
through and then your LED will come
through<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.060> top<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> into<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.340> case<00:01:20.340> so

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
through the top of it into the case so

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060 
through the top of it into the case so
you<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.930> drilling<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
you do have to do a little drilling and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.240 
you do have to do a little drilling and
I<00:01:23.520> got<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> Dremel<00:01:24.720> out<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.200> dream<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.070> whole

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
I got the Dremel out to dream the whole

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.760 
I got the Dremel out to dream the whole
a<00:01:26.400> little<00:01:26.820> bit<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:27.990> easier<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.590> stick

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
a little bit make it easier to stick

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.940 
a little bit make it easier to stick
these<00:01:28.979> through

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.039 

we<00:01:32.039> had<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> change<00:01:32.670> our<00:01:32.969> plans<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.719> a<00:01:33.750> little

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
we had to change our plans here a little

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.330 
we had to change our plans here a little
bit<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.909> can't<00:01:36.210> well<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:38.039> of<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
bit you can't well you kind of have to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
bit you can't well you kind of have to
remove<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.789> stock<00:01:39.090> feet<00:01:39.390> or<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> could<00:01:39.960> draw

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
remove the stock feet or you could draw

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.889 
remove the stock feet or you could draw
through<00:01:40.500> them<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.329> install

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
through them to do it but to install

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.950 
through them to do it but to install
these<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> antec<00:01:43.829> 900<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
these in the antec 900 that's going to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
these in the antec 900 that's going to
stick<00:01:46.289> this<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:47.219> knob<00:01:47.429> here<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.880> going

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
stick this little knob here it's going

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
stick this little knob here it's going
to<00:01:48.119> stick<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.509> through<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> case<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> keep

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
to stick up through the case and keep

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.999 
to stick up through the case and keep
you<00:01:50.280> from<00:01:50.460> getting<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.819> power<00:01:51.000> supply<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:52.009> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
you from getting the power supply in so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.789 
you from getting the power supply in so
after<00:01:53.369> sticking<00:01:54.210> them<00:01:54.569> through<00:01:54.869> hot<00:01:55.229> gluing

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
after sticking them through hot gluing

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.870 
after sticking them through hot gluing
everything<00:01:56.539> figuring<00:01:57.539> we're<00:01:57.719> basically<00:01:58.170> done

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
everything figuring we're basically done

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
everything figuring we're basically done
we<00:01:59.880> had<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.270> start<00:02:00.539> all<00:02:00.689> over<00:02:00.750> tear<00:02:01.409> everything

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
we had to start all over tear everything

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.419 
we had to start all over tear everything
back<00:02:02.069> out<00:02:02.840> drill<00:02:03.840> through<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.349> feet<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.890> hot

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
back out drill through the feet I hot

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.509 
back out drill through the feet I hot
glued<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:06.030> back<00:02:06.060> onto<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.750> case<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.340> can

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
glued them back onto the case so we can

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.870 
glued them back onto the case so we can
put<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.789> LEDs<00:02:09.299> on<00:02:09.630> them<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.649> way<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.130> can<00:02:11.340> put

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
put the LEDs on them that way we can put

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.360 
put the LEDs on them that way we can put
the<00:02:12.000> LEDs<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.079> stick<00:02:13.319> them<00:02:13.530> up<00:02:13.739> into<00:02:13.950> here

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the LEDs on and stick them up into here

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.509 
the LEDs on and stick them up into here
so<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.239> they<00:02:15.360> won't<00:02:15.540> extend<00:02:16.049> into<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.890> case

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
so that they won't extend into the case

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.390 
so that they won't extend into the case
and<00:02:17.849> get<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.209> way<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.540> power<00:02:18.780> supply

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
and get in the way of the power supply

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.130 
and get in the way of the power supply
so<00:02:20.400> hopefully<00:02:21.329> we're<00:02:21.510> only<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.720> few<00:02:21.930> minutes

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
so hopefully we're only a few minutes

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.120 
so hopefully we're only a few minutes
away<00:02:22.410> from<00:02:23.959> getting<00:02:24.959> these<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.799> we<00:02:25.920> can<00:02:26.010> get

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
away from getting these on so we can get

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.940 
away from getting these on so we can get
to<00:02:26.250> working<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.170> red<00:02:28.170> light<00:02:28.410> seven<00:02:28.829> stone

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
to working on the red light seven stone

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.240 
to working on the red light seven stone
okay<00:02:31.950> where<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:33.000> got<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.299> feed<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.810> case

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
okay where we got the feed on the case

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.250 
okay where we got the feed on the case
the<00:02:35.250> clear<00:02:35.640> acrylics<00:02:36.150> are<00:02:37.010> all<00:02:38.010> wired<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:39.260> we

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
the clear acrylics are all wired in we

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.120 
the clear acrylics are all wired in we
put<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.730> cold<00:02:41.730> cathodes<00:02:42.269> in<00:02:43.109> here's<00:02:43.769> one

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
put the cold cathodes in here's one

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.150 
put the cold cathodes in here's one
12-inch<00:02:44.700> run<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.060> along<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.540> rail<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.980> I

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
12-inch run it along this rail and I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.220 
12-inch run it along this rail and I
also<00:02:47.340> put<00:02:47.700> another<00:02:47.910> 12<00:02:48.299> inch<00:02:48.540> up<00:02:48.750> around<00:02:49.019> this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
also put another 12 inch up around this

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.710 
also put another 12 inch up around this
top<00:02:49.560> rail<00:02:50.100> kind<00:02:50.609> of<00:02:50.700> tuck<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.389> there

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
top rail kind of tuck it up in there

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.470 
top rail kind of tuck it up in there
I'll<00:02:52.960> powers<00:02:53.890> are<00:02:54.160> hooked<00:02:54.460> up<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.910> wired<00:02:55.150> in

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
I'll powers are hooked up and wired in

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.290 
I'll powers are hooked up and wired in
on<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.680> back<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.190> case<00:02:57.460> here<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.120> see

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
on the back of the case here you can see

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.810 
on the back of the case here you can see
the<00:02:58.450> two<00:02:58.630> different<00:02:58.960> switches<00:02:59.500> this<00:03:00.250> one<00:03:00.520> here

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
the two different switches this one here

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.840 
the two different switches this one here
is<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.800> feet<00:03:02.800> if<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.190> want<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.460> turn<00:03:03.580> them<00:03:03.760> on

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
is the feet if you want to turn them on

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.650 
is the feet if you want to turn them on
or<00:03:03.910> off<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:06.460> other<00:03:06.580> little<00:03:06.850> one<00:03:07.120> here<00:03:07.390> those

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
or off the other little one here those

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.140 
or off the other little one here those
are<00:03:07.690> for<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.110> cold<00:03:08.320> cathodes<00:03:09.150> this

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
are for the cold cathodes this

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.980 
are for the cold cathodes this
particular<00:03:10.690> lights<00:03:11.020> come<00:03:11.410> with<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:12.990> controller

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
particular lights come with a controller

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.040 
particular lights come with a controller
that<00:03:14.200> can<00:03:14.620> actually<00:03:14.980> control<00:03:15.370> two<00:03:15.640> lights<00:03:16.050> so

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
that can actually control two lights so

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.360 
that can actually control two lights so
I<00:03:17.080> only<00:03:17.260> needed<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.680> what<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.130> one

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
I only needed to what you is one

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.460 
I only needed to what you is one
controller<00:03:18.850> but<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.750> actually<00:03:19.960> get<00:03:20.440> a

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
controller but you actually get a

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.820 
controller but you actually get a
controller<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.610> switch<00:03:22.000> with<00:03:22.300> each<00:03:22.450> life

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
controller and a switch with each life

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.500 
controller and a switch with each life
so<00:03:23.830> if<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.100> person<00:03:24.520> wanted<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.970> hook<00:03:25.060> up<00:03:25.240> two

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
so if a person wanted to hook up two

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.410 
so if a person wanted to hook up two
different<00:03:25.870> colors<00:03:26.290> or<00:03:26.860> maybe<00:03:27.490> switch<00:03:28.090> back

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
different colors or maybe switch back

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.030 
different colors or maybe switch back
and<00:03:28.450> forth<00:03:28.690> between<00:03:29.050> colors<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.890> can

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
and forth between colors you can

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.380 
and forth between colors you can
certainly<00:03:30.250> use<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.640> extra<00:03:31.120> switches<00:03:31.830> but

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
certainly use the extra switches but

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.870 
certainly use the extra switches but
we're<00:03:34.390> ready<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.600> put<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.870> covers<00:03:35.200> on<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.880> go

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
we're ready to put the covers on and go

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.090 
we're ready to put the covers on and go
plug<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.150> thing<00:03:37.360> in<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.020> see<00:03:38.440> if<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.800> lights

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
plug this thing in and see if the lights

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.699 
plug this thing in and see if the lights
over<00:03:42.660> okay<00:03:43.660> we<00:03:43.870> got<00:03:44.020> everything<00:03:44.350> hooked<00:03:44.470> up

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
over okay we got everything hooked up

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.860 
over okay we got everything hooked up
and<00:03:44.920> running<00:03:45.250> before<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.270> show<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.690> lights
