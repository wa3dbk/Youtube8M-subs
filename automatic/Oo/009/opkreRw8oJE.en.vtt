xbox live subscription and I could see

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.280 
xbox live subscription and I could see
in<00:00:44.580> a<00:00:44.610> sense<00:00:44.910> why<00:00:45.300> they<00:00:45.540> would<00:00:45.660> charge<00:00:45.840> people

in a sense why they would charge people
that<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:47.190> i<00:00:47.220> think<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:47.940> about<00:00:48.060> sign<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that but i think it's about sign of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.720 
that but i think it's about sign of
 because<00:00:49.740> why<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.280> i<00:00:50.310> say<00:00:50.550> here

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
 because why would i say here

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.810 
 because why would i say here
