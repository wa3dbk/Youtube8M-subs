00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.750 
I think Emirates is there a malicious
doing<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.620> well<00:04:14.629> in<00:04:15.629> term<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.579> business<00:04:17.579> I

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
doing so well in term of business I

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.819 
doing so well in term of business I
think<00:04:17.850> they<00:04:18.090> will<00:04:18.239> see<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.690> downturn<00:04:19.260> in<00:04:19.530> term

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
think they will see a downturn in term

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.180 
think they will see a downturn in term
of<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:21.000> mean<00:04:21.780> we<00:04:21.959> talk<00:04:22.169> if<00:04:22.350> we<00:04:22.500> talkin<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.039> mean

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
of I mean we talk if we talkin I mean

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.640 
of I mean we talk if we talkin I mean
with<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.970> growth<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.389> mean<00:04:24.539> at<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.840> airport<00:04:25.320> I

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
with the growth I mean at the airport I

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.460 
with the growth I mean at the airport I
think<00:04:26.100> we<00:04:26.280> but<00:04:26.669> where<00:04:26.940> we<00:04:27.180> are<00:04:27.330> at<00:04:27.690> December

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
think we but where we are at December

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.250 
think we but where we are at December
now<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.430> we<00:04:29.580> should<00:04:29.639> see<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.260> double-digit

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
now and we should see a double-digit

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.740 
now and we should see a double-digit
growth<00:04:31.650> within<00:04:32.099> the<00:04:32.250> Emirates<00:04:32.760> or<00:04:33.389> the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
growth within the Emirates or the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.200 
growth within the Emirates or the
airport<00:04:34.260> growth<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:35.310> mean<00:04:35.490> maybe<00:04:35.669> we<00:04:35.789> will<00:04:36.000> not

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
airport growth I mean maybe we will not

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.120 
airport growth I mean maybe we will not
achieve<00:04:36.419> what<00:04:36.840> we<00:04:37.050> did<00:04:37.260> last<00:04:37.500> year<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:38.039> think

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
achieve what we did last year I think

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.540 
achieve what we did last year I think
the<00:04:38.400> last<00:04:38.699> year<00:04:39.030> or<00:04:39.240> two<00:04:39.599> or<00:04:39.810> seven<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:41.460> know
