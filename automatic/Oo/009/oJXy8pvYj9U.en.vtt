00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
pan around with it I ended up cutting us

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.350 
pan around with it I ended up cutting us
out<00:02:07.320> because<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.250> wanted<00:02:08.520> more<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> fast

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
out because they wanted more just a fast

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.100

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
cut sort of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.130 
cut sort of
video<00:02:11.860> treatment<00:02:12.820> here<00:02:13.120> but<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.690> will<00:02:13.840> say<00:02:13.990> that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
video treatment here but I will say that

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.910 
video treatment here but I will say that
it<00:02:14.200> was<00:02:14.230> very<00:02:14.560> smooth<00:02:14.890> very<00:02:15.580> responsive

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it was very smooth very responsive

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.230 
it was very smooth very responsive
really<00:02:17.920> almost<00:02:18.250> as<00:02:18.400> good<00:02:18.520> as<00:02:18.640> my<00:02:18.760> man<00:02:18.940> Fredo

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
really almost as good as my man Fredo

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.920 
really almost as good as my man Fredo
bogan<00:02:19.870> as<00:02:20.650> far<00:02:20.920> as<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.130> motion<00:02:21.550> goes<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:22.720> took

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
bogan as far as the motion goes you took

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.210 
bogan as far as the motion goes you took
a<00:02:22.960> little<00:02:23.140> bit<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.350> getting<00:02:23.500> used<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:24.070> the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
a little bit of getting used to just the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.370 
a little bit of getting used to just the
way<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.970> know<00:02:25.060> you're<00:02:25.270> just<00:02:25.630> things<00:02:25.930> on<00:02:26.200> it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
way you know you're just things on it

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.800 
way you know you're just things on it
but<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> very<00:02:27.640> excellent<00:02:28.180> little<00:02:28.510> tripod

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
but it is a very excellent little tripod

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.410 
but it is a very excellent little tripod
for<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.290> hundred<00:02:29.560> fifty<00:02:29.890> bucks<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.700> think<00:02:31.180> I

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
for a hundred fifty bucks I think I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.150 
for a hundred fifty bucks I think I
might<00:02:31.570> have<00:02:31.660> said<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:31.900> it's<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.530> third<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
might have said that it's a third the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.340 
might have said that it's a third the
weight<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.550> my<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.630> reveille<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.290> the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
weight of my of the reveille and the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.020 
weight of my of the reveille and the
Manfrotto<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.160> probably<00:02:36.520> more<00:02:36.610> like<00:02:36.760> half

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
Manfrotto it's probably more like half

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.930 
Manfrotto it's probably more like half
that<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.830> will<00:02:38.980> say<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.700> is

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
that and but I will say this it is

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.730 
that and but I will say this it is
functions<00:02:40.480> really<00:02:40.660> good<00:02:40.990> for<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.380> kind<00:02:41.590> of

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
functions really good for this kind of

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.470 
functions really good for this kind of
thing<00:02:41.890> I'm<00:02:42.010> doing<00:02:42.250> here<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.700> think<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.209> would<00:02:43.330> do

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
thing I'm doing here I think it would do

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.220 
thing I'm doing here I think it would do
great

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
great

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.810 
great

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.680 
that do show a lot more painting and you
know<00:03:05.320> tilting<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:07.000> but<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.360> can<00:03:07.510> tell<00:03:07.630> you

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690

know tilting and but I can tell you
right<00:03:07.810> now<00:03:07.989> just<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.800> bit<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.310> did<00:03:09.550> do<00:03:09.790> it

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
right now just the bit that I did do it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.710 
right now just the bit that I did do it
feels<00:03:10.750> good<00:03:10.989> it's<00:03:11.560> not<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:13.030> doesn't<00:03:13.360> lock<00:03:13.660> up

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
feels good it's not it doesn't lock up

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.110 
feels good it's not it doesn't lock up
it<00:03:14.260> does<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:14.650> no<00:03:14.830> jerkiness<00:03:15.280> at<00:03:15.519> all<00:03:15.670> -<00:03:15.910> it's

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
it does it's no jerkiness at all - it's

to<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.860> tripod<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.730> think<00:03:22.000> you'll<00:03:22.120> really

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
to this tripod I think you'll really

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.240 
to this tripod I think you'll really
like<00:03:22.510> it

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
like it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.650 
like it
you<00:03:24.250> know<00:03:24.340> maybe<00:03:24.580> better<00:03:24.880> options<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.480> don't

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
you know maybe better options I don't

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.880 
you know maybe better options I don't
know<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:25.989> this<00:03:26.140> one<00:03:26.350> looks<00:03:26.380> like<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> good

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
know but this one looks like a good

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.039 
know but this one looks like a good
lightweight<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.640> me<00:03:27.730> I'm<00:03:27.910> glad<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.720> was

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
lightweight for me I'm glad that I was

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.229 
lightweight for me I'm glad that I was
kind<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.470> turned<00:03:29.650> on<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.250> by<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.549> people<00:03:31.120> at
