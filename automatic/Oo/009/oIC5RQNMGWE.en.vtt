00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.170
 I do not remember the name of this 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.880
 videogame well I'm here in this 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.610
 strange weird video game and today I come to 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.470
 tell you to explain for the second time 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.300
 the day since you have given 75 likes and 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.550
 I'm very grateful for that, so 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.309
 I'm going to open a new quote 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.769
 section in quotes as paragraph 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.100
 you want to call it a new quote 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.410
 type of video every Thursday rather every 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.010
 day I upload a snapshot in which you 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.879
 I will explain and I will mention the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.070
 majority for all those who 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.239
 cactus want depends depends on 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.689
 all of the cactus 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.180
 all the books or I will explain 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.100
 the 'bous that have been generated and those that 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.990
 they have arranged because of course you 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.270
 you'll be fed up with putting book pixel 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.280
 but but he has a reason in the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.070
 bojan are lazy but they do some 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.340
 work something they do so first thing 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.020
 what am I going to say before the bulls are 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.729
 a few things that 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.770
 they have put new ones and that I do not 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.350
 they mention the previous video one is that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.439
 the signs now when the Castilian 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.270
 they give you three and you can stake the 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.170
 in groups of 16 for example it does not let me 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.950
 put these on 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.710
 come click but come from jane not me 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.430
 they definitely leave 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.070
 so a two and three thanks to a 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.050
 stick and six blocks of refined wood 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.050
 great another thing that I want 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:06.090
 tell you is that 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:11.230
 now you see it now you do not see it basically 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.670
 what good did not want that now you see 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.210
 now 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:22.060
 now you do not see it great you see 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.910
 what I want to teach with this is a 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.920
 new bus that has been generated have 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.740
 arranged that you wrote has not 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.840
 appeared to nothing but is not at all 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.760
 arranged because once you go out you see 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.190
 3 and now that you do not see that is now 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.330
 you see now you do not see it I go out I go back to 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.330
 enter and 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.140
 before you saw it and now you do not see it and 3 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.660
 from here it has disappeared 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.050
 Well, this would be the only bus that 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.110
 there is right now that it is known that 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.050
 generated with this snapshot and now we're going 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.180
 with the buses that have fixed one is that 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.610
 with the I am destroying all the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.950
 cactus is an apology but this is not 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.160
 it can stay like this this can not be left 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.160
 A) Yes 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.599
 all right 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.230
 we followed one of the buses that had 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:18.440
 generated previously were that not 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.920
 colorful races were not 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.990
 they will not be fireproof now as you see 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.990
 said that as you see that bad 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.459
 Well, when they feel like it, 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.230
 burn or this is totally because 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.060
 the stairs now think then 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.130
 they can good what 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.140
 Now they think of when they please 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.020
 burn and when you see here it is 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.380
 finished one and this one but mother of God 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.140
 is on the invincible mother ladder of 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.580
 god this ladder is I have not destroyed the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.580
 block no 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.060
 well, other changes that 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.270
 of the buses that they have arranged is that 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.560
 before when I drank is a potion you 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.800
 there was the 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.750
 the empty bottle but I could continue 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.739
 drinking and had the effect of the potion 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.170
 Thomas now has the effect this time 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.639
 has been speed two and one of the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.850
 changes forgot to mention before 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.820
 is when you give the effect appears 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.770
 wow of the best things that have to 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.810
 have added so far in in minecraft 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.350
 it's good to describe it changes you totally 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.510
 the game and well I do not believe it and 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.250
 It also moves the menu to the 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:44.900
 right is something amazing and nothing a 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:47.030
 Burrada de dos is another of the few 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.490
 who have talked very important since 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.819
 I had uploaded all the videos to my channel 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.990
 You can search for them on my channel and 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.669
 put pus of the cw 26 and that could generate 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.580
 blocks and you could make the orange in the 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.430
 instant word and an orange wheat 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.780
 instantaneous now that does not work anymore and 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:14.009
 they have also arranged a bus with a gift 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:16.500
 don don don pistÃ³n sticky and with a 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:19.860
 normal piston a lot and now these two 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.699
 Gentlemen, they no longer generate a bus 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.670
 they used to do some super cool things 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.980
 it doubled 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.450
 it was duplicated to this part now clear 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.970
 Now I can not prove it as much as 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.700
 I can is to prove it really this 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.610
 part was duplicated and came back here 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.680
 this part repeated here and you could 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.600
 duplicate pistons although I could not 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.790
 pick up since when applied 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:49.420
 they disappeared but basically that was it 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.820
 and ladies and gentlemen, I would say there is no 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.850
 much more than telling you these are the 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:58.240
 major bus remarkable because then already 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.790
 you know that way is that when I total code 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.230
 and such talking about codes 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.230
 the bar command here works again 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:12.460
 hoyts that loud like it hurt respawn 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.240
 well get me through this hole walk I'm going to 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.930
 catch this 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:21.830
 and I'm going to come here myself and I'm going to 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:25.759
 follow the video here next to the 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:29.090
 coal and the command also turns to 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:31.580
 work because there was a wizard before 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.490
 I know what stories are told in the 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.160
 of moya or anything I hope that I have 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.289
 liked the tutorial of how to investigate 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.130
 this cave and in the end we have not 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:44.960
 found more than coal and iron but 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.659
 but good in the next episode of 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.580
 looking at the random mine we will find 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.400
 much more materials I hope that I have 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:56.349
 liked the bucs that have been fixed 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:00.949
 the 12 w 27 to give it a like down there 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:04.780
 subscribe to my channel and nothing that god 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:04.780
 I'll pay you to another
