miserable<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> grass<00:00:26.939> makes<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.599> quite<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
miserable so the grass makes it quite a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.810 
miserable so the grass makes it quite a
tricky<00:00:28.019> shot<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.529> picked<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.099> tough<00:00:29.580> flag

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
position for me as well here

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.569 
position for me as well here
but<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> does<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> feels<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.160> nice<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> mean

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
these shots around the green greeting

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900 
these shots around the green greeting
are<00:00:34.079> tricky<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> mentioned<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> grooves

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
are tricky but you mentioned the grooves

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.220 
are tricky but you mentioned the grooves
there<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.450> really<00:00:36.660> feel<00:00:36.989> them

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
there and you can really feel them

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
there and you can really feel them
working<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.770> maximum<00:00:38.219> effect<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.610> grabbing

hold<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> ball<00:00:39.360> definitely<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:39.870> now

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
hold of the ball definitely what now

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.240 
hold of the ball definitely what now
you've<00:00:40.170> done<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.559> they're<00:00:40.770> basically<00:00:41.040> put

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
you've done here they're basically put

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.500 
you've done here they're basically put
more<00:00:41.430> grooves<00:00:41.640> across<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> face<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:42.360> put<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
more grooves across the face they put a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
more grooves across the face they put a
new<00:00:42.660> pattern<00:00:42.930> across<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> face<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.670> can

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
new pattern across the face so you can

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.979 
new pattern across the face so you can
get<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.180> spin<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:45.870> more

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
get more spin on it you're more

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.330 
get more spin on it you're more
controlling<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:46.980> see<00:00:47.160> there

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
controlling it so as you can see there

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.709 
controlling it so as you can see there
Sarah's<00:00:47.760> showing<00:00:47.969> her<00:00:48.059> skills<00:00:48.329> here

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
Sarah's showing her skills here

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.630 
Sarah's showing her skills here
it's<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.379> how<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.950> control<00:00:50.430> she's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it's just how good of control she's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
it's just how good of control she's
getting<00:00:50.850> around<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> green<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> so

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
getting around the green with it so

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.930 
getting around the green with it so
that's<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:51.899> another<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.469> pressure

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
that's some another one but it pressure

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.459 
that's some another one but it pressure
it<00:00:53.940> does<00:00:54.000> feel<00:00:54.420> really<00:00:54.449> nice<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.140> as

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it does feel really nice and I think as

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
it does feel really nice and I think as
well<00:00:57.260> it's<00:00:58.260> ready<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> elevation<00:00:59.070> but

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
well it's ready to get the elevation but

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.920 
well it's ready to get the elevation but
also<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> weight<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> think<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.539> these<00:01:00.660> shots

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
also the weight I think on these shots

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.360 
also the weight I think on these shots
around<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> green<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.530> simply<00:01:01.829> find<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.250> my

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
around the green I simply find for my

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
around the green I simply find for my
level<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> weights<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:04.170> important

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
level that the weights really important

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
level that the weights really important
it<00:01:04.769> does<00:01:04.920> feel<00:01:05.129> quite<00:01:05.369> heavy<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.720> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it does feel quite heavy and I like that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
it does feel quite heavy and I like that
you<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:07.680> feels<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.520> know

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610

now<00:02:27.090> what<00:02:28.050> we<00:02:28.140> thoughts<00:02:28.350> good<00:02:30.110> out<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
now what we thoughts good out of the

now what we thoughts good out of the
bunker<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.620> thought<00:02:31.800> they<00:02:31.860> were<00:02:31.920> fantastic<00:02:32.490> and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
bunker I thought they were fantastic and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.310 
bunker I thought they were fantastic and
also<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.090> tight<00:02:33.300> lies<00:02:33.570> around<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.080> green<00:02:34.290> I

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
also the tight lies around the green I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.780 
also the tight lies around the green I
think<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:34.709> mentioned<00:02:34.860> with<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.160> grooves<00:02:35.489> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
think we mentioned with the grooves the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.060 
think we mentioned with the grooves the
contact<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.720> sort<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.959> really<00:02:37.650> sort<00:02:37.769> of<00:02:37.830> grip

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
contact that sort of really sort of grip

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.259 
contact that sort of really sort of grip
you<00:02:38.220> get<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.670> ball<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:38.880> thought<00:02:39.120> was

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
you get on the ball I thought was

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.759 
you get on the ball I thought was
