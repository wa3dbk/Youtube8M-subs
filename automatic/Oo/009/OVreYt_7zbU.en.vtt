let me click on show now you can see on
this<00:02:14.750> particular<00:02:15.349> picture<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:16.430> we<00:02:16.879> have

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
this particular picture that we have

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.020 
this particular picture that we have
dimensions<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.870> 900<00:02:18.379> x<00:02:18.500> 300<00:02:19.099> so<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.849> pretty

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
dimensions of 900 x 300 so it's a pretty

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.540 
dimensions of 900 x 300 so it's a pretty
wide<00:02:20.440> pitcher<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.680> narrow<00:02:22.129> so<00:02:22.400> that's

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
wide pitcher and narrow so that's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.300 
wide pitcher and narrow so that's
typical<00:02:23.300> for<00:02:23.330> slider<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:24.530> will<00:02:24.680> find<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.160> if

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
so if I clicked on it would pop up and

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.940 
so if I clicked on it would pop up and
it<00:03:28.819> would<00:03:28.910> be<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.090> large<00:03:29.359> be<00:03:30.079> just<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.560> picture
