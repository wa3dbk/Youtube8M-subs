00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.300
 all the time if they come back to 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 another law of today's recipe and the kitchen 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.859
 today we are going to learn to do our 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.859
 Own mascarpone cheese in a way 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.750
 homemade that is super easy and with the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.480
 mark puts so we can do a lot 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.060
 of desserts a lactose-free dessert like 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.760
 for example this tiramisu that we learned 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.740
 to do quite some time left 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.110
 delicious is also in the way of doing 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.170
 another kind of cake a lot of things 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.680
 go see what is super easy and good and 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.080
 you compare me 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.040
 to make our mascarpone cheese 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.230
 home without lactose we will use 500 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.980
 milliliters of cream to assemble without 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:56.480
 lactose with at least 35% of matter 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:59.239
 fat and 30 milliliters of lemon juice 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.790
 in a jug or in a bowl add the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.610
 half a liter of cream without lactose and 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.300
 On the other hand , we are going to squeeze the juice from 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.700
 half lemon because we want to get 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.960
 about 30 milliliters we are going to do it 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.610
 over a colander for here 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 do not drop any nugget 30 milliliters 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.979
 Equals about 3 tablespoons 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.460
 Tenth now as it incorporates the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.450
 30 milliliters of lemon juice at 500 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.450
 milliliters of cream 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.090
 now it's about removing 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:46.190
 until the note is cut as you see 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:49.020
 has already picked up a texture immediately 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.369
 and much denser the pantry 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.719
 work is being cut and that's what 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.360
 about 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.850
 we have to cut it to separate the acid 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.899
 lactic fat that would be 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.899
 our weight 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.340
 we add a little of salt 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.909
 if we keep stirring 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.670
 Now in a bowl we place a colander 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.880
 as big as possible 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.650
 and we are going to place the garments with gauze 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.280
 purposes that we can find in 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.280
 pharmacy 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.630
 the extend 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.820
 we put them here we do this for 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.820
 when we throw from the cheese 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.680
 to be able to strain in the city the boys 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.150
 and they are left 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.709
 with the fat 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.709
 and now we are going to add 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.130
 our cheese cream 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.130
 to the colander 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.620
 it was simply covered with the dough 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.519
 As you can see, you are beginning to discover 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.129
 fill the lactic soil of the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.130
 night and now simply on the other 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:36.950
 He has left us 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.950
 at least 24 hours in the fridge 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.659
 to drain all the acid from the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.659
 milk lactic acid 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.480
 and as I said can now simply 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.400
 we have to let our cheese rest 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.800
 draining the lactic acid into the idea 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.590
 We will leave it at least 24 hours 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.240
 between 1 or 2 days and then tomorrow 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.240
 we will see how we have been 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.769
 They have spent 24 hours a little more and 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.209
 let's take out our mascarpone cheese 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.209
 of the refrigerator 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.780
 As you see, it has loosened the entire floor 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.780
 lactic 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.479
 all the ground and now what we have left 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.479
 above we will check 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.390
 and the result as you can see is a cheese 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.390
 creamy 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.840
 with this texture 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.949
