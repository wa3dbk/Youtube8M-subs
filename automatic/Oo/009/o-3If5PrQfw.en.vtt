00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079
 i 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.990
 to our talent path to open today 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.380
 this carinao talent like the dog of 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.380
 ally 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.100
 or 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.100
 we saw a little bit the amount of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.290
 things you can do with English 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.330
 today they bring us more pirouettes we can say 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.340
 skills are all three parts 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.660
 the things that the good big headed me 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.949
 also some practical things of 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.030
 now we're going to ask that greets 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.030
 public since you greet the guys 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.820
 very well 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.830
 very good is a very polite dog 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.810
 so now we're going to do something that 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.810
 he does it before eating yes yes 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.940
 Strawberry 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.300
 remaining of a quite powerful dog 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.300
 and some things are embarrassing 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.890
 also also do some things 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.140
 useful as I told you if for example I 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.469
 I come to the supermarket and I come with many 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.469
 bags 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.670
 I close the door 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.290
 and also comes the morning to read the 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.319
 daily we are at home very cultured to their 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.909
 children and sometimes when I want I would 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.280
 he left out there careful how they go down 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:39.230
 of the door as awful 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:39.230
 but the news 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.590
 of the dogs 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.630
 of course it's a love to fight 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.230
 of allies but it is also a car that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.620
 does balance had some kinds of 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.420
 circus 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.420
 let's see how it goes quiet 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.500
 they are marine 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.010
 good aim not your strong if the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.340
 Balance 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.340
 still 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.459
 a mark of the hunt 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.110
 can be can be can be 7 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.290
 7 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.210
 good 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:19.390
 It's very good, something more like good and 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.549
 let's ask a question this is not 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:27.420
 it always works you can fail you can 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:31.290
 fail something very special to see how it is 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.290
 although an animal 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.210
 i 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.210
 the green 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:04.680
 and you are going to ruin everything you learned 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.850
 Well now the time comes that 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:16.900
 will do and we thank as love thanks 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.900
