to understand tagging if you're

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.900 
to understand tagging if you're
interested<00:04:10.800> with<00:04:10.890> motive<00:04:11.190> before<00:04:11.430> we<00:04:11.520> are<00:04:11.670> and

probably never will be which no
everything<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.590> good<00:04:13.800> for<00:04:13.980> taking<00:04:14.220> because<00:04:14.310> it

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
everything is good for taking because it

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.720 
everything is good for taking because it

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
makes it keeps its kind of resonance and

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.280 
makes it keeps its kind of resonance and
it<00:04:17.790> keeps<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.180> it's<00:04:18.419> key<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.600> subculture

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
it keeps it it's key to subculture

looking at the art of calligraphy I
think<00:04:24.810> according<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.200> easiest<00:04:25.470> way<00:04:25.620> of

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
think according the easiest way of

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.950 
think according the easiest way of
starting<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.820> kind<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.090> try<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.330> quantify<00:04:27.630> it

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
starting to kind of try to quantify it

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.320 
starting to kind of try to quantify it
and<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.890> so<00:04:29.370> what<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.700> know<00:04:29.820> but<00:04:30.120> it's<00:04:30.240> a

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
and so it so what you know but it's a

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.030 
and so it so what you know but it's a
very<00:04:30.510> it's<00:04:30.930> not<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:31.380> not<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.830> typical

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
very it's not it's not a typical

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.530 
very it's not it's not a typical

they're essentially according to him
kind<00:06:20.420> of<00:06:20.480> copies<00:06:20.780> of<00:06:20.810> a<00:06:20.960> copy<00:06:21.170> whereas<00:06:21.860> tagging

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
kind of copies of a copy whereas tagging

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.200 
kind of copies of a copy whereas tagging
is<00:06:22.340> is<00:06:22.520> a<00:06:22.820> kind<00:06:23.030> of<00:06:23.120> true<00:06:23.890> authentic<00:06:24.890> form<00:06:25.760> so<00:06:26.180> I

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
is is a kind of true authentic form so I

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.200 
is is a kind of true authentic form so I
think<00:06:26.300> that's<00:06:26.450> a<00:06:26.630> really<00:06:26.660> interesting<00:06:28.210> idea

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
think that's a really interesting idea

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.790 
think that's a really interesting idea
and<00:06:29.270> it<00:06:29.480> and<00:06:29.630> then<00:06:29.750> and<00:06:30.020> I<00:06:30.170> think<00:06:30.350> you<00:06:30.560> know<00:06:30.620> the

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
and it and then and I think you know the

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.410 
and it and then and I think you know the
idea<00:06:30.860> of<00:06:31.100> drawn<00:06:31.250> bow<00:06:31.400> dr<00:06:31.670> being<00:06:31.940> a<00:06:32.000> support<00:06:32.330> for

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.420 
idea of drawn bow dr being a support for

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.150 
idea of drawn bow dr being a support for
tagging<00:06:32.780> but<00:06:32.930> not<00:06:33.110> contemporary<00:06:33.800> art<00:06:34.010> is

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
tagging but not contemporary art is

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:46.500 
tagging but not contemporary art is
quite<00:06:34.430> an<00:06:34.520> interesting<00:06:34.760> idea<00:06:35.060> as<00:06:35.330> well

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.400 

generally<00:06:47.510> speaking<00:06:47.540> i<00:06:47.930> think<00:06:48.110> you<00:06:48.200> know<00:06:48.260> the

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
generally speaking i think you know the

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.110 
generally speaking i think you know the
public<00:06:48.770> just<00:06:49.190> don't<00:06:49.310> like<00:06:49.580> tagging<00:06:49.970> because

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
public just don't like tagging because

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.310 
public just don't like tagging because

they don't understand it and the way
they're<00:06:51.440> not<00:06:51.470> supposed<00:06:51.680> to<00:06:51.920> understand<00:06:52.310> it<00:06:52.460> so

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
they're not supposed to understand it so

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.690 
they're not supposed to understand it so

just that and I think it's hardly I

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.110 
just that and I think it's hardly I
think<00:07:12.410> it's<00:07:12.530> not<00:07:12.710> so<00:07:13.160> easy<00:07:13.190> to<00:07:13.490> dismiss<00:07:13.850> as

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
just this pointless activity I think

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.660 
just this pointless activity I think
there<00:07:16.400> are

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.670 
there are

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.790

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
there are motives and there and there

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.110 
there are motives and there and there
are<00:07:19.010> things<00:07:19.340> that<00:07:19.400> it<00:07:19.550> reflects<00:07:19.940> about

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
Society in the world as part of it so

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.760 
Society in the world as part of it so
