00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
on the bottom and and what we didn't
find<00:01:49.110> though<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.979> RAM<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> Bram<00:01:50.790> is

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
find though is the RAM so the Bram is

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.700 
find though is the RAM so the Bram is
probably<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.390> upgradeable<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.110> guess<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.530> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
probably not upgradeable I guess it's I

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869

am soldered on to the other side of the
PCB<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> mainboard<00:01:56.960> but<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.290> didn't<00:01:58.710> take

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
PCB on the mainboard but we didn't take

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.260 
PCB on the mainboard but we didn't take
out<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> mainboard<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.670> probably<00:02:00.000> won't

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
out the mainboard and we probably won't

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.219 
out the mainboard and we probably won't
take<00:02:00.509> out<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> mainboard

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
take out the mainboard

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.399 
take out the mainboard
to<00:02:01.560> check<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.130> because<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:03.409> can

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
to check on that because we can

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.660 
to check on that because we can
definitely<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.009> there's<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:05.399> enough

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
definitely see that there's not enough

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
definitely see that there's not enough
space<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.149> other<00:02:06.210> side<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> RAM<00:02:07.740> not

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
space on the other side for the RAM not

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.040 
space on the other side for the RAM not
to<00:02:08.099> being<00:02:08.280> soldered<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.720> RAM<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to being soldered on so the RAM is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.350 
to being soldered on so the RAM is
probably<00:02:10.289> not<00:02:10.440> upgradeable<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.730> Intel

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360

it's<00:02:46.290> worth<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.890> from<00:02:47.400> 128<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.090> buy<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.390> for

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
it's worth it and from 128 to buy it for
