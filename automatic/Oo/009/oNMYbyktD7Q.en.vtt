00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
logic is not like a megaphone ears like

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.850 
logic is not like a megaphone ears like
this<00:01:23.880> real<00:01:24.150> quiet<00:01:24.720> voices<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.650> voice

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860

you can hear everything they saying
that's<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> logic<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> voice<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.920> logic

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that's a logic that's the voice of logic

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.819 
that's a logic that's the voice of logic
is<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.729> quiet<00:01:39.000> basically<00:01:39.420> whispers<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
when the most of the gentleman logic is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
when the most of the gentleman logic is
whispering<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.930> gotta<00:01:43.170> quiet<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
whispering so you gotta quiet that

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.160 
whispering so you gotta quiet that
emotion<00:01:44.280> listen<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.509> logic<00:01:45.899> let<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
emotion listen to your logic let the
