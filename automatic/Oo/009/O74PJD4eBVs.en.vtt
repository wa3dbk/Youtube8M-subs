a little longer than I was supposed to

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.370 
a little longer than I was supposed to
and<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.210> realize<00:03:42.510> now<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.750> he's<00:03:42.960> cooled<00:03:43.230> off

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
and I realize now that he's cooled off

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.380 
and I realize now that he's cooled off
that<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.680> burned<00:03:43.950> his<00:03:44.130> bum<00:03:44.400> but<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.090> know<00:03:45.210> what

for at least an hour in fact it's

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.020 
for at least an hour in fact it's
actually<00:04:13.200> best<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.620> wait<00:04:13.770> 12<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.190> 24<00:04:14.580> hours<00:04:14.820> for

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
the glue to be fully bonded so I

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.710 
the glue to be fully bonded so I
recommend<00:04:17.250> doing<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.730> craft<00:04:18.000> over<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.390> day<00:04:18.570> or

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
recommend doing this craft over a day or

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.360 
recommend doing this craft over a day or
two<00:04:18.900> seems<00:04:19.290> like<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.470> long<00:04:19.709> time<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.980> wait<00:04:20.190> but

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
two seems like a long time to wait but

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.770 
two seems like a long time to wait but
it's<00:04:20.520> totally<00:04:20.940> worth<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.299> for<00:04:21.390> all<00:04:21.480> your<00:04:21.630> stuff
