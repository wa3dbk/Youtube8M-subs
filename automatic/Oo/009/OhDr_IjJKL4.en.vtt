00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.730
 It was not the first time that boy 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.600
 short a trainer guest performance in Becker 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.040
 boxing school gave 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.050
 but before we get into the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.990
 Training events fall here first 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.929
 a little explanation we make box 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 france expected 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.670
 roughly explained French 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.180
 kickboxing was created on the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 ship 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.150
 So they could hold on 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.660
 get to the lake 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.260
 it has a little bit of that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.649
 develops parallel to the normal kid box 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.480
 a little bit the difference is that 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.340
 wear so on onesie is whole 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.649
 train and watch out 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 A fight with a shoe is also allowed 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.649
 a little bit different as we do 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.140
 with the shoe tips and so on 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.629
 otherwise it actually stands out 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.629
 a certain technical sophistication 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.140
 It was about 250 years old 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.899
 at that time for defense on ships 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 developed before it became a sport 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.930
 at that time it was very effective in 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.880
 france the difference to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.409
 one is allowed to use conventional kickboxing 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.100
 do not stand in front of the enemy and 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.380
 to beat 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.729
 you always have to keep moving almost 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.890
 prancing before and around the opponent 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.150
 try to touch him without doing so 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:23.970
 to be touched yourself 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:26.070
 that's the biggest difference 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.869
 Another big difference is the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.689
 Number of athletes in 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.310
 germany and france there are in 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.970
 Germany is connected but that is very 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.880
 tiny 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.340
 I think five or six join the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.409
 very much separate from each other 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.820
 that's why this is very difficult but it 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.380
 there is certainly so in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.710
 france pretty big intends 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.119
 said there are 45,000 official 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.390
 operate the sabbat athlete in 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.259
 France is a lot 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.270
 they would probably be in germany 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.810
 be a hundred or should 50 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.000
 his 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.409
 Of course, that's why 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.119
 quite a big difference but there are also 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.560
 in germany competitions despite this 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.969
 in public 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.159
 Germany is the acquaintance 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.159
 between short and baker no coincidence 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.170
 I have known for a very long time now 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.040
 in the old days a lot to germany 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.250
 come 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.870
 berlin munich frankfurt stuttgart bei 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.760
 I have one of my seminars then 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.319
 We met and now we have 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.209
 determines five or six seminars 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.370
 together, none held the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.080
 fascination with the French kickboxing 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.850
 Becker also has such a long time left 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.400
 long not lost for me as 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.440
 trainer is interesting the methods like 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.239
 some things train so speak now 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.160
 maybe not especially what we do 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.160
 but how it tries to be 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.420
 He was formerly in France 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.750
 instructors of the trainer so 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.850
 trainer instructors the supreme and of 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.980
 Therefore, of course, he has the good tricks 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.230
 in stock and we always have to 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.760
 and that's why I do that 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.980
 We'd like to share her with him, too 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.750
 interest in the box francais sabbat awakened 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.069
 kai becker and his team stand 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.069
