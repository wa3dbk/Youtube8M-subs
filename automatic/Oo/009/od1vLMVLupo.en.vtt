00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.620 
color natural and I already know that
she<00:04:02.560> uses<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.310> color<00:04:03.489> whirl<00:04:03.819> from<00:04:04.180> Mac<00:04:04.359> which

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
she uses the color whirl from Mac which

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.680 
she uses the color whirl from Mac which
is<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.780> really<00:04:05.139> rusty<00:04:05.709> dark<00:04:06.099> Bobby<00:04:06.700> Brown<00:04:07.209> red

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
is a really rusty dark Bobby Brown red

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.970 
is a really rusty dark Bobby Brown red
so<00:04:08.319> that<00:04:08.410> makes<00:04:08.650> sense

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
so that makes sense

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.440 
so that makes sense
but<00:04:09.160> it's<00:04:09.310> really<00:04:09.459> dark<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:10.030> fell<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:10.299> love

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
but it's really dark and I fell in love

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.729 
but it's really dark and I fell in love
with<00:04:10.540> this<00:04:10.780> photo<00:04:11.019> where<00:04:11.260> she<00:04:11.410> has<00:04:11.560> like<00:04:11.709> a

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
with this photo where she has like a

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.740 
with this photo where she has like a
filter<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.790> makes<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.090> lip<00:04:13.239> color<00:04:13.450> look

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
filter and it makes the lip color look

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.509 
filter and it makes the lip color look
like<00:04:13.930> ten<00:04:14.290> shades<00:04:14.590> lighter<00:04:14.919> so<00:04:15.280> I'm<00:04:15.370> actually

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
like ten shades lighter so I'm actually

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.190 
like ten shades lighter so I'm actually
going<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.880> be<00:04:16.030> using<00:04:16.209> this<00:04:16.479> lip<00:04:16.690> liner<00:04:16.720> because

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
going to be using this lip liner because

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.779 
going to be using this lip liner because
I<00:04:17.320> think<00:04:17.380> it's<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.680> lot<00:04:17.859> closer<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.340> the

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
I think it's a lot closer to the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.819 
I think it's a lot closer to the
filtered<00:04:19.269> picture<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.840> if<00:04:20.349> you<00:04:20.469> really<00:04:20.680> like

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
filtered picture and if you really like

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.589 
filtered picture and if you really like
this<00:04:21.010> picture<00:04:21.219> too<00:04:21.519> then<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:21.820> highly<00:04:22.180> recommend
