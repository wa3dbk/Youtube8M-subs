palette<00:00:31.019> which<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> funny<00:00:32.040> because<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.790> really

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
palette which is funny because I really

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.079 
palette which is funny because I really
honestly<00:00:33.839> don't<00:00:34.320> love<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:35.040> lorac<00:00:35.339> Pro<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.879> I

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
honestly don't love the lorac Pro one I

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:37.939 
honestly don't love the lorac Pro one I
know<00:00:36.210> many<00:00:36.510> people<00:00:36.839> do<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.620> me<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.769> just

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
know many people do but for me I just

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.160 
know many people do but for me I just
find<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.790> shades<00:00:39.089> kind<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.449> muddy<00:00:39.659> together<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
find the shades kind of muddy together a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
find the shades kind of muddy together a
little<00:00:40.350> bit<00:00:40.559> too<00:00:40.739> easily<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.239> one

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
little bit too easily but with this one

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.420 
little bit too easily but with this one
I<00:00:42.629> feel<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:42.989> maybe<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.100> there's

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
I feel like maybe it's because there's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.700 
I feel like maybe it's because there's
more<00:00:44.610> contrast<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> colors<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.170> just

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
more contrast in the colors it just

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.430 
more contrast in the colors it just
seems<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.370> work<00:00:48.090> better<00:00:48.449> for<00:00:48.989> me<00:00:49.109> so<00:00:49.410> i

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
seems to work better for me so i

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.319 
seems to work better for me so i
actually<00:00:49.680> prefer<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.579> over<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> first

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
actually prefer this one over the first

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.689 
actually prefer this one over the first
one<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.530> anyway<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> palette

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
one but anyway this is what the palette

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.119 
one but anyway this is what the palette
looks<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.329> kind<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.620> basically

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
looks like it's kind of a it's basically

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799 
looks like it's kind of a it's basically
a<00:00:56.250> neutral<00:00:56.670> palette<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> does<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.629> some

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
a neutral palette but it does have some

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
a neutral palette but it does have some
fun<00:00:58.050> shades<00:00:58.410> kind<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.800> thrown<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.309> which

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
fun shades kind of thrown in there which

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.810

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
and sultry but it kinda reminds me of a

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.910 
and sultry but it kinda reminds me of a
garden<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:17.910> of<00:01:18.149> the<00:01:18.209> green<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.869> don't<00:01:19.830> know
