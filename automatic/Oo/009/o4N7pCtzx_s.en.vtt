00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.710
 this is another one of those sections that 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.170
 premiere in the channel thanks to the 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.610
 suggestion from one of the subscribers the 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.200
 idea is that every so often they 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.270
 I will be bringing the story of a guide 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.119
 that has been around for a long time or that 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.800
 has achieved great achievements in warm 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.630
 whether they have armed themselves with very 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 difficult to get or until the fact 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.740
 that they are great gates with many 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.360
 active players and someday any 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.460
 achievement that they have achieved as a clan 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.350
 may be reasons to appear in this 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.030
 section if you think your life deserves 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.190

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.380
 section sends the achievements of your guide in 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.910
 a message from youtube and if I consider that 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.010
 meet the characteristics that 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.020
 I need to return a message asking 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.240
 the photos like git and some information 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.490
 Additional please be clear to the 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.990
 time to send your good message after 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.550
 of the above said that you think if 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.950
 we start this section with the guild 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.840
 oldest that has existed in warm like this 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.840
 I'm talking about red rose 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.190
 on December 7, 1998 at the time 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.420
 little-inhabited antica server was created 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.630
 unofficially 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.119
 the clan called the red bulls 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.740
 passed the time and in the year of 2002 skip 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.990
 soft created the clans section in the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.640
 page of lukewarm dotcom so that 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.680
 clan called red rose happened to be 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.869
 officially considered and recognized in 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.490
 the game as a good as I already 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.439
 we had talked in another video the girl 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.610
 red rose receives a gift from 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.140
 the gods of tibia 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.360
 I am speaking of course of the rose 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.490
 jong that as we all know is an item 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.619
 extremely rare because it was created 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.659
 only in honor of this well also 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.850
 as we already mentioned it was created 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.470
 the russa armor that later became the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.720
 Noble armor we know today 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.060
 this last one that I told you about the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.580
 noble armor is a rumor sincerely not 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.409
 I can assure you that it is real or not 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.729
 guild of course also receives one of 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.069
 the first guides heights that have been 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.630
 created in tibia which is in 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.969
 figure 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.890
 by the way according to rumors the city was 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.360
 designed by a member of retro and the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.819
 gods fulfilled his wish and the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.620
 placed on the clear map a time 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.480
 Then they modified some things 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.239
 to make the figure we know today 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.860
 in day in addition to many other things the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.660
 guide has become famous on the server 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.459
 of antica for making events quite 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.180
 entertaining as football events 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.959
 festivals and other things 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.640
 unfortunately many of the 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.440
 official members no longer play lukewarm 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.480
 then they retired for personal reasons 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.190
 and that has made them not so 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.080
 frequent the events of the guide as 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.330
 before but that's not why we owe 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.819
 discourage you may surprise us in 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.860
 any time and there the red rose 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.099
 has been in existence to this day 15 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.720
 years and officially 11 years we will see 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.190
 without thinking about the many stories that 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.890
 some of the members of this guide we 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.330
