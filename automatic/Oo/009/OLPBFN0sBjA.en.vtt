right<00:02:41.530> with<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.739> level<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.650> level<00:02:44.800> is

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
right with that level is the level is

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.570 
right with that level is the level is
gonna<00:02:45.220> be<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.400> doorway<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.420> probably<00:02:47.580> probably

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
gonna be a doorway and probably probably

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.210 
gonna be a doorway and probably probably
a<00:02:48.760> 4-foot<00:02:49.150> doorway<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.200> then<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.800> wall<00:02:51.010> will

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
a 4-foot doorway and then the wall will

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.740 
a 4-foot doorway and then the wall will
go<00:02:51.400> from<00:02:51.730> there<00:02:51.970> over<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.570> there<00:02:54.239> my<00:02:55.239> intention

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
go from there over to there my intention

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.240 
go from there over to there my intention
with<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:55.959> upstairs<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.769> someone<00:02:57.070> will

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
with this upstairs is that someone will

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.290 
with this upstairs is that someone will
come<00:02:57.280> up<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.820> stairs<00:02:58.170> turn<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.590> then<00:03:00.300> they'll

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
come up the stairs turn and then they'll

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.600 
come up the stairs turn and then they'll
go<00:03:01.510> into<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.959> part<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:02.830> part<00:03:02.890> will<00:03:03.430> be<00:03:03.580> a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
go into that part this part will be a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.720 
go into that part this part will be a
living<00:03:03.910> room<00:03:04.239> sitting<00:03:05.200> type<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.709> area<00:03:06.040> this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
living room sitting type of area this
