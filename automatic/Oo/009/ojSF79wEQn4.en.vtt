00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 all right 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.619
 this time we will be seeing a 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:22.660
 smoke detector circuit and we see that 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.920
 we are using a 741 amplifier 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.520
 respectively- polarized with two 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.550
 sources a negative in this case -11 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.370
 good or positive of 11 volts we see 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.890
 also that this feeds a circuit 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.800
 which is the smoke detector and we are 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.910
 using a switch to simulate the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 smoke interference and output 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.370
 to know if there is interference or not 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.579
 we put this led indicator 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.300
 also at the entrance not denied of the 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.210
 amplifier we put the divider circuit 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.520
 of voltage and what we are doing is 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.500
 a comparator let's see how it works 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.810
 We can see 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.980
 the voltage level but this is these 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.890
 graphics let's see 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.440
 what is it measuring we can see 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.250
 that the red channel 1 of the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.970
 oscilloscope because it is measuring what 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.540
 the negated input of the amplifier as 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.540
 We can see 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.210
 channel 2 green is measuring 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.300
 what has been the entry not denied 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.509
 of the amplifier we can now understand 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.420
 better this graph we see the levels of 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.790
 voltage the green that is the input no 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.000
 denied the denied red and let's see what it is 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.890
 what happens if we would see this resistance 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.090
 we can see how how the voltage falls and 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.100
 how the voltage goes up the variable this is 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.050
 that this is the reference level 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.080
 let's see if there 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.590
 a separation in this circuit in other 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.770
 words if there is smoke we can see that it 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.030
 turn on and that's what we want that 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.590
 When there is smoke, send a signal 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.750
 because we can see the operation of 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.660
 this amplifier of this circuit 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.569
 comparator we have as a base the voltage 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.829
 What is it 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.469
 of the entry not denied and we put that 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.170
 reference voltage with the set of 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:44.469
 these resistances that's why it's important 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.569
 put a potentiometer as we do not know 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:51.780
 what will be the voltage level applied 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.689
 since it depends on infrared light 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.310
 towards the clear transistor photo that in 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.400
 this circuit we do not use that 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.829
 we use a normal transistor and a 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.280
 switch but in itself this is the 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:10.329
 operation we have to have in 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.340
 summary we have to have a circuit to 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.470
 the unengaged input of the amplifier 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.810
 to put our reference voltage 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:26.400
 and this in the denied entry put what 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.370
 is the circuit of the smoke detector and 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.930
 this how functioning does the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.560
 zero crossing circuit when crossing 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.560
 by 0 l it will turn on and send a signal 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.890
 and an alarm can also be connected 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.840
 a siren or anything to warn 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.019
 waths up 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.500
 Thank you very much. I hope you have served 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.500
