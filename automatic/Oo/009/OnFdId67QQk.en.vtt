00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.160 

I<00:00:04.880> have<00:00:05.880> a<00:00:05.910> couple<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.240> techniques<00:00:06.600> for<00:00:06.900> adding

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
I have a couple of techniques for adding

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.600 
I have a couple of techniques for adding
chords<00:00:07.500> now<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:08.040> actually<00:00:08.250> have<00:00:08.460> several

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
chords now I actually have several

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.090 
chords now I actually have several
techniques<00:00:09.059> for<00:00:09.210> adding<00:00:09.420> chords<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:10.530> with

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
techniques for adding chords in with

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.310 
techniques for adding chords in with
your<00:00:11.250> rhythm<00:00:11.520> section<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.690> be<00:00:12.720> approached

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
your rhythm section can be approached

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.110 
your rhythm section can be approached
from<00:00:13.590> three<00:00:14.309> different<00:00:14.400> ways<00:00:14.760> of<00:00:14.940> my

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
from three different ways of my

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.410 
from three different ways of my
estimation<00:00:15.660> one<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.930> them<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:17.119> it's<00:00:18.119> going<00:00:18.360> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
estimation one of them is it's going to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.540 
estimation one of them is it's going to
be<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:19.170> know<00:00:19.200> like<00:00:19.290> a<00:00:19.590> three<00:00:19.800> note<00:00:19.950> chord<00:00:20.250> so

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
be you know like a three note chord so

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.090 
be you know like a three note chord so
I'm<00:00:20.640> gonna<00:00:20.789> basically<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> three<00:00:22.710> finger

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
I'm gonna basically do a three finger

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.730 
I'm gonna basically do a three finger
thing<00:00:23.460> kind<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.789> assign<00:00:24.090> fingers<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
thing kind of assign fingers to the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:43.700 
thing kind of assign fingers to the
three<00:00:26.250> strings<00:00:41.450> just<00:00:42.450> assigning<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.320> index

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
three strings just assigning the index

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
three strings just assigning the index
middle<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.070> ring<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> three<00:00:44.820> adjacent

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
middle and ring to a three adjacent

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.400 
middle and ring to a three adjacent
strings<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.579> doing<00:00:47.790> that<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:49.290> those<00:00:49.379> are

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
strings so I'm doing that and those are

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.560 
strings so I'm doing that and those are
fallin<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.010> between<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.760> bass<00:00:50.940> notes<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.450> lot

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
fallin in between the bass notes a lot

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.860 
fallin in between the bass notes a lot
of<00:00:51.690> time

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.139 

another<00:00:57.870> approach<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.379> four<00:00:59.039> chords<00:00:59.730> or<00:00:59.879> chord

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
another approach of four chords or chord

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.549 
another approach of four chords or chord
stabs<00:01:00.450> however<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.020> want<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
stabs however you want to think of that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.130 
stabs however you want to think of that
like<00:01:01.770> accented<00:01:02.280> things<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.750> that<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
like accented things is that I like to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.910 
like accented things is that I like to
do<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:05.190> kind<00:01:05.550> of<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:06.420> harmonics<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.590> hitting

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
do is kind of as harmonics like hitting

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
do is kind of as harmonics like hitting
wherever<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.670> chord<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.300> of<00:01:09.390> course

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
wherever my chord is and of course

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.800 
wherever my chord is and of course
typically<00:01:10.039> you<00:01:11.039> like<00:01:11.190> kind<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.569> more<00:01:12.569> often

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
typically you like kind of more often

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.090 
typically you like kind of more often
than<00:01:12.929> not<00:01:12.959> probably<00:01:13.289> a<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.500> finger<00:01:13.709> chord

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
than not probably a one finger chord

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.309 
than not probably a one finger chord
thing<00:01:14.459> where<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:14.759> have<00:01:14.910> this<00:01:15.319> standard

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.319 
thing where they have this standard

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.469 
thing where they have this standard
shape<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.550> know<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> could<00:01:17.910> really<00:01:18.209> think<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
shape you know you could really think of

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.320 
shape you know you could really think of
this<00:01:18.539> is<00:01:18.690> kind<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.110> shame<00:01:19.670> major<00:01:20.670> triad<00:01:21.060> or

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
this is kind of a shame major triad or

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690 
this is kind of a shame major triad or
depending<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.780> route<00:01:21.929> could<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.319> minor<00:01:22.700> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
depending on the route could be minor it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580 
depending on the route could be minor it
can<00:01:23.819> be<00:01:23.910> obviously<00:01:24.119> C<00:01:24.929> major<00:01:25.140> thing<00:01:25.440> or<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
can be obviously C major thing or it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.400 
can be obviously C major thing or it
could<00:01:25.709> be<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.800> minor<00:01:26.399> 7th<00:01:26.819> a<00:01:27.410> convenient

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
could be a minor 7th a convenient

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.600 
could be a minor 7th a convenient
through<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.649> from<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.920> same<00:01:29.099> fret<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.550> if

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
through this from the same fret and if

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210 
through this from the same fret and if
you<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:29.819> 12<00:01:30.149> frets<00:01:30.420> higher<00:01:30.690> I'm<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.349> five<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.950> 12

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you go 12 frets higher I'm on five so 12

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.130 
you go 12 frets higher I'm on five so 12
and<00:01:32.340> 5<00:01:32.459> is<00:01:32.610> 17<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.330> go<00:01:33.720> down<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.929> 17th<00:01:34.410> fret

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
and 5 is 17 so I go down to 17th fret

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.300 
and 5 is 17 so I go down to 17th fret
smack<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.289> strings<00:01:37.590> right<00:01:37.800> over<00:01:38.099> the<00:01:38.190> front

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
smack the strings right over the front

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.999 
smack the strings right over the front
wire<00:01:38.990> it's<00:01:39.990> gonna<00:01:40.140> take<00:01:40.410> them<00:01:40.560> up<00:01:40.740> an<00:01:40.860> octave

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
wire it's gonna take them up an octave

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.070 
wire it's gonna take them up an octave
and<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.119> beautiful<00:01:42.770> sustain<00:01:44.959> you<00:01:45.959> got

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
and have this beautiful sustain you got

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.089 
and have this beautiful sustain you got
a<00:01:46.110> hit<00:01:46.349> we've<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.679> be<00:01:46.740> pretty<00:01:46.890> accurate

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:47.099 
a hit we've got to be pretty accurate

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:49.520 
a hit we've got to be pretty accurate
where<00:01:47.520> you're<00:01:47.610> hitting<00:01:47.789> now<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.989> hit<00:01:49.140> around

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
where you're hitting now if I hit around

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.100 
where you're hitting now if I hit around
it<00:01:49.739> and<00:01:49.830> say<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.039> miss<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.520> by<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> fret<00:01:50.940> or<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
it and say I miss it by a fret or so

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.020 
it and say I miss it by a fret or so
I'm<00:01:53.620> not<00:01:53.770> hearing<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.100> harmonic<00:01:54.640> I'm<00:01:54.790> getting

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
I'm not hearing the harmonic I'm getting

I'm not hearing the harmonic I'm getting
some<00:01:55.210> ring<00:01:55.390> it's<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.630> little<00:01:55.840> dead<00:01:55.990> if<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.260> get

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
some ring it's a little dead if I get

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.900 
some ring it's a little dead if I get

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.680 
hear it and what does it do it'll sing
out<00:02:09.160> for<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.580> while<00:02:10.270> you're<00:02:10.390> doing<00:02:10.570> other

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
out for you while you're doing other

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:21.600 
out for you while you're doing other
things<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:20.650> know<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:21.130> can<00:02:21.280> make<00:02:21.430> that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
things you know so you can make that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.310 
things you know so you can make that
stuff<00:02:21.790> sing<00:02:22.090> out<00:02:22.270> or<00:02:22.600> maybe<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.050> stops

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
stuff sing out or maybe it stops

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.170 
stuff sing out or maybe it stops
abruptly<00:02:23.530> maybe<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.040> smack<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:25.000> just

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
abruptly maybe you smack it and it just

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.380 
abruptly maybe you smack it and it just
stops<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.459> can<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.850> compete<00:02:31.060> legato

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
stops so you can it compete legato

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.300 
stops so you can it compete legato
staccato<00:02:31.870> however<00:02:32.200> you're<00:02:32.320> feeling<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.709> and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
staccato however you're feeling it and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.400 
staccato however you're feeling it and
then<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.910> other<00:02:34.060> technique<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.810> would<00:02:35.020> like<00:02:35.290> to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
then the other technique I would like to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.229 
then the other technique I would like to
talk<00:02:35.560> about<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.000> one's

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
talk about is that and this one's

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.020 
talk about is that and this one's
generally<00:02:37.690> gonna<00:02:37.840> fall<00:02:38.080> under<00:02:38.410> probably<00:02:39.190> you

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
generally gonna fall under probably you

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.199 
generally gonna fall under probably you
know<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.630> bass<00:02:40.780> line<00:02:41.020> is<00:02:41.110> pretty<00:02:41.290> busy<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:42.430> I'm

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
know the bass line is pretty busy so I'm

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.229 
know the bass line is pretty busy so I'm
gonna<00:02:43.330> use<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:45.010> brushing<00:02:45.700> technique

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
gonna use just the brushing technique

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.240 
gonna use just the brushing technique
could<00:02:46.540> be<00:02:46.600> middle<00:02:47.110> of<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.680> right<00:02:47.830> hand<00:02:48.040> could

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
could be middle of the right hand could

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.970 
could be middle of the right hand could
be<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.520> index<00:02:48.880> finger<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:50.739> know<00:02:50.830> it's

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
be the index finger and you know it's

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.410 
be the index finger and you know it's
generally<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.459> riff<00:02:51.640> that's<00:02:51.790> kind<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.060> busy

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
generally on a riff that's kind of busy

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:24.300 
generally on a riff that's kind of busy
so<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:53.380> take<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> bass<00:02:54.190> line<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.520> this<00:03:23.310> that's

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
so I take a bass line like this that's

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.289 
so I take a bass line like this that's
all<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.459> have<00:03:24.580> time<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.910> do<00:03:25.000> because<00:03:25.180> that's

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
all I have time to do because that's

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.360 
all I have time to do because that's
actually<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.630> pretty<00:03:25.840> jacked<00:03:26.769> up<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.160> very

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
actually a pretty jacked up and very

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.060 
actually a pretty jacked up and very
busy<00:03:27.610> it's<00:03:28.570> like<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.080> for<00:03:29.410> an<00:03:29.500> ultra<00:03:29.769> funk

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
busy it's like that for an ultra funk

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.670 
busy it's like that for an ultra funk
thing<00:03:30.370> so
