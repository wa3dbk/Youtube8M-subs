 true spokesman not to say and like the dc comics 5 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.160
 batman chose the end of the summer holidays to return to the front of 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
 the scene 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.180
 after regaining all its acclaim in the cinema thanks 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.150
 to adults afpa of the church man and especially sauna knight 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 now our masked vigilante is to conquer the hearts of the players 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.170
 with the can so man the studio rocksteady makes possible this desire 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.680
 At the same time, it crystallizes an old kid's dream of putting on the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 Batman's cape in a high-flying game 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.420
 enjoying complete freedom in the development of batman arkham 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.190
 the developers have paid the luxury of an unpublished story 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.580
 narrated j 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.800
 I want this one to start with the muscled arrest of the joker by 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.640
 a boosted batman to lopez or 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.460
 let's hope at any cost the company up to its cell 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.080
 batman quickly finds himself in the role of the pichichi hero as he goes 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.180
 find stuck in prison barkat masih the man they stay the 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 more dangerous and odious of catane site here 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.520
 because if the joker is the main opponent of this adventure 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.790
 the demand is going to fray with others coming here 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.950
 equally tough meals 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.740
 every nation 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.960
 Chereque 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.150
 art 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
 after 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.210
 the war 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.680
 show 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.920
 with the map 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 baldwin air france 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.260
 so that the player is completely immersed in this dark atmosphere 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.350
 and Gothic 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.020
 the rocksteady studio put the package side graphics by calling on the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 Catalan engine nights away the Mauritanian troy 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.929
 from the grain of the skin to the appearance of a garment by the way 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.279
 by the guides of the face or the least scars 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.029
 everything has been worked with special attention 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.079
 part of the past the tycoon of the most beautiful games of the moment 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.079
 the German does not realize 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.239
 better still the atmosphere so that the art direction has never been 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.459
 victim of bad taste 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.950
 on the contrary even if we can blame a musculature a little too much 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.950
 voluminous from our masked hero 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:45.089
 but it took at least if a few sessions to inflate to justify the 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.139
 batman force that has never distributed so many applicants all his 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.009
 career 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.959
 indeed every class to the establishment of what to fight its 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.609
 designers have put together a simple combat system and the 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.299
 shop 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.019
 allowing players to chain combos and counters with a certain 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.359
 class 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.709
 who has to face three to the 15 thugs at the same time batman is 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.540
 able to attack them simultaneously 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.599
 try all possible fronts 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.469
 easy access for novices the combat system finally some 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.659
 challengers so that fans of combos a little more complex are not 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.659
 not harmed by experience 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.180
 in addition to his mastery of martial arts bodenmann has a whole 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.469
 paraphernalia that allows him to cope with the many waves of enemies 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.209
 it's a great goal that for example allows you to glide briefly into 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.079
 the glasses 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.729
 his batarang can knock out his enemies blow to break some 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.259
 mechanisms and inaccessible 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.759
 while the gun to handle exposure makes it possible to blow up 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.799
 some types of walls 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.459
 do not forget either the ultimate army grabber to hoist himself on the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.440
 roof of a building 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.440
 and then we do not look at anyone 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.319
 shit 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.069
 adding that this whole range of diverse and diverse objects 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.069
 the operation a gameplay varied enough not to tire the player 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.039
 because if you go head-on on a group can not be an end in itself 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.289
 the game offers us and imposes us sometimes it is approached so 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:06.859
 finer more discreet 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.799
 indeed chelsea in the image of a simple T-shirt gives a little walk on the 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:10.669
 tiptoe chu 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.849
 the small excesses of emissions moment from behind 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.470
 moreover to better develop the railways of the special unit 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.459
 using x-rays which allows him to bring out elements 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.459
 important to spot enemies even through the walls 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:28.270
 six other media took care to achieve the doubling of his young son 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.190
 then and above all managed to find a fair balance giving free rein the 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.150
 player in his progression choices and on time 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.060
 we are delighted to go from the simple goal of mollo today to hide and seek 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.060
 while allowing to play with clear objectives 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.179
 however beside all its undeniable qualities we find 

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:50.779
 some weaknesses that prevent perfection 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.779
 starting with a lack of obvious challenger 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.810
 indeed 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.639
 not only are the titles legion 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.639
 but in addition the game vocation to constantly guide the player 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:02.949
 fighting the same way 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.100
 different bosses are never very hard to overcome at our most 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.580
 great dismay 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.120
 it's all the more true that the artificial intelligence of the enemies 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.699
 but karzai initiates what will fill happiness of infiltration lovers in 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.879
 further in this sense 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.259
 we also notice that a certain linearity is gradually installed 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:19.620
 in the adventurous 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.620
 with game mechanics that tend to repeat themselves 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.180
 that said this with a little fifteen hours of play to go after 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.029
 ventured the 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.029
 the life of batman arcana zidane is reasonable 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.819
 anyway these flaws remain minor to truly mess up 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.819
 the experience you really need to be experienced 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:43.499
 when 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.339
 here we are 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.439
 to file a complaint against me the note joÃ«l cruchaud 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.710
 seventeen songs 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.710
 in the 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.780
 she
