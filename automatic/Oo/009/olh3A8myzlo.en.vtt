one<00:00:01.260> of<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.439> biggest<00:00:01.620> issues<00:00:01.920> when<00:00:02.340> working

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
one of the biggest issues when working

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.079 
one of the biggest issues when working
with<00:00:02.850> an<00:00:02.939> AVR<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.780> breadboard<00:00:04.200> is

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:05.089 
with an AVR on a breadboard is

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.120 
with an AVR on a breadboard is
configuring<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.210> chip<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.410> work<00:00:07.799> with<00:00:08.010> an

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
configuring the chip to work with an

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.049 
configuring the chip to work with an
external<00:00:08.370> crystal<00:00:10.040> if<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.550> mess<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
external crystal if you mess up the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.999 
external crystal if you mess up the
fuses<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.719> only<00:00:12.990> way<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.170> recover<00:00:13.620> from<00:00:13.799> that

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
fuses the only way to recover from that

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.430 
fuses the only way to recover from that
is<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.280> use<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.910> high<00:00:15.480> voltage<00:00:15.540> paolo

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
is to use a high voltage paolo

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.630 
is to use a high voltage paolo
programmer<00:00:17.180> most<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.330> us<00:00:18.449> use<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:19.640> ISP

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
programmer most of us use a ISP

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.750 
programmer most of us use a ISP
programmer<00:00:20.880> or<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.570> serial<00:00:22.140> programmer<00:00:22.760> for

programmer or a serial programmer for
the<00:00:23.910> breadboard<00:00:25.099> to<00:00:26.099> resolve<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.640> issue<00:00:26.849> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the breadboard to resolve this issue I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.859 
the breadboard to resolve this issue I
actually<00:00:27.750> built<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.470> high<00:00:29.429> voltage<00:00:29.539> serial<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
actually built a high voltage serial a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.280 
actually built a high voltage serial a
high<00:00:31.439> voltage<00:00:31.500> parallel<00:00:32.460> fuse<00:00:33.360> resetar<00:00:33.870> so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
high voltage parallel fuse resetar so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.900 
high voltage parallel fuse resetar so
it's<00:00:34.410> not<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> full<00:00:34.800> programmer<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.670> just

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it's not a full programmer it just

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.119 
it's not a full programmer it just
resets<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.630> chips<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.680> twenty<00:00:38.010> eight

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
using the X arm crystal what I'm going

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.630 
using the X arm crystal what I'm going
to<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.020> turn<00:00:58.260> off<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.739> power

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
to do is I'm going to turn off the power

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.479 
to do is I'm going to turn off the power
supply<00:00:59.960> pull<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> crystal<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.149> show<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
supply pull the crystal out and show you

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.190 
supply pull the crystal out and show you
that<00:01:05.840> AVR<00:01:06.840> dude<00:01:07.080> will<00:01:07.409> fail<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.130> find<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.200> chip

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that AVR dude will fail to find the chip

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
that AVR dude will fail to find the chip
this<00:01:10.409> time<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.920> will<00:01:11.100> give<00:01:11.280> us<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> standard

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this time it will give us the standard

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.160 
this time it will give us the standard
error<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.210> simulate<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.900> locked

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
error so this will simulate a locked

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.109 
error so this will simulate a locked
chip<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.189> us<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:20.520> use<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> device<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.840> built

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
chip for us to use the device I built

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.929 
chip for us to use the device I built
we<00:01:24.119> basically<00:01:24.600> pull<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:26.220> serial<00:01:26.580> programmer

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
we basically pull the serial programmer

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.100 
we basically pull the serial programmer
out<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:29.100> actually<00:01:29.280> configured<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
out and I actually configured it on the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.319 
out and I actually configured it on the
same<00:01:31.290> breadboard<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> I'll<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:35.970> move<00:01:36.180> this

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
same breadboard so I'll just move this

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.069 
same breadboard so I'll just move this
over<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.320> plug<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.770> everything<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
over so I can plug in everything so you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:48.180 
over so I can plug in everything so you
can<00:01:40.259> see

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.470 

how<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.250> works<00:01:49.460> in<00:01:50.060> action<00:01:52.120> what<00:01:53.120> I'll<00:01:53.210> do<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
how it works in action what I'll do the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.480 
how it works in action what I'll do the
first<00:01:53.630> time<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:54.260> I<00:01:54.530> will<00:01:54.710> actually<00:01:54.860> run<00:01:55.340> it

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
first time is I will actually run it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.530 
first time is I will actually run it
I'll<00:01:55.910> actually<00:01:56.120> powered<00:01:56.570> up<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:58.300> that<00:01:59.300> first

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
I'll actually powered up and that first

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.020 
I'll actually powered up and that first
green<00:01:59.780> light<00:01:59.960> comes<00:02:00.260> on<00:02:00.410> to<00:02:00.920> show<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:01.370> the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
green light comes on to show that the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.860 
green light comes on to show that the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
fuse resetar is ready to go when I hit

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.580 
fuse resetar is ready to go when I hit
the<00:02:06.550> button<00:02:07.550> it's<00:02:08.300> going<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.540> try<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.869> reset

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
the button it's going to try to reset

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.700 
the button it's going to try to reset
the<00:02:09.740> fuses<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.970> flashing<00:02:11.450> green<00:02:11.480> LED<00:02:12.350> tells

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
the fuses the flashing green LED tells

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.820 
the fuses the flashing green LED tells
us<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.370> failed<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.850> find<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.830> actual

us that it failed to find the actual

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.510 
us that it failed to find the actual
chip<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.780> reason<00:02:18.110> being<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:19.100> did<00:02:19.340> not

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
chip and the reason being that I did not

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.780 
chip and the reason being that I did not
plug<00:02:20.330> up<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> 12-volt<00:02:21.110> power<00:02:21.290> supply<00:02:21.790> my

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
plug up the 12-volt power supply my

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.449 
plug up the 12-volt power supply my
product<00:02:23.150> supply<00:02:23.390> actually<00:02:23.630> provides<00:02:24.350> me<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.920> 12

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
product supply actually provides me a 12

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.000 
product supply actually provides me a 12
volt<00:02:25.730> out<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:27.260> I'll<00:02:27.350> just<00:02:27.590> wired<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.040> up<00:02:28.190> and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
volt out so I'll just wired it up and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.820 
volt out so I'll just wired it up and
hit<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.040> button<00:02:31.340> again<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:33.140> time<00:02:33.380> all<00:02:33.620> three

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
hit the button again this time all three

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.030 
hit the button again this time all three
lights<00:02:34.010> came<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.820> fuse<00:02:35.890> fuses<00:02:36.890> were

everything back apart and set it out the
way<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.650> was<00:02:45.800> originally<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.640> works<00:02:46.850> with

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
way it was originally so it works with

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.310 
way it was originally so it works with

the solar programmer once again and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.420 
the solar programmer once again and
we'll<00:02:51.470> try<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.739> run<00:02:52.040> AVR<00:02:52.820> dude<00:02:53.060> on<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.780> again
