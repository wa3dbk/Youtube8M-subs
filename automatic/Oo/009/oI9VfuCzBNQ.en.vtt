00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.450
 sheared zzzz users intent on an inside 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:17.279
 intent to pray minecraft brothers 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 of amodium are pieces today I am here for 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 present you a new fashion the moby today 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 to the kraft mix 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.160
 let's start with today's fashion a mod 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.170
 wonderful because besides introducing us 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.990
 this thing that I will show you today that is the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.690
 dna introduces us to so many things 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 wonderful in minecraft is let's say a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.010
 minimum of tech because as I said 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.660
 before introducing this DNA there 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 also introduces things that we do 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.040
 introduce other fashions for example i 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.440
 world league that are introduced 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.000
 from the magic wand anyway I'm inside 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.010
 this way with the authorization of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 modems that created that mode are 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.270
 very but very beautiful because as you see 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 these fashions have a complete one 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.739
 integration with a kind of magic la 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.320
 magic is recharged at the bottom right 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.270
 you see this little green bar e 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.760
 we can use it a few times 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.380
 see to limited we cannot exploit 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.930
 too much the powers we have while in the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.100
 magic wand were easily usable 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.020
 however there are for example these 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 chopsticks or we have 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.490
 these are the ones here that are a lot 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.340
 very beautiful ie tnt bo and lighting 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.170
 boh look you see are very much 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 pretty and practically there are so many 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.740
 very, very nice additions we have 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.170
 also of the airon furness si boys 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.439
 of the airo furness we have this block 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.079
 beautiful kimono are colorful block 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.400
 things a little strange look is very strange 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.950
 I know but it's beautiful 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.479
 however there are so many added that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.670
 however it will leave you because today you 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.790
 I wanted to explain this part of the mod 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.950
 that is, the part of the DNA we have three 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.740
 objects that is the dna ex art and turin dna 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.450
 mix and the mob assembler all three 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.790
 functions in a different way now vi 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.399
 I show how then we have a drop here 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.259
 the various drop from moba mob as you know 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.969
 for example lander main draw take for 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.250
 the chicken drop alro chicken and the cow 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.080
 rump the robin sorry if you are me 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.209
 stuck but I was thinking a second 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.300
 with this drop however there are 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.790
 many others 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.790
 I don't know, let's take it as an example 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.050
 squid the squid drop halim soft and then 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.760
 we need the inc sac per 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.680
 use the squid ok now I'll explain 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.270
 because I say use 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.240
 Meanwhile, however, we need the die 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.280
 of the dna that the dna that the seacraft a 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.680
 with the team that introduces us this fashion 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.490
 the co because it introduces us this mode and 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.200
 the airon how it works we open the extra edn 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.780
 expected as you see there is this kind of 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.420
 what do we do for example 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.090
 above in this case I want to create a 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.310
 yes a and her man exact a header 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.080
 I really want to create renderman thing 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.630
 I insert here lander pearls and 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.040
 under the empty usb key 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.830
 as you see the progress bar e 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.350
 very beautiful and will give us an exact key 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.780
 a usb key with the genetic code 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.800
 of the lander man we can use 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.830
 a lot of genetic codes we all say 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.500
 yes all i don't know now what to call them 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.600
 well all mob is exact of minecraft 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.430
 as you all see, however, I have not yet 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.470
 seen the village in fact the village a 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.810
 because there is not a drop also 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.450
 with her, as you can see, now I find one 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.040
 dna that this dna that i however like it 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.620
 use the time in the meantime we make ourselves the key 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.370
 right what we see we see a kind of 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.989
 menu conscript dna dell under man 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.260
 kingdom classification mob class monsters 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.790
 species and air men for now let's say that 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.870
 still simple this way because i have 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.360
 heard that in future versions 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.280
 they want to introduce mobs all 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.050
 made by them very very beautiful and one 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.270
 new dimension below we have a 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.200
 small description however in the mod 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.670
 now that we have this key 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.380
 however there are so many for 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.350
 example I do not know we take the cow 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.640
 here it is right click animal class 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.720
 mammal species cow you see ok a lot 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.910
 very nice there is also a description 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.440
 in every way 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.450
 now that this key, however, we can 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.340
 do whatever I want for example 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.030
 make a mutation that is put together 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.620
 a and her man and a cow 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.470
 look it was advancing and as you see 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.359
 unfortunately there was now mobs there 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.120
 they are all there are a few versions 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.820
 mob you see we have conscious grill shots 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.950
 park cic hancock retracing man and the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.520
 lair zombie and now for example c 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.550
 dropped a pick and 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.160
 even though I had put a cow inside 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.199
 strange as if it seems to me inside the cow 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.180
 I don't know why a big and went out 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.949
 her me anyway a phase still in 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.750
 beta is a fashion still in beta so there 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.789
 they are small bugs 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.680
 here I was telling you unfortunately not there 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.909
 they are all mobs so if I try to 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.580
 put I do not know 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.909
 the pd with her skeleton which is a stuff 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.740
 super mixed and try to put it in 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.419
 mob assembler that as you see to which 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.639
 buggata but I know where to put it here 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.080
 as you can see it does not work because it is the mob 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.720
 is not yet available 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.389
 if instead I put the pick and her man that 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.699
 is not available here I have to put though 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.819
 the we had not seen before was no longer 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:10.280
 great so where I had it 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:16.159
 put the corner man there must be for 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.020
 strength not impossible that I did not have 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.449
 seen before here is the commander man 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.669
 if he puts the commander man instead like 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.560
 you see it works because they don't have 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.940
 then added all the mobs then 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.229
 you must be patient they are 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.690
 adding and not really easy 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.789
 because they are so many and still have to 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.569
 do all the combinations but let's say 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:38.449
 which as version we say alpha beta is 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.120
 cute ok let's shoot this and her man 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.099
 as you see really beautiful what we understand 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.490
 if that's what we understand if it's peaceful 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.930
 or hostile by the name above the way in 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.690
 this case true I must say that a 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.639
 peaceful not only to say that hostile 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.440
 I know it is not a very difficult fashion but 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.750
 it is very, very beautiful especially for 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.860
 this fact of the DNA that I think is 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.900
 really interesting 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.610
 we still have to be patient because it is not 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.979
 still completed as you see there 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.750
 all mobs are available anyway 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.000
 to be an alpha it really did 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.210
 well which i am a little bit baghdad is 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.610
 But it is acceptable it is passable 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.319
 can you guys anyway i remember you 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.699
 to put I like and 200 seconds to me 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.469
 like to publish a new fashion there 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.569
 you will find two videos I finally don't know 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:23.029
 that I was absent for a day 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.319
 But I could not do anything there 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.270
 I did that I could not 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:29.389
 record and today I put you two or three 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.800
 lives from then 270 I like it as always
