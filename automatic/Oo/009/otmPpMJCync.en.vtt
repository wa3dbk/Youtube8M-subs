thirty<00:04:51.250> nine<00:04:51.490> thousand<00:04:52.150> dollars<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:54.280> the

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
thirty nine thousand dollars so the

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.820 
thirty nine thousand dollars so the
question<00:04:54.760> remains

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
question remains

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.810 
question remains

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
fantastic for for one of these type of

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.240 
fantastic for for one of these type of
vehicles<00:05:13.330> it's<00:05:13.540> really<00:05:13.750> well<00:05:13.900> thought<00:05:14.080> out

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
vehicles it's really well thought out

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.530 
vehicles it's really well thought out
it's<00:05:15.250> very<00:05:15.310> well<00:05:15.700> equipped<00:05:15.940> for<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.270> money<00:05:16.450> I

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
it's very well equipped for the money I

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.730 
it's very well equipped for the money I
don't<00:05:16.810> think<00:05:16.960> I'd<00:05:17.050> go<00:05:17.200> with<00:05:17.230> all<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.560> gizmos

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
don't think I'd go with all the gizmos

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.020 
don't think I'd go with all the gizmos
and<00:05:18.130> that<00:05:18.220> would<00:05:18.310> keep<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.550> price<00:05:18.760> down<00:05:18.970> a

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
and that would keep the price down a

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.740 
and that would keep the price down a
little<00:05:19.150> bit<00:05:19.420> lower

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
little bit lower

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.140 
little bit lower
probably<00:05:20.260> down<00:05:20.410> into<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:21.340> low<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:21.790> mid

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
probably down into the the low to mid

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.030 
probably down into the the low to mid
30s<00:05:22.180> which<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:22.930> think<00:05:23.110> would<00:05:23.170> be<00:05:23.320> a<00:05:23.500> pretty<00:05:23.950> good

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
30s which I think would be a pretty good

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.860 
30s which I think would be a pretty good
price<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:24.550> pay<00:05:24.670> for<00:05:24.700> a<00:05:24.970> car<00:05:25.210> that<00:05:25.240> has<00:05:25.600> these

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
price to pay for a car that has these

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.420 
price to pay for a car that has these
kind<00:05:26.140> capabilities<00:05:26.800> in<00:05:26.980> this<00:05:27.100> level<00:05:27.250> of

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
kind capabilities in this level of

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.610 
kind capabilities in this level of
comfort<00:05:27.850> I'm<00:05:28.540> not<00:05:28.690> a<00:05:28.720> huge<00:05:28.990> fan<00:05:29.020> of<00:05:29.260> a<00:05:29.440> lot<00:05:29.470> of

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
comfort I'm not a huge fan of a lot of

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.410 
comfort I'm not a huge fan of a lot of
the<00:05:29.740> interior<00:05:30.190> trim<00:05:30.340> pieces<00:05:30.670> but<00:05:31.060> you<00:05:31.270> know

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
the interior trim pieces but you know

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.820 
the interior trim pieces but you know
that's<00:05:31.600> okay<00:05:31.810> it's<00:05:31.990> not<00:05:32.170> it's<00:05:32.350> not<00:05:32.500> a<00:05:32.530> huge

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
that's okay it's not it's not a huge

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.560 
that's okay it's not it's not a huge
deal<00:05:33.010> I'm<00:05:33.460> sure<00:05:33.700> you<00:05:33.820> can<00:05:33.940> option<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.450> out

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
deal I'm sure you can option it out

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.240 
deal I'm sure you can option it out
without<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:35.020> little<00:05:35.140> glass<00:05:35.440> in<00:05:35.710> sets<00:05:36.010> which

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
without the little glass in sets which

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.830 
without the little glass in sets which
is<00:05:36.970> too<00:05:37.480> fussy<00:05:37.810> for<00:05:37.960> me

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.680 

but<00:05:42.830> so<00:05:43.669> I<00:05:43.699> got<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.030> play<00:05:44.180> with<00:05:44.300> some<00:05:44.510> of<00:05:44.540> the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
but so I got to play with some of the

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.290 
but so I got to play with some of the
navigation<00:05:45.580> features<00:05:46.580> you<00:05:46.820> were<00:05:46.910> building

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
navigation features you were building

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.210 
navigation features you were building
with<00:05:47.389> the<00:05:47.600> the<00:05:47.990> iPod<00:05:48.350> interface<00:05:48.560> button<00:05:49.160> you

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
with the the iPod interface button you

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.800 
with the the iPod interface button you
can<00:05:49.370> hook<00:05:49.550> your<00:05:49.699> iPod<00:05:50.030> right<00:05:50.240> into<00:05:50.540> it<00:05:50.660> and

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
can hook your iPod right into it and

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.469 
can hook your iPod right into it and
it's<00:05:51.080> just<00:05:51.169> not<00:05:51.710> very<00:05:52.160> intuitive<00:05:52.550> I<00:05:52.910> wasn't

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
it's just not very intuitive I wasn't

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.780 
it's just not very intuitive I wasn't
happy<00:05:53.660> with<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:54.020> iPod<00:05:54.470> interface<00:05:54.710> I<00:05:55.400> do<00:05:55.580> have

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
an idea to the comment on that because I

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.400

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
connector for an iPhone so the one thing

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.520 
connector for an iPhone so the one thing
that<00:06:14.090> I<00:06:14.120> liked<00:06:14.540> about<00:06:14.720> the<00:06:14.960> pilot<00:06:15.290> was<00:06:15.410> the

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
that I liked about the pilot was the

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.170 
that I liked about the pilot was the
fact<00:06:15.710> that<00:06:15.770> it<00:06:15.919> was<00:06:16.010> a<00:06:16.040> traditional<00:06:16.580> USB

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
fact that it was a traditional USB

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.690 
fact that it was a traditional USB
interface<00:06:17.660> so<00:06:18.110> all<00:06:18.290> you<00:06:18.470> had<00:06:18.680> to<00:06:18.710> do<00:06:18.979> was<00:06:19.280> you

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
interface so all you had to do was you

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.430 
interface so all you had to do was you
knew<00:06:19.970> we<00:06:20.060> had<00:06:20.180> your<00:06:20.330> own<00:06:20.510> cable<00:06:20.900> which<00:06:21.410> you

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
knew we had your own cable which you

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.990 
knew we had your own cable which you
plugged<00:06:21.800> into<00:06:21.919> the<00:06:22.070> USB<00:06:22.310> you<00:06:22.550> didn't<00:06:22.790> have<00:06:22.910> to

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
plugged into the USB you didn't have to

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.360 
plugged into the USB you didn't have to
have<00:06:23.120> a<00:06:23.150> custom<00:06:23.540> cable<00:06:23.900> that<00:06:24.050> in<00:06:24.260> 10<00:06:24.800> years<00:06:24.830> may

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
have a custom cable that in 10 years may
