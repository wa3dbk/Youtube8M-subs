1 gigahertz Edition so that means the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.429 
1 gigahertz Edition so that means the

look no there are benefits they do like
giveaways<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.830> stuff<00:02:23.150> well<00:02:24.150> that's<00:02:24.270> cool

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
giveaways and stuff well that's cool

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.320 
giveaways and stuff well that's cool
okay<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.650> let's<00:02:26.520> go<00:02:26.700> ahead<00:02:29.000> where<00:02:30.000> we<00:02:30.150> will

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
okay so let's go ahead where we will

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.050 
okay so let's go ahead where we will
find<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.140> vapor<00:02:31.470> acts<00:02:31.920> cooler<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.640> what<00:02:32.880> is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
find the vapor acts cooler so what is

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.000 
find the vapor acts cooler so what is
the<00:02:33.300> key<00:02:33.480> difference<00:02:33.630> between<00:02:33.959> vapor<00:02:34.470> chamber

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the key difference between vapor chamber

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.770 
the key difference between vapor chamber
and<00:02:35.190> heat<00:02:35.820> pipe<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.240> see<00:02:36.420> there's<00:02:36.600> heat

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and heat pipe you can see there's heat

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.840 
and heat pipe you can see there's heat
pipes<00:02:37.020> too<00:02:37.290> which<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.680> sort<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.010> fascinating

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
pipes too which is sort of fascinating

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.000 
pipes too which is sort of fascinating
are<00:02:38.940> they<00:02:39.060> vapor<00:02:39.390> chambers

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
are they vapor chambers

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.320 
are they vapor chambers
they<00:02:41.010> look<00:02:41.190> like<00:02:41.310> heat<00:02:41.550> pipes<00:02:41.790> give<00:02:42.209> me<00:02:42.300> a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
they look like heat pipes give me a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.890 
they look like heat pipes give me a
second<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.580> we<00:02:44.970> figured<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.360> out<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.750> this

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
second and we figured it out so this

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.479 
second and we figured it out so this
piece<00:02:46.230> down<00:02:46.470> here<00:02:46.680> at<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.830> very<00:02:46.860> bottom<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.459> a

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
piece down here at the very bottom is a

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.490 
piece down here at the very bottom is a
vapor<00:02:47.730> chamber<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.750> spreads<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.350> heat

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
vapor chamber so that spreads the heat

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.229 
vapor chamber so that spreads the heat
out<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.920> fins<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.400> these<00:02:50.640> heat<00:02:50.970> pipes

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
out to the fins and these heat pipes

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.690 
out to the fins and these heat pipes
right<00:02:51.510> above<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.140> vapor<00:02:52.500> chamber<00:02:52.890> actually

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
right above the vapor chamber actually

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.420 
right above the vapor chamber actually
carry<00:02:54.030> heat<00:02:54.360> out<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.260> far<00:02:55.620> extremities<00:02:56.370> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
carry heat out to the far extremities of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.460 
carry heat out to the far extremities of
the<00:02:56.610> cooler<00:02:57.060> where<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:57.900> be<00:02:58.019> carried<00:02:58.350> away

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
the cooler where it can be carried away

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.190 
the cooler where it can be carried away
by<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.280> fans<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.269> heat<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.050> vapor

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
by the fans so the heat the the vapor

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.810 
by the fans so the heat the the vapor
chamber<00:03:01.590> takes<00:03:01.739> care<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.040> sort<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.489> area

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
chamber takes care of sort of this area

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.850 
chamber takes care of sort of this area
with<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> heat<00:03:03.269> pipes<00:03:03.510> pulling<00:03:03.930> heat<00:03:04.080> away<00:03:04.290> to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
with the heat pipes pulling heat away to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.500 
with the heat pipes pulling heat away to
these<00:03:05.010> areas<00:03:05.430> here<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.910> should<00:03:06.150> give<00:03:06.330> this

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
these areas here that should give this

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.810 
these areas here that should give this
actually<00:03:07.110> very<00:03:07.440> effective<00:03:07.950> coverage<00:03:08.610> in

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
actually very effective coverage in

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.790 
actually very effective coverage in
terms<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.480> cooling<00:03:09.870> because<00:03:09.989> they're<00:03:10.410> using

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
terms of cooling because they're using

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.590 
terms of cooling because they're using
two<00:03:11.130> different<00:03:11.610> technologies<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.360> move<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
two different technologies to move the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.199 
two different technologies to move the
heat<00:03:12.780> away<00:03:12.989> from<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.920> GPU<00:03:14.280> core<00:03:14.670> itself<00:03:14.970> which

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
heat away from the GPU core itself which

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.170 
heat away from the GPU core itself which
is<00:03:15.330> located<00:03:15.810> here<00:03:15.840> out<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:17.459> far<00:03:17.850> reaches

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
is located here out to the far reaches

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.370 
is located here out to the far reaches
of<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.329> cooler<00:03:18.660> because<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.049> can<00:03:19.200> have<00:03:19.260> as

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
of the cooler because you can have as

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.229 
of the cooler because you can have as
big<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> cooler<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.280> want<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:20.820> if<00:03:21.150> you

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
big a cooler as you want and if you

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.150 
big a cooler as you want and if you
don't<00:03:21.420> have<00:03:21.570> an<00:03:21.690> efficient<00:03:22.140> way<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.620> move<00:03:23.010> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
don't have an efficient way to move the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.340 
don't have an efficient way to move the
heat<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.820> far<00:03:24.060> reaching<00:03:24.510> fins<00:03:24.810> then

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
heat to the far reaching fins then

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.380 
heat to the far reaching fins then
basically<00:03:25.829> all<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.310> heats<00:03:26.489> been<00:03:26.700> removed<00:03:27.060> by

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
basically all the heats been removed by

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.410 
basically all the heats been removed by
the<00:03:27.450> time<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:28.860> actually<00:03:29.340> can<00:03:29.579> get<00:03:30.030> over<00:03:30.299> there

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
the time it actually can get over there

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.240 
the time it actually can get over there
and<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:31.170> doing<00:03:31.470> nothing<00:03:31.890> at<00:03:32.070> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
and this is just doing nothing at the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.780 
and this is just doing nothing at the
outsides<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.760> fence<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:34.250> yeah<00:03:35.250> that's

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
outsides of the fence so yeah that's

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.890 
outsides of the fence so yeah that's
pretty<00:03:35.910> much<00:03:36.180> our<00:03:36.329> look<00:03:36.510> at<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.690> cooler

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
pretty much our look at the cooler

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.539 
pretty much our look at the cooler
actually<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> very<00:03:37.829> large<00:03:38.070> cooler<00:03:38.370> so

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
actually this is a very large cooler so

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.039 
actually this is a very large cooler so
the<00:03:38.640> fins<00:03:38.820> go<00:03:39.000> all<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.329> way<00:03:39.450> from<00:03:39.630> over<00:03:39.840> here

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
the fins go all the way from over here

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.620 
the fins go all the way from over here
to<00:03:40.769> all<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.190> way<00:03:41.310> over<00:03:41.549> here<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.239> can<00:03:42.420> see

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
to all the way over here and you can see

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.270 
to all the way over here and you can see
the<00:03:42.840> thickness<00:03:43.079> is<00:03:43.470> actually<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.010> there<00:03:44.190> you

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the thickness is actually in there you

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.190 
the thickness is actually in there you
can<00:03:45.030> look<00:03:45.269> at<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.510> thickness<00:03:45.720> under<00:03:46.079> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
can look at this thickness under the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.830 
can look at this thickness under the
shroud<00:03:46.440> here<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.360> pretty<00:03:48.600> short

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
shroud here so this is a pretty short

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.289 
shroud here so this is a pretty short
card<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.320> uses<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.829> old<00:03:50.190> style<00:03:50.579> placement<00:03:51.150> for

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
card it uses the old style placement for

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.420 
card it uses the old style placement for
the<00:03:51.390> PCI<00:03:51.720> Express<00:03:52.140> connector<00:03:52.560> which<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.070> fine

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
the PCI Express connector which is fine

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.710 
the PCI Express connector which is fine
because<00:03:53.610> since<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.209> short<00:03:54.420> card<00:03:54.630> you

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
because since it's a short card you

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.120 
because since it's a short card you
shouldn't<00:03:54.959> have<00:03:55.140> too<00:03:55.320> much<00:03:55.440> interference<00:03:55.739> in

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
shouldn't have too much interference in

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.380 
shouldn't have too much interference in
terms<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.489> hard<00:03:56.640> drive<00:03:56.820> bays<00:03:57.000> or<00:03:57.209> anything

terms of hard drive bays or anything

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.360 
terms of hard drive bays or anything
like<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:57.660> uses<00:03:58.500> dual<00:03:58.680> eighty<00:03:58.920> millimeter

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
like that uses dual eighty millimeter

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.759 
like that uses dual eighty millimeter
fans<00:03:59.670> for<00:03:59.970> cooling<00:04:00.269> as<00:04:00.420> well<00:04:01.079> as<00:04:01.350> there's<00:04:01.590> our

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
fans for cooling as well as there's our

you<00:04:11.130> can<00:04:11.400> do<00:04:11.579> up<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:12.090> actually<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:12.450> looks<00:04:12.600> like

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
you can do up to actually it looks like

I<00:04:27.310> think<00:04:28.240> that<00:04:28.450> pretty<00:04:28.660> much<00:04:28.810> wraps<00:04:29.080> it<00:04:29.350> up<00:04:29.440> for

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
I think that pretty much wraps it up for

I think that pretty much wraps it up for

we take a look at its performance as

we take a look at its performance as
well<00:04:37.450> as<00:04:37.560> its<00:04:38.560> quiet

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
well as its quiet

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.110 
well as its quiet
miss<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.800> coolness<00:04:41.800> which<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.520> am<00:04:42.580> expecting

both of which to be very very impressive
