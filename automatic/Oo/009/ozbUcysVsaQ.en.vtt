it can use smoke screens which lowers

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.210 
it can use smoke screens which lowers
your<00:06:13.669> accuracy<00:06:14.509> if<00:06:15.169> it<00:06:15.349> uses<00:06:15.500> that<00:06:15.770> like<00:06:16.009> two

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
your accuracy if it uses that like two

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.159 
your accuracy if it uses that like two
or<00:06:16.310> three<00:06:16.340> times<00:06:16.580> so<00:06:17.060> insulins<00:06:17.720> take<00:06:17.900> a<00:06:17.930> plane

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
or three times so insulins take a plane

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.110

of this child if she uses that a few
times<00:06:23.419> you<00:06:23.660> might<00:06:23.870> want<00:06:24.169> to<00:06:24.229> switch<00:06:24.470> your

times you might want to switch your
Pokemon<00:06:25.190> just<00:06:26.030> because<00:06:26.419> that<00:06:26.630> accuracy<00:06:27.199> will

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
Pokemon just because that accuracy will

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.249 
Pokemon just because that accuracy will
really<00:06:27.860> hurt<00:06:28.509> but<00:06:29.509> it<00:06:29.599> goes<00:06:29.750> away<00:06:29.930> whenever

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:30.259 
really hurt but it goes away whenever

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:31.870 
really hurt but it goes away whenever
you<00:06:30.530> switch<00:06:30.710> so<00:06:31.160> it's<00:06:31.280> okay
