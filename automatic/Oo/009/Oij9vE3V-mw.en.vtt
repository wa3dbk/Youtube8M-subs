00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.650
 2014 the suffering of the donkey 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.660
 we are here with one of the main 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.150
 news from samsung for this year that is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 the galaxy note is great dinÃ©a that they 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.320
 give company brought one of the biggest 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.449
 companies that did not have much 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.699
 as the agent she had already shown a 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.070
 another little thing if in that sense but not 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.140
 It was confirmed that he came here with 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.189
 great news as if they can already 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.140
 assembled is this side trim that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.050
 truth is a little screen 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.989
 dedicated what she does 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.770
 it is a center of notifications it 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.400
 a presence that can be seen at a price 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.460
 then the guy has a 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.110
 is the headline of the day for example and she 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.510
 also serves as a shortcut to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.820
 applications in case it replaces that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.810
 software that has many 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.350
 samsung devices from the galaxy s 3 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.770
 and you can for example here pt 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.650
 the camera for example and goes 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.920
 open here in another window is here ae 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.980
 also some additional functions in the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.400
 If I'm showing up here for you it 's 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.300
 Let's see what I can show you. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.720
 more in this sense the little screen is well 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.820
 she has 14 more 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.070
 one more spec he's a guy 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.130
 very similar to the galaxy note 4 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.090
 What changes are the guarantors are the 4 85 7 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.260
 inches 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.210
 already the galaxy is r 5.6 also a 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.970
 resolution with the arrival of 2560 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.119
 1.440 pixels is a very good resolution 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.270
 it is an apparatus of this testimony screen 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.160
 It 's amazing you do not even have it. 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.800
 Hurry a lot and always have a pixel 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.970
 alone there lost is a very 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.630
 beautiful and is very light also thinks only 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.970
 174 grams and so the visual is what 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.730
 We've gotten used to samsung right now. 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.870
 is that design or why round in the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.630
 borders 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.550
 here you see side is also continue 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.840
 being a plastic material but the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.300
 plastic material a little bit more and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.700
 more resistant behind 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.489
 they will also use that protection 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.920
 zinc by a fake nec in the skull that 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.019
 they say it guarantees that it takes 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.190
 even sweaty you can get right in 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.280
 wall 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.040
 it is a very big device and so 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.140
 like the conventional galaxy note it 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.610
 also have this pen it has like those 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.060
 digital sensor features with 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.640
 cardiac output and even rajoelin 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.720
 so I would have a little worse than 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.120
 the one from the hill and 4 is only 3 thousand mh 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.030
 it also close the system and that is 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.700
 you put the plug in question in half 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.459
 time it puts you 50% of the battery 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.139
 very useful for this market 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.819
 is that samsung is picking up 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.939
 clear 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.920
 normal light can also create a 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.530
 device of the type that fla parrish in the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.230
 between the iphone tablet will have 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.629
 a cooler screen but not so big 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.870
 that I can not carry in the pocket of a 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.730
 backpack and that's it but it's to complete 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.000
 the specifications it has a camera 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:35.549
 3.2 megapixel front-facing camera 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.639
 16 megapixel rear and the new one as well 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.730
 of course it has 2048 levels of 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:45.150
 pressure it is very fast it has 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.730
 quite responsive and that's it personal 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.680
 this is that the galaxy note is one of the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.180
 news from samsung here to 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.159
