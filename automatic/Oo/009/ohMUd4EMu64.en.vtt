00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.330 
labor's outside this hall you can mend
there<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:06.780> different<00:01:07.140> combinations<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.040> pull

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
there are different combinations to pull

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.320 
there are different combinations to pull
them<00:01:08.580> I'll<00:01:09.060> explain<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.630> how<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.930> works<00:01:09.960> as
