zombies are starting to pile up just

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
zombies are starting to pile up just
right<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.630> front<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.020> me<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.590> basically<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
right in front of me so basically all I

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.740 
right in front of me so basically all I
gotta<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.030> course<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> shoot<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
gotta do then is of course the shoot a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.480 
gotta do then is of course the shoot a
little<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.250> eventually

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
little bit and then they will eventually

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.069 
little bit and then they will eventually
die<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.270> thing<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.689> guys<00:01:36.869> will

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
die but one thing that you guys will

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.749 
die but one thing that you guys will
have<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> take<00:01:37.500> into<00:01:37.770> consideration<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.729> that

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
have to take into consideration is that

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.810 
have to take into consideration is that
after<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> while<00:01:40.079> some<00:01:40.740> zombies<00:01:41.159> may<00:01:41.369> start<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
after a while some zombies may start to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
after a while some zombies may start to
like<00:01:41.970> die<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.360> their<00:01:42.540> own<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:43.259> bear<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.560> mind

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
like die on their own but bear in mind

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 
like die on their own but bear in mind
that<00:01:43.799> those<00:01:44.009> zombies<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:45.180> come<00:01:45.420> back

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that those zombies do actually come back

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.450 
that those zombies do actually come back
so<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.290> wouldn't<00:01:46.770> say<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.250> died

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
so like I wouldn't say that they died

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460 
so like I wouldn't say that they died
that<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.119> kind<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.390> respawn<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.229> they

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that is kind of respawn and then they

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.370 
that is kind of respawn and then they
will<00:01:49.590> come<00:01:49.799> back<00:01:49.979> again<00:01:50.399> later<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.119> yeah<00:01:52.049> just

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
will come back again later so yeah just

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.289 
will come back again later so yeah just
bear<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.979> mind<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.670> when<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.939> zombies

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
bear that in mind that when the zombies

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060 
bear that in mind that when the zombies
die<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.689> their<00:01:54.840> own<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.500> come<00:01:55.710> back<00:01:55.860> for

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
die on their own they will come back for

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.440 
die on their own they will come back for
you<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.820> pretty<00:01:56.939> much<00:01:57.149> everything

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450
