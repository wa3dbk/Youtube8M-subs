00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:58.269

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:04.570
 rubber ready 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:09.979
 bucket of gallons of liquid rubber costs 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:13.040
 we have developed it with a solvent 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.930

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.410
 what was required to prove 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:53.740

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.630
 here is and protects or protects shorter 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.520
 it is not known what it does but even this 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.630
 makes the client always right 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.370
 Well, I wanted him to do so 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.520

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.000
