00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.590
 superfood is spirulina the 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.410
 Spirulina is a protein rich alga 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.960

 we distribute it and it has a flavor 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.350
 bit stronger you can add a 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.720
 teaspoon of spirulina to your bread

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.200
 third super food are the goya and berries 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.470
 to dehydrated blueberry species 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.519
 but harder and have a flavor 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.730

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.590
 similar the go and barry are very high in 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.209
 antioxidants also provide great 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.800
 amount of beta-carotene this 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.690
 superfood helps us protect 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.760
 our cells against the radicals 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.439
 free that are found 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.780
 from the environment to the 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.540
 same industrialized and processed food 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.239
 that many people consume then is 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.489
 a super antioxidant and it also helps 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.739

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.510

 top of your shakes on top of your 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.280
 oatmeal on top of your quinoa that by the way 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.049
 the sweet quinoa tastes very rich and also 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.489
 I have a recipe on instagram and you 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.310

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.870
 Rich flavor is also a super good 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.019
 option my room super food and I would say 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.629
 that this is my favorite are the people and 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.849
 hemp seeds or hearts of g 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.069
 these little seeds have a flavor like 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:19.099
 between the almond and the seeds of 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.859
 Pistachio squash does not taste 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.810
 as very similar are very rich in 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.909
 essential fatty acids whereby 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.099
 helps reduce the levels of 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.670
 triglycerides reduce levels of 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.530
 Bad cholesterol also helps health 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.200
 cardiovascular by these fatty acids 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.299
 essential is very rich in protein 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.810
 plant origin is excellent for 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.790
 joints 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.569
 reduce inflammation to people who 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.580
 suffers from osteoporosis or arthritis 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.910
 I recommend it 100% to have 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.760
 one so that the pain diminishes go and 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.470

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.599
 antioxidants is rich in calcium in 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.510

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.370
 protein of vegetable origin helps us 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.170
 keep our glucose levels in 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.450
 stable blood and also to reinforce 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.819
 our immune system now I know 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.120
 that many countries is very difficult 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.680

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.570

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.010
