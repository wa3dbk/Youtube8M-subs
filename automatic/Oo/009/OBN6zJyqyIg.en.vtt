and reality thing it's just you know
there<00:01:42.600> are<00:01:42.720> no<00:01:42.750> better<00:01:42.990> stories<00:01:43.380> than<00:01:43.410> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
there are no better stories than the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.680 
there are no better stories than the
ones<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.980> history<00:01:44.490> has<00:01:44.520> told<00:01:44.820> us<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.360> that's

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
ones that history has told us and that's

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.960 
ones that history has told us and that's
where<00:01:45.870> we<00:01:45.990> started<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.580> can<00:01:47.730> we<00:01:47.940> can

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
where we started it's it's we can we can

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.820 
where we started it's it's we can we can
find<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> craziest<00:01:48.660> things<00:01:48.870> to<00:01:49.020> tell<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
find the craziest things to tell but the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.990 
find the craziest things to tell but the
reality<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.280> history<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.730> always

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
reality is that history is always

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.610 
reality is that history is always
crazier<00:01:51.300> than<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.660> think<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.350> that's

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
crazier than what you think and that's

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.680 
crazier than what you think and that's
why<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.250> drive<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.730> make<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:54.060> historical

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
why the drive to make a historical

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.130 
why the drive to make a historical
fiction<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.200> there

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.219 

well<00:02:02.950> we're<00:02:03.220> slated<00:02:03.550> for<00:02:03.670> 2014<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:05.140> know

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
going to be you know big beats coming up

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.870 
going to be you know big beats coming up
I<00:02:11.650> mean<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:11.980> e3<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.340> coming<00:02:12.580> around<00:02:12.730> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
I mean the e3 is coming around the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.910 
I mean the e3 is coming around the
corner<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.390> we<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.319> lot<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.470> chances<00:02:14.860> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
corner and we have a lot of chances to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.520 
corner and we have a lot of chances to
get<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.180> give<00:02:16.480> more<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.900> player<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:17.350> this

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
get and give more to the player but this

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.960 
get and give more to the player but this
has<00:02:17.650> been<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.860> long<00:02:18.040> campaign<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.640> we<00:02:18.730> started

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
has been a long campaign that we started

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.000 
has been a long campaign that we started
with<00:02:19.030> 33<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.230> we're<00:02:20.410> trying<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.830> basically

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
with 33 and we're trying to basically

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.590 
with 33 and we're trying to basically
keep<00:02:21.310> everything<00:02:21.580> sustained<00:02:22.030> because<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.450> know

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
keep everything sustained because I know

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.300 
keep everything sustained because I know
viewers<00:02:23.500> out<00:02:23.650> there<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.920> players<00:02:24.100> out<00:02:24.280> there

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
viewers out there and players out there

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.040 
viewers out there and players out there
wanna<00:02:24.610> know<00:02:24.790> more<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.120> would<00:02:25.540> love<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.870> show

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
wanna know more I would love to show

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:38.030 
wanna know more I would love to show
more<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.250> think<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.550> will<00:02:27.670> very<00:02:27.970> soon

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.770 

so<00:02:39.040> different<00:02:39.640> for<00:02:39.850> everything<00:02:40.330> we're<00:02:40.480> seeing

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
so different for everything we're seeing

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.540 
so different for everything we're seeing
around<00:02:40.930> yeah<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.680> think<00:02:41.860> that's<00:02:42.130> why<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.340> makes

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
around yeah I think that's why it makes

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.280 
around yeah I think that's why it makes
it<00:02:42.730> hard<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.000> describe<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.630> because<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.020> so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
it hard to describe is because it is so

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.530 
it hard to describe is because it is so
different<00:02:44.530> but<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.370> know<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.210> game

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
different but you know the game

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.090 
different but you know the game
designers<00:02:46.930> create<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.620> know<00:02:47.650> wanted<00:02:48.040> to

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
designers create you know wanted to

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.170 
designers create you know wanted to
create<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.340> game<00:02:48.460> that<00:02:48.640> was<00:02:48.760> really<00:02:49.060> not

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
create a game that was really not

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.570 
create a game that was really not
stressful<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:50.110> think<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.860> combination<00:02:51.130> of

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
stressful I think it's a combination of

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.370 
stressful I think it's a combination of
you<00:02:51.970> know<00:02:52.060> beautiful<00:02:52.450> artwork<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.140> sound

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
you know beautiful artwork the sound

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.560 
you know beautiful artwork the sound
design<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:54.010> music<00:02:54.490> sort<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.210> combining

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
design and the music sort of combining

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:03.620 
design and the music sort of combining
in<00:02:55.780> just<00:02:55.960> a<00:02:56.050> relaxing<00:02:56.380> fun<00:02:57.250> atmosphere

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.440 

you<00:03:04.630> cannot<00:03:05.460> multiplayer<00:03:06.460> between<00:03:07.210> them

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
you cannot multiplayer between them

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.210 
you cannot multiplayer between them
right<00:03:08.110> there<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.380> no<00:03:08.440> multiplayer<00:03:08.740> but<00:03:09.100> you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
right there is no multiplayer but you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.430 
right there is no multiplayer but you
can<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.880> supports<00:03:10.390> cross<00:03:10.600> save<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.140> if<00:03:11.260> you're

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
can it supports cross save so if you're

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.160 
can it supports cross save so if you're
playing<00:03:12.190> your<00:03:12.370> game<00:03:12.490> on<00:03:12.640> ps4<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.780> can<00:03:13.930> save<00:03:14.140> a

playing your game on ps4 you can save a
cloud<00:03:14.590> save<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.190> then<00:03:15.340> resume<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.820> on<00:03:15.910> your
