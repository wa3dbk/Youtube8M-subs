the board is not going to be accurate
here<00:03:01.390> since<00:03:01.660> we<00:03:01.780> had<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.930> cut<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.290> out<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:02.710> so<00:03:02.980> I

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
here since we had to cut it out so so I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.800 
here since we had to cut it out so so I
measured<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.580> inside<00:03:03.970> window<00:03:04.300> down<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.720> I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
measured the inside window down and I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.050 
measured the inside window down and I
found<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.440> was<00:03:05.590> 37<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:07.860> 1/4<00:03:08.860> inches<00:03:09.700> so

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
found that it was 37 and 1/4 inches so

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.760 
found that it was 37 and 1/4 inches so
we<00:03:10.090> measured<00:03:10.690> now<00:03:10.930> we're<00:03:11.110> going<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.350> get<00:03:11.620> the

we measured now we're going to get the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.610 
we measured now we're going to get the

where the studs are and there's the hole

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.410 
where the studs are and there's the hole
so<00:04:01.360> we<00:04:01.480> mark<00:04:01.660> where<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.900> studies<00:04:02.730> again<00:04:03.730> mark

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
so we mark where the studies again mark
