00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.130
 hello it 's progress yannick without 

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:06.319
 photos.com today i will answer 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.249
 to one of your questions that I am asked 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.400
 regularly 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:12.020
 how does one do to clean up one's 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.120
 sensor when we have dust on it 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.339
 so already the first thing how 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.109
 to know if we have dust on his 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.630
 sensor ben already we'll see it the most 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.880
 often on these pictures especially in 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.189
 the skies we see tasks with 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.999
 black dots for example so that's it 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.739
 to say that to a dust 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:32.090
 so to be sure you can make a 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:35.530
 picture of a cloudless blue or gray sky 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.109
 or on a white wall you close 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.410
 the goal to f 22 you make a photo 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.269
 and there you will see the dust there 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.370
 there are always one or two who hang out 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.410
 so do not stress too much we do not 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.449
 no more all his photos to and 22 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.539
 what is really an opening a little 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.670
 extreme but it helps to see where 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.620
 are the dust clean up its sensor 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.300
 it's not safe but if you're 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.780
 meticulous and if we respect the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.280
 steps 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.179
 you'll see it's the door and everything 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.899
 the world knows what I'm going to do 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.360
 show today 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.700
 then there are several ways to clean 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.310
 its sensor there are several systems 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.229
 we will not go through all the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.850
 sensor cleaning systems me 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.090
 I picked one that is really very 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.270
 well 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.380
 so these are the Swabian feelers sticks 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.420
 or other brands 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.670
 see it comes in this form 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.259
 so a little stick with a fabric 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.030
 non- abrasive top and solution 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.469
 special for sensors so the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.140
 principle we will put one or two 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.939
 drops on this boat is not going 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.009
 then removed the lens from the camera 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.409
 we will raise the mirror and we will do 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.060
 a round trip on the sensor you 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.369
 see it's not very complicated 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.039
 just is meticulous do not force too much 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.780
 and well respected the steps before 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.270
 start the first thing to do already 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.009
 it's good to charge your battery 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.570
 indeed if you are in the process of 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.700
 clean the sensor is that the device 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.079
 it's a the mirror will go down and he 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.610
 risk of breaking on the boat is 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.530
 so loaded well your 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.320
 tri I know that on nikon devices 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.910
 in general they warn you must 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.650
 charge the battery otherwise we will not be able to 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.170
 to make a sensor arrow it's rather 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.380
 so reassuring then you prepare 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.470
 everything you put in a clean place 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.000
 without drafts without being disturbed and 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.460
 then you prepare all your 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.210
 material to know so the little 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.530
 bottle of lotions and the sensi 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.940
 receive clean slate so then I 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.890
 will show you concretely how 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.630
 it's the first thing to do 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.090
 before cleaning the sensor it's 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.770
 take a little brushstroke to 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.000
 clean the lens is the device you 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:49.660
 see a small soft brush and then 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.660
 here we clean a little bit everywhere 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:59.120
 once it's done you'll go 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:04.989
 in the menu so we will start with 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.190
 cannon cleaning the sensor 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.610
 so there is the apparatus of fact 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.610
 automatically 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.500
 so it's not very efficient in general but 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.060
 you can already tried like that otherwise 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.390
 you pass on manual the mirror will get 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.430
 lure high clean the sensor ok 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.590
 So here we have heard the mirror 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:34.099
 raised so I'm going to remove the lens 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:39.980
 here and there you see the sensor is at 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:43.670
 naked I will now be able to pass the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.420
 stick on the sensor in first 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:53.329
 thing to do I'll put there a 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:59.139
 drop or two on the stick and 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.139
 then I'll go back and forth 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.340
 on the sensor here is my sensor is 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.190
 clean 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:22.900
 I turn off the case and I put 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:25.990
 the objective here was I had more than 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.620
 then to check if the dust has 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.590
 well been removed 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.210
 if that's not the case then I 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.750
 repeat the operation with a new 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.750
 boat is for nikon housings 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.880
 menu then you go on the small 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.990
 adjustable wrench here and you are looking for 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.120
 mirror lock or raise the 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.250
 mirror it depends on the models you 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.200
 press ok start so there he we 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.810
 said when you press the 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.180
 trigger the mirror gets up and 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.570
 the shutter opens to lower the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.130
 mirror turn off the camera we have 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.850
 so I pressed the trigger the 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:15.940
 mirror is raised I remove the lens 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:19.500
 there too we see the sensor so he 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.500
 more than just cleaning it 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:32.310
 so I position the stick well 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.300
 a round trip 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:54.479
 I turn off the mirror of the senses and I put 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:55.020
 the goal and that's my sensor is 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.190
 clean 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.699
 I just have to do one more 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.090
 checking and then a month the handsome 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.229
 blue sky without dust in here 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.880
 you know now clean your 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.800
 sensor you saw it's not very 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.130
 complicated you just have to be meticulous 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.960
 and have the right material so really 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.060
 you're scared doing clean your 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.160
 sensor it costs about thirty or 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.260
 forty euros at a photographer 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.770
 to see also if the photographer has the 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.870
 skills to do it if not know but 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.040
 well it's a little longer try 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.270
 you will see it's not that complicated 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.790
 that at the first time we stress a little 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.419
 but if we respect all 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.360
 Steps 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.520
 there's no worry here we come to 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.250
 video term I hope to have you 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.200
