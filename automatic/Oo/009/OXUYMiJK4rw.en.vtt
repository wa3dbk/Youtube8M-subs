00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.660 

um<00:01:21.810> f1<00:01:22.810> always<00:01:23.259> ships<00:01:23.979> out<00:01:24.159> it's<00:01:24.400> stuff<00:01:24.640> that

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
um f1 always ships out it's stuff that

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.270 
um f1 always ships out it's stuff that
is<00:01:25.090> like<00:01:25.810> ready<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.350> use<00:01:26.500> out<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.890> box<00:01:27.070> so

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
something only through that you really

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.139 
something only through that you really
know<00:01:35.560> what<00:01:35.680> you're<00:01:35.799> doing<00:01:36.009> there's<00:01:36.850> two

things<00:01:37.299> on<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.570> body<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:37.930> can<00:01:37.960> adjust<00:01:38.350> the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
things on the body you can adjust the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.399 
things on the body you can adjust the
first<00:01:38.740> thing<00:01:38.950> is<00:01:39.100> on<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.450> steering<00:01:40.750> lines<00:01:41.049> if

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
first thing is on the steering lines if

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.180 
first thing is on the steering lines if
you<00:01:41.560> pull<00:01:41.770> up<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.039> swimmers

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.390 

under<00:01:45.910> it<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.060> will<00:01:46.300> find<00:01:46.540> some<00:01:46.750> knots<00:01:47.400> that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
under it you will find some knots that

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.610 
under it you will find some knots that
will<00:01:48.790> lengthen<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.360> back<00:01:49.510> lines<00:01:49.780> so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
will lengthen the back lines so

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.430 
will lengthen the back lines so
especially<00:01:51.450> or<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:52.780> also<00:01:52.900> shorten<00:01:53.200> them

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
especially or you can also shorten them

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.230 
especially or you can also shorten them
especially<00:01:54.310> if<00:01:54.370> you've<00:01:54.460> gone<00:01:54.550> for<00:01:54.730> old<00:01:54.880> school

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
maybe you want to shorten up a little if

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.920 
maybe you want to shorten up a little if

touch<00:02:01.240> them<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.690> leave<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.230> just<00:02:02.410> as<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.710> comes

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.590

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
lines you can shorten the front lines

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.440 
lines you can shorten the front lines
which<00:02:12.520> also<00:02:12.670> makes<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.000> front<00:02:13.210> lines<00:02:13.360> in

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
which also makes the front lines in

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.480 
which also makes the front lines in
order<00:02:13.630> or<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.140> also<00:02:14.380> thanks<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.740> them<00:02:14.950> you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:42.460 

you

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.680 

so<00:02:43.010> in<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.220> front<00:02:43.400> lights<00:02:43.670> where<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.450> split

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
so in the front lights where to split

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.730 
so in the front lights where to split
through<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.900> two<00:02:45.020> lines<00:02:45.230> there's<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.530> little

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
through the two lines there's a little

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.860 
through the two lines there's a little
swivel<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.760> case<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.210> blocks<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.720> little

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
swivel in case it blocks a little

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.260 
swivel in case it blocks a little
especially<00:02:48.680> when<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.920> use<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.280> sand<00:02:49.580> or<00:02:50.000> in

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
especially when you use it in sand or in

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.590 
especially when you use it in sand or in
saltwater<00:02:50.780> just<00:02:51.440> dip<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.590> into<00:02:51.800> fresh<00:02:52.100> water

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
saltwater just dip it into fresh water

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.300 
saltwater just dip it into fresh water
make<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.630> rotate<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.590> if<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.770> don't<00:02:54.980> twist<00:02:55.190> it

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
make it rotate and if you don't twist it

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.570 
make it rotate and if you don't twist it
nicely<00:02:55.520> if<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.390> roll<00:02:56.570> up<00:02:56.600> far<00:02:57.070> don't<00:02:58.070> do<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.370> in

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
nicely if you roll up far don't do it in
