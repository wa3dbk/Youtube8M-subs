00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.530
 With over 10,000 employees, we are constantly building the future of health 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.640
 In connection with a top hospital you are seeing makes you need every day 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.290
 we will also become women literally like in emmen where soon one will be 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.650
 new radiotherapy department is being built according to new opening on 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.380
 ecological center to take job search enthusiastic mbps for the function of 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.470
 radio-therapeutic laboratory technician 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.079
 It is made the bank for you 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.520
 the percentage set 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.060
 last season what is rss this has the white house the couple will be tuesday 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.130
 start 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 also 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.950
 we're going to work because of the great challenge currently working 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.470
 in addition, the price for that phase was in 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.300
 if you have been around for some time and with 180 stations, this primary school is in two 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.290
 year 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.260
 this is now a wasteland but in the summer of 2011 there will be a new one 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.390
 give the housing department of fiat 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.700
 it is being worked on but my new workplace but maybe also you and you 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.200
 future workplace 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.690
 for me, working in emmen is working in a small bottle with a lot 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.610
 independence and a wide range of duties a department under construction lasted as long as that 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.500
 this is the solution-oriented approach that is the reason to see the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.320
 cooperation is needed 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.730
 I think it will be incredibly nice if you are a new colleague by profession 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.050
 the quality of the work is recognized in the world and there are of course 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.180
 similar to that of an ordinary one 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.870
 and from now on have worked together you now it would expire the last 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.329
 Home games is also a party party tent 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.329
 and do the positive indications 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.360
 when you have a known guest working there will be an optimum exchange for this 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.350
 with the department in the umcg 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.440
 is regular 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.190
 for example for further training 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.190
 and taking clinical lessons 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.890
 I really enjoy working together 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.200
