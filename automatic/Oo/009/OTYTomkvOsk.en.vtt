00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
after all these years I don't quite

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.200 
after all these years I don't quite
pronounced<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.140> right<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> OBEX

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
pronounced it right but this is the OBEX

pronounced it right but this is the OBEX
case<00:00:30.539> now<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:31.920> does<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.510> mimic<00:00:33.510> more

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
case now this really does a mimic more

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.709 
case now this really does a mimic more
the<00:00:33.960> white<00:00:34.170> proof<00:00:34.620> type<00:00:35.160> cases<00:00:35.520> more<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.690> than

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the white proof type cases more so than

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.190 
the white proof type cases more so than
the<00:00:36.989> lunatic<00:00:37.670> their<00:00:38.670> tactic<00:00:39.239> extreme<00:00:39.899> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
water and dustproof part of that you're

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.850 
water and dustproof part of that you're
going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> cover<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.530> ports

on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.549> iphone<00:01:08.909> 5<00:01:09.180> using<00:01:09.869> these<00:01:10.439> rubber

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
on the iphone 5 using these rubber

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
on the iphone 5 using these rubber
stoppers<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.780> fit<00:01:13.049> pretty<00:01:13.619> well

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
stoppers right here that fit pretty well

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.280 
stoppers right here that fit pretty well
over<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.909> i've<00:01:15.479> used<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.080> about<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
over it so i've used this for about a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.260 
over it so i've used this for about a
week<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.799> want<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> limited<00:01:17.640> cases<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
week and I want the limited cases and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.679 
week and I want the limited cases and
figured<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.409> my<00:01:19.439> video<00:01:19.890> review<00:01:19.950> now

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
figured I would do my video review now

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.030 
figured I would do my video review now
coming<00:01:21.689> back<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.830> have

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
coming back to this one so I have

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.950 
coming back to this one so I have
something<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.460> compare<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.930> previous

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
something to compare with the previous

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.550 
something to compare with the previous
two<00:01:25.500> cases<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.159> had<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.640> my<00:01:26.759> iPhone<00:01:27.210> thought

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
two cases I had on my iPhone thought

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.780 
two cases I had on my iPhone thought
obviously<00:01:28.560> there's<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:28.860> Allen<00:01:29.250> screws<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
obviously there's no Allen screws to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.310 
obviously there's no Allen screws to
install<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.049> fairly

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
install on this is going to be fairly

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.069 
install on this is going to be fairly
easy<00:01:31.970> all<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.540> off<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
easy all you do is take it off here you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.990 
easy all you do is take it off here you
can<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.650> red<00:01:34.979> ring<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.549> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
can see this red ring right here that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030 
can see this red ring right here that
that<00:01:36.299> adds<00:01:36.509> an<00:01:36.810> extra<00:01:37.380> layer<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.950> protection

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that adds an extra layer of protection

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640 
that adds an extra layer of protection
to<00:01:38.520> seal<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.360> iphone<00:01:39.810> 5<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.409> make<00:01:40.619> sure

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
to seal in the iphone 5 so make sure

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.490 
to seal in the iphone 5 so make sure
that's<00:01:41.009> lined<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.549> pretty<00:01:42.240> decent<00:01:42.840> looks<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that's lined up pretty decent looks a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.880 
that's lined up pretty decent looks a
little<00:01:43.649> curved<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.350> iphone<00:01:46.350> 5<00:01:46.590> goes

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
little curved there so iphone 5 goes

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.109 
little curved there so iphone 5 goes
down<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.430> there's<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.850> screen

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
down you can see there's a screen

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.480 
down you can see there's a screen
protector<00:01:48.270> much<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.470> tactic<00:01:49.979> extreme

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
protector much like the tactic extreme

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.210 
protector much like the tactic extreme
so<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.540> i<00:01:51.600> want<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:51.990> get<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.409> cloth<00:01:52.740> and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
as it focuses a little bit you use a

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.180 
as it focuses a little bit you use a
coin<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:13.510> basically<00:03:13.930> put<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.710> there<00:03:14.920> and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
coin to basically put it in there and

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.490 
coin to basically put it in there and
turn<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.090> will<00:03:16.270> open<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.630> case<00:03:16.840> back<00:03:17.170> up

turn and that will open the case back up
so<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.130> can<00:03:18.310> take<00:03:18.460> it<00:03:18.580> out<00:03:18.670> pretty<00:03:18.910> easily<00:03:19.290> now

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290

hit the spacebar anything right around
this<00:03:55.540> edge<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.110> that<00:03:56.860> can<00:03:57.040> be<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.190> little

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
this edge and that can be a little

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.949 
this edge and that can be a little
problem<00:03:57.790> same<00:03:58.060> thing<00:03:58.270> if<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.450> go<00:03:58.660> from<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
problem same thing if you go from the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.410 
problem same thing if you go from the
notifications<00:03:59.709> they<00:04:00.670> have<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.850> cover<00:04:01.120> right

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
here and that can get in the way of the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.750 
here and that can get in the way of the
feedback<00:04:05.140> for<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.650> swipe<00:04:06.280> down<00:04:06.490> from<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
feedback for the swipe down from the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.580 
feedback for the swipe down from the
notification<00:04:07.360> so<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.540> outside<00:04:08.050> of<00:04:08.110> these<00:04:08.290> two

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590
