00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.170 
and opening up there never knew the
short<00:02:11.920> term<00:02:12.130> mission<00:02:12.459> trips<00:02:12.490> that<00:02:12.910> I've<00:02:13.060> been

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
short term mission trips that I've been

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.150 
short term mission trips that I've been
involved<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.780> here<00:02:13.990> in<00:02:14.080> Mozambique<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.890> thought

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
involved in here in Mozambique I thought

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.480 
involved in here in Mozambique I thought
the<00:02:15.400> idea<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:16.380> dental<00:02:17.380> care<00:02:17.650> specifically

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
the idea of dental care specifically

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.840 
the idea of dental care specifically
because<00:02:18.820> as<00:02:19.150> I've<00:02:19.720> been<00:02:20.020> in<00:02:20.200> Africa<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:21.250> see

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
because as I've been in Africa I see

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.140 
because as I've been in Africa I see
that<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.810> most<00:02:23.080> pressing<00:02:23.560> need<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.850> you

that is the most pressing need that you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.470 
that is the most pressing need that you
can<00:02:25.360> meet<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:26.380> will<00:02:26.590> provide<00:02:27.040> long<00:02:27.400> lasting

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
can meet that will provide long lasting

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.630 
can meet that will provide long lasting

pivotal<00:04:31.520> things<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.590> caught<00:04:33.590> my<00:04:33.800> attention

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
pivotal things that caught my attention

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.490 
pivotal things that caught my attention
about<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.760> itec<00:04:35.150> way<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.510> doing<00:04:35.870> things<00:04:36.140> is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
about the itec way of doing things is

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.130 
about the itec way of doing things is
when<00:04:37.040> we<00:04:37.190> leave<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.669> ministry<00:04:38.150> continues<00:04:38.270> and

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
when we leave the ministry continues and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.850 
when we leave the ministry continues and

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
but even when we go and we do all the

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.520 
but even when we go and we do all the
homework<00:04:45.219> up<00:04:45.580> front<00:04:45.610> we<00:04:46.569> try<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.900> best<00:04:47.319> that
