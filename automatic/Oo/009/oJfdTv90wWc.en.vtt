00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
wrong in ikkaku because I think that he

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.550 
wrong in ikkaku because I think that he
has<00:02:49.159> the<00:02:49.370> potential<00:02:49.669> to<00:02:49.849> be<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.209> world<00:02:51.079> world

world class striker and I think it's

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.209 
world class striker and I think it's
very<00:02:53.540> very<00:02:53.989> scary<00:02:54.469> that<00:02:54.709> were<00:02:54.799> willing<00:02:54.980> to

very very scary that were willing to

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.530 
very very scary that were willing to
