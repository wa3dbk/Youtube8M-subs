thought it'd be a good opportunity to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.089 
thought it'd be a good opportunity to
kind<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.510> sit<00:00:24.750> down<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:24.960> video<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.529> stand<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:25.980> i

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
kind of sit down on video or stand up i

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.679

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
guess since that's technically what i'm

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.660

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
display which gets into my other thing
but<00:01:27.780> we'll<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:29.100> second

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
but we'll get to that in just a second

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.440 
but we'll get to that in just a second
it's<00:01:29.549> obvious<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.119> larger

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it's obvious going to have a larger

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.300 
it's obvious going to have a larger
display<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.439> our<00:01:31.590> most<00:01:31.770> likely<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
display so our most likely gonna have a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.560 
display so our most likely gonna have a
larger<00:01:32.579> display<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.060> needs<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.390> bigger

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
larger display so it needs a bigger

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.910 
larger display so it needs a bigger
battery<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.140> need<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.409> able<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
battery we need to be able to get this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.350 
battery we need to be able to get this
device<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.220> make<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:35.970> way<00:01:36.090> through

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the day without a doubt you know I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
the day without a doubt you know I
iphone<00:01:38.460> 4s<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.060> pretty<00:01:39.570> decent<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
iphone 4s is pretty decent in the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.420 
iphone 4s is pretty decent in the
battery<00:01:40.350> life<00:01:40.470> departments<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.310> bit

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
battery life departments a little bit

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
battery life departments a little bit
worse<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:41.970> opinion<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> iphone<00:01:42.899> 4<00:01:43.200> but

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
worse in my opinion in the iphone 4 but

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
worse in my opinion in the iphone 4 but
based<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.770> my<00:01:43.829> testing<00:01:44.490> I'm<00:01:44.939> able<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.299> make<00:01:45.450> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
based on my testing I'm able to make it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
based on my testing I'm able to make it
through<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.780> day<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> case<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
through a day that's not the case with a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.590 
through a day that's not the case with a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
making it through the day and they're

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
making it through the day and they're
hoping<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.729> all<00:01:50.909> these<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.210> incremental
