00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello let's go with another summer recipe in 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.840
 this occasion is a chicken sandwich with 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.199
 mayonnaise the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.890
 Slicing the chicken breast 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.890
 we pepper 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.320
 and we put it on the grill 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.820
 it is not necessary to add oil and we are going 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.550
 to leave enough time for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.650
 caramelize well and be very tasty if 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.870
 we let it dry for a long time but as 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.370
 then we are going to chop it, no problem 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.500
 here what we are interested in is that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.860
 well tasty on the other hand let's chop 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.860
 the onion 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.590
 and we're going to put it in salt water for 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.590
 make it softer 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.460
 and let's go with the mayonnaise that can be 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.290
 Do with extra virgin olive oil or 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.140
 if you want it softer with oil 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.260
 sunflower a pinch of salt an egg and a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.140
 trickle of lemon juice 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.330
 we beat you already know from below up is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.950
 say submerge the blender and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.050
 then you go taking it out little by little 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.490
 until the mayonnaise comes out to me the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.740
 It's true that I'm pretty liquid 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.510
 so if you have some trick so 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.510
 get thicker you let me know 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.100
 do not 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.540
 when this is already removed the chicken and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.090
 we let it cool down a second to not 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.090
 burn our fingers we chop it 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.799
 and we put it in a big bowl 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.430
 next to the pitted black olives 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.460
 and also chopped some pickles 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.390
 sliced ​​some capers the onion and 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.390
 finally the mayonnaise 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.600
 Y 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.600
 we mix it well 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.910
 probably do not need to add salt 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.710
 because the chicken already had and the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.500
 capers and the movies are pretty 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.060
 salted with this mixture we are going to fill 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.060
 the mold bread sandwich 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.730
 and this is so simple it's easy to 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.770
 make cool we can keep it in the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.000
 fridge a good solution for summer 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.840
 Well I hope you liked a 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.840
 hug until then 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.300
 but
