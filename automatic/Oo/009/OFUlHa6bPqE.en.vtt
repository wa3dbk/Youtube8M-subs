00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
anything else besides silver a pair of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.590 
anything else besides silver a pair of
Masters<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.460> inside<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> box<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.420> your

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
Masters so inside the box you have your

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
Masters so inside the box you have your
Clippers<00:01:03.989> inside<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> case<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.339> have

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
Clippers inside a case and then you have

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.670 
Clippers inside a case and then you have
the<00:01:05.580> typical<00:01:06.170> instructions<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.380> really

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the typical instructions that really

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.590 
the typical instructions that really
don't<00:01:07.860> mean<00:01:08.010> much<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.490> some<00:01:09.119> oil<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.479> you're

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
don't mean much and some oil that you're

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.260 
don't mean much and some oil that you're
probably<00:01:09.750> never<00:01:09.930> use<00:01:10.490> that's<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.939> so

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
probably never use that's about it so

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.560 
probably never use that's about it so
this<00:01:12.510> box<00:01:12.750> will<00:01:13.020> straight<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> garbage

them up and down they do feel a little
bit<00:02:04.079> different<00:02:04.500> maybe<00:02:04.590> there's<00:02:04.890> weight

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
bit different maybe there's weight

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.050 
bit different maybe there's weight
distributed<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:07.610> not<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> normal<00:02:09.000> way

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
distributed you know not the normal way

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.680 
distributed you know not the normal way
but<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> comes<00:02:10.259> with<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> nice<00:02:11.220> black<00:02:11.610> blade<00:02:12.090> now

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.940 
but it comes with a nice black blade now
I<00:02:12.720> could<00:02:12.959> see<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.349> little<00:02:13.470> so

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
I could see this a little so

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.800 
I could see this a little so
on<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.160> corner<00:02:14.490> here<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.569> definitely

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
on the corner here so this is definitely

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.920 
on the corner here so this is definitely
a<00:02:15.990> painted<00:02:16.410> black<00:02:16.709> blade<00:02:17.630> but<00:02:18.630> everything

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
a painted black blade but everything

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.680 
a painted black blade but everything
else<00:02:19.050> looks<00:02:19.170> pretty<00:02:19.680> much<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.860> same<00:02:20.190> nothing

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
else looks pretty much the same nothing

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.390 
else looks pretty much the same nothing
nothing<00:02:21.690> really<00:02:21.780> changed<00:02:22.349> just<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> black

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
nothing really changed just the black

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.130 
nothing really changed just the black
cover<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.060> nice<00:02:24.239> faceplate<00:02:24.840> they<00:02:24.989> have

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
cover and the nice faceplate they have

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.280 
cover and the nice faceplate they have
here<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.060> do<00:02:27.209> happen<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.569> buy<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> pair

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
here so if you do happen to buy a pair

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.320 
here so if you do happen to buy a pair
of<00:02:28.319> these<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.800> pretty<00:02:29.190> much<00:02:29.310> what<00:02:30.150> you're

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
of these it's pretty much what you're

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.150 
one stem that branches off into two
separate<00:04:25.510> blades<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:26.710> looks<00:04:26.949> like<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.130> has

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
separate blades this looks like it has

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.920 
separate blades this looks like it has
two<00:04:27.490> different<00:04:27.639> stems<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.300> hold<00:04:28.510> each<00:04:28.660> blade

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
two different stems to hold each blade

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.820 
two different stems to hold each blade
so<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:31.600> might<00:04:31.750> be<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.930> difference<00:04:32.650> who

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
so that might be the difference who

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.500 
so that might be the difference who
