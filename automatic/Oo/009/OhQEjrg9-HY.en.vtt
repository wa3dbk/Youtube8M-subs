00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.760
Te Matatini 2013 is fast
approaching,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.200
where 41 groups will take to
the stage for four days

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.760
of competition in Rotorua.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.840
Teams such as Rangiwewehi
and Manutaki

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.040
didn't make the grade
at regional level,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.760
so how successful will past winners

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.800
be against new teams
at the nationals?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.280
We asked Professor Timoti Karetu
for his provocative view

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.080
on the competition this year.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.920
I think it's all about the energy

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.480
and skill of the performers,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360
the clarity of diction,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.960
the execution of hand movements
which are appropriate to the lyrics.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.920
That's what distinguishes a group.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.280
That's why I appreciate
Te Whanau a Apanui.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.440
No matter where I go, wherever
it may be among our people,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.720
I always go back
to Te Whanau a Apanui

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.480
because they are doing
all of these things.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.720
They do jump around a lot,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.160
but this is what they're known for.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.960
A group like that can do anything,
every one of them.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.560
If the leader is boring, so too
will be the group, no matter what.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.160
To me, the best male leader
is Wetini (Mitai Ngatai).

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.920
He invigorates his group,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.680
he's skilled in using Maori
weaponry, and he has presence.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:26.440
The dynamism of a group is dependent
on its leader being dynamic.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.720
I like this group
because of what they embody.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.600
Waka Huia has a very special
way about them.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.680
They don't show off when they win,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.480
nor do they say anything
when they don't win.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.280
That's what they're like.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.120
They wait until they're
amongst their own

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880
to express how they feel.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.240
It's hard staying
at the top of your game.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.240
That's why I admire Te Waka Huia.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.640
They achieve this, time and again.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.280
There may be some years
when their performance is weaker,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.640
and other years when they
come out stronger than ever.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.400
I've heard that Waihirere

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.120
have returned to their former glory.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.000
To me, they are the ideal.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
They typify Maori performance.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.680
Many groups don't do this,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.040
as they are focused instead
on doing their own thing,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.520
they forget about performing
with energy and vigour,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.320
while still having clarity
in their words.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.240
There have been some grumbling about
so many groups from the one region

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.880
being in the same pool,
but what can you do?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.360
If the draw is picked
from a hat, that's it.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.400
That perhaps is the only impartial
way of doing this.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.120
If it became dependent on how well
you performed previously,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.240
some groups wouldn't make the cut.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.240
What advice do I have for judges?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.440
Current judges have the misfortune
of having to stick to criteria set

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.160
by the organising committee -
I'm not really sure.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.360
But if I feel the energy
and appeal of a group,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.240
if they make me feel like
jumping up on stage with them,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.280
to me, they've hit the mark.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.840
Food for thought.
