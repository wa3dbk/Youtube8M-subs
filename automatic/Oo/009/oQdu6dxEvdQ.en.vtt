00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.480 
develop because the high blood sugar
actually<00:03:47.080> enters<00:03:47.380> into<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.830> lens<00:03:48.070> of<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.460> eye

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
actually enters into the lens of the eye

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.600 
actually enters into the lens of the eye
and<00:03:48.940> then<00:03:49.750> it's<00:03:49.960> converted<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.860> sugar<00:03:51.190> like

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
and then it's converted to a sugar like

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.360 
and then it's converted to a sugar like
sorbitol<00:03:52.300> for<00:03:52.570> instance<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.200> sorbitol<00:03:53.830> then

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
sorbitol for instance and sorbitol then

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.510 
sorbitol for instance and sorbitol then
can't<00:03:54.790> get<00:03:55.270> back<00:03:55.420> out<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.230> lens<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.800> then

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
can't get back out of the lens and then

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.390 
can't get back out of the lens and then
water<00:03:57.880> follows<00:03:58.600> into<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.140> lens<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.710> so<00:04:00.220> as<00:04:00.370> a

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
water follows into the lens and so as a

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.420 
water follows into the lens and so as a
water<00:04:00.670> comes<00:04:01.150> into<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.540> lens<00:04:01.720> then<00:04:02.430> breaks

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
water comes into the lens then breaks

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.520 
water comes into the lens then breaks
down<00:04:03.640> some<00:04:03.910> little<00:04:04.180> fibers<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.990> the<00:04:05.080> lens<00:04:05.290> and

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
down some little fibers of the lens and

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:13.770 
down some little fibers of the lens and
that<00:04:05.710> causes<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:06.130> cataract<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.790> develop<00:04:12.780> dr.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
that causes a cataract to develop dr.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.360 
that causes a cataract to develop dr.
wise<00:04:13.960> did<00:04:14.380> tell<00:04:14.560> us<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:14.740> there<00:04:15.070> was<00:04:15.220> an

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
wise did tell us that there was an

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.920 
wise did tell us that there was an
opportunity<00:04:15.490> for<00:04:15.970> him<00:04:16.180> potentially<00:04:16.420> to<00:04:16.810> have

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
opportunity for him potentially to have

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.440 
opportunity for him potentially to have
surgery<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.530> remove<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.859> cataracts<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:19.210> she

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
surgery to remove the cataracts that she

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.789 
surgery to remove the cataracts that she
thought<00:04:19.570> he<00:04:19.690> was<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.840> decent<00:04:20.170> candidate<00:04:20.680> based

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
thought he was a decent candidate based

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.560 
thought he was a decent candidate based
upon<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.220> fact<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.430> he<00:04:21.580> was<00:04:21.640> young<00:04:21.880> that<00:04:22.090> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
upon the fact that he was young that the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.290 
upon the fact that he was young that the
cataracts<00:04:22.900> came<00:04:23.080> on<00:04:23.290> as<00:04:23.470> fast<00:04:23.590> as<00:04:23.770> they<00:04:23.920> did

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
cataracts came on as fast as they did

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.730 
cataracts came on as fast as they did
however<00:04:25.300> what<00:04:25.510> we<00:04:25.600> needed<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.900> do<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:26.260> get<00:04:26.410> his

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
however what we needed to do is get his

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.220 
however what we needed to do is get his
levels<00:04:27.490> as<00:04:27.640> glucose<00:04:28.000> levels<00:04:28.330> stabilized

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
levels as glucose levels stabilized

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.080 
levels as glucose levels stabilized
before<00:04:29.590> they<00:04:29.860> would<00:04:30.010> be<00:04:30.160> able<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:30.880> do<00:04:30.970> the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
before they would be able to do the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.290 
before they would be able to do the
surgery<00:04:31.270> so<00:04:31.990> that's<00:04:32.770> why<00:04:33.040> glucose<00:04:33.700> monitoring

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
surgery so that's why glucose monitoring

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.040 
surgery so that's why glucose monitoring
was

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
was

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.230 
was
home<00:04:35.199> was<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:35.770> important<00:04:36.310> these<00:04:36.729> owners<00:04:37.000> were

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
home was so important these owners were

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.760 
home was so important these owners were
very<00:04:37.449> interested<00:04:37.750> in<00:04:38.139> doing<00:04:38.379> whatever<00:04:38.530> they

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
very interested in doing whatever they

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.249 
very interested in doing whatever they
could<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.009> help<00:04:39.220> him<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:40.270> they<00:04:40.569> they<00:04:40.930> had<00:04:41.080> not

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
could to help him so they they had not

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.839 
could to help him so they they had not
they<00:04:41.800> didn't<00:04:42.039> know<00:04:42.129> anything<00:04:42.159> about<00:04:42.520> how

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
they didn't know anything about how

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.159 
they didn't know anything about how
monitoring<00:04:43.389> he<00:04:43.509> had<00:04:43.599> not<00:04:43.750> heard<00:04:43.990> about

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
monitoring he had not heard about

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.499 
monitoring he had not heard about
checking<00:04:44.860> blood<00:04:44.979> glucose<00:04:45.400> at<00:04:45.550> home<00:04:45.729> but<00:04:46.030> they

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
checking blood glucose at home but they

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.140 
checking blood glucose at home but they
immediately<00:04:47.129> wanted<00:04:48.129> to<00:04:48.280> start<00:04:48.580> home

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
immediately wanted to start home

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.850 
immediately wanted to start home
monitoring<00:04:49.629> they<00:04:49.900> did<00:04:50.110> so<00:04:50.409> we<00:04:50.530> just<00:04:50.680> have<00:04:50.830> a

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
monitoring they did so we just have a

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.210 
monitoring they did so we just have a
little<00:04:51.099> monitor<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:52.800> we<00:04:53.800> need<00:04:53.949> to<00:04:54.009> take<00:04:54.159> a

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
little monitor and we need to take a

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.640 
little monitor and we need to take a
blood<00:04:54.460> sample<00:04:54.520> like<00:04:55.090> any<00:04:55.349> diabetic<00:04:56.349> you<00:04:56.500> need

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
blood sample like any diabetic you need

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.159 
blood sample like any diabetic you need
a<00:04:56.680> little<00:04:56.919> blood<00:04:57.190> sample<00:04:57.699> just<00:04:58.120> prick<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.629> the

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
a little blood sample just prick it the

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.730 
a little blood sample just prick it the
inside<00:04:59.710> of<00:05:00.129> the<00:05:00.879> of<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.419> gum<00:05:01.629> right<00:05:01.840> here<00:05:02.199> with

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
inside of the of the gum right here with

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.339 
inside of the of the gum right here with
a<00:05:02.770> Landsat<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.909> then<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.300> take<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.960> strip

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
a Landsat and then you take the strip

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.680 
a Landsat and then you take the strip
and<00:05:05.590> get<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.490> little<00:05:06.789> blood<00:05:06.909> sample<00:05:07.330> in<00:05:07.449> there

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
and get a little blood sample in there

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.980 
and get a little blood sample in there
put<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.349> in<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.560> monitor<00:05:09.009> and<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:10.419> then<00:05:10.840> you

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
put it in the monitor and and then you

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.820 
put it in the monitor and and then you
get<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.469> get<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:12.129> reading<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:13.560> 167<00:05:14.560> is<00:05:14.680> is

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
get the get the reading so 167 is is

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.369 
get the get the reading so 167 is is
reading<00:05:15.190> which<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.490> um<00:05:15.759> right<00:05:16.479> in<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.840> normal

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
reading which is um right in the normal

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.339 
reading which is um right in the normal
range<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:18.159> the<00:05:18.460> range<00:05:19.120> you<00:05:19.210> want<00:05:19.449> for<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.810> dog

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
did and got his cataract surgery done

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.360 
did and got his cataract surgery done
