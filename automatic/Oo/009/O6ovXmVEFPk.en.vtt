use<00:01:38.820> some<00:01:38.970> extension<00:01:39.540> rods<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.079> work<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.470> those

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
use some extension rods to work on those

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
use some extension rods to work on those
shoes<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> notice<00:01:41.850> I've<00:01:42.090> got<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.390> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and the floor wasted space I can put

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.219
