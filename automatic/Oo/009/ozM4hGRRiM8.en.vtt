00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the next step is to repeat on the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.830 
the next step is to repeat on the
opposite<00:02:20.100> side<00:02:20.370> when<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.090> go<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.300> take<00:02:21.660> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
hair and bring it through the loop er

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.790 
hair and bring it through the loop er
make<00:02:23.640> sure<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.450> right<00:02:24.720> amount<00:02:24.900> too

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
much hair can cause the loop to jam so

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.050 
much hair can cause the loop to jam so
you'll<00:02:28.350> want<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.680> start<00:02:29.040> over<00:02:29.280> if<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.670> does

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
you'll want to start over if that does

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.780 
you'll want to start over if that does
