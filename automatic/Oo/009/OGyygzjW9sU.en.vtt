 this occasion is answering some 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.320
 question of you that very kindly 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.070
 They send their comments through the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.289
 silva videos 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.699
 to recommend that you also visit my 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.099
 website here below is 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.099
 appearing the address 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.350
 so that they can download a plan 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.080
 to make an airplane there are many 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.180
 places on the internet that you can 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.670
 find where the plans can download 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.879
 for free for free 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.400
 This is an example that I am going to show you 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.650
 of a plane now you download a 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.530
 generally, they can come 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.500
 many file formats the most common 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.500
 is that they come in a pdf format and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.170
 you who are going to see them are going to see 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.090
 better the files one where it comes 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.480
 an image like this where it comes from 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.780
 the whole plane 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.690
 indicated on a single sheet and then they go 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:19.530
 to see in another file 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.580
 the plane where it comes flexed 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.580
 Part by part 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.700
 what is there to cut 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.440
 you have to cut them 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.270
 the parts 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.700
 for example how is this 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.340
 you have to cut 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.609
 and join them 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.240
 you have to cut them together for once 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:51.560
 that our parts are united 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.360
 on paper we are going to translate them into our 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.800
 material but here 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.800
 what has been working 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.270
 this 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.420
 clear cut 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.709
 the form to then stick it on it 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.940
 in the material and will cut me here 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.130
 previously also 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.110
 in this same plane 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.330
 although the report 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:28.100
 stick them with with tapes has here the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:32.670
 material easily and based on that I 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.849
 he cut it out and cut it out completely 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.970
 all cuts are indicated here 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.090
 what do we have to do in what position 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.300
 the position wing goes the helm 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.510
 not what position the elevator goes all the 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.180
 cuts are indicated in such a way 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.660
 to give us this 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.090
 trim our model is the fuselage 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.090
 in this case here is also 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.519
 if on the internet it is easier to get 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.730
 look for those if there is one there is a very 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.879
 known to very famous I think that of the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.670
 forums more traveled around the world than 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:21.659
 it's called rc groups here I'm going to put 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.180
 also the address so that they visit it 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.750
 and there you will find an infinity of 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.079
 plans and tips and techniques to assemble 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.760
 any aircraft model inclusive 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.379
 come other issues has everything that 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.920
 have to see related to the 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:40.200
 model cars cars helicopters 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.690
 boats and so on, I'm really not going to 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.190
 let go the directions are not you 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.709
