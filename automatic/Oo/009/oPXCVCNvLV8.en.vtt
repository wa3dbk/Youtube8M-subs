 hi how many people from youtube my 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280
 name is richard x cavazos and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.590
 welcome to a new video where I am going to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.439
 show or answer any questions that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.970
 they have with a df-el and that the truth is 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.490
 a page that I liked 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.480
 He has caught my attention and good that 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.400
 I'm going to do in this video 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.380
 I'm just going to show the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.720
 people who do not know that that df of it 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.910
 is a page where the links change 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.980
 By others 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.750
 so that you can advertise an example 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.420
 of hotel is a web page where you have 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.210
 more than a thousand daily visits to you 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.950
 register in happy and good is your link and 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.520
 is going to give you another link which you have to 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.980
 paste somewhere so that at the moment 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.540
 that they give link to this page opens 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.870
 your page but before your 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.460
 page will open advertising although there 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.670
 three is a bit difficult to understand but 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.540
 good an example I would have 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.510
 a page of what you think 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.810
 from socials 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.540
 well I would copy it and pray it here and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.229
 another language at the moment he gives me 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.229
 other link 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.380
 any link him after what will 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.290
 paste here and put it here so that we 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.540
 convert the link 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.130
 in one of these links and at the moment of 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.710
 that we click on first one 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.080
 advertising and then page 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.970
 you so that they pay us for 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.520
 advertising is valid and I also do this 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.890
 video to see what to tell them if 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.070
 pay as you can see, what is this 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.320
 account a month ago and I had around 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.840
 five thousand visits and how can you see here 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.610
 there will be a total of 5 or 5 dollars with 24 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.980
 cents worth here is in the 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.130
 transaction and good would be yesterday since I 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.790
 arrived the paypal mail that is once 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.780
 sent 524 dollars which is what I 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.390
 So they sent in the happy and good 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.660
 here I already have my balance of 50 dollars that 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.920
 Mexican companies would be 65 pesos worth 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.480
 good guys more than anything this video 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.790
 which is to say that I do it so that 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.190
 show them that these pages and for and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.140
 everything and well then simply the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.900
 information as I tell you would be that 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.410
 they pay you one dollar for every thousand visits and 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.300
 if you would be more interested 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.160
