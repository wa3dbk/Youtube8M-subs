and the moment you just touch it even
with<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> dart<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.829> your<00:03:15.340> print<00:03:15.790> still<00:03:16.060> on<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.109> so

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
with a dart it your print still on it so

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.800

so<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.220> kind<00:03:18.489> of<00:03:18.519> liked<00:03:18.670> about<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:19.209> case<00:03:19.600> with

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
so I kind of liked about the case with

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.750 
so I kind of liked about the case with
here<00:03:20.310> let's<00:03:21.310> open<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.760> up

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
here let's open it up
