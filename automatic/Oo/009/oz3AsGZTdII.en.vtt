00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.520
 hello everyone if you take care 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.650
 represented by thomas in this video 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.720
 we talked about the second 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.360
 lenses for pro pro from polar pro 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.100
 so it's the neutral density so 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.739
 which is totally water resistant 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.710
 and who is precisely for the aero 3 plus 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.780
 and not for roads 3 so that's 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.280
 simple i will make you a little 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.290
 unpacking and after I beg you to 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 what's the point of unpacking 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.590
 in the box we have like last 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.700
 times so I invite you to go see my 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.170
 last video that was for the 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.470
 mackerel so this time it's for 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.000
 a neutral density so look at that 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.710
 it can give you a little example to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.449
 the back and that actually makes it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.280
 slow down the shutter speed of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.990
 the device allows to illustrate the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.880
 very fast movements reduce the effect 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.800
 yellow so the effect of oscillations 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.570
 the effect of freezing that we had a little on 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.310
 the old gopro so there you have it 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.960
 no more and it's really a 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.180
 ideal lens for all every 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.350
 motorized sports so your motorcycles 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.450
 etc. 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.680
 so we have there little ties that allows 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.850
 not to drop the lens at 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.130
 case where we have of course the small bag 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.990
 which allows us not only to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.670
 clean our lenses but also 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.810
 protect it because you can put everything 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 inside it's a little bag 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.360
 show you like these and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.540
 so I used it quite often 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.680
 for my bike and my car because we have 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.720
 really a speed effect and I you 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.950
 show it after by pictures so 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.330
 I did not make a video specifically 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.740
 because we do not see very well the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.000
 difference that a video is a video 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.830
 but on a photo we really see the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.060
 difference so I find more 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.260
 that on the gopro his farm indeed 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.450
 professional we have something 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.520
 ultra flat and in addition that resists 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.170
 water so why not so I love 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.900
 really this product is the anti for go 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.210
 pro it's really pro so we're going 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.920
 go from leak to test which here is the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.509
 top lens with neutral intensity 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.009
 and at the bottom we do not have it we see this effect 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.560
 speed and got a little bit more 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.590
 dark so that's normal seems here I 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.390
 will you offer the lens down to 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.769
 left and without a lens at the top right 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.860
 immediately have the difference the effect 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.840
 speed and I still have a small 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.230
 last example so the same with the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.450
 car 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.519
 the neutral density at the bottom left and 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.069
 without neutral density down to 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.450
 right we go right to the site 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.940
 Internet 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.860
 to get this lens for go pro 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.620
 or his lenses for go pro it takes 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.970
 go to the pro polar site so I'll you 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.650
 will put the link in the description of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.209
 the video and you will have more than to go 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.640
 on the website if you want to 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.470
 order one so personally 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.930
 I took for heroes 3 plus you 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.510
 have for heroes 3 and for hero two 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.670
 so here below you have the blog 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.700
 with installation videos of 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.290
 internal others and here we go to hero 3 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.280
 more so I click on it to show 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.200
 a bit the production we have 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.170
 I had taken the killer wind 3 more 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.700
 with the three editions so what is there 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.130
 will have in the next videos you 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.989
 have the same thing the lens but for 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.480
 only the gopro sense that they are 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.329
 so of course he does not go underwater 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.900
 here by a similar one so we have the frame 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.120
 in city the normal polarizer fremm here 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.849
 we have other other lenses 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.579
 and precisely in the pack that includes 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.599
 this one here is this one so 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.950
 that's why I was interested 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.870
 I do not live too close to the sea so 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.310
 I did not take the suite I the three more 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.590
 but we'll see soon if I have to 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.209
 test them so here I hope this 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.980
 video will have pleased you and do not forget to
