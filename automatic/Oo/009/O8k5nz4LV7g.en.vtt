think the bright white looks a little
bit<00:02:12.550> better<00:02:12.730> than<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.180> sunflower<00:02:13.690> seeds<00:02:14.020> but

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
bit better than the sunflower seeds but

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.900 
bit better than the sunflower seeds but
they<00:02:14.440> serve<00:02:14.650> two<00:02:14.920> different<00:02:15.370> purposes<00:02:15.850> and
