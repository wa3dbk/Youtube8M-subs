00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
so I'm just gonna do a quick walkthrough

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.160 
so I'm just gonna do a quick walkthrough
how<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.220> real<00:00:09.000> life<00:00:09.210> video<00:00:09.540> works<00:00:09.750> compared

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
how the real life video works compared

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.980 
how the real life video works compared
to<00:00:10.230> how<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.380> real<00:00:10.650> life<00:00:11.639> training<00:00:12.059> works<00:00:12.180> in

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
to how the real life training works in

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.330 
to how the real life training works in
this<00:00:13.049> case<00:00:13.260> is<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> real<00:00:13.680> life<00:00:13.830> video<00:00:14.100> this<00:00:14.190> is

the Tour of Flanders 2007 so I've gone
ahead<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.180> stir<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.320> go<00:00:19.740> ahead

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
ahead and I just stir here I go ahead

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.249 
ahead and I just stir here I go ahead
and<00:00:20.010> pedal<00:00:20.330> and<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.570> pedal<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:21.990> second

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
and pedal and I that pedal on second

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.310 
and pedal and I that pedal on second
it'll<00:00:22.470> kick<00:00:22.650> out<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.920> mode<00:00:23.839> you<00:00:24.839> can<00:00:25.140> see

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it'll kick out of the mode you can see

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.300 
it'll kick out of the mode you can see
kind<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.800> bottom<00:00:25.949> there<00:00:28.160> that<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
kind of at the bottom there that the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.749 
kind of at the bottom there that the
miles<00:00:30.240> an<00:00:30.480> hour<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.839> off<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:32.340> right<00:00:32.490> now<00:00:32.640> I'm

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
miles an hour is off and right now I'm

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.940 
miles an hour is off and right now I'm
just<00:00:32.910> barely<00:00:33.720> pedaling<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.350> all<00:00:34.470> certainly

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
just barely pedaling at all certainly

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.580 
just barely pedaling at all certainly
not<00:00:35.450> totally<00:00:36.450> nineteen<00:00:36.810> twenty<00:00:37.170> four<00:00:37.350> miles

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
not totally nineteen twenty four miles

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.439 
not totally nineteen twenty four miles
an<00:00:37.739> hour<00:00:39.469> with<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.590> speed<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.449> and

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
an hour with that speed it's going and

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.760 
an hour with that speed it's going and
if<00:00:42.539> I<00:00:42.660> speed<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.989> does<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
if I speed up here it does know if it

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.540 
if I speed up here it does know if it
faster

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
faster

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.819 
faster
then<00:00:49.149> but<00:00:49.570> not<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.719> lot<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.260> if<00:00:50.379> I<00:00:50.500> go<00:00:50.620> ahead<00:00:50.649> and

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
then but not a lot and if I go ahead and

00:00:50.829 --> 00:01:01.960 
then but not a lot and if I go ahead and
just<00:00:50.980> stop<00:00:51.190> down<00:00:51.430> go<00:00:52.329> down

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.730 

you<00:01:02.540> consider<00:01:02.840> things<00:01:02.960> kind<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:03.320> slowed<00:01:03.530> down

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
you consider things kind of slowed down

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.340 
you consider things kind of slowed down
a<00:01:03.770> third<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.450> again<00:01:05.450> not<00:01:05.870> something<00:01:06.110> that

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
a third of it again not something that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.830 
a third of it again not something that
going<00:01:06.500> ten<00:01:07.400> point<00:01:07.670> six<00:01:07.790> miles<00:01:08.060> out<00:01:08.240> paddling

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
going ten point six miles out paddling

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.960 
going ten point six miles out paddling
right<00:01:09.080> now<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:10.250> look<00:01:10.340> but<00:01:10.490> I'm<00:01:10.580> doing<00:01:10.850> it's

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
right now you look but I'm doing it's

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.830 
right now you look but I'm doing it's
pretty<00:01:11.210> slow<00:01:11.420> though

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
pretty slow though

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.140 
pretty slow though
and<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:12.920> just<00:01:13.130> picked<00:01:13.340> in<00:01:13.460> actually<00:01:13.790> positive

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
and now just picked in actually positive

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150 
and now just picked in actually positive
training<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.510> do<00:01:14.600> all<00:01:14.720> together<00:01:15.160> let's

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
training to do all together let's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.970 
training to do all together let's
compare<00:01:16.430> that<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.560> video<00:01:18.560> I'm<00:01:18.650> over<00:01:18.830> here

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
compare that to the video I'm over here

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.720 
compare that to the video I'm over here
in<00:01:19.040> a<00:01:19.160> second<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:21.200> here<00:01:21.380> we<00:01:21.470> are<00:01:21.530> on<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.860> video

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
in a second so here we are on the video

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.030 
in a second so here we are on the video
mode<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.240> struck<00:01:23.450> mothers<00:01:23.840> what<00:01:24.770> you<00:01:24.860> see

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
mode the struck mothers what you see

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.010 
mode the struck mothers what you see
here<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.370> that<00:01:25.490> they're<00:01:25.670> cycling<00:01:26.060> on<00:01:26.390> without

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
here is that they're cycling on without

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.770 
here is that they're cycling on without
me<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.580> know<00:01:28.820> I'm<00:01:29.000> not<00:01:29.120> pedaling<00:01:29.660> all

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
me so you know I'm not pedaling all

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.270 
me so you know I'm not pedaling all
right<00:01:29.990> now<00:01:30.140> they're<00:01:30.350> they're<00:01:30.680> still<00:01:30.830> going

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
right now they're they're still going

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:42.070 
right now they're they're still going
I'll<00:01:31.970> go<00:01:32.240> ahead<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.540> start<00:01:32.780> here<00:01:32.840> though

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.480 

at<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:42.710> point<00:01:42.860> I'm<00:01:43.010> feeling<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.280> bit<00:01:43.310> of

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
at this point I'm feeling a bit of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.900 
at this point I'm feeling a bit of
resistance<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:45.680> see<00:01:45.950> giving<00:01:46.280> instructions

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
resistance you see giving instructions

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.450 
resistance you see giving instructions
in<00:01:47.090> fact<00:01:47.300> now<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:48.130> religions<00:01:49.130> are<00:01:49.190> really

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
in fact now that religions are really

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.000 
in fact now that religions are really
kicked<00:01:49.730> in<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.940> third<00:01:50.150> bit<00:01:50.360> there

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.620 

and<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.640> can<00:01:55.760> see<00:01:55.880> down<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.090> bottom<00:01:56.210> the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
and you can see down the bottom the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.260 
and you can see down the bottom the
target<00:01:56.990> wattage<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:57.410> 180<00:01:57.920> watts<00:01:59.290> and<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.530> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
target wattage is 180 watts and that the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.250 
target wattage is 180 watts and that the
current<00:02:02.270> watt<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.630> little<00:02:02.930> lower<00:02:03.050> than<00:02:03.170> that

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
current watt is a little lower than that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:11.790 
current watt is a little lower than that
one<00:02:03.590> 70s

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.530 

and<00:02:12.340> it's<00:02:12.490> hard<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.730> keep<00:02:12.880> changing<00:02:13.390> at<00:02:13.510> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and it's hard to keep changing at the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.950 
and it's hard to keep changing at the
trends<00:02:14.050> neither<00:02:14.230> there's<00:02:14.560> an<00:02:14.770> ounce<00:02:14.890> at<00:02:15.100> 170

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
trends neither there's an ounce at 170

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:25.030 
trends neither there's an ounce at 170
180<00:02:17.160> 190

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.490 

if<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.790> stop<00:02:26.060> pedaling

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.620 

the<00:02:33.500> video<00:02:33.770> continues<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.420> eventually<00:02:35.420> gives

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
the video continues on eventually gives

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.940 
the video continues on eventually gives
me<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.810> under-voltage<00:02:36.050> warning<00:02:36.680> which<00:02:36.800> is

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
me the under-voltage warning which is

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.580 
me the under-voltage warning which is
basically<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.570> self<00:02:38.570> gerbil<00:02:38.990> of<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.320> trainer

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
basically the self gerbil of the trainer

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.570 
basically the self gerbil of the trainer
but<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.640> video<00:02:40.850> keeps<00:02:41.060> on<00:02:41.210> going<00:02:41.450> though
