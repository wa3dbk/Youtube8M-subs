00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.730 
slightly rough on the edges so it almost
feels<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.990> might<00:03:40.170> get<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.380> paper<00:03:40.620> cut

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
feels like you might get a paper cut

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.560 
feels like you might get a paper cut
from<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.370> won't<00:03:41.610> but<00:03:41.940> that's<00:03:42.360> what<00:03:42.540> it

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
from it you won't but that's what it

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.710 
from it you won't but that's what it
feels<00:03:42.870> like<00:03:43.160> also<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.550> won't<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.120> this<00:03:45.480> case

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
feels like also you won't it this case

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.350 
feels like also you won't it this case
won't<00:03:45.990> enter<00:03:46.380> your<00:03:46.500> pocket<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.160> don't<00:03:48.150> know<00:03:48.210> if

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
won't enter your pocket so don't know if

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360 
won't enter your pocket so don't know if
experience<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:49.080> with<00:03:49.350> jeans<00:03:49.620> pockets<00:03:50.130> where

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
experience that with jeans pockets where

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.860 
experience that with jeans pockets where
you<00:03:50.550> pull<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.910> phone<00:03:51.060> out<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.300> because<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
you pull the phone out and because the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.870 
you pull the phone out and because the
case<00:03:52.020> is<00:03:52.080> so<00:03:52.470> plastic<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:53.190> actually<00:03:53.490> pulls<00:03:53.700> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
case is so plastic it actually pulls the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.470 
case is so plastic it actually pulls the
whole<00:03:54.620> insides<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.800> your<00:03:55.890> jeans<00:03:56.220> out<00:03:56.460> so<00:03:56.790> you

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
whole insides of your jeans out so you

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.510 
whole insides of your jeans out so you
won't<00:03:57.660> experience<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.200> with<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.440> case<00:03:58.770> but

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
won't experience that with this case but

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.160 
won't experience that with this case but
really<00:03:59.940> like<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.510> would<00:04:00.810> be<00:04:00.930> slightly

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
really like it I would be slightly

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.780 
really like it I would be slightly
worried<00:04:01.500> about<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.770> screen<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.220> back<00:04:02.310> so

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
worried about the screen in the back so

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.100 
worried about the screen in the back so
I<00:04:02.820> would<00:04:03.030> put<00:04:03.210> a<00:04:03.240> screen<00:04:03.480> protector<00:04:03.630> on

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
I would put a screen protector on

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.320 
I would put a screen protector on
especially<00:04:04.770> with<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.070> camera<00:04:05.310> being<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.850> little

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
especially with a camera being a little

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.600 
especially with a camera being a little
bit<00:04:06.480> raised<00:04:06.840> then<00:04:07.380> if<00:04:07.500> that's<00:04:07.740> very<00:04:08.100> visible

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
bit raised then if that's very visible

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.070 
bit raised then if that's very visible
but<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.850> camera<00:04:09.150> slightly<00:04:09.480> raised<00:04:09.840> on<00:04:09.990> the

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
but the camera slightly raised on the

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.170 
but the camera slightly raised on the
galaxy<00:04:10.470> s3<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.130> might<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.370> it's<00:04:12.060> not

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
galaxy s3 and it might just it's not

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.850 
galaxy s3 and it might just it's not
going<00:04:12.330> to<00:04:12.420> be<00:04:12.480> level<00:04:12.840> with<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.110> back<00:04:13.320> but<00:04:13.680> i

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
going to be level with the back but i

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.010 
going to be level with the back but i
would<00:04:14.040> still<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.730> know<00:04:14.850> put<00:04:15.570> something<00:04:15.930> on
