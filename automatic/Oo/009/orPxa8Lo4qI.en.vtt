Industries<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:04.470> he's<00:00:05.400> going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.609> take<00:00:05.790> us

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Industries in he's going to take us

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.980 
Industries in he's going to take us
through<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.330> pre-start<00:00:06.899> checks<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.859> quad<00:00:08.069> by

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.360 

now<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.349> should<00:00:13.410> all<00:00:13.740> do<00:00:13.980> whether<00:00:14.219> we're

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
now what we should all do whether we're

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.550 
now what we should all do whether we're
experienced<00:00:15.059> or<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.780> should<00:00:15.839> firstly

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
experienced or not we should firstly

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.990 
experienced or not we should firstly
look<00:00:16.740> at<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> operator's<00:00:17.460> manual<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.940> is

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
look at the operator's manual this is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.429 
look at the operator's manual this is
the<00:00:18.210> manual<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.810> came<00:00:19.050> with<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.350> machine

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the manual that came with the machine

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.010 
the manual that came with the machine
the<00:00:20.369> manufacturers<00:00:21.029> now<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.420> machine<00:00:21.600> much

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the manufacturers now this machine much

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.420 
the manufacturers now this machine much
much<00:00:22.199> better<00:00:22.380> than<00:00:22.619> any<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.859> us<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.189> as

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
much better than any of us do as

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
much better than any of us do as
operators<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.260> should<00:00:25.320> look

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
operators so this is what we should look

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.700 
operators so this is what we should look
at<00:00:25.939> to<00:00:26.939> find<00:00:27.630> out<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.960> pre-start<00:00:28.349> checks

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
at to find out what the pre-start checks

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.429 
at to find out what the pre-start checks
should<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:29.240> now<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.599> part<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.230> I'm

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
should be now on this part here I'm

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.350 
should be now on this part here I'm
going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> check<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.309> tires<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.940> want<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> check

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
going to check the tires I want to check

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.549 
going to check the tires I want to check
that<00:00:33.390> they've<00:00:33.630> got<00:00:33.750> tread<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> want<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> check

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that they've got tread I want to check

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.799 
that they've got tread I want to check
that<00:00:34.590> they're<00:00:34.890> inflated<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:36.210> inflation

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
that they're inflated now inflation

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.240 
that they're inflated now inflation
pressures<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> machine<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.100> are

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
pressures on a machine like this are

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
pressures on a machine like this are
pretty<00:00:38.370> important<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.899> don't<00:00:40.140> have

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
pretty important if you don't have

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.110 
pretty important if you don't have
access<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> manual<00:00:41.309> they're<00:00:41.670> actually

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
access to the manual they're actually

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
access to the manual they're actually
imprinted<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> outside<00:00:43.350> edge<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
imprinted on the outside edge of the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.400 
imprinted on the outside edge of the
tire<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.239> check<00:00:45.480> there<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.200> find

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
tire there so we can check there to find

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.900 
tire there so we can check there to find
out<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> inflation<00:00:47.190> pressure<00:00:47.610> should

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
out what the inflation pressure should

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.040 
out what the inflation pressure should
be<00:00:48.680> next<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> quad<00:00:50.160> bike<00:00:50.370> hey<00:00:50.789> these<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.840> go

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
be next on a quad bike hey these do go

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.950 
be next on a quad bike hey these do go
over<00:00:52.079> fairly<00:00:52.620> rough<00:00:52.770> terrain<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:54.390> bodies<00:00:54.750> get

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
over fairly rough terrain the bodies get

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.209 
over fairly rough terrain the bodies get
knocked<00:00:55.140> around<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.680> we're<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> check

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
knocked around so we're going to check

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.060 
knocked around so we're going to check
for<00:00:56.280> any<00:00:56.579> loose<00:00:57.210> bits<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> pieces<00:00:58.530> they're

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
for any loose bits and pieces they're

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.040 
for any loose bits and pieces they're
quite<00:00:59.250> plasticky<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.270> get<00:01:00.420> splits<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
quite plasticky so we can get splits and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.020 
quite plasticky so we can get splits and
bangs<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.500> them<00:01:01.710> we're<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> check<00:01:02.760> make

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
bangs on them we're going to check make

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.950 
bangs on them we're going to check make

sure no bolts are undone a full walk

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
sure no bolts are undone a full walk
around<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> machine<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.040> check<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.520> loose

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
around the machine to check for loose

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.590 
around the machine to check for loose

stuff so daily checks gotta be to have a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.780 
stuff so daily checks gotta be to have a
look<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:37.200> there's<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.829> screen<00:01:38.280> there<00:01:38.579> in

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
look in there there's a screen there in

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.270 
look in there there's a screen there in
front<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.329> radiator<00:01:39.810> core<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.409> we've<00:01:41.040> got

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
front of the radiator core and we've got

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.490 
front of the radiator core and we've got
to<00:01:41.540> make<00:01:42.540> sure<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:42.869> clear<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
to make sure that's clear because the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020 
to make sure that's clear because the
air<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.220> flow<00:01:44.399> through<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:44.820> while

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
nextly I'm going to check the oil and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.259 
nextly I'm going to check the oil and
for<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:44.860> that's<00:02:45.130> down<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.519> side<00:02:45.850> of<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
for that that's down the side of the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.940 
for that that's down the side of the
engine<00:02:46.420> down<00:02:46.840> here<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.440> where<00:02:47.590> I'm<00:02:47.709> pointing

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
engine down here just where I'm pointing

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.340 
engine down here just where I'm pointing
now<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.640> I've<00:02:49.060> got<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.420> remove<00:02:49.750> this

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350

particular cover together that I've

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.759 
particular cover together that I've
taken<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:52.660> off<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.350> can<00:02:53.500> show<00:02:53.709> you

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
taken this off so that I can show you

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.420 
taken this off so that I can show you
clearly<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.640> process<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.330> checking<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.140> oil

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
clearly the process of checking the oil

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.289 
clearly the process of checking the oil
so<00:02:57.430> I'm<00:02:57.519> going<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.730> remove<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.180> little

so I'm going to remove the little
dipstick<00:02:58.780> now

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.730 

I'll<00:03:09.290> wipe<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.650> oil<00:03:09.890> off<00:03:12.100> put<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.130> back<00:03:13.250> in

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
I'll wipe the oil off put it back in

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.870 
I'll wipe the oil off put it back in
screw<00:03:15.740> it<00:03:15.860> down<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.250> correct<00:03:16.430> level<00:03:17.230> and

stone and it is it's right up to the top
of<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.470> hatch<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.580> know<00:03:25.940> that

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
of the hatch so and so of I know that

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.510 
of the hatch so and so of I know that
the<00:03:26.360> oil<00:03:26.390> is<00:03:27.200> in<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.590> correct<00:03:27.890> range<00:03:28.130> for
