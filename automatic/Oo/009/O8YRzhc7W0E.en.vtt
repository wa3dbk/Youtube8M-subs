00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.390
 the best way to pass the matches 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.550
 more like I'm correcting errors that 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.519
 they are always present because they do not know 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.900
 It was natural but I understand it 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.900
 and I take responsibility 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 in relation to the team because we are 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.829
 giving very well we are very coupled already 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.400
 to the game that all we all already 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.529
 we know 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.560
 the truth that we are very happy today 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.900
 without him 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 and everything that has been tested as a team 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.780
 you are welcome 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.220
 they were what mistakes can be made or 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.860
 is committing that it has to improve 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.500
 because it's not his position 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.870
 the clear panorama 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.220
 aspects of output is the most complicated 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 because one is always attached to the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.809
 line and the possibilities of 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.150
 easy because lately only the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.400
 center or throw a long pass over the 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.400
 line then it 's different can not 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.770
 face and take variants because the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.320
 space is another one definitely now 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.360
 It must also be clear that the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.550
 risk is the maximum when losing a ball 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 in that area then if they are things that 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.200
 I have to improve and how are the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.000
 I want to go so high because they see me 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.770
 at some point you have that feeling of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.330
 you have to go up but for your 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 position by him is located can not go 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.990
 if it is difficult in the win always always 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.720
 there are in fact sometimes 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.009
 tactical positioning I do it a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.039
 little bit higher than it should 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.410
 then the saying that Pablo and I lula 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.880
 they are calling to always keep that 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.800
 that order of the line of four but 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.380
 but if it costs because not always 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.700
 wants to think about the goal and move forward 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.039
 have the camera first back 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.500
 Esteban against Perez Zeledón as 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.750
 we will see this herediano of the idea 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.120
 consolidates from the group and how 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.350
 see also the staff I think the idea 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.590
 It is clear to all 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.390
 the team is going to do is playing with 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.369
 a lot of intensity that is great and not 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.040
 only for us but for football 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:07.299
 national to get accustomed to another 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.770
 rhythm and then it 's very good is a team 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.459
 difficult has a good coach and 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.370
 we know that he has a lot of work to do 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.530
 defense to arrive with order 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.300
 up then we're going to handle all of that 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.580
 but if thinking more about ourselves 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.650
 at least in this type of defense 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.480
 seeing the forwards of the team's 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.800
 pérez who they are new to the Panamanian 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.060
 have another Argentine have them 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.680
 referenced have seen some of the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.630
 qualities of them to not have any 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.519
 surprise because they do not know much not 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.350
 we have seen the way of analysis 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.390
 but we did like the games and of course 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.510
 been remarkable that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.610
 seems to make the references of his game 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.230
 they also have players who want 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.230
 handle the ball well and leave me 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.700
 you have to be more careful with the attack 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:59.090
 what to think about its tips 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.989
 the easiest way is to press from 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.610
 from before but not that they are 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.080
 puntanos not give problems 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.209
 they were as you take for example 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.950
 who also told us very well about 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.629
 Herediano was the first 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.090
 places in the first places arrived 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.260
 to the supercopa they made a good match 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.660
 they fought against the national runner-up 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.430
 they won him win in concacaf and now he 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.160
 speaks well of the Herediano as he takes everything 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.410
 that the team of the group mentions a 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.750
 interview a few days ago and at the time 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.390
 that we are more than used to that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.319
 and if I have to stress that it is not right 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.569
 but it is not normal in which country it happens is 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.769
 a large team that works as the 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.450
 press pulling out negative things and not 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.950
 they bring out the good the truth that 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.150
 we are used to but should not 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:56.120
 be 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:58.569
 it's wrong I know that many of your 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.569
 higher 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:10.329
 even until the triumphs that we 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.489
 we are leaving many detectors outside 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.079
 this but that is also this issue of 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.269
 that do not take for something positive for something 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:21.470
 of the group for long to demonstrate what 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.820
 they would really be or if it 's a favor 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.460
 what are they doing to us because they make us 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.500
 be stronger and against all that 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.060
 we reached three endings and that already 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.310
 we are with plans against all that 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.390
 means that once we have 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.910
 fed our forces 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.640
 it will not affect us the least we do not 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.040
 it unites us more as we have 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.820
 shown then if they are going to continue 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.820
 we act in that way 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.610
 in favor of them I am speaking from the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.990
 positioning I was told by josé sánchez 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.730
 who plays a little more advanced with 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.680
 you have to know that this 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.420
 played together in minor divisions in 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.550
 the sporty saprissa are already known from 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:05.580
 enough time this helps them both 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:08.310
 Football clear seven years may 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.140
 in tibás gardens there I did not know and 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.930
 there we can find ourselves as a 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.990
 the ten years until the 15 maybe 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.980
 So yes I have already traveled a lot 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.720
 It has been very long 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:26.180
 then we 're going to love it for the 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.180
 then it is enough 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.940
 we wait normally
