00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.119 
to open the door and look at all this
hex<00:02:23.910> code<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:25.200> hex<00:02:25.410> code<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.860> gibberish

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
hex code and the hex code is gibberish

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.309 
hex code and the hex code is gibberish
it's<00:02:26.610> actually<00:02:26.849> pattern<00:02:27.540> recognition<00:02:28.049> that

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
it's actually pattern recognition that

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.979 
it's actually pattern recognition that
the<00:02:28.440> guys<00:02:28.650> do<00:02:28.950> they<00:02:29.160> get<00:02:29.340> inside<00:02:29.790> there<00:02:30.150> there

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the guys do they get inside there there

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.319 
the guys do they get inside there there
now<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.380> screen<00:02:31.739> with<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> hex<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.519> after<00:02:33.299> a

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
now on screen with a hex and after a

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.720 
now on screen with a hex and after a
while<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.840> get<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.110> go<00:02:34.230> oh<00:02:34.410> oh<00:02:34.620> there's<00:02:35.549> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
while you get to go oh oh there's the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.970 
while you get to go oh oh there's the
fuel<00:02:36.030> enrichment<00:02:36.180> schedule<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:37.920> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
fuel enrichment schedule you know it's a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.680 
fuel enrichment schedule you know it's a
literally<00:02:38.610> record<00:02:39.060> reverse-engineer

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
literally record reverse-engineer

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.600 
literally record reverse-engineer
encryption<00:02:40.170> yes<00:02:40.650> then<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.160> have<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.430> work

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
encryption yes then you have to work

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.270 
encryption yes then you have to work
through<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.000> hex<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.569> find<00:02:43.560> out<00:02:43.739> where<00:02:44.040> all

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
through the hex and find out where all

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.880 
through the hex and find out where all
the<00:02:44.519> tables<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.660> functions<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.410> scalars

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
the tables the functions and the scalars

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.410 
the tables the functions and the scalars
are<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.280> allow<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.610> tune<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.090> engine

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
are that allow you to tune the engine

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.020 
are that allow you to tune the engine
and<00:02:49.230> then<00:02:49.709> ultimately<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.430> design<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.819> device

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
and then ultimately you design a device

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.180 
and then ultimately you design a device
that<00:02:51.690> allows<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.530> improve<00:02:52.950> either

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
that allows you to improve either

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.850 
that allows you to improve either
efficiency<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.090> power<00:02:54.390> or<00:02:54.629> both<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.709> you're

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
efficiency or power or both so you're

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.819 
efficiency or power or both so you're
seeing<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.400> first<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.720> it's<00:02:58.440> heavily

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
seeing it here first but it's heavily

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.310 
seeing it here first but it's heavily
nerdy<00:03:00.709> definitely<00:03:01.709> my<00:03:01.859> comfort<00:03:02.130> zone
