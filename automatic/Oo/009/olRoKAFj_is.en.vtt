is<00:03:26.220> insane<00:03:26.729> I'm<00:03:27.540> sure<00:03:27.840> they're<00:03:28.019> being<00:03:28.199> a

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
is insane I'm sure they're being a

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
little modest on those speeds but I'll

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.839 
little modest on those speeds but I'll
do<00:03:30.479> some<00:03:30.659> benchmarking<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.319> show<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:32.669> also

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
do some benchmarking to show you it also

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
those guys that like encryption and

those guys that like encryption and
there<00:03:40.139> are<00:03:40.229> actually<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> few<00:03:40.739> guys<00:03:41.220> on<00:03:41.489> here

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
there are actually a few guys on here

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.129 
there are actually a few guys on here
that<00:03:42.000> do<00:03:42.379> that<00:03:43.379> has<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> two<00:03:44.040> million<00:03:44.609> hour<00:03:45.139> MTBF

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
that do that has a two million hour MTBF

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.789 
that do that has a two million hour MTBF
or<00:03:46.530> mean<00:03:47.310> time<00:03:47.549> between<00:03:47.579> failures<00:03:48.389> and<00:03:48.799> it's

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
or mean time between failures and it's

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.979

got a five-year limited warranty which

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.149 
got a five-year limited warranty which
of<00:03:52.680> course<00:03:53.959> you'll<00:03:54.959> need<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.349> read<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.709> to

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
of course you'll need to read that to

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.629 
of course you'll need to read that to
know<00:03:56.310> what<00:03:56.549> they<00:03:56.669> mean<00:03:56.819> by<00:03:57.000> limited<00:03:57.419> and<00:03:58.639> of

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
know what they mean by limited and of

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.469 
know what they mean by limited and of
course<00:03:59.909> it's<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.829> 2.5<00:04:01.829> in<00:04:02.040> form<00:04:02.310> factor<00:04:02.790> if<00:04:02.970> you

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
course it's a 2.5 in form factor if you

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.960 
course it's a 2.5 in form factor if you
have<00:04:03.689> only<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.169> 3.5<00:04:04.919> cage<00:04:05.280> or<00:04:05.519> something<00:04:05.849> along

those<00:04:06.030> lines<00:04:06.299> you're<00:04:06.810> gonna<00:04:06.930> have<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.169> find

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
those lines you're gonna have to find

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.439 
those lines you're gonna have to find
something<00:04:07.859> to<00:04:08.099> make<00:04:08.669> it<00:04:08.819> fit<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.090> there<00:04:09.239> or

something to make it fit in there or

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.589 
something to make it fit in there or
just<00:04:09.829> drop<00:04:10.829> it<00:04:10.979> in<00:04:11.099> there<00:04:11.180> attached<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.209> SATA

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
just drop it in there attached to SATA

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.259 
just drop it in there attached to SATA
power<00:04:12.840> Saturday<00:04:13.530> data<00:04:14.159> and<00:04:14.489> you're<00:04:15.090> good<00:04:15.239> to

perfectly to make it look nice you will

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.600 
perfectly to make it look nice you will
want<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.579> so<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.720> course<00:04:21.989> during<00:04:22.409> my<00:04:22.590> video<00:04:22.860> I'm

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
want to so of course during my video I'm

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.640 
want to so of course during my video I'm
going<00:04:23.909> to<00:04:23.970> show<00:04:24.210> or<00:04:24.479> on<00:04:24.750> my<00:04:24.990> next<00:04:25.259> video<00:04:25.530> I'm

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
going to show you how to install it

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.180 
going to show you how to install it
into<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.900> machine<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.470> how<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.650> install

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
into the machine and how to install

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.010 
into the machine and how to install
windows<00:04:29.670> onto<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.510> all<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.780> good<00:04:30.990> stuff

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
windows onto it and all the good stuff

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.260 
windows onto it and all the good stuff
then<00:04:31.710> I'll<00:04:31.830> do<00:04:31.950> a<00:04:31.980> bunch<00:04:32.220> of<00:04:32.340> performance<00:04:32.610> and

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
then I'll do a bunch of performance and

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.090 
then I'll do a bunch of performance and
all<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.540> good<00:04:33.720> stuff<00:04:33.750> as<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.260> usually<00:04:34.470> do<00:04:34.890> and
