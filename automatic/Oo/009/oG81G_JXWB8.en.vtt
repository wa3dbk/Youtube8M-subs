00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
just keeps going in a loop okay and you

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.080 
just keeps going in a loop okay and you
see<00:04:13.449> it's<00:04:13.780> it's<00:04:14.169> that's<00:04:14.650> all<00:04:14.859> it's<00:04:15.069> doing<00:04:15.280> its

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
continuously going in a loop you'll

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.460 
continuously going in a loop you'll
eventually<00:04:18.039> get<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.609> same<00:04:19.470> applications

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
eventually get the same applications

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.830 
eventually get the same applications
back<00:04:20.739> again<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.519> just<00:04:21.549> saw<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.060> calculator

back again you just saw the calculator

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.409 
back again you just saw the calculator
pass<00:04:23.169> by<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:24.370> let's<00:04:24.580> see<00:04:24.729> how<00:04:24.940> long<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.389> takes

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
pass by so let's see how long it takes

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.490
