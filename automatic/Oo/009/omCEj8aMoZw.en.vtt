00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
next division so hopefully i think we've

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.510 
next division so hopefully i think we've
got<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.540> more<00:01:06.570> game<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.110> play<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.530> in

got one more game to play and in

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.460 
got one more game to play and in
divisions<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:09.600> if<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.930> win<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.290> game

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
divisions and then if we win that game

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
divisions and then if we win that game
we<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.979> actually<00:01:11.100> threw<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.970> division<00:01:12.330> nine

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
