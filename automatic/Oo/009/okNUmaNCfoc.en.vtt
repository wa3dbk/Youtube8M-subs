I'd<00:00:01.350> like<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.589> talk<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.890> you<00:00:02.010> about<00:00:02.360> sodium<00:00:03.360> and

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
I'd like to talk to you about sodium and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.869 
I'd like to talk to you about sodium and
potassium<00:00:03.680> this<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:04.859> very<00:00:05.160> important

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
potassium this is a very important

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.080 
potassium this is a very important
aspect<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.540> healthy<00:00:06.870> diet<00:00:07.610> we<00:00:08.610> have<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> real

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
aspect of a healthy diet we have a real

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.089 
aspect of a healthy diet we have a real
problem<00:00:09.120> right<00:00:09.750> now<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:10.230> our<00:00:10.410> modern<00:00:10.769> diet

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
problem right now with our modern diet

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.850 
problem right now with our modern diet
in<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.940> contains<00:00:12.150> far<00:00:12.929> too<00:00:13.290> much<00:00:13.469> sodium

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
in that it contains far too much sodium

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.430 
in that it contains far too much sodium
and<00:00:14.280> not<00:00:14.460> enough<00:00:14.670> potassium<00:00:15.320> just<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
and not enough potassium just the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.800 
and not enough potassium just the
opposite<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.220> our<00:00:17.250> ancestors<00:00:17.820> ate<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
opposite of what our ancestors ate and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.230 
opposite of what our ancestors ate and
you<00:00:19.590> might<00:00:19.770> think<00:00:19.800> well<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.550> don't<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.029> high

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
you might think well I don't have high

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.240 
you might think well I don't have high
blood<00:00:21.539> pressure<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:22.109> not<00:00:22.260> salt<00:00:22.560> sensitive<00:00:23.130> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
blood pressure I'm not salt sensitive I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.210 
blood pressure I'm not salt sensitive I
don't<00:00:23.279> need<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> watch<00:00:23.880> my<00:00:24.119> salt<00:00:25.490> not<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:28.220> too

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
don't need to watch my salt not so too

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.030 
don't need to watch my salt not so too
much<00:00:29.400> salt<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> diet<00:00:29.939> has<00:00:30.330> many

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
much salt in the diet has many

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.620 
much salt in the diet has many
implications<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.550> our<00:00:32.669> health<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> everyone

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
implications for our health and everyone

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.760 
implications for our health and everyone
should<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.989> watching<00:00:34.860> their<00:00:35.160> sodium<00:00:35.430> intake

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
should be watching their sodium intake

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.619 
should be watching their sodium intake
high<00:00:37.770> sodium<00:00:38.100> intake<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:39.090> been<00:00:39.270> linked<00:00:39.570> to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
high sodium intake has been linked to

and<00:02:13.400> where<00:02:14.270> do<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.510> get<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.990> potassium

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
and where do we get to the potassium

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.070 
and where do we get to the potassium
well<00:02:16.280> again<00:02:16.790> that's<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.240> vegetables<00:02:17.840> and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
well again that's the vegetables and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.810 
well again that's the vegetables and
fruits<00:02:18.350> if<00:02:19.220> you're<00:02:19.370> getting<00:02:19.490> your<00:02:19.640> quota<00:02:20.030> of

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
fruits if you're getting your quota of

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.120 
fruits if you're getting your quota of
at<00:02:22.820> least<00:02:23.240> two<00:02:23.570> fruit<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:24.170> least<00:02:24.800> three

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
at least two fruit at least three

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.270 
at least two fruit at least three
vegetable<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.880> day<00:02:26.530> then<00:02:27.530> that's<00:02:27.890> where<00:02:28.160> you're

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
vegetable a day then that's where you're

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.520 
vegetable a day then that's where you're
getting<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.550> potassium<00:02:29.020> but<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.050> would<00:02:30.290> shoot

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
getting the potassium but I would shoot

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.560 
getting the potassium but I would shoot
for<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:31.160> higher<00:02:31.400> amount<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.000> would<00:02:32.060> try<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.450> go

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
for the higher amount I would try and go

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.650 
for the higher amount I would try and go
for<00:02:32.780> four<00:02:33.080> servings<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.830> fruit<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.240> five<00:02:35.240> of

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
for four servings of fruit and five of

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.680 
for four servings of fruit and five of
the<00:02:36.110> vegetable<00:02:36.970> sometimes<00:02:37.970> people<00:02:38.330> ask<00:02:38.450> me

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
the vegetable sometimes people ask me

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.250 
the vegetable sometimes people ask me
well<00:02:38.870> can<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.110> take<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.320> potassium<00:02:39.770> supplement

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
well can I take a potassium supplement

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.440 
well can I take a potassium supplement
sure<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.410> can<00:02:42.680> but<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.640> best<00:02:43.820> potassium

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
sure you can but the best potassium

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.229 
sure you can but the best potassium
supplement<00:02:44.959> would<00:02:45.140> be<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.650> glass<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.850> tomato

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
supplement would be a glass of tomato

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.660 
supplement would be a glass of tomato
juice<00:02:47.480> or<00:02:47.900> vegetable<00:02:48.410> juice<00:02:48.650> which<00:02:49.489> would

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
juice or vegetable juice which would

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.540 
juice or vegetable juice which would
give<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.880> about<00:02:50.000> 400<00:02:50.840> milligrams<00:02:51.550> of

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
give you about 400 milligrams of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.930 
give you about 400 milligrams of
potassium<00:02:53.350> versus<00:02:54.350> maybe<00:02:54.560> 99<00:02:55.220> milligrams<00:02:55.760> in

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
a potassium supplement banana is also

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.590 
a potassium supplement banana is also
very<00:03:00.260> high<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.560> potassium<00:03:01.360> several<00:03:02.360> hundred

you<00:03:10.010> do<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.400> there<00:03:10.850> is<00:03:11.120> room<00:03:11.480> for<00:03:11.510> some<00:03:12.140> salt

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
you do that there is room for some salt

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.440 
you do that there is room for some salt
in<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.040> diet<00:03:15.670> hopefully<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.700> healthy<00:03:17.180> salt

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
in your diet hopefully a healthy salt

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.940 
in your diet hopefully a healthy salt
and<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:19.459> is<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.850> good<00:03:20.390> choice<00:03:20.690> here<00:03:21.049> this<00:03:21.799> is
