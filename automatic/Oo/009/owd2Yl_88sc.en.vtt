it leave on him

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.550 
it leave on him
I<00:01:17.619> mean<00:01:18.520> obviously<00:01:18.700> if<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.479> look<00:01:20.079> at<00:01:20.200> two

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
I mean obviously if you look at two

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.160 
I mean obviously if you look at two
screens<00:01:20.979> at<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.220> same<00:01:21.430> time<00:01:21.640> one<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.570> new

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
screens at the same time one of a new

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.780 
screens at the same time one of a new
game<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.560> one<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.770> let's<00:01:24.100> say<00:01:24.250> setlist<00:01:24.610> two

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
game and one of let's say setlist two

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.200 
game and one of let's say setlist two
and<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.810> difference<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.470> huge<00:01:26.740> but<00:01:27.549> but<00:01:28.090> in

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
and the difference is huge but but in

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.940 
and the difference is huge but but in
retrospect<00:01:28.509> when<00:01:29.049> I<00:01:29.110> when<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.409> think<00:01:29.710> back<00:01:29.890> how

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
retrospect when I when I think back how

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.120 
retrospect when I when I think back how
I<00:01:30.189> perceived<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.270> graphics<00:01:31.659> back<00:01:31.869> then<00:01:32.130> it

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
I perceived the graphics back then it

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.389 
I perceived the graphics back then it
was<00:01:33.280> excellent<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.149> know<00:01:34.299> I<00:01:34.330> remember

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
was excellent and you know I remember

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.940 
was excellent and you know I remember
how<00:01:36.539> meticulously<00:01:37.539> detailed<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.439> animations

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
how meticulously detailed the animations

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.440 
how meticulously detailed the animations
were<00:01:39.189> and<00:01:39.750> everything<00:01:40.750> was<00:01:41.740> was<00:01:41.979> done<00:01:42.450> with

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
were and everything was was done with

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.289 
were and everything was was done with
with<00:01:43.810> such<00:01:45.299> such<00:01:46.299> an<00:01:46.420> attention<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.299> while

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
with such such an attention so while

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.699 
with such such an attention so while
there<00:01:49.479> was<00:01:49.539> an<00:01:49.690> odd<00:01:49.929> and<00:01:50.319> objective

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
there was an odd and objective

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.940 
there was an odd and objective
difference<00:01:51.159> subjectively<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:52.289> think<00:01:53.289> it's<00:01:53.440> I

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
difference subjectively I think it's I

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.070 
difference subjectively I think it's I
think<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.459> has<00:01:54.610> been<00:01:54.640> very<00:01:54.789> cool<00:01:55.179> like<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.420> of

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
think it has been very cool like that of

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.289 
think it has been very cool like that of
course<00:01:56.860> we<00:01:57.250> have<00:01:57.429> more<00:01:57.670> on<00:01:57.819> the<00:01:57.939> history<00:01:58.270> of
