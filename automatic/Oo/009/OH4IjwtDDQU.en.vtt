00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
poorly in this game just because like

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.640 
poorly in this game just because like
the<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.270> lowest<00:05:23.630> house<00:05:24.050> that<00:05:24.320> you<00:05:24.410> get<00:05:24.530> at<00:05:24.620> the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
the the lowest house that you get at the

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.560 
the the lowest house that you get at the
end<00:05:24.890> is<00:05:25.160> like<00:05:25.370> five<00:05:25.550> million<00:05:25.880> dollars<00:05:26.360> and

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
end is like five million dollars and

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.390 
end is like five million dollars and
it's<00:05:26.690> just<00:05:26.870> so<00:05:27.080> hard<00:05:27.380> not<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.650> pick<00:05:27.980> up<00:05:28.130> stuff

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.320 
it's just so hard not to pick up stuff
sometimes<00:05:29.230> so<00:05:30.230> I<00:05:30.650> don't<00:05:31.040> know<00:05:31.810> I'd<00:05:32.810> save<00:05:33.080> that
