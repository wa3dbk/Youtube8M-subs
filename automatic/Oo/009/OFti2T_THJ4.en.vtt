00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 I am with amandine brook came from 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.150
 dijon run specially the one 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.550
 from ultramar a gulf raid for the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.980
 first time at 177 km we approach her 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.889
 how amandine is a little bit a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 little bit a little stressful ago 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.490
 a little curiosity also know 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.220
 how am I going to handle how I 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.769
 will handle this ordeal and then there is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.010
 a little bit of excitement when even that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.539
 will when we will begin to address the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.920
 last phases of the race where we go 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.050
 to be really tired and at the same time 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.350
 we will know that the finish line and not 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.120
 very far and so here is a little bit 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.590
 a little bit of three at a time so 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.180
 this is the first time for you 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.700
 also long distance but still 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.010
 you have won a lot of races already 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 lately, including 6th on Saintlyon 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.289
 second on gendarmes and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 thieves 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.460
 it is true that finally here is Saintlylyon 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.020
 as the gendarmes had it was 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.430
 a real surprise because there was 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.609
 a plateau a women's plateau 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.309
 extremely high with notably the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.049
 presence of two klein laurence and 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.860
 the current champion of France trail 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.960
 short on on the gendarmes and a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.110
 plateau that beats international karé ment 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.820
 on on the saintélyon ​​so that's right 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.360
 that it was it was a big 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.380
 surprise 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.960
 now when 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.939
 when I run on my land we go 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.289
 to say in Côte-d'Or and that I win ultra 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.490
 ultra cawdor it's a pride 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.259
 it's a pride more than anything else 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.630
 what I think you did not come here 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.189
 alone so you have three acolytes with you 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.000
 who are there too it's your strategy of 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.229
 race and I understood 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.060
 so in fact it's stop in we're going 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.319
 say we expect it to be advanced 1 year 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.130
 next we would like to make marathon 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.680
 sands 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.570
 2014 so it's true that we train 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.170
 more and more together so with 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.619
 guillaume with vincent and then with 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.960
 the one who runs the whole body with his 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.820
 red nose which is a little the comics the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.200
 comic of the request so if I have 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.780
 understood it is they who will bring to 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.430
 to cross the 177 km you rely on them 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.750
 to be successful must be quite I 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.480
 think they're going to be there they're going to be 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.769
 there in the most 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.120
 difficult down as in the most 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.560
 small as in the easiest in 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.099
 does because there are always some in 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.989
 the race 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.670
 we feel good where we are we are good 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.170
 together what also does 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.930
 that's what the beauty of the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.280
 of trail when we start to be in 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.870
 the hard and we join others 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.959
 runners even if we do not know them in 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.780
 do you go there is this species of this 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.239
 kind of magic happens and that makes 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.209
 that ben that talking about it we come on 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.060
 manages to overcome the most 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.920
 difficult we do not concretely have you 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.360
 a little ambition anyway tonight 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.670
 we'll say tomorrow maybe what 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.700
 the arrival will be tomorrow so I have in 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.569
 the obligation to make a podium 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.980
 that's otherwise I have to do vannes dijon to 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.109
 foot of the banks 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.030
 in fact I have no choice I have to 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.889
 necessarily arrived at least in 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.569
 first three a lot of constraints 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.620
 all this despite all good I hope you 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.630
 will take a lot of fun and 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.090
 listen we end up on arrival tomorrow 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.819
 that's it in 24 hours 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.170
 small goal is to do in 24 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.450
 hours without falling asleep 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.530
 ok see you tomorrow at 7 pm 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.430
