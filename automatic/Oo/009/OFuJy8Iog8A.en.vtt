3 mod and now we realize that there's a
slight<00:00:26.160> error<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.660> trees<00:00:28.099> for<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:31.099> whoa

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
slight error in the trees for that whoa

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.549 
slight error in the trees for that whoa
the<00:00:32.399> trees<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.940> were<00:00:33.059> there<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:33.630> gone<00:00:33.840> they

spawn<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.120> are<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> regular

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
spawn so we are going to make a regular

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.889 
spawn so we are going to make a regular
tree<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.850> regular<00:00:42.300> treats<00:00:42.660> work

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
tree right here the regular treats work

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.430 
tree right here the regular treats work
but<00:00:43.230> most<00:00:43.530> special<00:00:44.309> trees<00:00:44.550> don't<00:00:44.879> work<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.239> all

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440
