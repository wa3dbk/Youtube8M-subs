 I'll show you a recipe for 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.400
 wafer pie 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.880
 I had this recipe but it is very delicious and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.160
 very weak sometimes we do not know 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.529
 make the dessert and this is a mess 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:32.160
 here is a sour cream and I go 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:35.460
 put the cream to put me 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.590
 here I am using chocolate powder 70% 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.730
 cocoa but you can substitute 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.750
 cocoa powder in chocolate powder that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.020
 you prefer 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.510
 [Music] 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.690
 I slowly mix the chocolate in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.690
 form 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.520
 ready the chocolate voter is in 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.160
 dust is at the point I want now I go 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.210
 alternating one layer of the 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.460
 chocolate and a layer of maria wafer 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 here I am using the rock Maria of 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.960
 chocolate you can use the traditional 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.960
 it's another cracker 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.840
 I do not usually look in the cookie-cutter milk. 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.440
 do not need to be here anymore if you 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.900
 preferred to look at soul milk 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.320
 her arrival in the milk before placing 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.320

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.010

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.460
 my last layer of cream now 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.460
 chocolate milk 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.760
 I did not want this cone is ready 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.010
 so our cookie pie now I 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.250
 I'm going to take the refrigerator. Leave some. 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.250
 hours 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:40.500
 Here I go and look for some cookies. 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.500
 for us to put over the burrow 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.829
 [Applause] 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.329
 so much of cookie stayed in the fridge 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.329
 one day to another 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.549
 Now we'll give a tip to people. 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.430
 here is another workout 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.220
 blender some of those cookies 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.760
 who use the older chocolate and 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.760
 I'll put it on and then we can 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.760
 serve 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.610
