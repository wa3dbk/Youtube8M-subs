properly you never see any of the frost

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
properly you never see any of the frost
because<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> invention<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.120> defrost

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
because of the invention of the defrost

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.900 
because of the invention of the defrost
cycle<00:00:36.770> needing<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.890> manually<00:00:38.340> defrost<00:00:38.760> your

definitely destroy the timer even if it

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.029 
definitely destroy the timer even if it

the<00:05:33.539> defrost<00:05:33.930> heater<00:05:34.050> should<00:05:34.590> have<00:05:34.919> some

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
the defrost heater should have some

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.980 
the defrost heater should have some
resistance<00:05:35.849> however<00:05:36.150> an<00:05:36.570> infinite

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
resistance reading would mean that it

circuit can be tested when the freezer

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.409 
circuit can be tested when the freezer
is<00:05:43.199> cold<00:05:43.530> by<00:05:43.949> checking<00:05:44.370> for<00:05:44.520> continuity<00:05:45.210> from

defrost heater if the thermostat is

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.379 
defrost heater if the thermostat is
closed<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.130> should<00:05:50.460> have<00:05:50.639> a<00:05:50.669> low<00:05:51.090> resistance

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
closed you should have a low resistance

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.120 
closed you should have a low resistance
reading<00:05:52.139> and<00:05:52.289> you<00:05:52.469> can<00:05:52.620> assume<00:05:52.919> that<00:05:52.949> the

reading and you can assume that the

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.040 
reading and you can assume that the
defrost<00:05:53.550> timer<00:05:53.669> is<00:05:54.090> not<00:05:54.120> sending<00:05:54.659> electricity

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
defrost timer is not sending electricity
