it's never not been an awesome game in
every<00:02:05.509> installation<00:02:06.049> of<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.590> every<00:02:07.310> version

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
every installation of it every version

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.100 
every installation of it every version
has<00:02:07.759> been<00:02:07.909> awesome<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:08.269> there's<00:02:08.539> no<00:02:08.660> point<00:02:08.840> in

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
has been awesome so there's no point in

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.050 
has been awesome so there's no point in
throwing<00:02:09.860> away<00:02:10.160> anything<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:10.910> just

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
throwing away anything it's just

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.000 
throwing away anything it's just
figuring<00:02:11.930> out<00:02:12.049> how<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.200> update<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:12.830> make

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
figuring out how to update it and make

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.699 
figuring out how to update it and make
it<00:02:13.540> relevant<00:02:14.540> for<00:02:14.720> today<00:02:17.260> we<00:02:18.260> looked<00:02:18.440> at<00:02:18.560> lots

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
it relevant for today we looked at lots

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.229 
it relevant for today we looked at lots
of<00:02:18.890> different<00:02:18.950> kind<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.519> references<00:02:20.209> and

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
of different kind of references and

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.690 
of different kind of references and
inspirations<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.519> one<00:02:22.519> thing<00:02:22.549> that

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
inspirations and and one thing that

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.580 
inspirations and and one thing that
struck<00:02:23.120> out<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.600> me<00:02:23.720> was<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> late

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
struck out to me was that in the late

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.650 
struck out to me was that in the late
70s<00:02:25.190> there<00:02:25.310> was<00:02:25.370> this<00:02:25.549> whole<00:02:25.790> movement<00:02:26.060> like

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
70s there was this whole movement like

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.150 
70s there was this whole movement like
the<00:02:26.900> punk<00:02:27.140> rock<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.590> new<00:02:27.709> wave<00:02:27.860> movement

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
the punk rock and new wave movement

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.120 
the punk rock and new wave movement
which<00:02:28.760> was<00:02:28.970> really<00:02:29.510> about<00:02:30.290> disenfranchised

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
which was really about disenfranchised

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.729 
which was really about disenfranchised
youth<00:02:31.250> sick<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.299> death<00:02:32.540> with<00:02:32.870> what<00:02:33.049> society

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
youth sick to death with what society

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.340 
youth sick to death with what society
had<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.070> offer<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.150> think<00:02:35.720> we're<00:02:36.170> actually

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
had to offer so I think we're actually

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.069 
had to offer so I think we're actually
in<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:37.070> similar<00:02:37.549> kind<00:02:37.820> of<00:02:37.910> situation<00:02:38.570> coming<00:02:38.840> up

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
in a similar kind of situation coming up

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.199 
in a similar kind of situation coming up
with<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.709> know<00:02:39.859> with<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.280> recession<00:02:40.910> and

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
with you know with the recession and

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.289 
with you know with the recession and
unemployment<00:02:41.299> and<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:43.400> financial<00:02:43.609> crisis<00:02:44.209> I

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
unemployment and the financial crisis I

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.789 
unemployment and the financial crisis I
think<00:02:44.510> there<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.810> disenfranchised<00:02:45.680> youth

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
think there is a disenfranchised youth

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.699 
think there is a disenfranchised youth
so<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:47.420> are<00:02:47.570> looking<00:02:47.840> at<00:02:47.959> what's<00:02:48.200> going<00:02:48.350> out

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
so we are looking at what's going out

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.460 
so we are looking at what's going out
going<00:02:49.130> on<00:02:49.370> with

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
going on with

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.680 
going on with
music<00:02:51.280> fashion<00:02:51.460> culture<00:02:51.880> that's<00:02:52.120> underground

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
music fashion culture that's underground

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.230 
music fashion culture that's underground
trying<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.500> recapture<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.100> energy<00:02:54.550> make<00:02:55.060> it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
trying to recapture that energy make it

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.330 
trying to recapture that energy make it
new<00:02:55.570> again<00:02:55.600> which<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.350> why<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.530> trailer<00:02:57.160> does

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
new again which is why the trailer does

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.240 
new again which is why the trailer does
have<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.660> kind<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.870> punk<00:02:59.320> rock<00:02:59.560> ethos<00:03:00.010> but

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
have a kind of a punk rock ethos but

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.790 
have a kind of a punk rock ethos but
it's<00:03:00.370> not<00:03:00.550> old<00:03:01.420> school<00:03:01.690> punk<00:03:01.870> it's<00:03:02.170> something

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
it's not old school punk it's something

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.240 
it's not old school punk it's something
new

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.370 

still<00:03:06.150> probably<00:03:06.420> too<00:03:06.660> early<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:07.020> talk<00:03:07.170> about

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
still probably too early to talk about

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.560 
still probably too early to talk about
the<00:03:07.620> combat<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.040> be<00:03:08.160> honest<00:03:08.460> is<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.360> short

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
the combat to be honest is the short

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.150 
the combat to be honest is the short
answer<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.100> long<00:03:11.720> answer<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:13.110> mean<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:14.130> be

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
answer and the long answer I mean to be

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.000 
answer and the long answer I mean to be
honest<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:14.640> took<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:15.360> year<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.230> change<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.890> get

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
honest it took a year and change to get

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.490 
honest it took a year and change to get
to<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> final<00:03:17.490> looking<00:03:17.910> Dante<00:03:18.270> so<00:03:18.810> go<00:03:19.230> ahead<00:03:19.350> and

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
to a final looking Dante so go ahead and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.260 
to a final looking Dante so go ahead and
triangulate<00:03:20.280> what<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.610> might<00:03:20.760> take<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:21.030> get<00:03:21.210> to

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
triangulate what it might take to get to

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.900 
triangulate what it might take to get to
a<00:03:21.390> final<00:03:21.570> combat<00:03:22.080> knowing<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.709> combat<00:03:23.670> and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
a final combat knowing that combat and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.640 
a final combat knowing that combat and
Dante<00:03:24.240> are<00:03:24.270> basically<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.959> end-all<00:03:25.620> be-all

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
Dante are basically the end-all be-all

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.520 
Dante are basically the end-all be-all
in<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.310> lot<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.550> ways<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.970> what<00:03:27.150> makes<00:03:27.480> DMC<00:03:28.020> DMC

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
in a lot of ways of what makes DMC DMC

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.949 
in a lot of ways of what makes DMC DMC
so<00:03:28.860> yeah<00:03:29.520> there's<00:03:29.730> still<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> lot<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.510> work<00:03:30.720> left

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
so yeah there's still a lot of work left

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.580 
so yeah there's still a lot of work left
to<00:03:31.080> do<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.560> phase<00:03:31.920> one<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.490> phase<00:03:33.300> five<00:03:34.170> to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
to do this is phase one of phase five to

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.740 
to do this is phase one of phase five to
getting<00:03:34.860> this<00:03:34.950> game<00:03:35.190> onto<00:03:35.490> a<00:03:35.520> shelf<00:03:35.820> we<00:03:36.570> are

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.780 
getting this game onto a shelf we are
committed<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.580> deepening<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.700> broadening

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
committed to deepening and broadening

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.930 
committed to deepening and broadening
the<00:03:39.390> gameplay<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:40.140> ways<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.500> take<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.610> beyond

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the gameplay in ways that take it beyond

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.040 
the gameplay in ways that take it beyond
just<00:03:42.330> being<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:43.050> brawler<00:03:43.770> and<00:03:44.070> like<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.820> said<00:03:45.050> so

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
just being a brawler and like I said so

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.080 
just being a brawler and like I said so
much<00:03:46.200> time<00:03:46.530> between<00:03:47.040> now<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.640> when<00:03:47.760> we<00:03:47.790> ship

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
much time between now and when we ship

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.270 
much time between now and when we ship
and<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.390> lot<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.570> exploration<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.440> needs<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.130> be

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
and a lot of exploration and needs to be

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.229 
and a lot of exploration and needs to be
done<00:03:50.459> but<00:03:50.790> yet<00:03:51.209> we<00:03:51.390> are<00:03:51.620> broadly<00:03:52.620> speaking

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
done but yet we are broadly speaking

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.550 
done but yet we are broadly speaking
interested<00:03:54.239> in<00:03:54.390> deepening<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.200> gameplay

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560
