but<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.350> needs<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.650> work<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.490> real<00:01:37.880> kind<00:01:38.300> of

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
but it needs to work in a real kind of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.320 
but it needs to work in a real kind of
setting<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:38.900> that<00:01:39.110> battle<00:01:39.500> real<00:01:39.909> real<00:01:40.909> system

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
setting in that battle real real system

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.050 
setting in that battle real real system
so<00:01:42.140> what<00:01:42.290> we've<00:01:42.440> got<00:01:42.470> here<00:01:42.620> is<00:01:42.950> we've<00:01:43.100> got<00:01:43.340> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
things back stop grumbling start very

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.920 
things back stop grumbling start very
basic<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:42.170> what<00:02:42.320> we've<00:02:42.470> been<00:02:42.620> really

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
basic so what we've been really

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.130 
basic so what we've been really
is<00:02:44.439> to<00:02:44.620> make<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:45.010> war<00:02:45.280> but<00:02:45.939> they<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:46.239> be<00:02:46.629> far

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
is to make that war but they can be far

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.119 
is to make that war but they can be far
far<00:02:47.950> easier<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.579> fit<00:02:48.909> into<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.150> mix<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:50.140> actually

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
far easier to fit into a mix so actually

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.349 
far easier to fit into a mix so actually
what<00:02:51.280> we've<00:02:51.430> done<00:02:51.579> to<00:02:51.760> do<00:02:51.909> that<00:02:52.090> we've

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
what we've done to do that we've

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.990 
what we've done to do that we've
redesigned<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.620> bracing<00:02:54.099> panel

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
redesigned the bracing panel

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.110 
redesigned the bracing panel
we've<00:02:55.569> got<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> new<00:02:56.280> 90<00:02:57.280> degree<00:02:57.489> turn<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:57.790> Scott

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
we've got a new 90 degree turn on Scott

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.759 
we've got a new 90 degree turn on Scott
racing<00:02:58.599> so<00:02:58.689> it's<00:02:58.840> kind<00:02:59.019> of<00:02:59.079> tight<00:02:59.319> it's<00:02:59.590> nice

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
racing so it's kind of tight it's nice

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.520 
racing so it's kind of tight it's nice
and<00:02:59.980> controlled<00:03:00.310> but<00:03:01.090> lower<00:03:01.450> braces<00:03:02.049> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and controlled but lower braces the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.440 
and controlled but lower braces the
braces<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:03.129> let<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.609> wood<00:03:03.819> breathe<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.329> little

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
braces to let the wood breathe a little

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.610

vibration answer to get the guitar

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.869 
vibration answer to get the guitar
sounded<00:03:08.769> really<00:03:09.010> Lively

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879
