00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.420
 techno 01net today even more 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.639
 faster faster and faster 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.620
 it's the 4g is a potting soil is fast 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.120
 with all these rapids there but yes it is 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.440
 true that the operators wash us 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.029
 with the 4g step if you noticed 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.199
 but most all today 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.820
 so does that bring some 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.820
 thing to hide answer right away 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.130
 so the promise of the 4g we know 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.980
 because we're talking about it now 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.620
 several months otherwise it goes very fast 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.050
 that's the 4g it's more flow it's 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.809
 a latency time a better ping 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 but also we are 10 times the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.739
 3g french yes so that after it's 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.480
 numbers that the operators feast 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.059
 with these numbers there that are sum 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.890
 all pretty theoretical but basically the 4g 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.809
 you can promise debits in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.640
 fact that would be equivalent to fiber 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.050
 optical at home ring that you make yourself 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.430
 count it in the pocket every thing 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.079
 so fast that your phone cram 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 other roman you are where god he 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.789
 burns it's horrible good we tested and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.159
 finally it's still not bad but 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.320
 to give you an idea 4g 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.250
 it's 100 megabits of a second an airlock and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.100
 the theoretical numbers 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.360
 while the 3g it caps at 42 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.340
 megabits you're still it's the ax 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.409
 pulsed the last generation 3g 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.210
 so we wanted to judge on piece 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.860
 and we organize a little test in 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.030
 video watch this then there put the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.740
 small dishes in the big ones took 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.720
 full of phone the more we went 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.790
 feasted three smartphones under your eyes 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.710
 to have a galaxy s 4 that is equipped 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.299
 a chip 3g so we will stay at home 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.740
 the orange operator 1 we could have in 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.820
 choose another name chose this one 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.810
 same for the consistency of the tests have 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.729
 learned the same operator 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.460
 here is an area where we receive 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.670
 this operator the soul the galaxy s 4 is in 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.799
 3g the iphone 5 s being h + tomorrow it's the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.079
 super 3g room at 42 megabits second 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.659
 track and the famous 4g and well she is at 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.250
 inside the lg j 2 good you see 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.990
 on this occasion but here is the g2 which 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.460
 will soon be testing who is we going to say 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.229
 lg's flagship phone 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.520
 interesting enough who has a chip 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.260
 besides 4g that can ride up 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.180
 150 megabits second 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.010
 tell you time there it goes crazy we go for 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.360
 the tests are gone we are going to go 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.130
 we're going to start with a small 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.920
 speedtest here is a little software that 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.050
 shows us counter in support how 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.930
 what it looks like we have the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.630
 figures speak for themselves to the galaxy 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.910
 the galaxy s 4 in 3g so the iphone 5 is 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.980
 in older age and the lg I am two years old 4g 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.590
 Well, that's impressive, it's 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.500
 true that there the lg with 80 megabits 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.260
 second it's still good, huh 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.940
 18 about 21 and about 80 mega bits 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.180
 for the last batch d for the plot so 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.760
 the rising supply we are to you see it 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.230
 this mega for the 4g yeah so that's 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.670
 still impressive imagine 16 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.380
 megabit upload is four times more 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.550
 the Kalashnikov more so when it is 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.230
 when you have an adsl connection to the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.120
 house you ceiling at 1 mega so there 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.460
 it's still hot it's even more 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.530
 fast that in fact the stud in fiber 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.410
 optics that is capped in general or 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.000
 at 5 times gala dinner we have this year there 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.650
 conditions are optimal here but 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.650
 the cloud in 3g not bad either huh on 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.780
 is at 3 or 4 mega bits depending on 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.740
 in 3g or older age and the passage 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.660
 we realize that he does not have much 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.000
 difference between the traditional 3g 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.800
 in orange and the h chips option that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.390
 costs 5 euros more was virtually 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.959
 the same flows if you're still in 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.100
 rtc home makes you dream already 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.110
 already I wish you good luck 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.239
 to watch this video in hd I think 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.450
 that you need a week pretty well 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.340
 so beyond the geeks test with this 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.900
 speedtest storyteller seeing a little bit of it 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.030
 that it gives in the East in the facts 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.350
 and in practice and in practice by 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.310
 example if you want to download a 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.780
 application then we chose 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.910
 the application holds that's the ratp 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.769
 to see who is about 12 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.300
 mega byte well look what that 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.700
 give the drug it's impressive 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.940
 Here is the 4g snapshot that is 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.200
 to say that 12 mega are engulfed by going 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.760
 we will say one second 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.989
 impressive then against angers that 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.660
 takes a little more time well 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.760
 safe even if there is good there is a big 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.980
 difference between a download 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.030
 snapshot and three seconds 1 this is the 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.739
 question we could ask was 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.209
 actually but because there we are 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.680
 on the posted that's not all that huge 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.850
 to us but I live but if you 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.239
 download games that make 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.730
 today up to 50 100 200 mega bits 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.280
 200 megabytes so here we will finally see 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.440
 actually good look what that 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.420
 now gives upload because 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.430
 it's true that the 4g the promise is 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.290
 to send videos of big pictures 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.500
 etc or even big attachments 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.910
 in a snap of your fingers and that's it 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.770
 what does that give with a video on 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.720
 youtube videos on youtube that have 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.950
 been taken with the galaxy s 4 and this 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.940
 famous lg2 look at the difference in 3g 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.830
 it's going relatively fast 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.880
 ceding to specify that the files must be 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.550
 about the same weight yes a 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.190
 manhattan twenty mega and there 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.630
 again is well the 4g pushes everything 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.160
 it is true that there the count is when 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.740
 even pretty impressive 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.030
 so here is no photo to note that 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.980
 there we are in we were in 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.110
 visibly exceptional conditions 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.400
 ie the 4g she was from 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.190
 good mood no but we can imagine 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.060
 also that the network is almost empty 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.320
 because there are not many people 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.850
 who of course said them with 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.260
 subscriptions to sit with the furia of 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.639
 millions of users necessarily that 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.730
 it happens well before slowing down 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.230
 besides the promise of the 4g that will be 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.180
 as fast as optical fiber it 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.919
 do not hide the face it will be wrong 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.940
 because of course when we are all 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.620
 downloading big 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.919
 files on the same cell 4g on 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.750
 will not have this idiot to a word of the 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.770
 French price a word of rates 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.690
 so you have to know that the operators 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.010
 and it is precisely to value this 4g 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.750
 by increasing the price of subscriptions a 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.300
 look a little bit what's on offer 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.710
 the Bouygues SFR and Orange mobile free 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.419
 do not communicate for the 4g it should 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.430
 not delay but for now these are 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.290
 the three incumbent operators in 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.510
 general it's a there is a difference of 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.389
 5 to 10 euros for the same subscription in 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.430
 3g in 4g pay attention to the fair use 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.780
 to the data than the data plan that you 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.070
 are going to have because we can imagine 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.610
 they are four young and we can 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.350
 Download 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.300
 here we can imagine that in 4g you 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.020
 have downloaded faster and therefore more 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.560
 so take a package with more data 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.520
 available 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.320
 and then with regard to the cover 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.970
 is well then the 4g is in the process of 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.350
 to settle in the big cities 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.669
 I'm going to battle that operators 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.710
 is leading right now it's enough 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.540
 impressive is fierce the goal 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.240
 it's 40% coverage for the end of 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.240
 the year then both at bouygues 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.500
 at orange and at sfr bouygues ça va 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.970
 arrive a little earlier to note 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.290
 that the particularity of the 4g network of 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.860
 Bouygues is that it will be compatible 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.379
 with the previous iphone 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.330
 the iphone 5 which will be the only one in France to 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.430
 able to capture the 3g the 4g will be so 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.199
 at bouygues telecom here is the 4g 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.449
 concretely what does it look like 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.810
 really wanted to judge on piece to 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.090
 through 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.080
 here are two more things 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.550
 maybe two little questions that 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.250
 you ask yourself 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.870
 if you change devices I confirm 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.889
 and although it is 4g compatible because 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.819
 that he still has phones that are 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.979
 not compatible 4g 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.840
 look at that well and then know that in 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.330
 terms of autonomy we had said that 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.560
 their 4g phones to consume them 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.900
 a lot more energy than a phone 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.009
 in 3g well it's wrong 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.110
 the first tests that I could lead 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.400
 shows that not only does it not consume 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.960
 more than a phone in 3g but I 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.710
 the impression that we if the phone 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.050
 is well optimized 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.219
 it consumes less so here it is 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.969
 maybe some information too 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:57.129
 important 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:58.719
 here for the 4g we meet tomorrow 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.250
 with another subject but you 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:02.250
 high-tech hi all quickly
