00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
developers for pocket might as well to
try<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.159> hackers<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.850> less<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.630> it's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
try and get hackers to be less and it's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
try and get hackers to be less and it's
quite<00:01:45.990> hard<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:47.100> other

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
quite hard to do that when you get other

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.649 
quite hard to do that when you get other
people<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.640> community<00:01:47.700> who<00:01:48.000> developed

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
people in the community who developed

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.990 
people in the community who developed
the<00:01:48.750> hacker<00:01:48.899> software<00:01:49.280> but<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.579> try<00:01:50.820> our

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the hacker software but we do try our

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.760 
the hacker software but we do try our
best<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.659> quite<00:01:51.840> hard<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.079> start<00:01:52.409> coding

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
best and it's quite hard to start coding

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.050 
best and it's quite hard to start coding
different<00:01:53.159> hacking<00:01:53.460> software<00:01:53.759> because<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
different hacking software because the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.530 
different hacking software because the
community<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.600> new<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:56.219> yeah<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.149> lbs

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
community so new and and yeah like lbs

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.020 
community so new and and yeah like lbs
chi<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.840> tried<00:01:58.110> doing<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:59.340> work<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> sub

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
chi have tried doing it it's work to sub

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.090 
chi have tried doing it it's work to sub
cases<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.750> obviously<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.649> start<00:02:01.950> up

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
cases but obviously as you start up

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.399 
cases but obviously as you start up
making<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.610> own<00:02:02.640> anti<00:02:03.180> hacks<00:02:03.360> someone<00:02:04.290> else

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
making your own anti hacks someone else

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.420 
making your own anti hacks someone else
comes<00:02:04.590> along<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.799> says<00:02:04.920> oh<00:02:05.100> no<00:02:05.159> I'm<00:02:05.369> just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
comes along and says oh no I'm just

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.089 
comes along and says oh no I'm just
gonna<00:02:05.549> make<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:06.060> hacking<00:02:06.509> software<00:02:06.869> better

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
gonna make one hacking software better

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.800 
gonna make one hacking software better
so<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.429> constant<00:02:08.849> battle<00:02:09.119> between<00:02:09.149> us<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so it's constant battle between us and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.809 
so it's constant battle between us and
hackers

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
hackers
