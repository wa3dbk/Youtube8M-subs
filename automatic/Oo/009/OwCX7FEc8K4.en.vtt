00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.230
 and 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.750
 well hello to everyone these cui 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.830
 that human I am delighted to you 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.570
 welcome back with me for my 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.029
 new video that will be today a 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.070
 top 10 best keyboard shortcuts 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.150
 windows because yes you can do 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.070
 whatever you want with your 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.320
 slider you do not even imagine everything 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.879
 that you can do with your keyboard 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.829
 so two little things before 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.360
 start know that this is not a top 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.340
 10 graduated that I'm not going to do a 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.710
 number 10 which would be means to arrive 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.539
 a number one that would be incredible no 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.890
 all shortcuts are worth it 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.719
 really a selection that I made me 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.690
 same and that I find it indispensable for 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.190
 any user a second 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.820
 little thing when I talk about touch 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.210
 windows 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.970
 I'm talking about this key here it is 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.860
 you 're forewarned get ready it's 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.049
 party number 1 key f3 simply 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.840
 f3 key that can be replaced by 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.040
 control f if that does not work serves to 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.020
 to research 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.270
 a search in the page here you 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.200
 press f 3 by me I press 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.530
 control what does not it work 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.810
 always 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.310
 and then in your browser appears 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.689
 this little bar where you have everything 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.119
 just type a strong text that me 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:28.389
 also I put vilaj vilaj I'm going all 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.090
 just have the words village that 

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:33.310
 will be highlighted here that's it so it's 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.999
 rather simple if you want to spotted a 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.209
 topic in particular here's number two 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.740
 halts a screen a combination rather 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.479
 known but remember that they 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.490
 deserve to be called it serves all 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.139
 simply to take a screenshot 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.929
 then the alt key is located while 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:53.170
 bottom left and a screen is located all 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.979
 in the top right here is what you do 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.469
 a screen with rest stops and then you go 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.119
 in paint 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.130
 you've been down since you 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.439
 put snare and then here you can 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.299
 save your screenshot know 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.119
 that if the text 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.940
 a screen and in different colors in 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.530
 done this is the case on my keyboard you 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.630
 go find the key on the keyboard 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.709
 which has the same color for example - for 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.209
 take a screenshot I can not 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.050
 press alt and I have to press 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.239
 the fn key 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.220
 no reference to the national front no 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.380
 fn just means functions so I 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.120
 have to press functions 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.930
 a screen that's about the same 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.230
 it's just like this is number 3 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.940
 windows plus she then windows serves 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.200
 simply lock the session 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.610
 I can not do you a 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.870
 demonstration more than I'm trying 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.760
 to register like you can do me 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.220
 trust 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.180
 number four alt + tab 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.260
 a little later simply down 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.020
 scroll through the apps that are 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.680
 open on low on your computer 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.200
 quite simply 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.310
 here you can easily get to 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.620
 an application a trick you want 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.760
 number 5 e windows + tab 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.610
 so in fact it's exactly the same 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.730
 than the previous except that it's a lot 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.600
 more case that's just 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.670
 yes I'm lazy number 6 because 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.930
 I have a small fault in my hands 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.040
 more knob control 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.600
 so if you have a wheel that 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.550
 mouse brain what I hope when 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.020
 even what is quite prevalent and you 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.820
 done against them more knurling and I'm going 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.680
 just posted but the elements of the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.300
 office since control over wheel 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.340
 simply serves to zoom in here you are 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.260
 can zoom in folders but not that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.330
 I do not use game especially on 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.920
 web pages to zoom in on a page 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.710
 internet you have control wheel 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.210
 forward and backward 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.170
 in short you understood alt + f 4 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.570
 combinations as well known and who 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.250
 deserve to be called halt at +16 4 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.870
 Closes the current application 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.230
 for example there I am under opera 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.200
 I press alt f4 and my page closes 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.090
 do not do this on your desk otherwise 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.020
 your computer i come it's a whole 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.690
 simply number fast windows + peace 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.860
 so windows + peace i want it done 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.930
 immediately everyone is suspicious 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.490
 is for those who have plugged their 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.330
 computer on a screen if you have a 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.580
 desktop 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.610
 that's me I did on my computer 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.859
 laptop that but it's actually missing in 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.080
 does all all the parameters of 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.180
 fittings so disconnect the producer 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:26.280
 duplicate and tender projectors 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:29.490
 only here is number 9 of windows + e 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.470
 I do it right now the windows + e 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.080
 Well, it's just the job of 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.720
 work here or computer that allows 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.070
 to access it extremely quickly and 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.950
 number 10 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.470
 maybe 1 1 which is very nice so 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.060
 it's the f2 key you click on a 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.770
 folder 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.670
 I loved you stuff everything you press 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:54.000
 f2 and here we can rename the file 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.090
 it's all stupid so here I hope that 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.100
 this video you liked if it is the case 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.990
 I invite you if it is not 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.400
 already done to subscribe to my channel a 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.380
 left a little blue thumbs it's like 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.910
 you want it here I hope it's 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.380
 god pleased you as for me I tell you

 ciao
