 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.960
 your home welcome to sandro for 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.370
 we're going to show you some shots of 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.800
 contact that we have made with the liquid 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.830
 of a terminal to make price 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.969
 content a pretty simple design 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.800
 and pretty thin so we're going to 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.220
 take a good look let's start 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.720
 by the physical appearance of the liquid in the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.040
 terminal that the manufacturer presented 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.480
 Does it really expect a design 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.739
 attractive and undoubtedly are the main 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.570
 characteristics that this has 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.829
 device is not very finite weighs very 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.809
 little let's talk a little bit about the design 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.080
 how is a line is very rounded is 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.920
 a screen 5 inches 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.750
 As you can see we have the buttons 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.830
 directly integrated into the screen what 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.270
 that we know that many of you 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.550
 like a speaker if everything in the part 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.140
 superior with a rather peculiar design 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.510
 and if we go to one of the sides 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.360
 we will be able to count the control of 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.460
 volume as we see is really fine in 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.310
 the other side we will be able to count on 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.810
 the reader for microsd cards and if you 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.880
 we turn around as you see and we 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.590
 we find here with a finish in this 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.030
 plastic case or logically can 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.980
 to be otherwise is a terminal 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.839
 quite low cost that if you see 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.070
 stain quite easily we have the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.470
 speaker on the part 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.450
 lower upper part intended for 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.330
 the speaker the flash and in the part 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.550
 lower connection microusb and in the part 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.500
 top we have the 3.5 jack and the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.760
 button to unlock the good terminal 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.260
 let's talk a little bit in this case 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.340
 of the presentation software that has 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.040
 done to do as you see we have the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.200
 version 4.4 points 2 android kitkat 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.600
 that logically comes personalized 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.280
 with the manufacturer to do as is a 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.360
 small topic as you see animations a 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.400
 little different from what we are 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.680
 accustomed the box of applications 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.990
 they are also slightly redesigned with 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.880
 applications with widgets as you see a 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.619
 typical we are not very lovers 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.180
 of this kind of customizations since 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.340
 As you can see, it has not gone completely smooth 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.200
 nevertheless it is a terminal as I say 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.250
 quite pretty powerful since we 've 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.539
 talked about the software we're going to see a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.100
 little bit of the jagua so that you know what 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.210
 is what has in this case we 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.250
 we found with a processor 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.899
 mediatek and logically could not be another 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.060
 way a Chinese processor we have already 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.710
 seen from 1.3 gigahertz a gig of ram 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.750
 and in the storage section we 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.149
 we found 8 gigs let's see a 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.190
 little bit what is the storage that 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.050
 we are left for the user as you see 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.640
 We have available 5 gigas for the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.950
 user battery 2000 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.260
 100 min amps a battery that we 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.610
 do something justita we'll see how it is 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.200
 behaves in day to day also 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.170
 important we do not have in this case 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.330
 lte connectivity for this jade to do 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.709
 Well, you know, let's talk 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.290
 little of the screen in this case 5 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.000
 inch full hd screen in this case 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.500
 is a ips panel like the area of 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.790
 terminals that usually uses the truth 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.530
 that looks really good is a size 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.630
 quite restrained and we liked about 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.709
 all side frames the truth that 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.060
 they have done at least they have tried 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.310
 make an effort to make them 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.620
 relatively contained and as you see a 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.050
 sufficient screen five inches and 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.310
 the truth is that it does not paint anything we're going 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.320
 to give a little bit of the front camera 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.160
 in this case, as you can see, sound is bad 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.840
 result a 1.5 megapixel camera 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.489
 the truth that works enough and we 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.050
 let's go to the back for the camera 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.790
 back we have a 13 mega camera 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.860
 pixels only so you can see the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.200
 shutter speed let's try 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.030
 focus and we shoot as you see a 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.650
 world's greatest experience more 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.000
 fast we have a panoramic format 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.239
 we have the possibility to record in full 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.500
 hd is the multimedia section of the good 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.120
 this is the review that we have given him 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.920
 terminal crazy as you see without big 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.000
 pretensions we can not ask you either 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.800
 too much we will see 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.050
 when it comes from the hand of the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.640
 operators a pretty content price 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.710
 so good this has been the taking of 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.710
 contact see you soon soon
