00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.490
 I'll always have that again 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.769
 I will cover the top by the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.880
 You can leave four millimeters of writing 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.010
 you also through the three millimeters 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.320
 let slices 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.700
 then i have my heat here i have 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.530
 this is the pig that usually hangs here 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.850
 it's called 24 26 sharp stars then 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.489
 I have a small spice mixture here 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.329
 with garlic you can take fresh 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.129
 or liquid as always ok I do that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.550
 whole now the manufacturer I show 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.840
 you okay now I have one here 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.219
 small tag that's not yet 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.680
 too many, I actually do that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.460
 still not there for you all the time 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 to the side 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:13.020
 then I take my good one here now 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:15.259
 location and my spices so that constanta 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.799
 later still through 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.740
 and how I let this through now 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.580
 to show that to me 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.270
 Maybe we'll see that for me 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.720
 defects so i have the group now 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.720
 let through 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:40.060
 and now the whole thing is well mixed 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:43.350
 not too strong so by a rough 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.350
 plant has to be seen a bit 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.760
 so that was it now to be completely and indeed 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.930
 with wolf because that's a small amount 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.560
 I do not mean that to myself 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.500
 thirst dirty dirty okay like that 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.220
 short a fill or minster 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.260
 filled at the same time so I have 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.320
 already brought up here 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:13.750
 as I said, that's the foundation 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.390
 team space 24 26 usually like 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.640
 said index finger thumb if we then 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.470
 still middle finger to hold on and 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.230
 if it gets stuck in front again and again 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.450
 push forward before pushing because 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.520
 okay, I'll fill it up now 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.460
 I do not have to show you where I show 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.910
 it then when it's done 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.739
 I got four pieces out okay 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.600
 I will smoke now at 50 degrees and 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.790
 about an hour long and then still 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.830
 times three four five six hours is coming 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.239
 on how you want to have the color 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:53.200
 So can at between 12 and 25 degrees on 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:57.250
 best easy 18 to 25 degrees 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.540
 where I'm not too cold at the time 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.730
 twelve degrees or something 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.820
 They are usually taken for long-matured 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.790
 you want to have 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:13.180
 I do not have to, I already have 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.380
 more often asked why I got 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.380
 the apartment so the air yes from the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.700
 why would sausage why right now 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.160
 The brother is not that bad 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.600
 there it is of course when the bleed sees 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.340
 one that I sit then also kalla 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.220
 in abdallah it would not be quite so 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.690
 bad but just if you knew 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.600
 then it can happen when there is air in it 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.030
 Is that me if you want to ripen longer 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.340
 that I form yeast at it or just 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.140
 airborne bacteria anyway 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.400
 they can then do harm and 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.150
 that's why you should of course try 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.909
 as well as he can 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.159
 pick big air holes for it 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.409
 I always stocker or how 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:54.060
 my grandma said pixar 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.470
 but he calls himself stepper okay me 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.730
 Show you that was short with the smoking 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.709
 shows you but of course then 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.329
 if one is finished so hopps 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.159
 infected now but from both sides 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.769
 I stuck with it properly 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.750
 heat is so 50 degrees should have 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.609
 be inside 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.519
 and as I said an hour ago and 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:14.370
 then at the earliest after smoking my 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.940
 deficits are done no longer 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.079
 made of it very nice color and the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.680
 of course I want to go now as well 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.490
 try 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:28.889
 no question I have it all 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:35.550
 made up briefly warm and easy times 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:38.449
 Look how she tastes out of the hat 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.449
 pulling is always good 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.720
 the idea for the cluster is awesome right now 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.870
 just try it 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.430
 My little fallen through it again 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.650
