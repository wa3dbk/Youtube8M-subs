recommendation<00:04:21.979> is<00:04:22.840> very<00:04:23.840> simple<00:04:24.169> which<00:04:25.160> is

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
recommendation is very simple which is

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.250 
recommendation is very simple which is
to<00:04:25.430> pay<00:04:25.639> yourself<00:04:26.060> definitely<00:04:26.870> with<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.110> on

that<00:04:27.349> one<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.770> I'm<00:04:27.979> with<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.550> on<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.699> one

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
that one and I'm with you on that one

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.089 
that one and I'm with you on that one
one<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.449> the<00:04:29.539> things<00:04:29.720> that<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.110> think<00:04:30.349> we<00:04:30.500> all<00:04:30.710> do

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
one of the things that I think we all do

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.330 
one of the things that I think we all do
is<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.729> not<00:04:31.880> count<00:04:32.240> ourselves<00:04:32.419> in<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:33.740> cost<00:04:34.010> of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
is to not count ourselves in the cost of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.010 
is to not count ourselves in the cost of
the<00:04:34.430> business<00:04:34.789> because<00:04:35.090> we're<00:04:35.300> reinvesting

in<00:04:36.199> it<00:04:36.410> looking<00:04:36.949> at<00:04:37.070> yourself<00:04:37.220> as<00:04:37.880> part<00:04:38.599> of<00:04:38.660> the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
in it looking at yourself as part of the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.600 
in it looking at yourself as part of the
cost<00:04:38.990> structure<00:04:39.349> of<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.740> business<00:04:40.160> is

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
cost structure of the business is

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.610 
cost structure of the business is
something<00:04:41.060> none<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.240> us<00:04:41.389> do<00:04:41.599> very<00:04:41.840> well<00:04:41.930> but

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
something none of us do very well but

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.290 
something none of us do very well but
it's<00:04:42.770> incredibly<00:04:43.340> important<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:43.970> it's

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
it's incredibly important and it's

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.390 
it's incredibly important and it's
critical<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:44.840> do<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.260> in<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.470> context<00:04:46.280> of

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
critical to do that in the context of

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.730
