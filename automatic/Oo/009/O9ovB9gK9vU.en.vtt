00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
out that good but there's markings so

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.880 
out that good but there's markings so
yeah<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:22.720> was<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.050> first<00:01:23.229> ever<00:01:23.530> figure

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890

that<00:01:23.920> I've<00:01:24.190> painted<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:24.910> think<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.210> came

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
that I've painted and I think it came

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.200 
that I've painted and I think it came
out<00:01:25.540> really<00:01:25.750> nice<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:29.140> next<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:29.979> have<00:01:30.100> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
out really nice so next we have a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.249 
out really nice so next we have a
splinter<00:01:31.210> camo<00:01:31.630> Panzer<00:01:32.380> crewman<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.990> guy's

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
splinter camo Panzer crewman this guy's

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.350 
splinter camo Panzer crewman this guy's
the<00:01:35.470> second<00:01:35.860> guy<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:35.950> painted<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:36.610> think<00:01:37.210> it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
the second guy I painted and I think it

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.600 
the second guy I painted and I think it
came<00:01:37.540> out<00:01:37.690> pretty<00:01:37.750> nice<00:01:38.140> maybe<00:01:38.680> not<00:01:38.979> as<00:01:39.190> good

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
came out pretty nice maybe not as good

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.640 
came out pretty nice maybe not as good
as<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.060> first<00:01:40.210> one<00:01:40.509> but<00:01:40.690> it's<00:01:41.380> winter

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
as the first one but it's winter

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.980 
as the first one but it's winter
camouflage<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.340> lot<00:01:42.550> harder<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:43.030> paint<00:01:48.990> both

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
camouflage is a lot harder to paint both

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.190 
camouflage is a lot harder to paint both
these<00:01:50.290> figures<00:01:50.680> took<00:01:50.979> me<00:01:51.160> around<00:01:51.910> I<00:01:52.330> would<00:01:52.960> say

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
these figures took me around I would say

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.890 
these figures took me around I would say
five<00:01:53.680> hours<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:54.159> me<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:55.150> it<00:01:55.330> seems<00:01:55.540> like<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.720> lot

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
five hours to me and it seems like a lot

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.530 
five hours to me and it seems like a lot
but<00:01:56.250> painting<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.430> very<00:01:57.670> time<00:01:57.940> consuming<00:01:57.970> if

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
but painting is very time consuming if

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.880 
but painting is very time consuming if
