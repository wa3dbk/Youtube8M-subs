I think what NCS does is it does show
that<00:01:55.729> we<00:01:55.909> are<00:01:56.180> capable<00:01:56.720> of<00:01:57.229> doing<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.130> lot<00:01:58.820> more

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
that we are capable of doing a lot more

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.969 
that we are capable of doing a lot more
than<00:01:59.090> people<00:01:59.510> expect<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.350> actually<00:02:00.830> I'm

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
than people expect and actually I'm

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.980 
than people expect and actually I'm
quite<00:02:01.190> surprised<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:02.390> know<00:02:02.510> thinking<00:02:02.900> about

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
quite surprised you know thinking about

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.890 
quite surprised you know thinking about
just<00:02:03.560> 15<00:02:03.920> 16<00:02:04.310> 17<00:02:04.729> year-olds<00:02:05.150> raising<00:02:05.840> a

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
just 15 16 17 year-olds raising a

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.859 
just 15 16 17 year-olds raising a
thousand<00:02:06.350> pounds<00:02:06.619> for<00:02:06.710> charity<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:07.810> think<00:02:08.810> is

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
thousand pounds for charity I think is

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.210 
thousand pounds for charity I think is
invaluable<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.590> don't<00:02:09.770> have<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.070> many

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
invaluable you don't have that many

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.400 
invaluable you don't have that many
opportunities<00:02:10.399> anymore<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.450> go<00:02:11.600> off<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.080> do

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
opportunities anymore to go off and do

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.440 
opportunities anymore to go off and do
something<00:02:12.650> by<00:02:12.920> yourself<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:14.120> know<00:02:14.240> I<00:02:14.270> think

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
something by yourself you know I think

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.880 
something by yourself you know I think
especially<00:02:14.990> when<00:02:15.110> you're<00:02:15.230> at<00:02:15.350> school<00:02:15.620> you're

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
especially when you're at school you're

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.449 
especially when you're at school you're
very<00:02:16.820> looked<00:02:17.000> after<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.950> lovely<00:02:19.280> sort

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
very looked after and it's a lovely sort

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.280 
very looked after and it's a lovely sort
of<00:02:19.550> transition<00:02:20.180> between<00:02:20.330> school<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:20.959> perhaps

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
of transition between school and perhaps

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.350 
of transition between school and perhaps
going<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.890> college<00:02:22.010> or<00:02:22.280> university<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
going on to college or university the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.120 
going on to college or university the
biggest<00:02:23.900> thing<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.410> learned<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:24.920> to

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
biggest thing that I learned it's to

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.040 
biggest thing that I learned it's to
give<00:02:25.310> back<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.090> community<00:02:26.630> because

give back to the community because

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.860 
give back to the community because
already<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.950> community<00:02:28.430> helps<00:02:28.940> us<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.660> many

it's<00:02:36.470> helpful<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:37.190> see<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.430> world<00:02:37.610> a

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
it's helpful to to see the world a

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.130 
it's helpful to to see the world a
little<00:02:37.790> bit<00:02:38.000> differently<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.959> learn

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
little bit differently and to learn

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.930 
little bit differently and to learn
something<00:02:39.190> about<00:02:40.190> themselves<00:02:40.400> they<00:02:40.730> never

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
something about themselves they never

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.150
