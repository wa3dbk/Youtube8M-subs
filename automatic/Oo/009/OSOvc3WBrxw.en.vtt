00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
payback will be in the ability to do

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
payback will be in the ability to do
molecular<00:00:44.460> imaging<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.150> and<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:47.000> 90<00:00:48.000> 95

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
molecular imaging and and you know 90 95

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.280 
molecular imaging and and you know 90 95
percent<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.420> do<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.840> imaging

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
percent of what we do in the imaging

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.680 
percent of what we do in the imaging
world<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.860> cancer<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.640> structural

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
world in cancer is structural

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.050 
world in cancer is structural
so<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.050> image<00:00:55.320> structures<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.130> image<00:00:56.490> features

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
so we image structures we image features

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.069 
so we image structures we image features
that<00:00:57.390> are<00:00:57.960> static<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.480> but<00:01:00.480> many<00:01:00.690> many

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that are static and so but many many

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.039 
that are static and so but many many
tumors<00:01:01.650> that<00:01:01.980> can't<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.280> cured<00:01:02.610> today

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
tumors that can't be cured today

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.170 
tumors that can't be cured today
essentially<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.460> incurable<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
essentially are incurable because of a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.690 
essentially are incurable because of a
very<00:01:06.570> complex<00:01:07.110> molecular<00:01:07.409> signaling<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.520> them

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
very complex molecular signaling in them

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.330 
very complex molecular signaling in them
and<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.259> need<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.680> molecular

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and so what we really need is molecular

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.600 
and so what we really need is molecular
imaging<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.620> way<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.979> resolve<00:01:14.159> those

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
imaging and and the way we resolve those

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.100 
imaging and and the way we resolve those
molecules<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.420> through<00:01:15.600> spectroscopic

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
molecules is through spectroscopic

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.700 
molecules is through spectroscopic
techniques<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.490> we're<00:01:17.700> integrating

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
techniques and so we're integrating

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.340 
techniques and so we're integrating
molecular<00:01:19.710> spectroscopy<00:01:20.190> into<00:01:21.060> CT<00:01:21.479> into<00:01:21.840> MRI

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
molecular spectroscopy into CT into MRI

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.880 
molecular spectroscopy into CT into MRI
and<00:01:22.740> ultrasound<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:23.820> way<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:25.440> take<00:01:25.680> that

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and ultrasound as a way to to take that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.260 
and ultrasound as a way to to take that
next<00:01:26.159> step<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.180> imaging<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.220> tracking

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
next step in in imaging and tracking

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
next step in in imaging and tracking
tumors<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.720> today<00:01:31.260> and<00:01:31.530> curable<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
tumors that are today and curable and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.310 
tumors that are today and curable and
hopefully<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.790> future<00:01:32.900> we<00:01:33.900> will<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.200> able

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
hopefully in the future we will be able

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
hopefully in the future we will be able
to<00:01:35.060> decode<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.479> molecular<00:01:36.960> signaling<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
to decode that molecular signaling and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.450 
to decode that molecular signaling and
make<00:01:39.119> them<00:01:39.299> curable<00:01:39.860> another<00:01:40.860> focus<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.340> your

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
make them curable another focus of your

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.219 
make them curable another focus of your
work<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.909> laser<00:01:42.150> therapy<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
work is laser therapy and and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.020 
work is laser therapy and and
specifically<00:01:44.010> a<00:01:44.250> technique<00:01:44.790> known<00:01:44.820> as

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
specifically a technique known as

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.780 
specifically a technique known as
photodynamic<00:01:45.900> therapy

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
photodynamic therapy

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.730 
photodynamic therapy
what<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> photodynamic<00:01:48.510> therapy<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.560> what

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
what is photodynamic therapy and what

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.490 
what is photodynamic therapy and what
are<00:01:49.860> its<00:01:49.890> advantages<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.110> photodynamic

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
are its advantages so photodynamic

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.399 
are its advantages so photodynamic
therapy<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:53.490> has<00:01:54.420> been<00:01:54.630> around<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.260> while

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
therapy is has been around for a while

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.880 
therapy is has been around for a while
it's<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.070> combination<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.890> chemotherapy

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
it's the combination of a chemotherapy

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's the combination of a chemotherapy
like<00:01:59.310> drug<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.960> light<00:02:01.200> activated<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
like drug that is light activated so

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.179 
like drug that is light activated so
it's<00:02:02.280> inherently<00:02:02.759> tied<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:03.689> laser

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
it's inherently tied in with laser

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.590 
it's inherently tied in with laser
development<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.400> so<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.790> inject<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.479> drug

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
development and so you inject the drug

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.770 
development and so you inject the drug
you<00:02:07.140> wait<00:02:08.009> til<00:02:08.220> localizes<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> tissue<00:02:09.599> you

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
you wait til localizes in the tissue you

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.940 
you wait til localizes in the tissue you
to<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.920> treated<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:12.299> and<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> tissue<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:13.830> is

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
to be treated and and the tissue then is

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.500 
to be treated and and the tissue then is
irradiated<00:02:14.430> either<00:02:14.760> internally<00:02:15.480> or

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
irradiated either internally or

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.349 
irradiated either internally or
externally<00:02:15.950> with<00:02:16.950> laser<00:02:17.189> light<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.150> so

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
externally with laser light and and so

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.820 
externally with laser light and and so
that<00:02:18.510> produces<00:02:19.290> a

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that produces a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.280

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.980 
cancer and prostate cancer as a
physicist<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:41.640> what<00:02:41.910> are<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.030> attractions

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
physicist what what are the attractions

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.410 
physicist what what are the attractions
of<00:02:43.200> working<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.220> multidisciplinary<00:02:44.820> field

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
of working in a multidisciplinary field

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.090 
of working in a multidisciplinary field
like<00:02:45.840> biomedical<00:02:46.470> optics

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
like biomedical optics

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.870 
like biomedical optics
I<00:02:47.130> think<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.910> attraction<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:49.070> for<00:02:50.070> people<00:02:50.670> who

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
I think the attraction is for people who

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.300 
I think the attraction is for people who
are<00:02:51.090> technically<00:02:51.810> trained<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.560> want<00:02:52.950> to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
are technically trained and want to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.410 
are technically trained and want to
impact<00:02:54.150> healthcare<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.610> Medical

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
impact healthcare that the Medical

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.330 
impact healthcare that the Medical
Physics<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> natural<00:02:58.410> attraction<00:02:58.500> because

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
Physics is a natural attraction because

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.890 
Physics is a natural attraction because
you<00:02:59.550> can<00:03:00.210> use<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.810> tools<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.700> quantitative

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
you can use the tools the quantitative

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.110 
you can use the tools the quantitative
physical<00:03:04.010> tools<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.310> expertise<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.820> you

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
physical tools and expertise that you

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.750 
physical tools and expertise that you
have<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.620> affect<00:03:08.040> positively

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
have and and to affect positively

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.760 
have and and to affect positively
society<00:03:09.540> through<00:03:09.780> through<00:03:10.080> healthcare<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
society through through healthcare and

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.550 
society through through healthcare and
so<00:03:10.920> many<00:03:11.130> many<00:03:11.820> people<00:03:12.060> who<00:03:12.780> have<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.080> physics

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
so many many people who have a physics

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.730 
so many many people who have a physics

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840

them in and and they can do something
that<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.680> positive<00:03:29.130> for<00:03:29.250> society<00:03:29.810> what

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
that that is positive for society what

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.270 
that that is positive for society what
do<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:30.959> think<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.200> future<00:03:31.500> holds<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:31.800> lasers

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
puzzle but really to solve you know

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.029 
puzzle but really to solve you know
these<00:05:07.909> are<00:05:08.090> multidisciplinary<00:05:08.770> problems<00:05:09.770> and

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
these are multidisciplinary problems and

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.270 
these are multidisciplinary problems and
so<00:05:10.250> really<00:05:10.909> to<00:05:11.150> do<00:05:11.330> anything<00:05:11.889> useful<00:05:12.889> to

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
so really to do anything useful to

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.820 
so really to do anything useful to
translate<00:05:13.969> what<00:05:14.479> we've<00:05:14.629> discovered<00:05:15.110> we<00:05:15.500> we

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
translate what we've discovered we we

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.740 
translate what we've discovered we we
have<00:05:16.039> to<00:05:16.250> have<00:05:16.280> that<00:05:16.639> team<00:05:16.940> approach<00:05:17.180> that

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
have to have that team approach that

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.469 
have to have that team approach that
that<00:05:18.020> would<00:05:18.139> be<00:05:18.289> my<00:05:18.469> my<00:05:18.889> most<00:05:19.190> dominant<00:05:20.120> advice

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
that would be my my most dominant advice

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:32.239 
that would be my my most dominant advice
