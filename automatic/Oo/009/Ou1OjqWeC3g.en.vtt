this<00:01:30.150> phone<00:01:30.330> actually<00:01:32.000> house<00:01:33.000> itself<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:34.200> this

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
this phone actually house itself in this

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.430 
this phone actually house itself in this
interactive<00:01:35.400> color<00:01:35.820> coded<00:01:36.150> dot<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:37.259> this

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
interactive color coded dot now this

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.050 
interactive color coded dot now this
phone<00:01:37.650> actually<00:01:37.860> comes<00:01:38.160> in<00:01:38.369> four<00:01:38.670> separate

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
phone actually comes in four separate

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
this screen is this a TV this is one of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.070 
this screen is this a TV this is one of
Japan's<00:01:55.410> new<00:01:55.950> TV<00:01:56.460> systems<00:01:56.910> where<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:57.750> will<00:01:57.990> be

able<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.800> access<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.790> network<00:02:00.030> lovely<00:02:00.479> we're

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
able to access a network lovely we're

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
able to access a network lovely we're
not<00:02:00.720> in<00:02:00.810> Japan<00:02:00.900> when<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:01.680> brought<00:02:01.890> an<00:02:01.979> aerial

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
not in Japan when they brought an aerial

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.719 
not in Japan when they brought an aerial
so<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.610> still<00:02:02.820> works<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.690> is<00:02:03.869> more<00:02:04.080> like<00:02:04.729> five

so it still works this is more like five

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.010 
so it still works this is more like five

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.789 
video obviously there's just the one
sensor<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:34.330> I<00:03:34.360> won't<00:03:34.569> be<00:03:34.690> able<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.900> record<00:03:35.200> 3d

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.000 
sensor so I won't be able to record 3d
data<00:03:35.980> itself
