 foundation of the American dream and for a 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.559
 good reason as owner of your own home 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.480
 you are making money with the increase 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.859

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.320
 those who rent who spend money 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.760
 while increasing the acquired value of 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.620
 its owners 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.180
 the value acquired is probably the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.190
 reason why you own your 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.190
 own house but who is the owner of 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.350

 the houses the household items with 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.640
 they have a required value too 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.379
 millions and millions of ordinary people and 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.269
 current they walk on a gold mine 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.310
 in the required value every day and ni 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.740
 they even realize 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.860
 now there is a way to convert the 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.230
 household expenses in household income 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.170
 as with a concept of a lot of sense 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.240
 common called house gold 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.100
 a concept that allows you to win 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.140
 value acquired content in products 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.170
 that are used in homes everywhere 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.810
 the keywords are value acquired 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.700
 because most of the products in 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.979
 the homes of the people were bought 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.539
 in retail stores as well as 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.759
 real estate contain a value 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.830
 acquired the commercial goods with 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.210
 they have an acquired value also without 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.159
 But most buyers 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.720
 give away this value acquired in their 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.039
 commercial goods to stores 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.810
 commercial when people 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.729
 understanding is commercials are carried 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.619
 the product but traders 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.390
 they carry the profit and the profit comes out 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.970
 directly from the acquired value of the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.580
 family in each home this is what 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.590
 happens a merchant buys an item 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.789
 wholesale for $ 10 then sell it 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.560
 for 20 dollars 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.420
 the merchant immediately deposits the 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.690
 earning 10 dollars on his own 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.580
 correct bank account if the buyer 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.770
 he took the product but the merchant 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.929
 he took the profit 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 It would be great if buyers 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.670
 they will take the product and you will take 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.619
 the profit would not be fabulous to convert 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.060
 your household expenses in income from 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.550

 home ready to mine 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.580

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.430
