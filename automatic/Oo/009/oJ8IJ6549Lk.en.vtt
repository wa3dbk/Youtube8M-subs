00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 to the verician federico very good morning I 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.430
 I am in the direction of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.770
 hydrography and navigation of the marina and 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.380
 what we are observing here is a 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.580
 map of the tip and part of the quiet 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.170
 whose areas could easily be 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.720
 flooded in cases there is a 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.730
 tsunami after of course an earthquake of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.890
 great intensity I'm like commander 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.150
 Yerko Jara who is the technical chief of the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 hydrography direction of the marina 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.859
 so they can explain to us a bit in what 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.340
 consists that map we see that for example 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.829
 the whole area of ​​the tip especially 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.649
 would be the most vulnerable a case of a 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.290
 tsunami good morning and now we can see 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.940
 a flood letter that will be prepared 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.969
 the direction of hydrography of the navy 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.070
 of war the area of ​​the tip would be the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.430
 most vulnerable area because it is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.120
 surrounded by the sea and only has one area 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.020
 evacuation that you have to move to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 4000 inhabitants of the tip towards 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.360
 shelters that are established in the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.470
 jaguar waka the pink zone 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.100
 are flood zones for waves of 8 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.430
 meters the most intense rubbing zones 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.740
 are parables of 9 meters here we have 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.420
 an extension of this area we can see 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.490
 the yahuar park huaca in the university 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.680
 of the callao the carrion hospital and the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.810
 San Antonio school this would be the area 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.940
 yahuar huaca where everyone affected 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.400
 of this area would have to be for the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.650
 civil defense care and population 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.740
 he knows he has to go to asia if he 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.920
 tsunami if according to the drills 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.520
 that have been made you have 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.130
 knowledge if it is an earthquake of origin 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.070
 far away you can do this evacuation 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.530
 horizontal if it is an earthquake of origin 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.979
 close the point also has already 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.130
 vertical evacuation protocol towards 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.350
 some buildings that are already 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.360
 studied that can harbor this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.920
 population on their roofs with that it 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.159
 refers to where the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.200
 epicenter been rector there are three 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.280
 parameters to evaluate if an epicenter 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.700
 an earthquake is an earthquake of near origin 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.550
 distant origin that in kilometers in 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.280
 how much closer and left can be said 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.340
 which is close is when the height of the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.099
 wave between 89 but it has a kind of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.130
 arrival of 20 minutes 25 minutes as 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.780
 maximum the first wave you have to remember 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.700
 that the first wave is not always the most 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.040
 destructive the second or the third 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.920
 may have greater intensity than 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.770
 first 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.060
 now so many things have said 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.370
 during these days after the earthquake 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.430
 of chili it was said that it does not matter sometimes 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.580
 the size of the wave but with the force 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.340
 that the sea could come is not true 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.340
 good the speed of the waves more or 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.209
 less are 900 kilometers per hour not 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.739
 sold 20 not necessarily very high 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 right it makes waves of 50 centimeters 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.730
 can move container ships 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.310
 that are close to the very important 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.600
 commanders that is or some wave when 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.390
 be when you have been speaking for 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.239
 example here and especially in tacna ilo 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.890
 of a wave of centimeters in height 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.049
 good people have a reference 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.180
 of sense this line does not happen anything but 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.959
 one says that if it could be dangerous 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.950
 if that's why when the earthquake of 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.069
 iquique an alarm was given an alarm that 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.880
 is evacuation to the southern sector and an alert 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.660
 to the center and north sector the air 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.190
 and that are attentive in listening that 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.430
 can the authorities say more 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.230
 forward then we are constantly 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.990
 evaluation of these weapons 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.080
 the alarm if it is evacuation if correct 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.470
 evacuation alarm now during the 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.230
 time is being evaluated if 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.470
 these alarms or these alerts remains 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.540
 they cancel or they can increase the level 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.540
 from an alert to an alarm 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.790
 important also yes that lack of 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.790
 responsibility ours too
