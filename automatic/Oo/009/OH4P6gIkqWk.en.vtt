talking about and there are so many it's
hard<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.240> pick<00:00:24.510> they're<00:00:25.199> literally<00:00:25.529> not

hundreds<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.580> probably<00:00:26.820> thousands<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.449> books

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
hundreds but probably thousands of books

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.740 
hundreds but probably thousands of books
now<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.080> articles<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.680> are<00:00:28.800> very<00:00:29.099> very<00:00:29.340> good

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
now in articles that are very very good

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.319 
now in articles that are very very good
I<00:00:30.980> frequently<00:00:31.980> mention<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> book<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
I frequently mention the book that I

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.000 
I frequently mention the book that I
read<00:00:33.750> early<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.410> even<00:00:34.800> though<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.920> don't

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
read early on even though I don't

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.560 
read early on even though I don't
recommend<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> first<00:00:36.120> book<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
recommend it as the first book and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.850 
recommend it as the first book and
that's<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.559> Road<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.890> Serfdom<00:00:37.920> by<00:00:38.610> Hayek<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
that's the Road to Serfdom by Hayek and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.819 
that's the Road to Serfdom by Hayek and
Hayek<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.489> an<00:00:41.850> Austrian<00:00:42.270> economist<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
Hayek is an Austrian economist and and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.639 
Hayek is an Austrian economist and and
has<00:00:44.760> written<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:45.840> economics<00:00:46.590> but

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
has written about economics but

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.200 
has written about economics but
predicted<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> problems<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.000> have

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
predicted a lot of problems that we have

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.690 
predicted a lot of problems that we have
today<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> isn't<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.680> easiest<00:00:49.710> book<00:00:50.460> in

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
today but it isn't the easiest book in

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900 
today but it isn't the easiest book in
the<00:00:51.120> world<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.050> read<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.949> start<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the world to read and to start with so I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
the world to read and to start with so I
would<00:00:54.329> pick<00:00:54.629> something<00:00:54.930> else<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.739> you're

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
would pick something else if you're

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.639 
would pick something else if you're
starting<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.899> understand<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
starting out and that is to understand a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.700 
starting out and that is to understand a
basic<00:00:58.800> principle<00:00:59.280> of<00:01:00.260> libertarianism<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
basic principle of libertarianism and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.799 
basic principle of libertarianism and
then<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.309> Frederic<00:01:03.210> Bastiat

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
then is Frederic Bastiat

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.190 
then is Frederic Bastiat
the<00:01:04.350> law<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.700> makes<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.930> very

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the law because this makes a very very

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.950 
the law because this makes a very very
strong<00:01:07.439> point<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.130> very<00:01:08.610> short<00:01:09.060> easy<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
strong point it's very short easy to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.679 
strong point it's very short easy to
read<00:01:10.350> very<00:01:10.619> clear<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> understand

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
read very clear but if you understand

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.249 
read very clear but if you understand
the<00:01:12.840> point<00:01:13.170> made<00:01:13.500> by<00:01:14.240> Basquiat<00:01:15.240> about<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the point made by Basquiat about the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.190 
the point made by Basquiat about the
morality<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> law<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.750> understand

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
morality of the law you can understand

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
morality of the law you can understand
everything<00:01:20.009> else<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.520> talk<00:01:20.790> about<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
everything else that we talk about and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
everything else that we talk about and
the<00:01:21.720> basic<00:01:22.170> point<00:01:22.470> he<00:01:22.860> makes<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:25.350> as

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the basic point he makes is that you as

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
the basic point he makes is that you as
a<00:01:26.340> citizen<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:26.939> limitations<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.960> can't

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
a citizen have limitations you can't

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.840 
a citizen have limitations you can't
hurt<00:01:28.500> other<00:01:28.680> people<00:01:29.070> or<00:01:29.159> take<00:01:29.340> other<00:01:29.490> people's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
hurt other people or take other people's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.490 
hurt other people or take other people's
property<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.810> he<00:01:30.840> applies<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
property but he applies that to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.740 
property but he applies that to
government<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.040> well<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:33.180> work<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.600> an

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
government as well we work on an

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.660 
government as well we work on an
assumption<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.500> dictators<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.400> even

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
assumption at all dictators and even

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.210 
assumption at all dictators and even
interventionism<00:01:36.509> assumes<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.439> governments

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
interventionism assumes that governments

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
interventionism assumes that governments
are<00:01:38.310> different<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.689> authority

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
are different they have more authority

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.410 
are different they have more authority
more<00:01:40.470> power<00:01:40.799> more<00:01:41.189> responsibility<00:01:42.090> they're

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
more power more responsibility they're

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.940 
more power more responsibility they're
supposed<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> make<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.140> people<00:01:43.320> better<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
supposed to make the people better and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.350 
supposed to make the people better and
they're<00:01:44.070> supposed<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.369> make<00:01:44.640> sure<00:01:45.060> there's

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
they're supposed to make sure there's

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090 
they're supposed to make sure there's
nobody<00:01:45.570> falls<00:01:46.020> through<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.290> cracks<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.979> then

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
nobody falls through the cracks and then

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.580 
nobody falls through the cracks and then
economy<00:01:47.850> needs<00:01:48.060> regulated<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.899> nobody's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
economy needs regulated and nobody's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.580 
economy needs regulated and nobody's
smart<00:01:50.340> enough<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.840> market<00:01:52.170> isn't<00:01:52.290> smart

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
smart enough the market isn't smart

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.870 
smart enough the market isn't smart
enough<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.340> interest<00:01:53.700> rates

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
enough to know what interest rates

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
enough to know what interest rates
should<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.390> should<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.170> there's<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> need

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
should be it should be so there's a need

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.300 
should be it should be so there's a need
for<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.950> Federal<00:01:56.280> Reserve<00:01:56.450> but<00:01:57.469> the<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.009> truth

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
