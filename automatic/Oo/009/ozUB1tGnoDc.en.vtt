feeling really smooth but um I'd like I
said<00:05:33.290> my<00:05:33.470> skin<00:05:33.740> after<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.040> while<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.790> was<00:05:34.970> good

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
said my skin after a while it was good

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.180 
said my skin after a while it was good
when<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.390> had<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:36.080> lot<00:05:36.200> of<00:05:36.260> break<00:05:36.500> off<00:05:36.680> on<00:05:36.830> my<00:05:36.920> skin

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
when I had a lot of break off on my skin

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.180 
when I had a lot of break off on my skin
but<00:05:38.060> after<00:05:38.300> I<00:05:38.510> kind<00:05:38.750> of<00:05:38.780> cleared<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.260> up<00:05:39.410> it's

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
but after I kind of cleared it up it's

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.500 
but after I kind of cleared it up it's
kind<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.520> like<00:05:40.610> it<00:05:40.790> was<00:05:40.880> too<00:05:41.000> harsh<00:05:41.240> for<00:05:41.300> my

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
kind of like it was too harsh for my

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.960 
kind of like it was too harsh for my
skin<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:42.080> wasn't<00:05:42.470> so<00:05:42.560> much<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.740> cleanser<00:05:43.340> I'd

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
skin it wasn't so much the cleanser I'd

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
skin it wasn't so much the cleanser I'd
lose<00:05:44.450> more<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.050> astringent<00:05:45.470> and<00:05:46.720> in<00:05:47.720> the

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
lose more the astringent and in the

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.630 
lose more the astringent and in the
ocean<00:05:48.320> the<00:05:48.500> lotion<00:05:48.530> wasn't<00:05:49.040> hydrating<00:05:49.430> enough

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
ocean the lotion wasn't hydrating enough

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.300 
ocean the lotion wasn't hydrating enough
because<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.060> does<00:05:50.210> have<00:05:50.240> all<00:05:50.920> salicylic<00:05:51.920> acid

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
because it does have all salicylic acid

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.790 
because it does have all salicylic acid
in<00:05:52.400> it<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.700> then<00:05:53.540> this<00:05:53.780> also<00:05:54.020> does<00:05:54.560> have

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
in it and then this also does have

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.310 
in it and then this also does have
silicic<00:05:55.220> acid<00:05:55.750> so<00:05:56.750> i<00:05:56.780> think<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:57.080> was<00:05:57.290> just--

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
silicic acid so i think that was just--

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.750 
silicic acid so i think that was just--
little<00:05:57.620> bit<00:05:57.710> too<00:05:57.800> dry<00:05:57.950> for<00:05:57.980> my<00:05:58.220> skin<00:05:58.520> being

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
little bit too dry for my skin being

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.060 
little bit too dry for my skin being
that<00:05:58.940> i<00:05:58.970> didn't<00:05:59.210> have<00:05:59.420> any<00:05:59.720> blemishes<00:06:00.620> at<00:06:00.950> the

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070
