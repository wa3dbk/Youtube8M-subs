so first thing you need to do is get
your<00:00:38.460> head<00:00:38.640> around<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.030> environment<00:00:40.129> up<00:00:41.129> here

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
your head around the environment up here

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.490 
your head around the environment up here
this<00:00:41.940> will<00:00:42.149> form<00:00:42.420> most<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.050> functions

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
this will form most of the functions

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.819 
this will form most of the functions
that<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> use<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> screen

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
that you are going to use on the screen

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.350 
that you are going to use on the screen
you've<00:00:46.829> got<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.250> points<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> bottom

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
you've got some points down the bottom

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.470 
you've got some points down the bottom
here<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:49.730> slide<00:00:50.730> bar<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
here you have a slide bar just to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
here you have a slide bar just to
enlarge<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.500> parts<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.949> think<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> most

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
enlarge the parts I think for the most

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.080 
enlarge the parts I think for the most
they<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.059> stay<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.660> size<00:00:55.789> there<00:00:56.789> should<00:00:56.969> be

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
they can stay that size there should be

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.110 
they can stay that size there should be
nothing<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.510> groups<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:59.340> brick<00:00:59.579> sees<00:00:59.789> all

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
nothing in groups and it brick sees all

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.119 
nothing in groups and it brick sees all
of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.390> bricks<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.899> open<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.559> shut<00:01:01.770> them<00:01:01.980> you

multiples down close the whole lot down

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.750 
multiples down close the whole lot down
there<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.710> ones<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.070> want<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.430> mainly

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
folder so if I was to to bring out a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
folder so if I was to to bring out a
block<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> got<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.400> click<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.820> the

block and you'll find that the block is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.840 
block and you'll find that the block is
moving<00:01:23.580> out<00:01:23.880> onto<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.360> theoretical<00:01:24.930> table

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
moving out onto that theoretical table

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.990 
moving out onto that theoretical table
at<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.060> stage<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:28.340> as<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.850> the

I<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:01.049> move<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.560> different<00:02:01.590> position<00:02:02.399> if

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
I can move it to a different position if

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.060 
I can move it to a different position if
I<00:02:02.909> want

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
I want

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.770 
I want
lock<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.820> down<00:02:07.100> if<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.330> decide<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.570> might

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
lock it down if I decide that I might

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.210 
lock it down if I decide that I might
want<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.990> put<00:02:10.170> one<00:02:10.320> pin<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:10.950> some<00:02:11.100> very

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
want to put one pin so just some very

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.950 
want to put one pin so just some very
basic<00:02:11.340> functions<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.240> Lego<00:02:12.480> I'm<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
basic functions of Lego I'm going to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.830 
basic functions of Lego I'm going to
grab<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> pin<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:15.150> move<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.420> out<00:02:15.510> onto<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
grab a pin and move it out onto the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.370 
grab a pin and move it out onto the
table<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.890> moment<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.250> come<00:02:17.430> near<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.970> block

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
table the moment I come near that block

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.050 
table the moment I come near that block
it<00:02:19.380> starts<00:02:19.890> trying<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.310> guess<00:02:20.550> where<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.820> want

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it starts trying to guess where I want

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.300 
it starts trying to guess where I want
that<00:02:21.150> pin<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.720> go<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:22.590> you've<00:02:22.860> got<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.160> in<00:02:23.250> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that pin to go if you've got it in the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
that pin to go if you've got it in the
wrong<00:02:23.580> position<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:26.370> probably<00:02:26.910> won't<00:02:27.060> show

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
wrong position you probably won't show

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.910 
wrong position you probably won't show
it<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.660> but<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.870> will<00:02:27.959> gray<00:02:28.230> out<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.740> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it here but it will gray out if the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.710 
it here but it will gray out if the
block<00:02:29.130> Gray's<00:02:29.400> out<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.970> means<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> can't

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
block Gray's out it means that it can't

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.870 
block Gray's out it means that it can't
do<00:02:30.930> what<00:02:31.110> you're<00:02:31.260> trying<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.709> do<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.130> let's

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
do what you're trying to do so let's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.640 
do what you're trying to do so let's
just<00:02:33.060> lock<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.540> pin<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.900> place<00:02:35.240> now<00:02:36.240> if<00:02:37.170> some

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
just lock that pin in place now if some

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.890 
just lock that pin in place now if some
reason<00:02:38.040> I'm<00:02:38.190> working<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.910> model<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.750> I've

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
reason I'm working on the model and I've

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.310 
reason I'm working on the model and I've
just<00:02:40.080> mistakenly<00:02:40.800> click<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.550> drag

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
just mistakenly click on it and drag

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.500 
just mistakenly click on it and drag
it's<00:02:43.320> going<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.560> pull<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.860> out<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.100> place<00:02:44.510> so

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
it's going to pull it out of place so

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.670 
it's going to pull it out of place so
just<00:02:45.930> click<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.860> back<00:02:46.980> into<00:02:47.190> place<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:49.410> that's

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
just click it back into place so that's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.460 
just click it back into place so that's
basically<00:02:50.160> how<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.459> add<00:02:50.970> blocks<00:02:51.570> move<00:02:52.140> blocks

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
basically how you add blocks move blocks

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.520 
basically how you add blocks move blocks
so<00:02:53.420> what<00:02:54.420> I'll<00:02:54.540> do<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> next<00:02:54.989> tutorial

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
so what I'll do in the next tutorial

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.840 
so what I'll do in the next tutorial
will<00:02:55.650> show<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.920> how<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.220> use<00:02:56.280> some<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
will show you how you use some of the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.220 
will show you how you use some of the
more<00:02:57.060> functions<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.380> top<00:02:58.590> toolbar<00:02:58.860> here
