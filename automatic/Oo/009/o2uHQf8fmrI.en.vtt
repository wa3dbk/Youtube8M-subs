00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hi, how are you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.890
 my name is sandro it 's just technique too 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.250
 done maintenance and today I'm going to show 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:18.600
 How do you exchange the buoy for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:21.960
 a problem that occurs 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 enough and sometimes people 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.970
 they are in doubt is how to make 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.980
 replacement of the water tank buoy 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.769
 when a problem happens there 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.260
 It's usually cool because sometimes 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.750
 the thief can not drain all the water 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.200
 that starts to leak in this case you 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 You will have one of the boot on the scoreboard 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.469
 the first thing is you know what the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 connection you have there in your box 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.579
 water 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.539
 exist by default on all buoys 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.190
 two patterns the half-inch pattern or the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.640
 standard 34 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.370
 You will know this as you imagine 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.070
 tattoo with this connection 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.340
 this connection here is three quarters then 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.610
 it will fit into this larger thread 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.939
 already if your water connection is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.770
 half an inch she'll fit 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.619
 usually also in this minor connection 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.619
 here it is then the buoys already come standard of 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.700
 factory with two in boxes you do not 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.570
 need to worry 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.890
 the first thing for you to do the repair 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.350
 or replacing the box float 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.530
 Water is you close the general register 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.600
 close the log for you to avoid 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 leak and avoid taking a shower in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.000
 up the liner so you'll make the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.899
 Removal is the buoy here she is no longer 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.090
 working 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.850
 Only you must remember here we are. 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.490
 by way of example that the water level 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.070
 It's going to be very difficult here. 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.130
 you get turning supports this direction 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.290
 stay 10 in the water under the water of this water 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.969
 under water then to avoid and to 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.210
 make work easier without breaking 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.879
 parts that can make your 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.470
 I fix the first thing to do what it is 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.470
 You drop the boy. 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:18.530
 Very well now, the float is over. 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:22.249
 It's easy for you to do this job. 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.609
 It just will who took the 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:27.920
 buoy registration 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:30.680
 At this point you can already prepare the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.290
 new buoy that you will put there then 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.319
 the preparation will do the same 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.459
 initially you will remove the float 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.019
 to make it easier for you to 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.260
 now you 're going to pass the veda thread on the 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.849
 connection to your box 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.129
 in the case of our example here we 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.269
 we are using the three-bedroom 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:55.790
 then you will pass the thread tape 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:01.879
 remembering that to use tape veda thread 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.900
 You will always use nine turns are 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.739
 sufficient 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.980
 You put on these nine laps, are you going? 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:16.310
 but then put in there to replace your 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.859
 connection of the water box very well now 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.799
 which is well secured also forbidden 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:29.659
 now yes you can again rosso that 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:31.759
 to buoy the system very well placed 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.709
 buoy in position after falling again 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.729
 now I have two situations here to 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.569
 show for you 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:40.790
 the float that comes originally from the factory 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:45.280
 comes with straight art 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:49.099
 This one has been purposely here. 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.699
 curved and that means that this 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:55.099
 water level will be lower than in this 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.049
 example so if you want the 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.739
 level is slightly lower 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.449
 You can bend to metallic art, okay? 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.389
 taking care not to break you 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:07.030
 can prove there until it reaches the level of 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:10.340
 water you want 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.430
 remembering that the water level can never 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.829
 stay very close to the water thief in the 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.469
 water tank to avoid leakage 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.930
 It's always ideal if you leave around 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:22.940
 7 feeling sÃ¡ 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.670
 below the work level, this is how 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.210
 makes to replace the buoy of the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.210
 water tank 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.420
 and then liked the video click liked and 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.740
 Leave your comment 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.630
 I would like to see more videos about
