00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:17.789
 Talk guys back to the hot novel is 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.859
 s10 exchange of brake pads before 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.640
 to exchange 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.619
 Let's do two brake tests here . 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.859
 to see if it is able to apply the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.200
 new match that is with a buyer 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:39.870
 check test of a theme here on disk 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:45.120
 and with a micrometer measure the thickness of the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.059
 see if disk is with me and equipment 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.379
 be used after the two 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.579
 testing the first test pattern warping 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:01:01.550
 they buyer 0 teixeira 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.550
 the disk was standing at maximum 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.369
 to see that it is in perfect condition to 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.700
 who a minimum of warping the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.530
 maximum 100 5 millimeters 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.359
 there you have to do one more edition in 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.500
 top to bottom in the middle on the 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.100
 from below 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.009
 to complete the test the next test 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.350
 disk thickness test 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.969
 with that who knows will compete with the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.689
 minimum amount of material and to rotate 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:42.329
 Play that, you're out of a job. 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:47.170
 here to take our party frei 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.789
 we need ax 13 to take 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.060
 the screw up here 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.500
 in the other three down here has a 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.619
 against the door here 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.079
 17 keys to hold here and with 13 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:03.310
 behind will take the employment track 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:07.539
 then you can take the tablets 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.380
 behind the front, remembering that this model 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.530
 here they have these little girls here 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.530
 O 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:23.019
 before moving the nun's piston 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:36.450
 enter the brand new tablets that 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:36.450
 is the front because it is the back of that 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:47.069
 behind the front at will at 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:53.230
 new track here gives a correct 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:55.930
 in the clamp holder, remembering here 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.250
 the new pads in the car will have a 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.790
 frame and rubbery to settle here 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.019
 surface of the disc when you check the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.540
 Brake Fluid 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.669
 bleed if needed and ready 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.040
 I hope it comes to help you who have 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.030
 this idea is to get out with the car of the line 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.449
 gm 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.180
