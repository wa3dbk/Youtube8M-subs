00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.159
 2 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.159
 cost of gold operation with the planetary crisis 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.029
 we saw a lot 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.900
 before this match 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.310
 during the super-g 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.079
 with beautiful things 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.099
 we notice less beautiful 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.099
 the troupe of people talking on the ground 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.519
 too few people 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.960
 it gives parasitic information 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.900
 you have a captain 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.200
 that one 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.360
 and he alone 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.800
 a hundred people 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.510
 so right to speak 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.760
 it's the tick 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.430
 and the captain 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.530
 information for others 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.980
 this information paradise 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 they disrupt early work 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.420
 you respect the instructions that are given 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.250
 for the coach 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.340
 stÃ©phane does the relay on the ground so denied 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 we must also respect what he denies 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.550
 we saw some very good things 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.350
 and that now that we must remember 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.350
 and to implement on the match 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.750
 facing the Germans 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.670
 in tribute to the signatories 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.820
 a full match 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.760
 is not at the end of all the ranks we are tired 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.890
 because we have played all afternoon and only if we played 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.600
 they will also be motivating themselves 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.720
 we talk a lot more 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.060
 every month possibilities 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.200
 each of us must implement them 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.660
 already said 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
 all alone 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.970
 he is a player on the field 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.970
 six players on the bench that on the roads 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.360
 all by yourself you are nothing collective playing 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.360
 play with friends 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.789
 the team is well informed 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.529
 we will never win 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.529
 6 insolent too low st-laurent 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.049
 if at a time 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.669
 give up 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.139
 it's the whole team 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.899
 who is a writer 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:29.819
 you do not have 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.819
 trotting up buddies 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:36.189
 you do not have the right to lie to them 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.629
 pretending to be able to play if you're tired of not asking 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.459
 get out 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.459
 because of redemptions but warns I'm inspired 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.379
 do not be ashamed 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.259
 there is a player on the field the six players on the bench the players on the 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.209
 bench are equally important 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.769
 than those who are on the bench 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.769
 there necessarily not the craze of players who play less water 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.419
 it is not serious 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.639
 all those who are on the bench of what maybe any moment available 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.979
 for the whole of the eu 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.569
 at my father's door after the break 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.349
 if you are new here you are motivated for while match 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.680
 you do not have time to think about getting back on the ground to tell you 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.069
 in the flat bottom it's because I have to do 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.069
 as he tries to find out what you have to do 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:31.509
 concentration 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.399
 motivation 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:35.479
 while 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.479
 four times ten minutes 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:43.709
 the law and the guy will conclude the rest time he would at times 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.789
 it's an official match 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:48.809
 with all that it entails 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:50.349
 for those who do not know diallo
