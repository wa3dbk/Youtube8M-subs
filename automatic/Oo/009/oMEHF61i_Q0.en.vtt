this path takes me I think so I got a
little<00:03:22.080> bit<00:03:22.319> ways<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.709> go<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.310> doesn't<00:03:23.400> look

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:39.220 
like much from there from here looks
like<00:03:26.730> it

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.539

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
when I saw that my path is going to

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.429 
when I saw that my path is going to
reach<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.030> top<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.420> mountain<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.870> was<00:03:43.260> so
