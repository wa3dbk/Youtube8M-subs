the motor plate held in by these two

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.040 
the motor plate held in by these two
screws

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
screws

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.079 
screws
sometimes<00:00:42.769> when<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.250> screws<00:00:43.460> are<00:00:43.670> too<00:00:43.879> loose

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
sometimes when the screws are too loose

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.119 
sometimes when the screws are too loose
either<00:00:44.690> just<00:00:45.019> through<00:00:45.170> regular<00:00:45.710> play<00:00:45.890> wear

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129

and tear and vibration the motor plate

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.840 
and tear and vibration the motor plate
will<00:00:48.530> come<00:00:48.769> loose<00:00:49.010> you<00:00:49.250> can<00:00:49.399> see<00:00:49.550> here<00:00:49.760> it

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
will come loose you can see here it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.849 
will come loose you can see here it
should<00:00:49.969> be<00:00:50.030> sitting<00:00:50.359> flush<00:00:50.739> but<00:00:51.739> it's

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
should be sitting flush but it's

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.500 
should be sitting flush but it's
actually<00:00:52.100> sticking<00:00:52.309> about<00:00:52.609> sticking<00:00:53.269> out<00:00:53.390> of

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
actually sticking about sticking out of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.500 
actually sticking about sticking out of
it<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:53.750> this<00:00:53.809> is<00:00:53.960> what<00:00:54.079> you'll<00:00:54.230> hear<00:00:55.510> that

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
it and this is what you'll hear that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.410 
it and this is what you'll hear that
quick<00:00:56.899> high-pitched<00:00:57.769> whirring<00:00:58.070> noise<00:00:58.429> that's

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
quick high-pitched whirring noise that's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.240 
quick high-pitched whirring noise that's
actually<00:00:59.870> coming<00:01:00.019> from<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.500> pistol<00:01:00.980> grip<00:01:01.010> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
actually coming from the pistol grip and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.340 
actually coming from the pistol grip and
not<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.730> body<00:01:01.969> of<00:01:02.179> the<00:01:02.300> gun<00:01:02.449> that<00:01:02.929> means<00:01:03.199> that

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
not the body of the gun that means that

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.590 
not the body of the gun that means that
the<00:01:03.440> motor<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.739> adjusted<00:01:04.309> too<00:01:04.580> low<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.089> we're

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
the motor is adjusted too low so we're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.980 
the motor is adjusted too low so we're
going<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.780> adjust<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.350> motor<00:01:06.740> plate<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.990> that

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
going to adjust the motor plate and that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.880 
going to adjust the motor plate and that
should<00:01:09.380> fix<00:01:10.190> it<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:12.229> just<00:01:12.440> tighten<00:01:12.619> those<00:01:12.830> two

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
should fix it so just tighten those two

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.789 
should fix it so just tighten those two
screws<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.940> should<00:01:14.119> be

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.410 

so<00:01:19.799> here's<00:01:19.979> an<00:01:20.100> example<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.969> motor<00:01:21.180> plate

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
so here's an example of a motor plate

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.450 
so here's an example of a motor plate
that's<00:01:21.659> fully<00:01:21.899> seated<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that's fully seated in but with the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.010 
that's fully seated in but with the
motor<00:01:23.820> adjustment<00:01:24.720> screws<00:01:24.899> set<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.439> low

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
motor adjustment screws set to low

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.660 
motor adjustment screws set to low
you'll<00:01:28.020> hear<00:01:28.170> very<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.860> same<00:01:29.100> sound<00:01:29.460> as

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you'll hear very much the same sound as

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.029 
you'll hear very much the same sound as
the<00:01:29.729> motor<00:01:30.600> plate<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:31.860> loose

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
the motor plate when it was really loose

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.590 
the motor plate when it was really loose
that's<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:32.789> the<00:01:32.880> motor<00:01:33.060> dustman<00:01:33.450> screw

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that's because the motor dustman screw

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.169 
that's because the motor dustman screw
is<00:01:33.720> really<00:01:33.990> good<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:35.039> what<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.670> want<00:01:35.819> to<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.000> is

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
is really good so what you want to do is

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.809 
is really good so what you want to do is
turn<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.539> clockwise<00:01:37.310> basic<00:01:38.310> rule<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> thumb

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
turn it clockwise basic rule of thumb

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.660 
turn it clockwise basic rule of thumb
righty-tighty<00:01:39.770> lefty-loosey<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.490> we're

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
righty-tighty lefty-loosey so we're

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.429 
righty-tighty lefty-loosey so we're
going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> give<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.149> a<00:01:42.210> half<00:01:42.360> turn<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> test

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
going to give it a half turn and test

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.550 
going to give it a half turn and test
bar<00:01:44.750> since<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.079> loose<00:01:46.289> we're<00:01:46.439> just

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
bar since it's this loose we're just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
bar since it's this loose we're just
going<00:01:46.679> to<00:01:46.710> give<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> full<00:01:47.159> charge<00:01:47.369> now<00:01:47.579> give<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
going to give a full charge now give it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.289 
going to give a full charge now give it
another<00:01:48.479> full<00:01:48.810> term

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
another full term

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.550 
another full term
okay<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.539> sounding<00:01:51.959> a<00:01:52.080> little<00:01:52.259> louder

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
okay that's sounding a little louder

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
okay that's sounding a little louder
than<00:01:52.709> if<00:01:52.950> that's<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> sound<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:54.030> motor

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
than if that's the sound of the motor

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.929 
than if that's the sound of the motor
engaging<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.069> gearbox<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.700> let's<00:01:56.819> give

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
engaging with the gearbox so let's give

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.419 
engaging with the gearbox so let's give
it<00:01:56.970> another<00:01:57.119> full<00:01:57.539> turn<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.830> I<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.189> want<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
it another full turn and I just want to

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.499 
it another full turn and I just want to
keep<00:01:59.490> testing<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.909> out<00:02:00.259> okay<00:02:01.259> get<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.979> closer

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
keep testing it out okay get in closer

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.699 
keep testing it out okay get in closer
give<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> two<00:02:03.780> turns<00:02:04.080> just<00:02:04.319> make<00:02:04.470> sure<00:02:04.619> it

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
give it two turns just make sure it

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.699 
give it two turns just make sure it
engages<00:02:04.830> fully<00:02:06.110> alright<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.319> can<00:02:07.470> hear<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
engages fully alright you can hear it

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:08.150 
engages fully alright you can hear it
firing

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
firing

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.390 
firing
I<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.489> want<00:02:08.700> do<00:02:09.599> small<00:02:09.959> increments<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:10.709> just

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I just want do small increments now just

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.270 
I just want do small increments now just
give<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.670> foot<00:02:11.940> turn<00:02:12.329> that's<00:02:13.319> fire<00:02:13.680> water

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
give the foot turn that's fire water

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.370 
give the foot turn that's fire water
turn<00:02:14.519> pass<00:02:15.360> bar<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.840> want<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.079> find<00:02:16.230> that

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
turn pass bar and you want to find that

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.370 
turn pass bar and you want to find that
sweet<00:02:16.680> spot<00:02:16.950> where<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.910> motor<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.930> turning

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
sweet spot where the motor is turning

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.410 
sweet spot where the motor is turning
over<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:20.220> quickly<00:02:20.819> as<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:22.940> okay<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.150> some

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
over as quickly as it can okay in some

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.479 
over as quickly as it can okay in some
instances<00:02:24.959> when<00:02:25.769> you're<00:02:25.890> adjusting<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.430> the

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
instances when you're adjusting in the

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.059 
instances when you're adjusting in the
motor<00:02:26.780> sometimes<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.049> turn<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.890> motor

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
motor sometimes you can turn the motor

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.729 
motor sometimes you can turn the motor
too<00:02:29.430> high<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.299> too<00:02:30.959> far<00:02:30.989> into<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.530> gears

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
too high and it's too far into the gears

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.379 
too high and it's too far into the gears
and<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.069> not<00:02:32.280> reaching<00:02:32.639> the<00:02:32.730> optimal<00:02:33.239> angle

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
and it's not reaching the optimal angle

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.349 
and it's not reaching the optimal angle
of<00:02:33.840> engagement<00:02:34.350> for<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:35.010> gearbox<00:02:35.190> when<00:02:36.180> that

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
of engagement for the gearbox when that

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:41.050 
of engagement for the gearbox when that
happens<00:02:36.750> it'll<00:02:36.989> usually<00:02:37.139> sound<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.650> this

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.670 

you<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.209> hear<00:02:42.389> it<00:02:42.510> firing<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.200> turning<00:02:43.560> over

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
you can hear it firing and turning over

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.319 
you can hear it firing and turning over
much<00:02:44.069> slower<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.670> can<00:02:44.790> feel<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> lot<00:02:45.269> of

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
much slower you can feel a lot of

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.410 
much slower you can feel a lot of
resistance<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.380> motor<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.850> we're<00:02:48.299> going

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
resistance in the motor so we're going

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.000 
resistance in the motor so we're going
to<00:02:48.510> loosen<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.959> motor<00:02:49.139> now<00:02:49.350> by<00:02:49.560> turning<00:02:49.920> it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
to loosen the motor now by turning it

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.879 
to loosen the motor now by turning it
counterclockwise<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:51.150> lowering<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.889> so

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
counterclockwise and lowering it so

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.550 
counterclockwise and lowering it so
we're<00:02:53.280> going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.459> give<00:02:53.609> it<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.760> turn<00:02:54.290> let's<00:02:55.290> fire

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
we're going to give it a turn let's fire

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.030 
we're going to give it a turn let's fire
it<00:02:55.709> another<00:02:56.340> half<00:02:56.609> turn<00:02:56.870> that's<00:02:57.870> fire<00:02:58.170> I'm

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
it another half turn that's fire I'm

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.220 
it another half turn that's fire I'm
sure<00:02:59.280> and<00:03:00.230> write<00:03:01.230> about<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:03.989> hear

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
sure and write about that you can hear

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.490 
sure and write about that you can hear
it

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
it

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.890 
it
gearbox<00:03:05.310> becomes<00:03:05.790> really<00:03:06.090> snappy<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.780> can

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
gearbox becomes really snappy you can

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.240 
gearbox becomes really snappy you can
hear<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.109> motor<00:03:07.230> turning<00:03:07.620> over<00:03:07.739> really<00:03:08.220> fast

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
hear the motor turning over really fast

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.000 
hear the motor turning over really fast
so<00:03:08.670> it's<00:03:08.870> kind<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.049> bit<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.380> an<00:03:10.500> art<00:03:10.769> more

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
so it's kind of a bit of an art more

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.349 
so it's kind of a bit of an art more
than<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.220> science<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:11.819> want<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> give<00:03:12.239> us

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
than a science you just want to give us

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.120 
than a science you just want to give us
nice<00:03:12.569> half<00:03:12.900> turn<00:03:13.170> increments<00:03:13.620> until<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.889> find

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
nice half turn increments until you find

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.160 
nice half turn increments until you find
that<00:03:14.250> sweet<00:03:14.459> spot<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:15.150> that's<00:03:15.810> how<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.019> do<00:03:16.139> a

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
that sweet spot and that's how you do a

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.020 
that sweet spot and that's how you do a
motor<00:03:16.410> adjustment

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.570 

here<00:03:22.540> we<00:03:22.690> have<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:23.110> JD<00:03:23.530> Hogg<00:03:23.740> the<00:03:24.400> motor

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
here we have a JD Hogg the motor

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.400 
here we have a JD Hogg the motor
adjustment<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.150> actually<00:03:25.450> far<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.230> back

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
adjustment is actually far in the back

there's<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.740> tiny<00:03:29.980> screw<00:03:30.370> hole<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:32.230> you

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
there's a tiny screw hole and what you

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.810 
there's a tiny screw hole and what you
want<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.560> do<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.830> not<00:03:33.010> stick<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.490> straight

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
want to do is not stick it in straight

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.970 
want to do is not stick it in straight
but<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.180> want<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.480> actually<00:03:34.600> kind<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.320> take<00:03:35.950> a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
but you want to actually kind of take a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.710 
but you want to actually kind of take a
peek<00:03:36.280> into<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.790> hole<00:03:36.880> see<00:03:37.180> where<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.510> and

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
peek into the hole see where it is and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.050 
peek into the hole see where it is and
it's<00:03:37.810> actually<00:03:38.080> angled<00:03:38.530> forward<00:03:38.970> towards<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
it's actually angled forward towards the

it's actually angled forward towards the
front<00:03:40.180> of<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.390> gun<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.780> kind<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.410> kind

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
front of the gun you kind of just kind

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.410 
front of the gun you kind of just kind
of<00:03:41.709> get<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.100> feel<00:03:42.370> for<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.700> but<00:03:42.880> once<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.180> catches

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
of get a feel for it but once it catches

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.870 
of get a feel for it but once it catches
you'll<00:03:43.780> definitely<00:03:44.170> know<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.680> then<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.730> can

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
you'll definitely know and then you can

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.199 
you'll definitely know and then you can
start<00:03:46.090> adjusting<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.630> motor<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:47.050> way<00:03:48.209> here

and you can adjust the motor from that

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.060 
and you can adjust the motor from that
point
