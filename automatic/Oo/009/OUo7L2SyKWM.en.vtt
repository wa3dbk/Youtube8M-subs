back on so it still looks like a toolbox
then<00:00:44.410> I'm<00:00:44.559> gonna<00:00:45.390> support<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.899> inside<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.440> it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
then I'm gonna support the inside of it

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.639 
then I'm gonna support the inside of it
make<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.280> little<00:00:48.430> frame<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:49.149> go<00:00:49.270> in<00:00:49.360> inside<00:00:50.320> and

make<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:50.860> little<00:00:51.010> bit<00:00:51.070> stronger<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:52.030> then

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
make it little bit stronger and then

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.250 
make it little bit stronger and then
that<00:00:52.390> should<00:00:52.840> slot<00:00:53.230> straight<00:00:53.559> over<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.800> top

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that should slot straight over the top

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:05.749 
that should slot straight over the top
make<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.410> kill<00:00:56.620> leave<00:00:57.610> that<00:01:02.280> will<00:01:03.280> steer<00:01:03.640> in

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
make the kill leave that will steer in

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.210 
make the kill leave that will steer in
got<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.789> little<00:01:07.180> washer<00:01:07.539> here<00:01:08.080> weld<00:01:08.860> that<00:01:09.070> on

got a little washer here weld that on

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.440 
got a little washer here weld that on
just<00:01:10.119> so<00:01:10.300> this<00:01:10.420> won't<00:01:10.630> slide<00:01:11.200> up<00:01:12.420> got<00:01:13.420> a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
just so this won't slide up got a

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.900 
just so this won't slide up got a
bearing<00:01:13.899> down<00:01:14.050> here<00:01:15.960> Baron<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.080> middle

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
bearing down here Baron in the middle

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.430 
bearing down here Baron in the middle
turned<00:01:18.910> all<00:01:19.090> these<00:01:19.270> clippings<00:01:19.720> on<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.050> lathe

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
turned all these clippings on a lathe

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.940 
turned all these clippings on a lathe
inside<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:22.690> kickstart<00:01:23.170> was<00:01:23.259> a<00:01:23.319> bit<00:01:23.470> long<00:01:23.679> so

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
inside the kickstart was a bit long so

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.290 
inside the kickstart was a bit long so
it<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.490> change<00:01:24.759> it<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:27.520> bit<00:01:27.640> stubby<00:01:28.090> now

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
it to change it a little bit stubby now

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.770 
it to change it a little bit stubby now
sure<00:01:28.810> just<00:01:29.800> so<00:01:29.890> I<00:01:29.950> can<00:01:30.069> kick<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.280> down<00:01:30.520> right

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
sure just so I can kick it down right

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.600 
sure just so I can kick it down right
I'm<00:01:31.780> gonna<00:01:31.959> been<00:01:32.740> trying<00:01:33.160> that<00:01:33.310> off<00:01:33.429> a<00:01:33.459> little

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
I'm gonna been trying that off a little

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.740 
I'm gonna been trying that off a little
bit<00:01:33.910> so<00:01:34.450> it's<00:01:34.569> a<00:01:34.599> bit<00:01:34.750> smoother<00:01:39.270> back<00:01:40.270> axle

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
bit so it's a bit smoother back axle

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.649 
bit so it's a bit smoother back axle
here<00:01:41.819> made<00:01:42.819> that<00:01:43.030> work

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.510 

turned<00:01:48.659> all<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.260> leave<00:01:49.650> 16<00:01:50.640> mil<00:01:51.020> 17<00:01:52.020> mil

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
turned all this then leave 16 mil 17 mil

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.260 
turned all this then leave 16 mil 17 mil
17<00:01:53.690> 16<00:01:54.690> mil<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.770> 16<00:01:56.220> mil<00:01:56.400> barons<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:59.270> flattened

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
17 16 mil to 16 mil barons and flattened

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.359 
17 16 mil to 16 mil barons and flattened
off<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.630> ends<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.140> these<00:02:01.590> mini<00:02:01.860> chord<00:02:02.159> wheels

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
off the ends so these mini chord wheels

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.210 
off the ends so these mini chord wheels
would<00:02:02.759> fell<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:05.520> made<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.360> little

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
would fell on and I made this little

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.600 
would fell on and I made this little
pocket<00:02:08.220> area<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.200> I've<00:02:10.319> made<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.800> disc<00:02:11.220> brake

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610

but<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:27.030> not<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.209> get<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.420> bit<00:03:27.570> more

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
but it's not I get a bit more

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.110 
but it's not I get a bit more
complicated<00:03:28.049> then<00:03:28.609> I'm<00:03:29.609> thinking<00:03:30.030> of

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
complicated then I'm thinking of

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.020 
complicated then I'm thinking of
mounting<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.450> fuel<00:03:30.780> tank<00:03:31.340> onto<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.430> back<00:03:32.670> of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
mounting the fuel tank onto the back of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.930 
mounting the fuel tank onto the back of
the<00:03:33.359> toolbox

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.710 

okay<00:03:40.810> that's<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.800> toolbox<00:03:42.190> racer<00:03:42.610> with<00:03:43.330> the

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
okay that's the toolbox racer with the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.790 
okay that's the toolbox racer with the
toolbox<00:03:44.140> on<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:45.870> obviously<00:03:46.870> she<00:03:47.320> panel<00:03:47.680> over

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
toolbox on it obviously she panel over

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.180 
toolbox on it obviously she panel over
here

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
here

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.790 
here
and<00:03:48.370> then<00:03:48.670> our<00:03:49.420> pop<00:03:49.930> rivet<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.260> drawers<00:03:50.530> back

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
and then our pop rivet the drawers back

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.720 
and then our pop rivet the drawers back
on<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:52.450> it'll<00:03:52.600> still<00:03:52.900> look<00:03:53.080> like<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.260> toolbox<00:03:53.730> my

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
on so it'll still look like a toolbox my

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.530 
on so it'll still look like a toolbox my
firt<00:03:54.940> little<00:03:55.150> padlock<00:03:55.390> here<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.370> then<00:03:57.540> here

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
firt little padlock here and then here

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.200 
firt little padlock here and then here
I'm<00:03:58.750> gonna<00:03:58.840> put<00:03:59.110> a<00:03:59.290> little<00:03:59.710> seat<00:04:00.030> I'm<00:04:01.030> gonna

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
I'm gonna put a little seat I'm gonna

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.560 
I'm gonna put a little seat I'm gonna
weld<00:04:01.690> up<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.100> support<00:04:03.100> box<00:04:03.940> because<00:04:04.390> it's

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
weld up and support box because it's

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.290 
weld up and support box because it's
really<00:04:04.900> flimsy<00:04:05.670> can't<00:04:06.670> really<00:04:06.880> sit<00:04:07.090> on<00:04:07.210> it

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
really flimsy can't really sit on it

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.800 
really flimsy can't really sit on it
yeah<00:04:11.670> really<00:04:12.670> small<00:04:13.000> sprocket<00:04:13.480> on<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.660> back

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
yeah really small sprocket on the back

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.060 
yeah really small sprocket on the back
so<00:04:15.150> acceleration<00:04:16.150> won't<00:04:17.049> be<00:04:17.170> great<00:04:17.470> top-end

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
so acceleration won't be great top-end

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:26.240 
so acceleration won't be great top-end
should<00:04:18.519> be<00:04:18.609> pretty<00:04:18.820> good

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.450 

exhaust

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.140 

I<00:04:33.800> made<00:04:34.800> all<00:04:34.950> this<00:04:35.180> hub<00:04:36.320> steering<00:04:37.320> hub<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:38.150> got

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
I made all this hub steering hub I got

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.800 
I made all this hub steering hub I got
given<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.570> steering<00:04:39.960> wheel<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:42.450> made<00:04:42.600> all

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
given the steering wheel and I made all

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.880 
given the steering wheel and I made all
this<00:04:43.020> on<00:04:43.770> lathe<00:04:44.360> all<00:04:45.360> down<00:04:45.600> here<00:04:46.880> underneath
