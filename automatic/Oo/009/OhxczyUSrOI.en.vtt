00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
simple it's just like basically a simple

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.479 
simple it's just like basically a simple
loop<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.450> take<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.870> scarf

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
loop all you do is you take your scarf

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.240 
loop all you do is you take your scarf
throw<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> around<00:00:47.670> Jeff<00:00:48.680> pull<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.860> through

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
throw it around Jeff pull this through

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.710 
throw it around Jeff pull this through
and<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.060 

another<00:00:55.720> way<00:00:55.930> to<00:00:55.960> do<00:00:56.260> it<00:00:56.290> is<00:00:56.470> kind<00:00:56.620> of<00:00:56.710> called<00:00:56.920> a

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
another way to do it is kind of called a

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.520 
another way to do it is kind of called a
pretzel<00:00:57.430> which<00:00:58.180> is<00:00:58.330> a<00:00:58.360> little<00:00:58.660> bit<00:00:58.810> funner<00:00:59.110> a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
pretzel which is a little bit funner a

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.410 
pretzel which is a little bit funner a
little<00:01:00.040> bit<00:01:00.160> more<00:01:00.430> detailed<00:01:00.850> but<00:01:01.030> again<00:01:01.300> you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
little bit more detailed but again you

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.420 
little bit more detailed but again you
do<00:01:01.570> pretty<00:01:01.840> much<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.320> same<00:01:02.530> thing<00:01:02.860> so<00:01:03.400> you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
do pretty much the same thing so you

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.910 
do pretty much the same thing so you
throw<00:01:03.730> this<00:01:03.880> over<00:01:04.030> doubled<00:01:04.660> up<00:01:04.809> you<00:01:05.410> put<00:01:05.650> one

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
throw this over doubled up you put one

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.000 
throw this over doubled up you put one
inside<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.340> loop<00:01:07.230> like<00:01:08.230> that<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:08.770> then<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
inside the loop like that and then the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.610 
inside the loop like that and then the
other<00:01:09.190> one<00:01:09.520> goes<00:01:09.550> through<00:01:10.180> this<00:01:10.750> top<00:01:11.050> part<00:01:11.380> and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
other one goes through this top part and

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.640 
other one goes through this top part and
the<00:01:11.770> loop<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.550> then<00:01:13.420> you've<00:01:13.540> got<00:01:13.750> what's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
the loop and then you've got what's

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.240 
the loop and then you've got what's
called<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:16.000> pretzel<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.770> if<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.100> don't
