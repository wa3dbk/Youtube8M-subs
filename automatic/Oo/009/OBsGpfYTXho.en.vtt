 now the video he wants to make is total 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.779
 the question and answer video I know 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.170
 what I told you two or three ago 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.700
 videos that I would have answers and I've 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.049
 caught 10 of the most questions 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.570
 frequent that you do to me and I have them 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 all here so let's kill for the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.310
 first question that you ask me a lot 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.140
 which is painted as I carry the flu in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.019
 the yellow that I'm wearing because he painted 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.800
 had been is this this were just as 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.949
 summit alias the yellow with a tone 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.190
 greenish in the background and it is fluorine and not 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.750
 has a name in particular but 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.090
 simply the binomial is of prevention 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 same and I love my beautiful bless 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.950
 Summer content and makes your hands 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.539
 super-brunette not also complete 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 I had found yellow mentals that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.710
 I liked it so much because I've had 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.120
 while the yellows have before and 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 when they put him in his hands 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 green the super weird but this one makes you 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.970
 the hands great because you do not know me 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.860
 love and is 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:05.460
 animal very much is that base of 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.400
 makeup used the base is this is 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 of the oak and it's the meeting casting and the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.650
 color that uses these 50 space and what 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.480
 used for dry skin used 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.900
 used for oily skin I do not know for 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.400
 what do I think is because the color I do not know 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.730
 why it was the first time I found 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.670
 in Honduras but it still worked for me 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.320
 well with the moisturizer I do not know 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.330
 it has always worked well for me and is 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.790
 it works just great and I think that 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.280
 it is the 3rd 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.140
 vote if the reyno was used with stay and 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.810
 I love I have another our quality 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.390
 but this one is always going back to this 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.980
 end of the day so you can stop 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.990
 very little that seems very natural too 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.960
 You can get a lot of soccer and you 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.540
 It covers a lot and does not let you see the face 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.670
 fake weird guy come on that 's me 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.010
 love dancing next try to me 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.740
 you do a lot a lot a lot is where I'm from 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.200
 I was born in Colombia but at 45 years old 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.420
 we play Spain so I consider myself 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.490
 the two sites because I was born in Colombia 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.960
 only be if I ate but I have lived 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.030
 all my life in Spain and all my 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.530
 memories of the little one and everything is in 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.959
 Spain so I also consider 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.330
 Spanish after I got married 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.310
 medina and that us so I am of the two 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.310
 sites at least in my mind 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.140
 that studied studied photography of 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.670
 photograph of the school that is called in 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.050
 English and study the photography course 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.940
 in black and white and the truth is that 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.280
 we were super interested photography to 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.670
 a good next room for photography and 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.700
 he destituted a lot and that university 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.760
 what work my job is to be a mom and 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.190
 when I got pregnant I was super 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.739
 half hand I spent more time in the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.020
 bathroom that my job so I 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.550
 I decided to quit my job and since I 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.880
 I got pregnant has returned to work 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.590
 and it has been my 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.270
 decision because I 've always said to 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.740
 that I have babies I want to be me now that 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.020
 they take care of them in crystals leading to 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.550
 daycare I do not want to be me mom I want 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.070
 be there always with them I want to 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.900
 to educate is I think I 'm always there and my 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.340
 mother has always done that when 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.570
 we were small a version that 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.050
 I was at home I want to be the same 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.580
 so I love it and also makes a 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.390
 lots of time to be able to make videos 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.390
 so I have a great time 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.940
 because I speak so fast it's worth speaking 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.790
 fast because I forget things 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.940
 super super fast and if I do not take me 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.640
 I am empanada and later they do not come to me 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.200
 head so if I do not speak fast that 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.910
 I forget all the things already 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.830
 better I'm also very nervous or if 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.020
 for example begins to have heat not 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.200
 I start to put super nervous I'm 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.890
 as another line that does not have me in 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.460
 Spanish 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:54.730
 we 're going super super super talk anyway 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.920
 fast because I think it would be quick to see 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.010
 real life not so fast in life 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.569
 real something normal 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.489
 how I feel more comfortable talking 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.069
 English with Spanish I feel more comfortable 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.290
 speaking in Spanish obviously but as 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.629
 So much time was four years talking 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.610
 only in English every day there is a 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.060
 Lots of jargon and vocabulary of the day 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.199
 a day that does not come to me so fast but 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.840
 obviously speaking Spanish I feel 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.620
 much more myself and I feel much more 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.229
 comfortable so 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.840
 also that from maracay media they live no longer 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.150
 is English because I think I have a 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.100
 good reason to be seen English 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.010
 since the great Spanish was always born 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.510
 and then I realized that I arrived 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.680
 is also speaking spanish videos and 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.510
 We are both talking in Spanish 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.820
 they never learn English because they are all 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.770
 the day with me so I say Friday to 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.389
 the taps because that's how I can talk or to 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.120
 ask when I'm with the family of 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.050
 here and when we go to Spain because 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.610
 is our plan and will open us spain to 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.229
 learn Spanish obviously but that 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.580
 we want you to do here so good 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.020
 then long space or time and 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.030
 when I go to school to speak English 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.460
 but I definitely want you to open the 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.370
 two languages â€‹â€‹where I learned English already in 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.530
 English grammar vocabulary of all in 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.750
 Spain because that's what they teach us in 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.090
 the school a lot of grammar a 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.830
 lot of vocabulary and that's how I 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.320
 I learned but when I came here I let go 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.550
 much more I started to understand things 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.619
 because I'm leaving we do not do many 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.199
 talking exercises 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:25.789
 my brother my parents my father are together 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:31.030
 to alaska 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:33.790
 a little more to English and understand a little 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.650
 when oil they speak English but not 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.680
 played until I came to the USA and I started 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.930
 hear English since I really started 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.330
 understand all the words that people 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.430
 said start talking and start 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.190
 talk a little more fluid because 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.900
 practices a lot so the theory the 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.700
 grammar all that in Spain but 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.800
 afterwards I already talked when I was here 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.200
 result a lot more and the last 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.300
 question that will be from the USA when 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.640

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.750
 vision is Christian where you have 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.510
 three theoretical months and then three months 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.170
 or two practical months and in the month is 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.890

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.100
 answered all the questions but if 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.050
 I would have answered them all 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.490
