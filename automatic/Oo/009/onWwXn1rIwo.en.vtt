00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
brain research which was fascinating but

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.370 
brain research which was fascinating but
also<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.580> know<00:00:11.639> tracing<00:00:12.120> your<00:00:12.389> lineage<00:00:12.960> back

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
also you know tracing your lineage back

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.230 
also you know tracing your lineage back
and<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.860> kind<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.160> trace<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.670> back<00:00:14.849> very

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and you kind of trace it back very

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240 
and you kind of trace it back very

of where you come from

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.349 
of where you come from
yeah<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:23.369> pretty<00:00:23.550> good<00:00:23.670> job<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.240> it

yeah and you do pretty good job of it
and<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.630> go<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.949> Middle<00:00:26.220> Ages<00:00:26.340> in

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and you go back to the Middle Ages in

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.390 
and you go back to the Middle Ages in
essence<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.599> then<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.500> take<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.010> sort<00:00:29.340> of

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
essence but then you take a sort of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.060 
essence but then you take a sort of
quantum<00:00:30.000> leap<00:00:30.269> back<00:00:30.810> further<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.439> talk<00:00:31.890> about

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
quantum leap back further and talk about

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.840 
quantum leap back further and talk about
you<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:32.880> you're<00:00:33.239> related<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:35.160> puffer

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
wrong you sing like - mr. descended from

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.090 
wrong you sing like - mr. descended from
a<00:00:42.390> puffer<00:00:42.690> fish<00:00:42.719> I'm<00:00:42.989> saying<00:00:43.320> all<00:00:43.649> descended

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
a puffer fish I'm saying all descended

a puffer fish I'm saying all descended
from<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.309> puffer<00:00:44.579> fish<00:00:44.610> all<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:44.940> well<00:00:45.239> okay

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
from a puffer fish all right well okay

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.240 
from a puffer fish all right well okay
but<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.039> that

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
but if it's just if it's if it's that
common<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.600> maybe<00:00:48.780> we're<00:00:49.260> not

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
common then you know maybe we're not

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.350 
common then you know maybe we're not
interested<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.370> fascinated<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.270> know

and I thought about you I didn't think
about<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.460> thought<00:00:53.610> about<00:00:53.670> burger

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
about me when I thought about burger

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.490 
about me when I thought about burger

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
year ago thing yeah yep yeah that's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.920 
year ago thing yeah yep yeah that's
efficient<00:01:46.860> pusher<00:01:47.100> yeah<00:01:47.280> no<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.720> goes

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
efficient pusher yeah no but this goes

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
efficient pusher yeah no but this goes
back<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.829> woman<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.250> Africa<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.670> we're<00:01:50.820> all

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
back to a woman in Africa that we're all

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.429 
back to a woman in Africa that we're all
descended<00:01:51.030> from<00:01:51.329> them<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> single<00:01:52.170> woman

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
descended from them it's a single woman

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.960 
descended from them it's a single woman
I<00:01:52.619> ain't<00:01:53.220> even<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> hard<00:01:53.610> time<00:01:53.729> wrapping

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
I ain't even have a hard time wrapping

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.539 
I ain't even have a hard time wrapping
around<00:01:54.210> how<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.630> could<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.470> when<00:01:56.430> you

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
around how that could be so but when you

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.010 
around how that could be so but when you
when<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.939> look<00:01:57.090> at<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:59.149> woman<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.659> well<00:02:00.869> we

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
when you look at it woman but well we

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.780 
when you look at it woman but well we
were<00:02:01.140> apparently<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.829> almost<00:02:02.430> akin<00:02:02.549> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
were apparently you know almost akin to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.370 
were apparently you know almost akin to
reduced<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> few<00:02:03.479> thousand<00:02:03.990> probably<00:02:04.170> at

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
reduced to a few thousand probably at

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.810 
reduced to a few thousand probably at
one<00:02:04.469> point

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
one point

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.760 
one point
in<00:02:04.970> Africa<00:02:05.510> those<00:02:05.750> four<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.140> choke<00:02:06.380> period

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
in Africa those four the choke period

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.760 
in Africa those four the choke period
and<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:08.570> can<00:02:08.720> tell<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:08.930> to<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.229> genetics

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
and you can tell that to the genetics

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.860 
and you can tell that to the genetics
because<00:02:10.580> we're<00:02:10.850> all<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.120> similar<00:02:11.360> well<00:02:11.840> I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
because we're all so similar well I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.540 
because we're all so similar well I
don't<00:02:12.230> want<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.410> degenerate<00:02:12.890> too<00:02:13.160> much<00:02:13.340> on

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
don't want to degenerate too much on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.240 
don't want to degenerate too much on
this<00:02:13.670> one<00:02:13.730> but<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.090> thing<00:02:14.990> that's<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.470> left

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
this one but the thing that's that left

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.100 
this one but the thing that's that left
out<00:02:16.490> of<00:02:16.520> me<00:02:16.790> immediately<00:02:17.240> was<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.080> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
out of me immediately was the that the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.240 
out of me immediately was the that the
only<00:02:19.210> descendant<00:02:20.210> today<00:02:20.960> alive<00:02:21.530> closest

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
only descendant today alive closest

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.970 
only descendant today alive closest
relative<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.240> t-rex<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.170> chicken<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.890> I

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
relative to a t-rex is a chicken and I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.190 
relative to a t-rex is a chicken and I
thought<00:02:25.220> I'm<00:02:26.180> not<00:02:26.390> sure<00:02:26.600> we<00:02:26.750> should<00:02:26.900> be<00:02:26.930> more

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
thought I'm not sure we should be more

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.190 
thought I'm not sure we should be more
offended<00:02:27.500> there<00:02:28.270> well<00:02:29.270> actually<00:02:29.600> it's<00:02:29.900> birds

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
offended there well actually it's birds

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.110 
offended there well actually it's birds
in<00:02:30.440> general<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.100> they<00:02:31.280> they<00:02:31.490> happen<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.820> see

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
in general and they they happen to see

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.690 
in general and they they happen to see
if<00:02:32.330> sequenced<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.170> chicken<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.190> was

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
if sequenced the chicken so that was

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.210 
if sequenced the chicken so that was
close<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.630> probably<00:02:35.870> most<00:02:36.740> birds

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
close but it's probably most birds

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.270 
close but it's probably most birds
chicken<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.240> Birds<00:02:38.780> not<00:02:39.140> all<00:02:39.290> not<00:02:39.950> all<00:02:39.980> bird

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
chicken like Birds not all not all bird

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.460 
chicken like Birds not all not all bird
species<00:02:40.610> but<00:02:41.030> what<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:41.930> means<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.380> know

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
species but what that means is you know

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.260 
species but what that means is you know
they<00:02:42.800> found<00:02:43.190> out<00:02:43.370> more<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.610> more<00:02:43.670> information

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
they found out more and more information

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.760 
they found out more and more information
in<00:02:44.330> fact<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.570> was<00:02:44.660> just<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.959> discovery<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.650> other

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
in fact I was just a discovery the other

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.880 
in fact I was just a discovery the other
day<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.220> feathers<00:02:47.030> imprinted<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.840> rock<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.440> a

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
day of feathers imprinted on a rock of a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.970 
day of feathers imprinted on a rock of a
dying<00:02:49.160> dinosaur<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:51.050> is<00:02:51.230> pretty<00:02:51.410> clear<00:02:51.709> that

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
dying dinosaur and is pretty clear that

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.380 
dying dinosaur and is pretty clear that
there<00:02:52.100> were<00:02:52.160> certain<00:02:52.610> there<00:02:52.850> were<00:02:52.940> these

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
there were certain there were these

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.020 
there were certain there were these
avian<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.380> non-avian<00:02:54.860> dinosaurs<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.670> t-rex

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
avian and non-avian dinosaurs and t-rex

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.640 
avian and non-avian dinosaurs and t-rex
has<00:02:56.150> probably<00:02:56.450> didn't<00:02:56.630> have<00:02:56.720> feathers<00:02:56.900> but

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
has probably didn't have feathers but

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.630 
has probably didn't have feathers but
the<00:02:58.010> weird<00:02:58.370> thing<00:02:58.430> about<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:58.940> story<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.630> that

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the weird thing about that story is that

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.870 
the weird thing about that story is that
there<00:03:01.640> are<00:03:01.760> dormant<00:03:02.180> genes<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:03.200> all<00:03:03.880> organisms

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
there are dormant genes in all organisms

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.920 
there are dormant genes in all organisms
that<00:03:05.120> have<00:03:05.239> been<00:03:05.330> around<00:03:05.540> for<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.780> long<00:03:05.870> time

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
that have been around for a long time

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.360 
that have been around for a long time
like<00:03:06.200> us<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.560> know<00:03:06.650> descended<00:03:07.160> from<00:03:07.220> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
like us you know descended from the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.670 
like us you know descended from the
pufferfish<00:03:07.670> another<00:03:08.120> thing<00:03:08.450> right<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:08.840> there

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
pufferfish another thing right and there

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.710 
pufferfish another thing right and there
are<00:03:09.800> genes<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.340> chicken<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:11.630> you

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
are genes and a chicken that if you

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.210 
are genes and a chicken that if you
activated<00:03:12.320> them<00:03:12.530> they<00:03:12.650> would<00:03:12.769> actually<00:03:12.920> turn

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
activated them they would actually turn

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.560 
activated them they would actually turn
into<00:03:13.340> little<00:03:13.550> dinosaurs<00:03:14.030> they're<00:03:14.390> just

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
into little dinosaurs they're just

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.150 
into little dinosaurs they're just
inactive<00:03:15.140> they<00:03:15.320> would<00:03:15.440> grow<00:03:15.590> teeth<00:03:15.860> they

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
inactive they would grow teeth they

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.710 
inactive they would grow teeth they
would<00:03:16.280> have<00:03:16.400> little<00:03:16.550> arms<00:03:16.940> instead<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.300> wings

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
would have little arms instead of wings

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.970 
would have little arms instead of wings
right<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.050> let's<00:03:18.140> say<00:03:18.320> I'll<00:03:18.470> get<00:03:18.650> in<00:03:18.769> very

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
right so let's say I'll get in very

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.830 
right so let's say I'll get in very
Jurassic<00:03:19.519> Park<00:03:19.730> I'm<00:03:20.030> not<00:03:20.180> sure<00:03:20.299> well<00:03:20.480> been<00:03:20.720> in

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
Jurassic Park I'm not sure well been in

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.750 
Jurassic Park I'm not sure well been in
