00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.270
 this 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.940
 The design of this helmet is based on 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.720
 the old leather helmets and the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.780
 particularity that it has is that it is 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.840

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.380
 thought and designed to save it in 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.200

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.469

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.929

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.240
 so that the rain does not bother us or 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.490
 the sun that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 it starts to rain we can put the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.560
 visor so that the water does not fall 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:55.110
