00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
what you're doing the only thing that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.549 
what you're doing the only thing that
really<00:00:56.460> got<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.239> me<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> realized<00:00:58.079> after<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
really got to me that I realized after I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
really got to me that I realized after I
bought<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.550> made<00:01:00.210> me

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
bought it that it kind of made me

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.330 
bought it that it kind of made me
rethink<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.140> would<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.530> next<00:01:01.770> time<00:01:02.070> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
rethink what I would do next time is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.530 
rethink what I would do next time is
that<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> single<00:01:04.110> boiler<00:01:05.540> this

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that because it's a single boiler this

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.890 
that because it's a single boiler this
kind<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> gets<00:01:07.520> irritating<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:09.270> you

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
kind of gets irritating because you

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.820 
kind of gets irritating because you
can't<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.880> this<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.409> at<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> same<00:01:13.590> time

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
can't do this and that at the same time

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.679 
can't do this and that at the same time
which<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.729> could<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> professional

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
which you could do on a professional

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.200 
which you could do on a professional
local<00:01:16.049> machine<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> ended<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:18.150> doing

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
local machine so what I ended up doing

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.109 
local machine so what I ended up doing
is<00:01:18.600> spending<00:01:19.200> another<00:01:19.380> 60<00:01:19.799> bucks<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.340> getting

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
is spending another 60 bucks and getting

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.320 
is spending another 60 bucks and getting
this<00:01:21.299> capresso<00:01:22.200> milk<00:01:22.530> frother<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.250> warmer<00:01:23.700> so

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
this capresso milk frother and warmer so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
this capresso milk frother and warmer so
that's<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> only<00:01:24.780> real<00:01:25.290> downside<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:26.159> found

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that's the only real downside I found

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.880 
that's the only real downside I found
with<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> single

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
with this is that because the single

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
with this is that because the single
boiler<00:01:29.189> which<00:01:29.369> many<00:01:29.820> other<00:01:30.060> machines<00:01:30.509> have

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
boiler which many other machines have

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.090 
boiler which many other machines have
single<00:01:31.079> boilers<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.530> they<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> same

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
single boilers and they have the same

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.679 
single boilers and they have the same
problem<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> mean<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> definitely

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
problem so I mean it this is definitely

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.380 
problem so I mean it this is definitely
the<00:01:36.689> top<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.409> would<00:01:38.250> say<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> top<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the top I would say it's the top of the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.649 
the top I would say it's the top of the
line<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.549> single<00:01:41.549> boiler<00:01:41.880> machine<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.450> this

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
line for a single boiler machine of this

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.280 
line for a single boiler machine of this
of<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.229> type<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.299> you're<00:01:46.200> gonna

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
of this type you know you you're gonna

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.539 
of this type you know you you're gonna
have<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> deal<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
have to deal with that and you have to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
have to deal with that and you have to
deal<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:47.899> having<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> wait<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.860> get

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
deal with having to wait for this to get

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
deal with having to wait for this to get
you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.579> going<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:52.049> kind<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
you know going and it's really kind of a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.980 
you know going and it's really kind of a
pain<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.820> don't<00:01:54.119> even<00:01:54.210> use<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.540> anymore

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
pain so I don't even use this anymore

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.569 
pain so I don't even use this anymore
it's<00:01:55.290> done<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.100> wrap<00:01:59.340> up

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
it's done but to just really wrap up
