00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
out of the way the reason I didn't use a

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.840 
out of the way the reason I didn't use a
brush<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.619> begin<00:01:32.979> with<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.250> because<00:01:33.280> I<00:01:33.580> didn't

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
brush to begin with is because I didn't

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.520 
brush to begin with is because I didn't
want<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:34.030> smudge<00:01:34.330> around<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.020> side<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
want to smudge around the side of the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.700 
want to smudge around the side of the
nail<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.979> I<00:01:36.789> thought<00:01:37.000> using<00:01:37.750> either<00:01:38.050> orange

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
nail and I thought using either orange

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.770 
nail and I thought using either orange
wood<00:01:38.920> stick<00:01:38.950> or<00:01:39.399> a<00:01:39.460> very<00:01:39.850> tiny<00:01:40.149> dotting<00:01:40.570> tool

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
wood stick or a very tiny dotting tool

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.779 
wood stick or a very tiny dotting tool
would<00:01:41.289> be<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.679> best<00:01:41.860> thing<00:01:42.039> to<00:01:42.220> use<00:01:42.250> for<00:01:42.429> that

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
would be the best thing to use for that

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.029 
would be the best thing to use for that
now<00:01:43.570> next<00:01:44.020> we're<00:01:44.170> going<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.440> come<00:01:44.619> in<00:01:44.770> with<00:01:44.860> the
