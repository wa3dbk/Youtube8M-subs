00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Hello, this is Rafael Ortega and you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.220
 I tell you that although the framework of 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.930
 Room rental is complex the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.150
 of apartment rentals is much 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.860
 worse it's really about a monster and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.599
 is that they are not even renting 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.730
 the apartments in bolivars but that 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.650
 they rent them in dollars this was what 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.920
 we discover here in and if we think about it 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.920
 all right 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.590

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.000
 advertisement for an apartment rental in 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.579
 the big clubs in 200 thousand bolivars 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.180

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.610

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.199

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.269
 apartments to arrive with suitcases 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.269

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:54.010

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.219

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.909

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.589

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.920
 I need lately I had to 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.780
 travel a lot and I need to be 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.890
 in Caracas for a while and I have 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.950
 payment availability 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.790
 As you see the Lord wants is my foundation 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.040
 pay in three months deposits and 1500 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.060
 dollars and three months of deposits would be 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.010
 four thousand dollars for six thousand dollars 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.220
 you are the commission you do not have to pay 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.050
 minimum commission fee of course 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.150
 a commission month for you yes but 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.170
 much of this can be negotiated with the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.570
 sir express and all ok uterus but since 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.479
 of how we take with these new ones like 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.009
 premiered then he wants to recover 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.009
 this month 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:54.560
 at least do these expenses 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.500
 of the apartment in renovations 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.570
 to recover with the payment with the payment of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.940
 the work to be in August 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.530
 because no but if here it says that they are 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.530
 200,000 because they charge it in dollars 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.230
 where they live to recover their 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.420
 money for this because he is asking 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.230
 this because the bolivar is not doing 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.850
 nothing extends young his name my name 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.830
 is jesÃºs pp team 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.140
 I am Italian but I have time already in 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.810
 venezuela but I think that for the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.300
 first days of January I would like that 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.330
 out for february but if it is to move 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.280
 in January I will have to move in January 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.900
 but because it is once 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.090
 I tell myself that you do not have to grab 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.770
 because they still gave me the united in the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.400
 new york times ok from the new york times 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.400

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.819
 I have the money I have the money 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.760
 wait I'm going for the department 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.440
 get poker and they're going to finish this 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.090
 week for what is ready I will 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.860
 we are going to pour can come and see 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.170
 Attention to the data that this 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.489
 call is about a manager that is 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.500
 offering apartments that 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.849
 build on the basis of payment 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.830
 advanced in tenants' dollars 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.720
 for later these mafias 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.420
 enter the dollars in the market 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.010
 parallel and thus enrich yourself is 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.660
 unfortunate that this way is played with 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.580
 the needs of human beings 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.410
 remember that society is full of 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.600
 contradictions and that we can all 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.260
 solve them with actions and if 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.260
 we think well
