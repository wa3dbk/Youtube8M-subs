 now let's get comfortable and start with 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.800
 the questions and armanda celebrity crush that 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.620
 you had when I was young then I was like 11 12 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.579
 years I don't remember it perfectly 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.120
 however the titanic movie was released but the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.780
 berta of those who never know what is cooked 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.020
 obviously of the protagonist that is 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.840
 bob blond blue eyes face 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.909
 angel leonardo di caprio 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.150
 I think it was the most beautiful in the world 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.030
 beautiful and so I had taken one 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.640
 overcooked for him to such an extent becomes 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.330
 to make my poster room the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.689
 in short, the school diary 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.780
 I went crazy for him, I saw almost 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.650
 all his films and above all the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.340
 titanic 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.409
 I don't know if you will believe it or not but I know it 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.750
 certainly I have seen it more than 100 times 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.150
 I knew the lines by heart together 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.490
 that is true and I looked at one day 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.670
 part of the film the whole movie though 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.760
 it lasted like 3 hours so I was really there 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.920
 cooked really really cooked while 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.229

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.280
