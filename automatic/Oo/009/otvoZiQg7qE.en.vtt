hello<00:00:04.650> guys<00:00:04.859> now<00:00:05.700> let's<00:00:05.940> talk<00:00:06.150> about

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
hello guys now let's talk about

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.780 
hello guys now let's talk about
fermentation<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.470> little<00:00:07.859> bit<00:00:07.980> more<00:00:08.280> details

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
fermentation in little bit more details

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.450 
fermentation in little bit more details
and<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.840> have<00:00:10.019> been<00:00:10.200> talking<00:00:10.410> about<00:00:10.650> anaerobic

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
and we have been talking about anaerobic

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.030 
and we have been talking about anaerobic
metabolism<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.389> you've<00:00:12.719> also<00:00:12.929> seen<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
metabolism and you've also seen the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.390 
metabolism and you've also seen the
discussion<00:00:14.580> about<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.030> know<00:00:16.010> the<00:00:17.010> ethanol

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
discussion about you know the ethanol

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.950 
discussion about you know the ethanol
fermentation<00:00:17.699> especially<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.840> this

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
fermentation especially now in this

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.240 
fermentation especially now in this
video<00:00:19.140> we'll<00:00:19.410> be<00:00:19.439> talking<00:00:19.710> about<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
video we'll be talking about the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.509 
video we'll be talking about the
fermentation<00:00:20.699> as<00:00:21.180> an<00:00:21.480> overview<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:23.039> let's

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
fermentation as an overview so let's

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.220 
fermentation as an overview so let's
talk<00:00:23.850> about<00:00:24.029> fermentation<00:00:24.539> all<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
talk about fermentation all the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.990 
talk about fermentation all the
different<00:00:25.560> types<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.010> fermentation<00:00:26.550> actually

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
different types of fermentation actually

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.960 
different types of fermentation actually
so<00:00:27.720> let's<00:00:28.109> take<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> color<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.189> let's<00:00:29.670> begin

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
so let's take a color and let's begin

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.659 
so let's take a color and let's begin
with<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:30.990> fermentation<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.309> type

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
with it you know fermentation is a type

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.510 
with it you know fermentation is a type
of<00:00:34.550> anaerobic<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.820> aerobic<00:00:37.520> metabolic

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
of anaerobic and aerobic metabolic

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.830 
of anaerobic and aerobic metabolic
pathway<00:00:38.940> anaerobic<00:00:39.450> metabolism<00:00:40.760> meta<00:00:41.840> Bowl

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
pathway anaerobic metabolism meta Bowl

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.029 
pathway anaerobic metabolism meta Bowl
ISM<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.129> type<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> anaerobic<00:00:44.969> metabolism

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
ISM it's a type of anaerobic metabolism

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.240 
ISM it's a type of anaerobic metabolism
so<00:00:47.039> fermentation<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.879> usually<00:00:48.300> occurred<00:00:48.719> in

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
so fermentation is usually occurred in

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
so fermentation is usually occurred in
bacteria<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.610> also<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.510> be<00:00:51.570> seen<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.050> low

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
bacteria and also it can be seen in low

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010 
bacteria and also it can be seen in low
in<00:00:53.190> carry<00:00:53.370> oats<00:00:53.579> low<00:00:54.239> air<00:00:54.360> carriers<00:00:54.840> for

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
in carry oats low air carriers for

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.830 
in carry oats low air carriers for
example<00:00:55.469> East<00:00:56.280> East<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:56.969> eukaryotic<00:00:57.629> cell

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
example East East is in eukaryotic cell

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.599 
example East East is in eukaryotic cell
but<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.379> still<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.949> fermentation<00:00:59.579> going

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
but you can still see fermentation going

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.670 
but you can still see fermentation going
on<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.300> also<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.109> seen<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.469> higher

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
on and also it can be seen in higher

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
on and also it can be seen in higher
eukaryotes<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.340> us<00:01:02.699> because<00:01:03.239> even<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.960> our

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
eukaryotes like us because even in our

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.469 
eukaryotes like us because even in our
body<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:05.040> fermentation<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> time

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
body we have fermentation all the time

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.929 
body we have fermentation all the time
you<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.140> after<00:01:07.439> taking<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.920> food<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you know after taking a food there is

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.310 
you know after taking a food there is
there<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.810> amount<00:01:10.080> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
there are a little bit amount of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
there are a little bit amount of
fermentation<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.000> why<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.240> all

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
fermentation going on that is why if all

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.899 
fermentation going on that is why if all
sleepy<00:01:12.930> operating<00:01:13.470> too<00:01:13.680> much<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.070> certain

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
sleepy operating too much of certain

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.530 
sleepy operating too much of certain
certain<00:01:15.720> sugary<00:01:16.049> food<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:17.159> also

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
certain sugary food and then also

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.539 
certain sugary food and then also
fermentation<00:01:18.540> occurs<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.140> our<00:01:19.290> muscle<00:01:19.770> then

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
fermentation occurs in our muscle then

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
fermentation occurs in our muscle then
the<00:01:21.000> fermentation<00:01:21.330> occur<00:01:21.750> inside<00:01:22.080> our<00:01:22.229> muscle

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the fermentation occur inside our muscle

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
the fermentation occur inside our muscle
and<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.920> produces<00:01:23.610> lactic<00:01:23.850> acid<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.689> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and that produces lactic acid there it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
and that produces lactic acid there it
causes<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> muscle<00:01:26.130> fatty<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.210> these<00:01:27.360> things

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
causes the muscle fatty so these things

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080 
causes the muscle fatty so these things
are<00:01:27.810> related<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:29.159> each<00:01:29.310> other<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
are related with all with each other so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.609 
are related with all with each other so
let's<00:01:30.270> talk<00:01:30.479> about<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.900> fermentation

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
let's talk about the fermentation

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.679 
let's talk about the fermentation
fermentation<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.939> majorly<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.509> two

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
fermentation can be majorly of two

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.590 
fermentation can be majorly of two
different<00:01:34.020> types<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.790> ethanol

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
different types one is the ethanol

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.660 
different types one is the ethanol
fermentation<00:01:37.040> another<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> lactic

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
fermentation another one is the lactic

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.660 
fermentation another one is the lactic
acid<00:01:39.150> fermentation<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.320> context<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
acid fermentation in that context so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.149 
acid fermentation in that context so
let's<00:01:41.880> talk<00:01:42.030> about<00:01:42.329> both<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> them<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:43.159> now

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
let's talk about both of them here now

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.690 
let's talk about both of them here now
in<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.930> lactic<00:01:46.740> acid<00:01:47.009> fermentation<00:01:47.310> if

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
in in a in a lactic acid fermentation if

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
in in a in a lactic acid fermentation if
we<00:01:47.820> talk<00:01:48.000> about<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> lactic<00:01:48.990> acid

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
we talk about here the lactic acid

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.370 
we talk about here the lactic acid
fermentation<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:49.950> glucose<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.229> what<00:01:52.229> we

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
fermentation we have glucose and what we

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.580 
fermentation we have glucose and what we
produce<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:53.159> lactate<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.329> lactic<00:01:54.420> acid<00:01:55.200> so

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
produce is lactate or lactic acid so

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.289 
produce is lactate or lactic acid so
this<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> substrate<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
this is the substrate this is the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.969 
this is the substrate this is the
substrate<00:01:57.420> remember<00:01:58.170> glucose<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
substrate remember glucose and the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.999 
substrate remember glucose and the
product<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> lactic<00:02:00.119> acid<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.810> lactate<00:02:01.409> same

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
product is lactic acid or lactate same

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.090 
product is lactic acid or lactate same
thing<00:02:02.280> now<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:04.140> glucose<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:04.950> will

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
thing now from one glucose they will

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.280 
thing now from one glucose they will
produce<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.820> lactate<00:02:06.390> remember<00:02:06.930> because<00:02:07.200> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
produce to lactate remember because you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.109 
produce to lactate remember because you
know<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.920> all<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.459> type<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.700> fermentation

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
know in all this type of fermentation

a<00:02:12.390> very<00:02:12.540> important<00:02:13.080> thing<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.319> look

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
a very important thing to look

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.309 
a very important thing to look
for<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.490> number<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.880> carbon<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:16.260> is

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
for is the number of carbon that is

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.000 
for is the number of carbon that is
prism<00:02:16.880> in<00:02:17.880> glucose<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.599> six<00:02:19.050> carbon<00:02:19.620> in

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
lactate there is only three turbine so

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.260

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
pyruvate from glucose is termed as you

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.000 
pyruvate from glucose is termed as you
know<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.120> called<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.720> glycolysis<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
know it is called as the glycolysis and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.320 
know it is called as the glycolysis and
this<00:02:56.819> process<00:02:57.090> requires<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:59.160> know<00:02:59.280> ATP<00:03:00.090> and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
this process requires you know ATP and

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.830 
this process requires you know ATP and
it<00:03:00.720> also<00:03:00.959> produces<00:03:01.739> ATP<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.580> requires<00:03:03.060> two<00:03:03.299> ATP

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
it also produces ATP it requires two ATP

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.530 
it also produces ATP it requires two ATP
and<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.440> produces<00:03:04.980> four<00:03:05.310> ATP<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:06.269> ultimately

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
and it produces four ATP so ultimately

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.979 
and it produces four ATP so ultimately
it<00:03:06.900> gives<00:03:07.049> us<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.500> gain<00:03:07.799> of<00:03:08.010> two<00:03:08.519> ATP's<00:03:08.989> right

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
it gives us the gain of two ATP's right

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.620 
it gives us the gain of two ATP's right
so<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.380> via<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.980> glycolysis<00:03:11.430> from<00:03:12.150> glucose

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
so the via the glycolysis from glucose

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.830 
so the via the glycolysis from glucose
we<00:03:13.049> produce<00:03:13.319> two<00:03:13.980> pyruvate<00:03:14.640> molecules<00:03:15.209> each

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
we produce two pyruvate molecules each

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.479 
we produce two pyruvate molecules each
of<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.230> pyruvate<00:03:16.440> molecules<00:03:17.069> are<00:03:17.250> three

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
of the pyruvate molecules are three

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.390 
of the pyruvate molecules are three
carbons<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.299> such<00:03:18.660> two<00:03:19.140> pyruvate<00:03:19.920> molecules

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
carbons so such two pyruvate molecules

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.039 
carbons so such two pyruvate molecules
will<00:03:20.640> give<00:03:20.910> ultimately<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.570> six<00:03:21.780> carbon

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
will give ultimately the six carbon

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.770 
will give ultimately the six carbon
which<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.440> their<00:03:22.859> present<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.519> glucose<00:03:23.850> so

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
which is their present in the glucose so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.099 
which is their present in the glucose so
no<00:03:25.590> carbon<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.100> lost<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.820> any<00:03:27.030> means<00:03:27.450> every

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
no carbon is lost in any means every

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.990 
no carbon is lost in any means every
carbon<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.560> there<00:03:28.799> now<00:03:29.400> from<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.760> pyruvate

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
carbon is there now from the pyruvate

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.650 
carbon is there now from the pyruvate
they<00:03:30.570> directly<00:03:31.200> produce<00:03:31.380> lactate<00:03:32.660> but

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
they directly produce lactate but

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.509 
they directly produce lactate but
remember<00:03:34.049> during<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.470> glycolysis<00:03:34.980> they

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
remember during the glycolysis they

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.310 
remember during the glycolysis they
require<00:03:35.820> also<00:03:36.120> requires<00:03:36.510> certain<00:03:36.780> agents

and<00:04:20.630> then<00:04:21.630> if<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.650> lactic<00:04:23.039> acid<00:04:23.340> star<00:04:23.550> P

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
and then if the lactic acid star P

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.310 
and then if the lactic acid star P
accumulate<00:04:24.180> in<00:04:24.270> our<00:04:24.360> muscle<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.200> muscle

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
accumulate in our muscle the muscle

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.379 
accumulate in our muscle the muscle
becomes<00:04:25.800> very<00:04:26.039> much<00:04:26.280> stiff

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
becomes very much stiff

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.059 
becomes very much stiff
and<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.719> time<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.319> muscle<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:28.680> called<00:04:28.919> as

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
and that time the muscle is called as

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.059 
and that time the muscle is called as
the<00:04:29.189> fatty<00:04:29.490> condition<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:30.569> muscle<00:04:31.069> now

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
the fatty condition of the muscle now

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:33.950 
the fatty condition of the muscle now
let's<00:04:32.280> talk<00:04:32.460> about<00:04:32.520> another<00:04:32.969> fermentation

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
let's talk about another fermentation

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.679 
let's talk about another fermentation
that<00:04:34.169> is<00:04:34.349> the<00:04:34.949> alcohol<00:04:35.460> fermentation<00:04:35.689> again

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:36.689 
that is the alcohol fermentation again

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.689 
that is the alcohol fermentation again
the<00:04:36.810> substrate<00:04:37.259> here<00:04:37.439> is<00:04:37.590> also<00:04:37.949> glucose<00:04:38.430> and

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
the substrate here is also glucose and

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.890 
the substrate here is also glucose and
the<00:04:39.180> product<00:04:39.599> here<00:04:40.110> is<00:04:40.499> ethanol<00:04:41.310> or<00:04:41.900> alcohol

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
the product here is ethanol or alcohol

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.899 
the product here is ethanol or alcohol
so<00:04:43.169> this<00:04:43.319> is<00:04:43.469> the<00:04:43.590> product<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:44.550> we<00:04:44.669> need<00:04:44.819> to

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
so this is the product so we need to

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.869 
so this is the product so we need to
produce<00:04:45.090> ethanol<00:04:45.419> from<00:04:46.139> glucose<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.949> this

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
produce ethanol from glucose and this

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.119 
produce ethanol from glucose and this
also<00:04:48.120> have<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.169> intermediate<00:04:49.379> called

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
also have the intermediate called

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.920 
also have the intermediate called
pyruvate<00:04:50.490> because<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.479> is<00:04:51.569> very<00:04:51.749> very

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
pyruvate because that is very very

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.409 
pyruvate because that is very very
important<00:04:52.529> except<00:04:53.129> for<00:04:53.310> pyruvate<00:04:53.819> they<00:04:54.210> have

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
important except for pyruvate they have

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.379 
important except for pyruvate they have
a<00:04:54.599> certain<00:04:55.050> extra<00:04:55.889> stage<00:04:56.219> so<00:04:56.729> pyruvate<00:04:57.270> is

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
a certain extra stage so pyruvate is

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.779 
a certain extra stage so pyruvate is
already<00:04:57.810> there<00:04:58.199> but<00:04:58.469> they<00:04:58.979> have<00:04:59.249> a<00:04:59.430> certain

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
already there but they have a certain

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.939 
already there but they have a certain
extra<00:05:00.389> stage<00:05:00.689> we'll<00:05:01.110> be<00:05:01.139> talking<00:05:01.409> about<00:05:01.710> it

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
extra stage we'll be talking about it

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.740 
extra stage we'll be talking about it
later<00:05:02.099> the<00:05:02.639> process<00:05:03.090> of<00:05:03.210> production<00:05:03.629> of

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
later the process of production of

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.899 
later the process of production of
pyruvate<00:05:04.289> from<00:05:04.319> glucose<00:05:04.889> remains<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.610> same

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
pyruvate from glucose remains the same

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.929 
pyruvate from glucose remains the same
through<00:05:06.659> ATP's<00:05:07.259> are<00:05:07.340> ultimately<00:05:08.340> produced

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:08.939 
through ATP's are ultimately produced

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.809 
through ATP's are ultimately produced
and<00:05:09.360> also<00:05:09.810> they<00:05:09.930> require<00:05:10.289> nad<00:05:10.889> to<00:05:11.460> produce

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
and also they require nad to produce

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.040 
and also they require nad to produce
NADH<00:05:12.360> +<00:05:12.830> H+<00:05:13.830> two<00:05:14.490> of<00:05:14.669> them<00:05:14.909> and<00:05:15.150> once<00:05:15.870> they

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
NADH + H+ two of them and once they

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.679 
NADH + H+ two of them and once they
produce<00:05:16.289> that<00:05:16.860> that<00:05:17.310> pyruvate<00:05:17.669> is<00:05:18.240> you<00:05:18.569> know

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:18.689 
produce that that pyruvate is you know

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.019 
produce that that pyruvate is you know
three<00:05:18.900> carbon<00:05:19.349> molecule<00:05:19.830> now<00:05:20.520> during<00:05:20.759> this

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029 
three carbon molecule now during this

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.929 
three carbon molecule now during this
process<00:05:21.800> from<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:23.039> pyruvate<00:05:23.250> they<00:05:23.729> produce

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 
process from the pyruvate they produce

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.510 
process from the pyruvate they produce
acetaldehyde<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:25.469> the<00:05:26.009> production<00:05:26.310> of

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
acetaldehyde and the production of

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.790 
acetaldehyde and the production of
acetyl<00:05:26.939> get<00:05:27.120> from<00:05:27.389> pyruvate<00:05:27.599> requires<00:05:28.529> the

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
acetyl get from pyruvate requires the

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.100 
acetyl get from pyruvate requires the
release<00:05:29.159> of<00:05:29.400> a<00:05:29.520> carbon<00:05:29.909> dioxide<00:05:30.060> from<00:05:30.930> the

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
release of a carbon dioxide from the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.230 
release of a carbon dioxide from the
pyruvate<00:05:31.349> so<00:05:32.039> that<00:05:32.219> what's<00:05:32.460> happening<00:05:32.909> here

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
pyruvate so that what's happening here

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.079 
pyruvate so that what's happening here
carbon<00:05:33.689> dioxide<00:05:33.810> is<00:05:34.500> released<00:05:34.979> here<00:05:35.460> as<00:05:35.610> the

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.089 
carbon dioxide is released here as the

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:38.390 
carbon dioxide is released here as the
carbon<00:05:36.300> dioxide<00:05:36.539> released<00:05:37.319> one<00:05:37.770> carbon<00:05:38.250> is

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
carbon dioxide released one carbon is

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.149 
carbon dioxide released one carbon is
released<00:05:38.430> from<00:05:38.969> pyruvate<00:05:39.240> so<00:05:39.990> from<00:05:40.469> 3<00:05:40.710> carbon

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
released from pyruvate so from 3 carbon

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.399 
released from pyruvate so from 3 carbon
it<00:05:41.310> becomes<00:05:41.729> now<00:05:41.909> two<00:05:41.969> carbon<00:05:42.629> molecule<00:05:43.139> and

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
it becomes now two carbon molecule and

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.040 
it becomes now two carbon molecule and
we<00:05:43.740> all<00:05:43.860> know<00:05:44.099> acetaldehyde<00:05:44.879> is<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.389> two<00:05:45.629> carbon

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
we all know acetaldehyde is a two carbon

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.860 
we all know acetaldehyde is a two carbon
molecule<00:05:46.560> now<00:05:47.009> from<00:05:47.219> acetaldehyde<00:05:47.669> they<00:05:48.569> will

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
molecule now from acetaldehyde they will

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.469 
molecule now from acetaldehyde they will
produce<00:05:49.169> ethanol<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:50.339> during<00:05:51.120> this<00:05:51.270> process

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
produce ethanol and during this process

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.719 
produce ethanol and during this process
of<00:05:51.870> ethanol<00:05:52.289> production<00:05:52.620> while<00:05:53.279> by<00:05:53.669> the

the<00:06:00.449> alcohol<00:06:00.839> dehydrogenase<00:06:01.490> will<00:06:02.490> convert

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
the alcohol dehydrogenase will convert

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.450 
the alcohol dehydrogenase will convert
if<00:06:03.089> acetaldehyde<00:06:03.659> into<00:06:04.229> ethanol<00:06:04.469> and<00:06:04.860> during

this<00:06:05.610> process<00:06:06.139> they<00:06:07.139> also<00:06:07.800> recycle<00:06:08.639> the<00:06:08.789> nad

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
this process they also recycle the nad

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.469 
this process they also recycle the nad
plus<00:06:09.629> back<00:06:10.139> to<00:06:11.099> the<00:06:11.219> previous<00:06:11.610> state<00:06:11.819> because

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
plus back to the previous state because

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.889 
plus back to the previous state because
NADH<00:06:12.960> is<00:06:13.199> oxidized<00:06:14.009> to<00:06:14.310> nad<00:06:14.610> plus<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.330> they

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:15.899 
NADH is oxidized to nad plus and they

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:18.769 
NADH is oxidized to nad plus and they
give<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:17.009> nad<00:06:17.279> plus<00:06:17.520> and<00:06:17.699> they<00:06:18.120> produce<00:06:18.509> more

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
give the nad plus and they produce more

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.980 
give the nad plus and they produce more

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
and more free nad plus which will go for

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.709 
and more free nad plus which will go for

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
the next round of glycolysis right so

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.559 
the next round of glycolysis right so
that<00:06:24.870> is<00:06:25.139> in<00:06:25.680> a<00:06:25.800> whole<00:06:26.099> fermentation<00:06:27.000> but

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569 
that is in a whole fermentation but

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.629 
that is in a whole fermentation but
remember<00:06:28.050> fermentation<00:06:28.710> occurs<00:06:29.250> in<00:06:29.520> the

ultimately via the Arabic pathway they

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.860 
ultimately via the Arabic pathway they

the presence of oxygen in the absence of
oxygen<00:07:17.370> in<00:07:17.909> turn<00:07:18.150> they<00:07:18.389> will<00:07:18.419> produce<00:07:18.720> only

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:19.970 
oxygen in turn they will produce only

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.969 
oxygen in turn they will produce only
four<00:07:20.970> to<00:07:21.180> six<00:07:21.419> ATP's<00:07:21.960> so<00:07:22.620> that<00:07:22.770> is<00:07:22.889> the

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 
four to six ATP's so that is the

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.490 
four to six ATP's so that is the
difference<00:07:23.400> right<00:07:23.669> but<00:07:24.630> still<00:07:24.870> fermentation

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 
difference right but still fermentation

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.920 
difference right but still fermentation
is<00:07:25.590> required<00:07:26.039> in<00:07:26.310> certain<00:07:26.520> organism<00:07:27.449> and<00:07:27.659> it

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
is required in certain organism and it

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.809 
is required in certain organism and it
is<00:07:28.050> required<00:07:28.470> for<00:07:28.740> us<00:07:28.979> because<00:07:29.250> we<00:07:29.610> use

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 
is required for us because we use

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.149 
is required for us because we use
fermentation<00:07:30.539> to<00:07:30.659> produce<00:07:30.690> lot<00:07:31.620> of<00:07:31.800> different

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:32.159 
fermentation to produce lot of different

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:35.230 
fermentation to produce lot of different
important<00:07:32.639> variety<00:07:33.030> of<00:07:33.060> food<00:07:33.560> for<00:07:34.560> our

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 
important variety of food for our

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.550 
important variety of food for our
convenience<00:07:36.240> so<00:07:36.720> that<00:07:36.750> is<00:07:36.960> kind<00:07:37.139> of<00:07:37.199> it<00:07:37.349> guys

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 
convenience so that is kind of it guys

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.780 
convenience so that is kind of it guys
and<00:07:37.889> I<00:07:38.250> hope<00:07:38.400> that's<00:07:38.669> helpful<00:07:38.909> thank<00:07:39.630> you
