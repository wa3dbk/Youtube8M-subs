00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 these dear subscribers and viewers of my 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.280
 channel as promised today spend 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.480
 lake-type coffee machine review as 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.460
 spoke yet call it mokka 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.850
 coffee maker it's called kaiserhoff kh 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:25.710
 15-60 This is what a box looks like in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 which she shipped produced then 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.059
 There is as can be seen from the name of the company 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.510
 German but produced it is written made 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.290
 in prc what stands for 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.579
 people republic tea 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.460
 Like most goods in China let's 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.010
 We will consider it in more detail as 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.370
 says made steel in principle what 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:59.329
 no doubt she has 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.829
 principle, the device is not difficult here 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.060
 she looks inside as follows 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.479
 we have a container for loading coffee 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.939
 net form bottom 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:20.009
 also made and steel valve for 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.280
 pressure relief handle is made of 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.070
 quality plastic 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.439
 cap you can see the tube on the inside 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.530
 here's the capacity of the same coffee going as 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.070
 once the steam condenses and turns into 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.600
 coffee 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.270
 Well, we still have the bottom rather top 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.409
 parts also another filter so 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.799
 called here see sealer form 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.740
 rubber band that's just like on it 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.259
 stop a little what his fingers 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.200
 you can basically pull out but when he 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.329
 hot he probably gum more 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.170
 expanding it has to get 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.040
 just prepared a knife like a knife 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.990
 try new 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.830
 when it was not hot that is got 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:15.130
 hands filter here's another one that is 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.590
 elementary construction that's folding 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.440
 all back now still try not 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.020
 make coffee that is see how 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.260
 prepare prices and at the same time tell you what 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:33.670
 there are recommendations for making coffee 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:37.260
 in this type of coffee maker as saying 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.580
 continue review kaiserhoff coffee makers 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.740
 Now let's see directly how 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.740
 make coffee before you run 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.320
 coffee talk a little about what 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.740
 there are recommendations from amateurs and 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:56.200
 connoisseurs cooking in coffee with this 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.970
 type of coffee makers and so a number of lovers here 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.720
 advise before starting 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.860
 directly cooking itself 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.450
 for boiling water separately in the kettle and 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.550
 before you already leave on you 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.390
 directly pour the coffee machine itself 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.600
 hot coffee or rather pour hot water 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.680
 in the coffee maker itself explain it to not 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:25.000
 what a range of coffee can with long 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.239
 heating then further grieve 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.549
 In principle, this may be relevant but 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.100
 in my opinion more relevant to 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.670
 big coffee makers that is this 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.760
 directly to us at two hundred and thirty 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.850
 milliliters as indicated by two cups 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.820
 according to my observations, what if 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.160
 use at least boiling water the way and 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.260
 heat directly with cold 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.049
 water basically nothing from this 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.170
 changes but probably at large 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.150
 who are there for liters and a half then 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.390
 for them it may be quite relevant 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.290
 so if you want to get more me 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.750
 die drink 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.670
 it is recommended to boil water first and 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.310
 Respectively already fill in this form 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:19.239
 as for the coffee itself is recommended 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.060
 here load the coffee medium grinding so 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:26.110
 as fine grinding again states 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.960
 may further upset well and 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.930
 accordingly, we will wait now 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.990
 run coffee and see how this goes 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.990
 process 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.540
 here watching the process already like coffee itself 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.880
 starts to collect in the tank 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:52.190
 direct to the finished drink 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:57.060
 under the principle, the process goes on like this 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.900
 the aroma of coffee feels good tasty 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.740
 coffee also turns out such coffee makers 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.740
 now we will drink
