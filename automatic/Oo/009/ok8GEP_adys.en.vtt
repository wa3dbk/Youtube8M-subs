00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120

be too Brown I thought it might look too
muddy<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:13.050> then<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> loved<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.400> was

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
muddy but then I loved it it's it was

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.460 
muddy but then I loved it it's it was
crazy<00:02:14.790> how<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.150> really<00:02:15.450> worked<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.260> look

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
crazy how it really worked with the look

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.680 
crazy how it really worked with the look
so<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:17.370> fun<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:17.970> try<00:02:18.180> things<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.569> you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so it's fun to just try things that you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.150 
so it's fun to just try things that you
think<00:02:18.870> might<00:02:19.110> not<00:02:19.319> work<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:19.830> they'll

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
think might not work because they'll

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.920 
think might not work because they'll
often<00:02:20.400> times<00:02:20.790> maybe<00:02:21.090> they<00:02:21.300> will<00:02:21.480> work<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
often times maybe they will work and

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.420 
often times maybe they will work and
maybe<00:02:22.050> they're<00:02:22.260> amazing<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:23.340> really
