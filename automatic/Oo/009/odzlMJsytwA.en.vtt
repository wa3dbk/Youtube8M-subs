00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
all the way to the lowest and so instead

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.630 
all the way to the lowest and so instead
of<00:02:51.470> going<00:02:52.470> over<00:02:52.709> here<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.130> trying<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.400> think

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
of going over here and trying to think

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.330 
of going over here and trying to think
about<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:55.160> there's<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.250> sort<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.470> Excel<00:02:58.470> so

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
about it there's a sort and Excel so

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.910 
about it there's a sort and Excel so
here's<00:02:59.519> how<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.700> do<00:02:59.819> it<00:03:00.799> highlight<00:03:01.799> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
here's how you do it highlight the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.309 
here's how you do it highlight the
column<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.430> want<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.730> sort<00:03:02.940> by<00:03:03.319> I'm

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
column that you want to sort by I'm

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.720 
column that you want to sort by I'm
going<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.560> sort<00:03:04.709> by<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:04.920> column<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:07.489> go<00:03:08.489> to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:19.580 

data<00:03:15.049> sort<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:17.840> let's<00:03:18.840> say<00:03:18.989> descending

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
data sort and let's say descending

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.870 
data sort and let's say descending
because<00:03:19.859> we<00:03:19.950> want<00:03:20.130> from<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> highest<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
because we want from the highest to the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.620 
because we want from the highest to the
lowest<00:03:22.069> I'm<00:03:23.069> going<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.340> su<00:03:23.880> here<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.510> have

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
lowest I'm going to su here you have

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.360 
lowest I'm going to su here you have
selected<00:03:25.170> only<00:03:25.319> some<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.859> available<00:03:26.100> data

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
selected only some of the available data

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.180 
selected only some of the available data
only<00:03:27.359> select<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.049> data<00:03:28.290> will<00:03:28.440> be<00:03:28.530> sorted<00:03:28.829> what

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
only select the data will be sorted what

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.250 
only select the data will be sorted what
you<00:03:29.340> want<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.640> do<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:30.060> want<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.600> expand<00:03:31.109> the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
you want to do I want to expand the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.220 
you want to do I want to expand the
selection<00:03:31.560> which<00:03:32.130> means<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.549> want<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.940> whole

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
selection which means I want the whole

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.400 
selection which means I want the whole
the<00:03:34.230> whole<00:03:34.440> chart<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.579> be<00:03:35.609> sorted<00:03:36.060> together<00:03:36.410> so

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
the whole chart to be sorted together so

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.970 
the whole chart to be sorted together so
let's<00:03:37.620> do<00:03:37.769> that

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
let's do that

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.479 
let's do that
so<00:03:38.880> remember<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:40.859> highest<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.459> highest

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
so remember the highest the highest

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.729 
so remember the highest the highest
earner<00:03:42.060> here<00:03:42.329> or<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.660> highest<00:03:42.840> sales<00:03:43.230> was

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
earner here or the highest sales was

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.970 
earner here or the highest sales was
George<00:03:44.100> at<00:03:44.630> 86,000<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.500> lowest<00:03:46.859> was

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
George at 86,000 and the lowest was

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.900 
George at 86,000 and the lowest was
James

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
James

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.840 
James
so<00:03:48.299> if<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:49.139> see<00:03:49.319> George<00:03:49.680> at<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:49.950> top<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.549> James

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
so if we see George at the top and James

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.879 
so if we see George at the top and James
on<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> bottom<00:03:51.480> then<00:03:52.200> we'll<00:03:52.410> know<00:03:52.560> we've<00:03:52.739> done

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
on the bottom then we'll know we've done

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.210 
on the bottom then we'll know we've done
it<00:03:53.040> right<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.609> let's<00:03:53.790> do<00:03:53.910> that

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
it right so let's do that

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.720 
it right so let's do that
boom<00:03:56.840> George<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:57.959> at<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.230> top<00:03:58.430> James<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.609> at

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
boom George is at the top James is at

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.690 
boom George is at the top James is at
the<00:03:59.880> bottom<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:01.530> as<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.769> can<00:04:01.950> see<00:04:02.100> it's<00:04:02.310> sorted

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
the bottom so as you can see it's sorted

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.670 
the bottom so as you can see it's sorted
it<00:04:02.850> from<00:04:03.480> highest<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.900> lowest<00:04:03.989> 86<00:04:05.239> 78-75<00:04:06.239> 67<00:04:07.139> 54

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
it from highest to lowest 86 78-75 67 54

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.970 
it from highest to lowest 86 78-75 67 54
52<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.430> that's<00:04:08.970> how<00:04:09.120> easy<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.810> do<00:04:09.980> just

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
52 and that's how easy it is to do just

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.229 
52 and that's how easy it is to do just
that<00:04:11.100> simple<00:04:11.370> so<00:04:11.700> by<00:04:12.600> descending<00:04:13.109> boom<00:04:13.530> and

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
that simple so by descending boom and

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.089 
that simple so by descending boom and
expand<00:04:15.239> selection<00:04:15.780> because<00:04:16.590> all<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:16.979> to

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
expand selection because all you have to

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.970 
expand selection because all you have to
remember<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.669> whichever<00:04:18.599> one<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:18.959> choose

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
remember is whichever one you choose

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.580 
remember is whichever one you choose
you<00:04:20.100> have<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.900> say<00:04:22.050> expand

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
you have to you have to say expand

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.530 
you have to you have to say expand
selection<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.940> can<00:04:24.120> get<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.390> whole

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
selection so that you can get the whole

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.870 
selection so that you can get the whole
thing<00:04:24.720> now<00:04:25.290> something<00:04:26.130> else<00:04:26.280> I've<00:04:26.490> noticed

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
thing now something else I've noticed

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.850 
thing now something else I've noticed
with<00:04:26.970> Excel<00:04:27.360> if<00:04:27.570> you're<00:04:27.900> copying<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.680> pasting

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
with Excel if you're copying and pasting

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.840 
with Excel if you're copying and pasting
from<00:04:29.370> another<00:04:30.980> spreadsheet<00:04:31.980> or<00:04:32.550> from<00:04:32.730> another

from another spreadsheet or from another

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.960 
from another spreadsheet or from another
source<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:35.010> you're<00:04:35.160> moving<00:04:35.490> things<00:04:35.670> around

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
source and you're moving things around

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.330

like<00:04:36.150> you're<00:04:36.420> you're<00:04:37.790> copying<00:04:39.170> and<00:04:40.340> cutting

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
like you're you're copying and cutting

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.460 
like you're you're copying and cutting
it<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:42.200> moving<00:04:43.200> or<00:04:43.410> let's<00:04:44.100> see<00:04:45.230> let's<00:04:46.230> say<00:04:46.410> you

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
it and moving or let's see let's say you

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.610 
it and moving or let's see let's say you
take<00:04:46.800> this<00:04:47.040> column<00:04:47.370> e<00:04:47.960> you<00:04:48.960> cut<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.590> you

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
take this column e you cut it and you

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.510 
take this column e you cut it and you
put<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.430> in<00:04:50.640> G<00:04:51.680> sometimes<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:52.980> there's<00:04:53.340> an

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
put it in G sometimes that there's an

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.350 
put it in G sometimes that there's an
issue<00:04:53.670> there<00:04:54.060> with<00:04:54.960> sorting<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.880> I<00:04:56.880> don't

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
issue there with sorting and I don't

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.990 
issue there with sorting and I don't
know<00:04:57.420> why<00:04:57.600> I've<00:04:58.170> seen<00:04:58.470> it<00:04:58.650> before<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.820> best

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
know why I've seen it before so the best

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.220 
know why I've seen it before so the best
thing<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.240> do<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:00.570> just<00:05:00.720> keep<00:05:00.930> everything

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
thing to do is just keep everything

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.100 
thing to do is just keep everything
where<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:01.860> was<00:05:02.390> originally<00:05:03.390> if<00:05:03.600> you're

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
where it was originally if you're

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.050 
where it was originally if you're
starting<00:05:04.530> with<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.770> new<00:05:05.040> spreadsheet<00:05:05.460> or<00:05:05.940> if

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
starting with a new spreadsheet or if

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.150 
starting with a new spreadsheet or if
you're<00:05:06.240> copying<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.380> pasting<00:05:07.560> from<00:05:08.010> other

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
you're copying and pasting from other
