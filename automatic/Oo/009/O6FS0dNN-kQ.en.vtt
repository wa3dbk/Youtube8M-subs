not been a muumuu and Shen or yeah bloom

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.780 
not been a muumuu and Shen or yeah bloom
abortion<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.430> everyone

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
abortion they will get one but everyone

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.570 
abortion they will get one but everyone
knows<00:01:09.180> amumu<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.080> better<00:01:10.350> than<00:01:10.439> Shen<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> also

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
knows amumu is better than Shen and also

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.870 
knows amumu is better than Shen and also
you<00:01:11.880> will<00:01:12.119> always<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.630> pic<00:01:13.409> order<00:01:13.880> advantage

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you will always have pic order advantage

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910 
you will always have pic order advantage
so<00:01:15.090> basically<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.689> will<00:01:15.840> no<00:01:15.990> matter<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.890 
so basically you will no matter what you
will<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> choose<00:01:17.700> which<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.659> want

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
will get to choose which one you want

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.550 
will get to choose which one you want
amumu<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.830> probably<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.490> best<00:01:20.759> overall

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
amumu is probably the best overall

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
amumu is probably the best overall
Malphite<00:01:22.560> second<00:01:23.159> shuns<00:01:23.549> third<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
Malphite second shuns third and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:34.120 
Malphite second shuns third and
blitzcrank<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> last<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.560> let<00:01:25.770> me<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:25.860> been

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.190 

so<00:01:35.130> they're<00:01:35.880> probably<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> ban<00:01:36.630> amumu

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
so they're probably going to ban amumu

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.260 
so they're probably going to ban amumu
and<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.010> free<00:01:38.220> shine<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:38.640> our<00:01:38.729> team<00:01:39.000> if

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and that's a free shine for our team if

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.820 
and that's a free shine for our team if
they<00:01:39.479> banish<00:01:39.780> n<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> freedom<00:01:40.500> movement

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
they banish n that's a freedom movement

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.890 
they banish n that's a freedom movement
for<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.950> team<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:41.490> don't<00:01:42.000> paint<00:01:42.299> either

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
for the team if they don't paint either

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.100 
for the team if they don't paint either
one<00:01:43.440> of<00:01:43.470> those<00:01:45.049> then<00:01:47.030> they'll<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.210> Shen<00:01:48.600> but

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
one of those then they'll get Shen but

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.380 
one of those then they'll get Shen but
I'll<00:01:49.290> get<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> moment<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.159> overall<00:01:50.700> amumu<00:01:51.330> is

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
I'll get a moment and overall amumu is

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.139 
I'll get a moment and overall amumu is
definitely<00:01:52.200> better<00:01:52.440> for<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> carry<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.399> there

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
definitely better for a carry and there

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:06.800 
definitely better for a carry and there
we<00:01:54.300> go<00:02:01.970> as<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.610> have<00:02:05.810> Azrael

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.500 
that's what I do so basically what
happens<00:02:37.440> here<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:38.959> we<00:02:39.959> win<00:02:40.370> that's<00:02:41.370> simply<00:02:42.269> how

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
happens here is we win that's simply how

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:55.720 
happens here is we win that's simply how
it<00:02:43.320> how<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.130> happens<00:02:44.549> is<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.390> went<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.810> what

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:09.410 

or<00:02:56.730> support<00:03:06.530> but<00:03:07.530> uh<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:08.459> works<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.030> would<00:03:09.209> say

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
or support but uh this works I would say

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.349 
or support but uh this works I would say
a<00:03:09.810> hundred<00:03:10.200> percent<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.769> time<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:12.150> works

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
a hundred percent of time and it works

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.810 
a hundred percent of time and it works
about<00:03:12.600> seventy<00:03:13.260> percent<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.680> time<00:03:13.890> where<00:03:14.670> you

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
about seventy percent of time where you

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.060 
about seventy percent of time where you
get<00:03:15.030> only<00:03:15.359> one<00:03:15.930> champion<00:03:16.500> that's<00:03:16.709> really

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
get only one champion that's really

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.970 
get only one champion that's really
overpowered<00:03:17.640> overall<00:03:18.359> so<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.019> mean<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:19.799> that

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
overpowered overall so I mean but that

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.370 
overpowered overall so I mean but that
is<00:03:20.130> basically<00:03:20.780> seventy<00:03:21.780> percent<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.170> time

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
is basically seventy percent of time

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.380 
is basically seventy percent of time
I'll<00:03:23.010> get<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> movement<00:03:23.700> they'll<00:03:23.880> get<00:03:24.000> nothing

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
I'll get a movement they'll get nothing

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.449 
I'll get a movement they'll get nothing
another<00:03:24.840> thirty<00:03:25.170> percent<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.680> time<00:03:25.829> they'll

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
another thirty percent of time they'll

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.220 
another thirty percent of time they'll
decide<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.970> ban<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.540> I'll<00:03:27.720> star<00:03:28.109> or

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
decide to ban like I'll star or

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.699 
decide to ban like I'll star or
something<00:03:28.380> which<00:03:29.220> gives<00:03:29.730> them<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.150> free

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
something which gives them a free

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.710 
something which gives them a free
basically<00:03:31.709> allows<00:03:32.100> them<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.519> go<00:03:33.090> off<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.600> get

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
basically allows them to go off and get

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.650 
basically allows them to go off and get
Shen<00:03:34.109> or<00:03:34.350> whatever<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.799> left<00:03:35.070> off<00:03:35.630> majority<00:03:36.630> of
