mark<00:03:03.470> just<00:03:03.920> cut<00:03:04.370> some<00:03:04.700> nose<00:03:06.099> but<00:03:07.099> I<00:03:07.129> think<00:03:07.370> he

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
mark just cut some nose but I think he

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.449 
mark just cut some nose but I think he
just<00:03:07.609> peaced<00:03:07.790> out<00:03:07.970> okay<00:03:09.069> that's<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.159> big<00:03:10.280> laser

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
just peaced out okay that's a big laser

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.920 
just peaced out okay that's a big laser
you<00:03:10.609> know<00:03:10.730> how<00:03:10.879> what's<00:03:11.150> up<00:03:11.329> what<00:03:11.540> printed<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
you know how what's up what printed it

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.690 
you know how what's up what printed it
is<00:03:12.049> as<00:03:12.200> far<00:03:12.379> as<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.560> deck<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:13.069> think<00:03:13.489> it's<00:03:13.609> like

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
is as far as the deck I think it's like

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.970 
is as far as the deck I think it's like
four<00:03:13.970> by<00:03:14.090> three<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.569> then<00:03:14.690> it's<00:03:15.290> got<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> Z<00:03:15.739> of

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
four by three and then it's got a Z of

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.050 
four by three and then it's got a Z of
maybe<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:17.090> foot<00:03:17.949> so<00:03:18.949> you<00:03:19.010> can<00:03:19.250> fit<00:03:19.430> some<00:03:19.549> some

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
maybe a foot so you can fit some some

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.789 
maybe a foot so you can fit some some
pretty<00:03:20.209> good<00:03:20.359> stuff<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.750> looks<00:03:20.900> down<00:03:21.079> or<00:03:21.620> a

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
pretty good stuff that looks down or a

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.420 
pretty good stuff that looks down or a
little<00:03:22.099> bit<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.280> residue<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:24.250> they<00:03:25.250> made

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
little bit of residue on it they made

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.539 
little bit of residue on it they made
Raspberry<00:03:26.419> Pi<00:03:26.480> boxes<00:03:27.139> that<00:03:28.040> are<00:03:28.099> currently

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
Raspberry Pi boxes that are currently

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.770 
Raspberry Pi boxes that are currently
running<00:03:28.609> over<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.120> low<00:03:29.269> five

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
running over a low five

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.349 
running over a low five
oh<00:03:29.810> really<00:03:30.410> oh<00:03:30.889> there's<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.819> whole<00:03:31.970> pile<00:03:32.180> of

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
oh really oh there's a whole pile of

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.170 
oh really oh there's a whole pile of
stuff<00:03:32.540> out<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.690> wood<00:03:32.900> over<00:03:33.049> here<00:03:33.139> yeah<00:03:33.829> oh<00:03:34.519> this

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
stuff out of wood over here yeah oh this

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.240 
stuff out of wood over here yeah oh this
is<00:03:35.329> kind<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.569> did<00:03:36.139> you<00:03:36.199> see<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.440> end<00:03:36.560> line<00:03:36.709> no

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
is kind of did you see the end line no

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.920 
is kind of did you see the end line no
so<00:03:37.579> this<00:03:37.699> is<00:03:37.879> one<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.269> nicer<00:03:38.569> raspberry

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
so this is one of the nicer raspberry

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.500 
so this is one of the nicer raspberry
pies<00:03:39.139> it's<00:03:39.410> like<00:03:39.590> acrylic<00:03:40.489> acrylic<00:03:41.180> wood

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
pies it's like acrylic acrylic wood

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.819 
pies it's like acrylic acrylic wood
inlay<00:03:41.780> Oh

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
inlay Oh

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.530 
inlay Oh
so<00:03:43.400> that's<00:03:43.579> that's<00:03:43.819> wood<00:03:44.060> with<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.389> edge

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
so that's that's wood with the edge

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.750 
so that's that's wood with the edge
cutting<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.139> can<00:03:45.379> good<00:03:45.799> band<00:03:46.040> right<00:03:46.370> yeah<00:03:46.609> so

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
cutting so I can good band right yeah so

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.430 
cutting so I can good band right yeah so
this<00:03:46.879> is<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.090> curved<00:03:47.269> line<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.810> kerf

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
this is the curved line and the kerf

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.699 
this is the curved line and the kerf
bench<00:03:48.709> technique<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.819> just<00:03:50.510> laser-cut<00:03:51.260> to

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
bench technique and just laser-cut to

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.220 
bench technique and just laser-cut to
make<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:51.949> box<00:03:52.129> and<00:03:52.549> then<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.720> acrylic<00:03:54.139> and
