now another question is is going to be a

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.360 
now another question is is going to be a
reboot<00:02:13.270> or<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.540> sequel<00:02:14.350> I'm<00:02:14.680> going<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.040> predict

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
reboot or a sequel I'm going to predict

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.520 
reboot or a sequel I'm going to predict
that<00:02:15.550> if<00:02:15.760> Michael<00:02:16.120> Bay's<00:02:16.270> directing<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.140> is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
that if Michael Bay's directing it it is

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.950 
that if Michael Bay's directing it it is
going<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.920> be<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.280> sequel<00:02:18.850> if<00:02:19.120> another<00:02:19.480> director

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
going to be a sequel if another director

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.840 
going to be a sequel if another director
is<00:02:20.050> directing<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:21.310> going<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.640> be<00:02:21.820> a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
is directing it it's going to be a

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.190 
is directing it it's going to be a
reboot<00:02:22.270> because<00:02:22.690> when<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.960> really<00:02:23.170> think

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
reboot because when you really think

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200 
reboot because when you really think
about<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.620> having<00:02:24.250> Michael<00:02:24.520> Bay<00:02:24.640> director<00:02:24.670> a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
about it having Michael Bay director a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.270 
about it having Michael Bay director a
reboot<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.900> his<00:02:26.050> own<00:02:26.290> franchise<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.890> he

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
reboot to his own franchise that he

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.520 
reboot to his own franchise that he
ended<00:02:27.850> would<00:02:28.240> be<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> bit<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.840> mockery<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.260> his

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
ended would be a bit of a mockery to his

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.190 
ended would be a bit of a mockery to his
own<00:02:29.680> work<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.970> think<00:02:31.630> what's<00:02:31.840> really<00:02:31.900> going

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
own work so I think what's really going

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.420 
own work so I think what's really going
to<00:02:32.230> happen<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.800> he's<00:02:32.950> going<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.100> find<00:02:33.340> a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
to happen is that he's going to find a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.280 
to happen is that he's going to find a
way<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.610> make<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.120> fourth<00:02:34.390> one<00:02:34.570> happen<00:02:34.930> in

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
way to make the fourth one happen in

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.410 
way to make the fourth one happen in
terms<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.860> having<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.310> story<00:02:36.640> connected<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.300> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
terms of having a story connected to the

least so if you can find it get your

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.240 
least so if you can find it get your
hands<00:03:19.989> on<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.260> because<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.830> figure<00:03:21.160> is
