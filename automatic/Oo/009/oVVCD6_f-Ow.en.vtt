have about 150 children in the campus

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.009 
have about 150 children in the campus
taking<00:00:11.730> instruments<00:00:12.269> every<00:00:12.540> week<00:00:12.719> and

they're taking violins wind instruments

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.880 
they're taking violins wind instruments
and<00:00:16.820> guitar<00:00:17.820> I've<00:00:18.359> seen<00:00:18.810> such<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> benefit<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and guitar I've seen such a benefit in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.970 
and guitar I've seen such a benefit in
terms<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.490> children<00:00:21.270> being<00:00:21.810> more<00:00:22.199> creative<00:00:22.410> in

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
terms of children being more creative in

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.340 
terms of children being more creative in
the<00:00:23.100> classroom<00:00:23.580> lots<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.480> math<00:00:24.660> improvements

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the classroom lots of math improvements

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.290 
the classroom lots of math improvements
in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> last<00:00:25.769> four<00:00:25.980> years<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.279> our<00:00:26.519> campus<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
in the last four years on our campus and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.060 
in the last four years on our campus and
I<00:00:27.480> think<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.720> lot<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.170> has<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.830> with

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
I think a lot of that has to do with

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.160 
I think a lot of that has to do with
just<00:00:29.429> learning<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.300> play<00:00:30.449> an<00:00:30.539> instrument

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
just learning to play an instrument

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.830 
just learning to play an instrument
learning<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> read<00:00:32.279> notes<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.480> whole<00:00:33.510> issue

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
learning to read notes the whole issue

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.490 
learning to read notes the whole issue
of<00:00:33.989> tempo<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.320> community<00:00:37.320> our

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
of tempo and time and a community our

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.319 
of tempo and time and a community our
students<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.340> talented<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.210> they're

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
community is to really bring all of the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819 
community is to really bring all of the
arts<00:00:56.730> into<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.449> core<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.050> curriculum<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
arts into the core of the curriculum and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.729 
arts into the core of the curriculum and
when<00:00:59.609> some<00:00:59.940> people<00:01:00.210> ask<00:01:00.449> well<00:01:00.750> how<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
when some people ask well how do you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.670 
when some people ask well how do you
make<00:01:01.920> sure<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.730> teachers<00:01:03.140> don't<00:01:04.140> feel<00:01:04.409> like

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
make sure that teachers don't feel like

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.109 
make sure that teachers don't feel like
they<00:01:04.890> can't<00:01:05.159> teach<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.580> core<00:01:05.790> curriculum

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
they can't teach the core curriculum

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.760 
they can't teach the core curriculum
because<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.630> arts<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.110> taking<00:01:07.439> time<00:01:07.619> away

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
because the arts are taking time away

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.560 
because the arts are taking time away
from<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.340> core<00:01:08.520> curriculum<00:01:08.820> we're<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:09.479> at

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
from the core curriculum we're here at

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.270 
from the core curriculum we're here at
community<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> arts<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.770> core<00:01:11.040> and

because we really see arts that the key

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.350 
because we really see arts that the key
to<00:01:18.630> learning<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.670> vehicle<00:01:21.119> for
