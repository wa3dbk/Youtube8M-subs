00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
crafters library in today's video I'm

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.160 
crafters library in today's video I'm
going<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.910> show<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.179> how<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> technique

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
going to show you how to do a technique

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.340 
going to show you how to do a technique
I<00:00:16.289> created<00:00:16.650> which<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.310> call<00:00:17.520> faux<00:00:17.910> glassine<00:00:18.480> now

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
I created which I call faux glassine now

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.050 
I created which I call faux glassine now
the<00:00:19.439> reason<00:00:19.740> they<00:00:19.830> call<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.640> simply

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the reason they call it that is simply

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.300 
the reason they call it that is simply
because<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.900> finished<00:00:22.230> product<00:00:22.680> has<00:00:23.070> some

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
because the finished product has some

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.390 
because the finished product has some
similarities<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:23.970> glossy<00:00:24.949> you<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.279> them

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
similarities to glossy you can see them

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.519 
similarities to glossy you can see them
here<00:00:26.670> now<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.390> actually<00:00:27.630> created<00:00:28.199> two

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
here now I actually created two

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.349 
here now I actually created two
different<00:00:28.920> variations<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.880> technique

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
different variations to this technique

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.840 
different variations to this technique
the<00:00:31.019> first<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.009> simple<00:00:32.340> full<00:00:32.610> glass

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the first is just a simple full glass

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.479 
the first is just a simple full glass
scene<00:00:33.149> which<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.160> piece

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
scene which you can see in this piece

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.930 
scene which you can see in this piece
here<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.930> has<00:00:37.200> some<00:00:37.559> similarities<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.550> glass

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
here it has some similarities to glass

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.670 
here it has some similarities to glass
scene<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.600> somewhat<00:00:39.930> transparent

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
scene and that it's somewhat transparent

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.319 
scene and that it's somewhat transparent
and<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.340> similarities<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and some similarities to like a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.110 
and some similarities to like a
cardstock<00:00:42.960> vellum<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:44.879> how

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
cardstock vellum and you can see how

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.540 
cardstock vellum and you can see how
I've<00:00:45.719> used<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.680> project<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I've used it in this project here to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.630 
I've used it in this project here to
create<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.829> semi-transparent<00:00:49.829> pocket<00:00:50.430> into

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
create a semi-transparent pocket into

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.779 
create a semi-transparent pocket into
which<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.239> slide<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.780> tag<00:00:52.730> now<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
which I can slide this tag now the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.340 
which I can slide this tag now the
second<00:00:54.210> variation<00:00:54.420> which<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> show

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
second variation which I'm going to show

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
second variation which I'm going to show
you<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.829> separate<00:00:56.219> video<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.149> full

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you in a separate video is a full

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.439 
you in a separate video is a full
marbled<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.170> stained<00:00:58.500> glass<00:00:58.829> scene<00:00:59.300> now<00:01:00.300> this

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
marbled and stained glass scene now this

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
marbled and stained glass scene now this
is<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.020> piece<00:01:01.289> looks<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:01.859> before<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
is what the piece looks like before it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.880 
is what the piece looks like before it
actually<00:01:02.609> gets<00:01:02.969> steamed<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.260> compare<00:01:04.739> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
actually gets steamed if you compare it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.940 
actually gets steamed if you compare it
to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.400> glass<00:01:06.060> scene<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.810> original<00:01:07.740> full

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to the glass scene the original full

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.130 
to the glass scene the original full
glass<00:01:08.159> scene<00:01:08.430> piece<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.270> see<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.990> it's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
glass scene piece you can see that it's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.980 
glass scene piece you can see that it's
much<00:01:10.350> more<00:01:10.970> transparent<00:01:11.970> than<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> first

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
much more transparent than the first

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.920 
much more transparent than the first
piece<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.760> also<00:01:14.970> much<00:01:15.270> more<00:01:15.509> highly

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
piece and it's also much more highly

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.450 
piece and it's also much more highly
wrinkled<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.409> that's<00:01:16.590> part<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> process

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
wrinkled and that's part of the process

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.859 
wrinkled and that's part of the process
of<00:01:17.580> creating<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.090> foam<00:01:18.330> marbled<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
of creating this foam marbled and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
of creating this foam marbled and
stained<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.490> an<00:01:20.700> example

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
stained and here you can see an example

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.700 
stained and here you can see an example
of<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.689> looks<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:22.140> once<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.560> been

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
of what it looks like once it's been

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.490 
of what it looks like once it's been
stained<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.369> then<00:01:23.490> applied<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> project<00:01:24.600> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
stained and then applied to a project so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
stained and then applied to a project so

else you're going to let it air dry it's

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.819 
else you're going to let it air dry it's
also<00:02:03.060> good<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:04.350> you're<00:02:04.439> working<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.740> a

bought this box of a hundred sheets I
must<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.330> bought<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.629> about<00:02:23.900> six<00:02:24.110> years

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
must have bought this about six years

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.520 
must have bought this about six years
ago<00:02:24.620> maybe<00:02:24.830> even<00:02:24.950> more<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:26.480> as<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.900> can<00:02:27.050> see<00:02:27.260> I

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
box of a hundred now one of the things

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.000 
box of a hundred now one of the things
that's<00:02:32.720> really<00:02:32.930> important<00:02:33.530> when<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:33.980> are

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
that's really important when you are

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.890 
that's really important when you are
doing<00:02:34.519> this<00:02:34.640> technique<00:02:34.910> is<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.360> do<00:02:35.599> want

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
doing this technique is you do want

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.550 
doing this technique is you do want
something<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.780> heat<00:02:38.780> resistant<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:39.500> if

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
something that is heat resistant so if

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.320 
something that is heat resistant so if
you<00:02:39.650> look<00:02:39.769> at<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.010> one<00:02:40.280> here<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.790> says<00:02:41.120> it's

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
you look at this one here it says it's

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.600 
you look at this one here it says it's
for<00:02:41.690> copiers<00:02:42.260> now<00:02:42.440> paper<00:02:42.650> copiers<00:02:43.160> heat<00:02:43.370> up<00:02:43.489> to

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
for copiers now paper copiers heat up to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.759 
for copiers now paper copiers heat up to
a<00:02:43.670> high<00:02:43.819> temperature<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:45.170> these

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
a high temperature so this these

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.640 
a high temperature so this these
transparencies<00:02:46.459> can<00:02:46.970> withstand<00:02:47.290> heat<00:02:48.290> if

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
transparencies can withstand heat if

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.729 
transparencies can withstand heat if
you're<00:02:49.099> using<00:02:49.660> an<00:02:50.660> acetate<00:02:51.290> sheet<00:02:51.590> or

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
you're using an acetate sheet or

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.640 
you're using an acetate sheet or
transparency<00:02:52.400> from<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.209> different<00:02:53.930> source<00:02:54.349> and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
transparency from a different source and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.250 
transparency from a different source and
they<00:02:54.709> don't<00:02:54.890> state<00:02:55.250> if<00:02:55.579> it's<00:02:56.200> resistant<00:02:57.200> to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
they don't state if it's resistant to

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.600 
they don't state if it's resistant to
heat<00:02:57.440> or<00:02:57.530> not<00:02:57.650> then<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:57.920> may<00:02:58.069> want<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.370> take<00:02:58.579> a

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
heat or not then you may want to take a

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.130 
heat or not then you may want to take a
small<00:02:58.880> piece<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.269> just<00:02:59.420> test<00:02:59.660> it<00:02:59.810> with<00:02:59.959> your

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
small piece and just test it with your

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.020 
small piece and just test it with your
heat<00:03:00.319> tool<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.620> make<00:03:01.340> sure<00:03:01.519> that<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.760> doesn't

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
heat tool and make sure that it doesn't

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.850 
heat tool and make sure that it doesn't
melt<00:03:02.180> you're<00:03:02.450> working<00:03:02.810> with<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.110> if<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.680> does

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
melt you're working with it if it does

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.380 
melt you're working with it if it does
melt<00:03:04.160> then<00:03:04.519> you're<00:03:04.640> just<00:03:04.760> going<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.000> only<00:03:05.150> edge

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
melt then you're just going to only edge

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.850 
melt then you're just going to only edge
any<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.930> heating<00:03:06.260> aspects<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.769> you're

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
any of the heating aspects and you're

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.620 
any of the heating aspects and you're
gonna<00:03:06.950> have<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.220> do<00:03:07.430> things<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.150> slower<00:03:08.420> way

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
gonna have to do things the slower way

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.900 
gonna have to do things the slower way
which<00:03:09.410> still<00:03:09.650> works<00:03:09.680> which<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.610> letting<00:03:10.819> it

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
which still works which is letting it

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.620 
which still works which is letting it
air<00:03:11.090> dry<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.940> first<00:03:14.180> thing<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.450> I'm

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
air dry so the first thing that I'm

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.900 
air dry so the first thing that I'm
going<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.900> do<00:03:15.200> as<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.709> can<00:03:15.860> see<00:03:16.040> here<00:03:16.430> my

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
going to do as you can see here my

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.069 
going to do as you can see here my
tissue<00:03:17.209> paper<00:03:17.329> is<00:03:17.959> quite<00:03:18.709> wrinkled<00:03:19.639> up<00:03:20.079> now

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
tissue paper is quite wrinkled up now

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.349 
tissue paper is quite wrinkled up now
for<00:03:21.139> this<00:03:21.410> technique<00:03:21.859> for<00:03:22.010> full<00:03:22.280> glassine<00:03:22.760> you

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
for this technique for full glassine you

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.210 
for this technique for full glassine you
don't<00:03:23.600> want<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.019> wrinkles<00:03:24.350> this<00:03:24.470> has<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:24.859> be<00:03:25.010> a

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
don't want the wrinkles this has to be a

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.280 
don't want the wrinkles this has to be a
nice<00:03:25.700> smooth<00:03:26.150> piece<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.660> tissue<00:03:26.870> paper<00:03:26.959> you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
nice smooth piece of tissue paper you

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.420 
nice smooth piece of tissue paper you
want<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.500> eliminate<00:03:27.680> as<00:03:28.040> many<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
want to eliminate as many of the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.240 
want to eliminate as many of the
wrinkles<00:03:28.790> as<00:03:28.910> possible<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.900> i<00:03:29.930> have<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.650> craft

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
wrinkles as possible so i have a craft

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.300 
wrinkles as possible so i have a craft
iron<00:03:31.609> for<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.209> can<00:03:32.480> use<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:33.819> regular<00:03:34.819> iron

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
iron for that you can use a regular iron

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.979 
iron for that you can use a regular iron
so<00:03:37.310> once<00:03:37.549> you've<00:03:37.730> ironed<00:03:38.000> out<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.359> wrinkles

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
so once you've ironed out the wrinkles

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.379 
so once you've ironed out the wrinkles
as<00:03:39.200> best<00:03:39.590> as<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.769> can<00:03:39.889> you're<00:03:40.790> now<00:03:40.940> going<00:03:41.209> to

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
as best as you can you're now going to

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.120 
as best as you can you're now going to
need<00:03:41.540> your<00:03:41.930> transparency<00:03:42.739> sheet<00:03:44.859> so<00:03:45.859> very

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
tool focused in any one area for too too

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.909 
tool focused in any one area for too too
long<00:06:31.910> and<00:06:32.229> then<00:06:33.229> once<00:06:33.500> your<00:06:33.949> tissue<00:06:34.610> is<00:06:34.759> dry

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
long and then once your tissue is dry

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.129 
long and then once your tissue is dry
you're<00:06:36.919> then<00:06:37.069> going<00:06:37.310> to<00:06:37.400> take<00:06:37.840> another<00:06:38.840> layer

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
you're then going to take another layer

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.809 
you're then going to take another layer
of<00:06:39.289> this<00:06:39.440> medium<00:06:39.860> and<00:06:40.479> brush<00:06:41.479> it<00:06:41.660> on<00:06:41.810> top<00:06:42.139> and

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
of this medium and brush it on top and

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.580 
of this medium and brush it on top and
you<00:06:43.819> want<00:06:44.090> it<00:06:44.300> to<00:06:44.330> be<00:06:44.539> a<00:06:44.569> fairly<00:06:45.020> thick<00:06:45.380> layer

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
you want it to be a fairly thick layer

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.890 
you want it to be a fairly thick layer
because<00:06:46.250> you<00:06:46.370> really<00:06:46.849> want<00:06:46.880> it<00:06:47.150> to<00:06:47.180> soak<00:06:47.569> into

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
because you really want it to soak into

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:55.089 
because you really want it to soak into
the<00:06:48.470> tissue<00:06:53.319> then<00:06:54.319> once<00:06:54.590> you<00:06:54.800> have<00:06:55.069> your

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
the tissue then once you have your

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.980 
the tissue then once you have your
tissue<00:06:55.580> thoroughly<00:06:56.240> coated<00:06:56.599> in<00:06:57.080> the<00:06:57.650> medium

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
tissue thoroughly coated in the medium

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.089 
tissue thoroughly coated in the medium
I'm<00:06:59.990> just<00:07:00.289> sort<00:07:00.470> of<00:07:00.560> smoothing<00:07:00.889> out<00:07:01.039> my

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:01.099 
I'm just sort of smoothing out my

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:06.040 
I'm just sort of smoothing out my
brushstrokes<00:07:02.050> and<00:07:03.909> then<00:07:04.909> you<00:07:05.389> want<00:07:05.630> to<00:07:05.690> heat

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
brushstrokes and then you want to heat

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.200 
brushstrokes and then you want to heat
this<00:07:06.319> until<00:07:06.919> it<00:07:07.039> dries<00:07:07.310> or<00:07:07.610> set<00:07:07.819> it<00:07:07.909> aside<00:07:08.000> to

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
this until it dries or set it aside to

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.270 
this until it dries or set it aside to
dry<00:07:08.479> overnight

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.950 

so<00:07:12.280> once<00:07:12.490> your<00:07:12.669> piece<00:07:12.910> is<00:07:13.150> thoroughly<00:07:13.539> drawing

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
so once your piece is thoroughly drawing

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.170 
so once your piece is thoroughly drawing
you<00:07:14.500> can<00:07:14.680> now<00:07:14.800> go<00:07:15.009> ahead<00:07:15.039> and<00:07:15.490> flip<00:07:15.880> it<00:07:16.060> over

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
you can now go ahead and flip it over

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.080 
you can now go ahead and flip it over
and<00:07:16.539> then<00:07:17.440> just<00:07:17.710> cut<00:07:18.009> off<00:07:18.690> the<00:07:19.690> tissue<00:07:20.020> paper

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
and then just cut off the tissue paper

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:30.420 
and then just cut off the tissue paper
that<00:07:22.090> is<00:07:22.300> along<00:07:22.720> the<00:07:22.780> edges<00:07:28.410> and<00:07:29.410> there<00:07:30.340> you

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:30.430 
that is along the edges and there you

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.159 
that is along the edges and there you
can<00:07:30.580> see<00:07:30.789> what<00:07:31.000> it<00:07:31.090> looks<00:07:31.270> like<00:07:31.360> on<00:07:31.660> this<00:07:31.900> side

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.169 
can see what it looks like on this side

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.110 
can see what it looks like on this side
this<00:07:32.380> is<00:07:32.440> the<00:07:32.770> transparency<00:07:33.340> side<00:07:33.639> facing

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
this is the transparency side facing

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.840 
this is the transparency side facing
upwards<00:07:34.539> but<00:07:35.110> when<00:07:35.229> you<00:07:35.350> flip<00:07:35.620> it<00:07:35.740> over<00:07:35.949> now<00:07:36.610> on

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:36.850 
upwards but when you flip it over now on

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.529 
upwards but when you flip it over now on
this<00:07:37.060> side<00:07:37.330> you<00:07:37.660> have<00:07:38.039> what<00:07:39.039> looks<00:07:39.310> like<00:07:39.539> the

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:40.539 
this side you have what looks like the

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:42.540 
this side you have what looks like the
glassine<00:07:41.080> paper<00:07:41.199> almost<00:07:41.889> is<00:07:42.070> just<00:07:42.250> a<00:07:42.340> little

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:42.550 
glassine paper almost is just a little

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.520 
glassine paper almost is just a little
bit<00:07:42.699> more<00:07:42.970> durable<00:07:43.780> and<00:07:44.050> doesn't<00:07:44.320> cling

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530 
bit more durable and doesn't cling

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.170 
bit more durable and doesn't cling
crinkle<00:07:45.039> this<00:07:45.250> or<00:07:45.520> make<00:07:45.669> the<00:07:45.789> same<00:07:45.940> kind<00:07:46.150> of

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:46.180 
crinkle this or make the same kind of

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.879 
crinkle this or make the same kind of
crinkly<00:07:46.419> sounds<00:07:46.840> as<00:07:46.930> glassy<00:07:47.320> and<00:07:47.349> paper<00:07:47.620> does

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:47.889 
crinkly sounds as glassy and paper does

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:50.550 
crinkly sounds as glassy and paper does
but<00:07:48.190> it<00:07:48.340> has<00:07:48.520> the<00:07:48.699> very<00:07:48.970> very<00:07:49.810> similar<00:07:50.169> effect

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 
but it has the very very similar effect

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.469 
but it has the very very similar effect
so<00:07:50.740> you<00:07:50.830> can<00:07:50.979> see<00:07:51.240> that<00:07:52.240> it's<00:07:52.360> quite

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 
so you can see that it's quite

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:54.240 
so you can see that it's quite
transparent<00:07:52.960> so<00:07:53.560> there<00:07:53.710> you<00:07:53.800> have<00:07:53.830> it<00:07:53.979> a<00:07:54.220> very

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.250 
transparent so there you have it a very

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.460 
transparent so there you have it a very
fun<00:07:54.639> technique<00:07:55.090> to<00:07:55.300> create<00:07:55.449> a<00:07:55.660> full<00:07:56.020> glassy

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:56.470 
fun technique to create a full glassy

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.100 
fun technique to create a full glassy
look<00:07:56.710> so<00:07:57.639> here<00:07:57.849> you<00:07:57.940> can<00:07:58.120> see<00:07:58.330> an<00:07:58.419> example<00:07:58.780> of

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.110 
look so here you can see an example of

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.469 
look so here you can see an example of
how<00:07:59.380> I've<00:07:59.590> used<00:07:59.889> my<00:08:00.099> full<00:08:00.310> glassine<00:08:00.820> paper<00:08:00.849> I

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 
how I've used my full glassine paper I

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:05.129 
how I've used my full glassine paper I
cut<00:08:02.169> out<00:08:02.349> a<00:08:02.770> piece<00:08:03.250> to<00:08:03.550> create<00:08:03.729> a<00:08:03.940> pocket<00:08:04.419> for

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:05.139 
cut out a piece to create a pocket for

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:07.650 
cut out a piece to create a pocket for
this<00:08:05.289> tag<00:08:05.650> on<00:08:05.949> the<00:08:06.099> front<00:08:06.340> of<00:08:06.430> my<00:08:06.580> card<00:08:06.940> I<00:08:07.180> then

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:07.660 
this tag on the front of my card I then

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.710 
this tag on the front of my card I then
stitched<00:08:08.050> it<00:08:08.320> to<00:08:08.650> my<00:08:08.889> designer<00:08:09.220> paper<00:08:09.580> and<00:08:10.060> I

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 
stitched it to my designer paper and I

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.139 
stitched it to my designer paper and I
lightly
