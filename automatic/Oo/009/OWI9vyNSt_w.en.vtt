00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
we're just going to show you what we're

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.960 
we're just going to show you what we're
gonna<00:00:19.140> show<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.500> how<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> build<00:00:19.970> basically

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
gonna show you how to build basically

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.849 
gonna show you how to build basically
these<00:00:21.240> are<00:00:21.420> all<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:21.990> these<00:00:22.109> women<00:00:22.470> these

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
these are all what are these women these

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.720 
these are all what are these women these
a<00:00:22.920> geothermal<00:00:23.900> you<00:00:24.900> know<00:00:24.960> yeah<00:00:25.680> all<00:00:26.310> right

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
a geothermal you know yeah all right

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.200 
a geothermal you know yeah all right
which<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:28.039> full<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.160> lava<00:00:29.460> cells<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.060> them

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
which I have full of lava cells in them

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.060 
which I have full of lava cells in them
okay<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.840> basically<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.380> goes<00:00:31.560> down<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
okay and basically that goes down and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.130 
okay and basically that goes down and
into<00:00:32.430> our<00:00:32.550> power<00:00:32.759> source<00:00:33.000> which<00:00:33.210> holds<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.930> lot

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
into our power source which holds a lot

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.420 
into our power source which holds a lot
of<00:00:34.170> power<00:00:34.410> into<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:36.149> high<00:00:37.160> transport<00:00:38.160> egde

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
of power into a high transport egde

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.000 
of power into a high transport egde
which<00:00:38.790> turns<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.270> medium<00:00:39.750> medium<00:00:40.290> sorry<00:00:40.500> medium

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
which turns a medium medium sorry medium

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
which turns a medium medium sorry medium
and<00:00:41.250> then<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> mediums<00:00:42.270> came<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.750> MFE

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and then the mediums came to an MFE

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.290 
and then the mediums came to an MFE
which<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.440> another<00:00:43.710> power<00:00:43.950> supply<00:00:44.160> where<00:00:44.610> we

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
which is another power supply where we

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.790 
which is another power supply where we
have<00:00:45.450> more<00:00:45.629> power<00:00:45.780> stored<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.440> also<00:00:46.680> we

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
have more power stored and also we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.010 
have more power stored and also we
charge<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.340> their<00:00:47.520> stuff<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> low<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
charge all their stuff in to a low and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.069 
charge all their stuff in to a low and
all<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.039> our<00:00:50.250> master<00:00:51.149> aiders<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.449> furnaces

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
all to our master aiders and furnaces

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.529 
all to our master aiders and furnaces
and<00:00:52.500> everything<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.460> you'll<00:00:54.329> build

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and everything like that so you'll build

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.270 
and everything like that so you'll build
up<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.930> our<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> basically<00:00:55.920> everything

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
up so our here is basically everything

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.410 
up so our here is basically everything
you're<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.760> need<00:00:56.910> you're<00:00:57.059> gonna<00:00:57.180> need<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you're going to need you're gonna need a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.729 
you're going to need you're gonna need a

you be a bitch minecraft and then your
energy<00:03:10.069> Clint<00:03:10.810> collector<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.219> then<00:03:13.219> you<00:03:13.400> want

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
energy Clint collector and then you want

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.030 
energy Clint collector and then you want
to<00:03:13.579> get<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> lot<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.209> sell<00:03:14.590> place<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.859> in

there<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:18.319> better<00:03:18.739> energy<00:03:19.040> tip

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
there and the better energy tip

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.539 
there and the better energy tip
collector<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.659> have<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.469> better<00:03:21.680> energy<00:03:22.250> yet

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
collector you have the better energy yet

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.280 
collector you have the better energy yet
pretty<00:03:23.419> much<00:03:23.599> basically<00:03:24.379> get<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.010> redstone<00:03:25.340> one

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
pretty much basically get a redstone one

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.509 
pretty much basically get a redstone one
a<00:03:27.519> red<00:03:28.519> man<00:03:28.730> red<00:03:28.879> matter<00:03:29.269> one<00:03:29.480> sorry<00:03:30.069> so<00:03:31.069> which

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
a red man red matter one sorry so which

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.780 
a red man red matter one sorry so which
will<00:03:31.639> make<00:03:31.879> it<00:03:31.909> fast<00:03:32.569> I<00:03:32.780> like<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.319> yeah<00:03:33.790> and

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
timer down and that will they should

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.129 
timer down and that will they should
pump<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.819> lava<00:03:41.030> cells<00:03:41.299> into<00:03:42.370> not<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:44.139> into

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
pump the lava cells into not that into

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:53.199 
pump the lava cells into not that into
there<00:03:48.219> as<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:50.569> can<00:03:50.719> see<00:03:51.760> it's<00:03:52.760> starting<00:03:53.030> to

there as you can see it's starting to

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.469 
there as you can see it's starting to
get<00:03:53.329> power<00:03:53.569> there<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.290> FSU's<00:03:55.359> speeding<00:03:56.359> up

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:56.479 
get power there and FSU's speeding up

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.530 
get power there and FSU's speeding up
powering<00:03:57.229> up<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:58.060> our<00:03:59.060> furnaces<00:03:59.810> have<00:04:00.049> power

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
powering up and our furnaces have power

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.640 
powering up and our furnaces have power
that's<00:04:02.540> pretty<00:04:03.290> much<00:04:03.500> how<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.310> get<00:04:05.650> unlimited
