 Yes It Is Hello I am the ice today 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.500
 I would like to make a review of the visit , but it's not like an animal lightning, even though it's a lion 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:25.119
 It is a sound without five points of people who put up 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.119
 It is here First of all the main Let's take a look from Naa c yesterday also is 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.880
 Mission controller is designed to make it easy to operate multiple applications 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.260
 It is a function 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:39.220
 So I'm working with multiple applications open in a small screen notebook 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.000
 Even in this way to work smoothly with fish on control 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.490
 It has become 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.290
 Also easy to operate because it was also joined the multi-touch absolute Come functions 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.760
 Quickly go to the app you are looking for using the multi-touch gesture as well 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.350
 It became accessible 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:03.030
 airdrop is a new feature that lets you pass files to people nearby 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.040
 You will be rewarded and drop and drag the file from the drop if put that person is even close 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.450
 I can give it to that person 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 Not sent to the other party as another usb memory or e-mail attachment because 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.630
 Even files can be delivered easily 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.020
 I do not know what I would never do before 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.909
 John finally added full screen mode 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.060
 Safari even if you press the full screen button on the upper right 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.550
 Nail too 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:36.320
 And iphoto can all be enjoyed in full screen mode 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.770

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:57.390
 The mail in the fourth has changed the layout greatly 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.360
 Read messages and lists at the same time using the laptop's widescreen 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.909
 It is now possible 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:08.890
 ios No simple design is not cool 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.080
 icloud is me and my father also easy when other devices you have 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.330
 This is a new feature 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:20.000
 I do not have a cake that I collected account registration, but if it is only with other devices 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.890
 The link is also easy with this 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.370
 And this is really a little bit but I was personally happy update 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.700

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.840
 Quick Look has been really well improvements in Lion 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.990
 The size of the window that can be automatically changed also according to the size of the image 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.010
 Know that you are looking at Quick Look even if you are working in windows other than binder 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:47.230
 Has disappeared 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.739
 You may think that there is nothing like it, but this will allow you to work more efficiently 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.739
 became 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.819
 There are more than 50 items in all 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:05.069

 Last but not least this update on os 10 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.050
 It felt like I was conscious of only notebook users 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:24.930
 So for notebook users you should upgrade 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.930
 Others are 8 ways 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.450
