00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.520 
the device so that's how much you will
see<00:02:42.519> but<00:02:42.700> i'll<00:02:43.209> show<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:43.689> with<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.230> device

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
see but i'll show you with the device

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.390 
see but i'll show you with the device
later<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:46.690> we<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.170> course<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.560> psu<00:02:47.950> cable

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
later then we have of course a psu cable

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.039 
later then we have of course a psu cable
and<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.629> huge<00:02:50.049> psu<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:52.000> i<00:02:52.120> compare<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
and a huge psu if i compare this to the

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.460 
and a huge psu if i compare this to the
samsung<00:02:56.049> n150<00:02:57.040> for<00:02:57.519> example<00:02:58.000> i<00:02:58.150> mean<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.349> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
samsung n150 for example i mean to the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.210 
samsung n150 for example i mean to the
psu<00:02:59.920> of<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.159> n150<00:03:00.819> then<00:03:01.689> you<00:03:01.900> will<00:03:02.049> see<00:03:02.290> the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
psu of the n150 then you will see the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.369 
psu of the n150 then you will see the
size<00:03:03.489> difference<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:04.269> could<00:03:04.599> be<00:03:04.780> like<00:03:04.989> twice

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
size difference it could be like twice

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.420 
size difference it could be like twice
as<00:03:05.590> big<00:03:05.829> it's<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.810> height<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.319> has<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.620> few

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
as big it's the height it has a few

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.390 
as big it's the height it has a few
millimeters<00:03:10.260> also<00:03:11.260> plus<00:03:11.620> but<00:03:11.980> with<00:03:12.220> the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
millimeters also plus but with the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.990 
millimeters also plus but with the
samsung<00:03:12.879> n150<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:14.290> get<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.560> huge<00:03:15.220> end<00:03:15.609> like

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
samsung n150 you get a huge end like

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.069 
samsung n150 you get a huge end like
this<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.629> for<00:03:16.870> their<00:03:18.419> for<00:03:19.419> this<00:03:19.540> median<00:03:19.959> you

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
this and for their for this median you

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.009 
this and for their for this median you
only<00:03:20.260> have<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> small<00:03:21.480> kind<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.569> cable<00:03:22.870> like

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
only have a small kind of cable like

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.819 
only have a small kind of cable like
this<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:23.500> that's<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:24.010> plus<00:03:24.489> but<00:03:25.349> why<00:03:26.349> do<00:03:26.410> i<00:03:26.769> need

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
this so that's a plus but why do i need

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.439 
this so that's a plus but why do i need
such<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.250> big<00:03:27.400> psu<00:03:29.159> then<00:03:30.159> let's<00:03:30.699> see<00:03:30.940> we<00:03:31.239> have

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
such a big psu then let's see we have

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.220 
such a big psu then let's see we have
some<00:03:31.900> caution<00:03:32.409> papers<00:03:32.889> and<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.579> course

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
some caution papers and of course

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.759 
some caution papers and of course
finally<00:03:35.230> there<00:03:36.930> titanium<00:03:37.930> device<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.900> that's

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
finally there titanium device so that's

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.949 
finally there titanium device so that's
it<00:03:41.979> from<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.340> box<00:03:42.519> it's<00:03:43.060> empty<00:03:45.750> no<00:03:46.750> other

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
it from the box it's empty no other

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.469 
it from the box it's empty no other
extras<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.949> we<00:03:48.220> have<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.669> immediate<00:03:49.060> accalia

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
extras so we have the immediate accalia

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:54.000 
extras so we have the immediate accalia
e<00:03:49.780> 12<00:03:50.409> 22<00:03:51.040> here<00:03:51.959> titanium<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.440> is<00:03:53.620> actually

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
e 12 22 here titanium this is actually

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.469 
e 12 22 here titanium this is actually
plastic<00:03:54.579> so<00:03:56.819> titanium<00:03:57.819> is<00:03:57.879> only<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.209> color

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
plastic so titanium is only the color

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.349 
plastic so titanium is only the color
you<00:03:58.720> can<00:03:58.930> see<00:03:59.260> my<00:03:59.949> fingerprints<00:04:00.729> a<00:04:00.849> little<00:04:01.209> bit

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
you can see my fingerprints a little bit

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.530 
you can see my fingerprints a little bit
maybe<00:04:01.629> in<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.489> light<00:04:03.489> but<00:04:03.940> it's<00:04:04.510> not<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:06.540> bad

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
maybe in the light but it's not that bad

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.409 
maybe in the light but it's not that bad
with<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.139> black<00:04:08.349> version<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.799> probably<00:04:09.419> more

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
with the black version is probably more

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.659 
with the black version is probably more
viewable<00:04:10.989> but<00:04:11.379> this<00:04:11.620> diesel<00:04:11.889> only<00:04:12.280> two<00:04:12.430> colors

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
viewable but this diesel only two colors

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.659 
viewable but this diesel only two colors
so<00:04:13.030> it's<00:04:13.239> only<00:04:13.599> an<00:04:13.780> titanium<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.709> black

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
so it's only an titanium and black

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.879 
so it's only an titanium and black
available<00:04:16.030> on<00:04:16.449> this<00:04:16.659> side<00:04:16.930> we<00:04:16.959> have<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.320> card

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
produce only the big long ones then we

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.850 
produce only the big long ones then we

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.730 
off button here feels pretty good a
little<00:04:45.280> bit<00:04:45.460> not<00:04:46.270> too<00:04:46.300> soft<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:47.139> it<00:04:47.409> doesn't

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
little bit not too soft but it doesn't

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.029 
little bit not too soft but it doesn't
give<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:47.889> too<00:04:48.009> much<00:04:48.370> space<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.360> press<00:04:50.110> it<00:04:50.349> on

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
give you too much space to press it on

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.309 
give you too much space to press it on
the<00:04:51.219> back<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:51.639> see<00:04:51.819> we<00:04:52.180> don't<00:04:52.449> have<00:04:52.930> any

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
the back you can see we don't have any

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.200 
the back you can see we don't have any
indication<00:04:54.129> for<00:04:55.000> future<00:04:55.599> and<00:04:55.900> 3g<00:04:56.710> module<00:04:57.669> but

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
indication for future and 3g module but

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.939 
indication for future and 3g module but
the<00:04:58.539> battery<00:04:58.750> will<00:04:59.139> fit<00:04:59.439> pretty<00:04:59.680> good

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
the battery will fit pretty good

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.159 
the battery will fit pretty good
probably<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.699> on<00:05:01.419> the<00:05:01.539> other<00:05:01.659> side<00:05:01.960> we<00:05:02.110> have
