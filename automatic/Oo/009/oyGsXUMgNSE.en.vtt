00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.670

 Well, we have it here 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.599
 to one side and we're taking away the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.599
 lacito then we can already take the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.599
 top 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.520
 first of all in the east ipod 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.520
 pretty light 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.220
 in california something that comes in all 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.640
 their products 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.770
 and then 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.720
 an information of the quick average 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.040
 basic to start 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.460
 I was in Spanish and English in my case 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.170
 product information 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.170
 a single acoustics 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.340
 is the one that comes 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.340
 they can go back in 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.820
 ok there are 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:31.350
 what else we have inside we have very well 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.350
 organized and accommodated their hearing aids 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.740
 this as you can see in this observe 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.140
 they are the old version as they 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:45.410
 he commented are not the ipods 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.650
 likewise work and it sounds good 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.340
 and finally 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.090
 this little horse that is quite peculiar 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.840
 because to charge the ipod 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:06.030
 can be connected in the same part as 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.030
 connects the headphones as you can see 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.710
 these are we going to say more 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.640
 and this is the charger you can observe 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.470
 that this has 33 strips on the charger 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.260
 and in the change the other that are the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.180
 Hearing aids have only 2 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.180
 and both can be connected 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.919
 to the boss jack team 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.970
 up with ease 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:50.000
 and now we are going to wait for this ipod 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:52.900
 come here another clip a clip the poplars 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.900
 the listing 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.740
 plastic 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:05.870
 here you can watch the ipod shuffle 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.870
 let's see an east 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.710
 a quick product guide together in the 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.650
 front face but it has no screen 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:21.800
 the plus / minus buttons this for 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:26.120
 change the song ipauss play 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.270
 and up has the port for 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.230
 hearing aids and to charge 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.700
 this button is for the voice over 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:38.430
 and this one on 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.520
 the options of off 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:46.530
 that has been turned off 3056 play 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:49.430
 songs this normal or be followed and 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.750
 On the other hand, the last option is 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.729
 randomly hence his name paul 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.599
 chiasson means random 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.599
 we can 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.780
 this little button to three positions right now 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.720
 this can see 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.060
 apparently it was missing flour 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.789
 here yes how to know if this one has 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.819
 a load or I do not think it's green if 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:19.830
 he still has a battery and red if he already 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.889
 you are finishing it so that it is in mode 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.000
 normal normal specifications and the 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.910
 third that is the 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.580
 to reading 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.910
 and good in the back you can 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:37.280
 look at the apple logo 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.280
 and a clip to hold it on the rock 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:53.029
 and this is the simplest model 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:53.029
 Its size is also quite 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:03.670
 reduced compared to your ipod nano 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:06.720
 how can you see the telephone station 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.720
 like twice 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.360
 it's also more they said live 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:23.809
 this is ideal this device is ideal for 

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:25.490
 if nothing else you want 

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:29.689
 for example you go on a trip and you want 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:33.229
 listen to music without spending the battery 

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:37.449
 your ipod touch phone 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:37.449
 This has very good battery life 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.020
 and again 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.439
 15 hours of audio 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.260
 that 's enough in this little one 

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:53.330
 apparatus and good 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.470
 this is all friends I hope that you
