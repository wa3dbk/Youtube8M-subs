so<00:01:16.259> though<00:01:16.409> i'm<00:01:17.130> working<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> try<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> make<00:01:17.880> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
so though i'm working to try to make a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.370 
so though i'm working to try to make a
little<00:01:18.090> bit<00:01:18.240> brighter<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.170> bright

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
little bit brighter it's not as bright

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.630 
little bit brighter it's not as bright
as<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:23.369> basically

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

half ants to run it coming up perhaps in
the<00:01:41.009> future<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.350> dynasty<00:01:43.350> sign<00:01:43.829> there's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the future I have a dynasty sign there's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.990 
the future I have a dynasty sign there's
it<00:01:44.850> guts<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.950> trick<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.399> converting<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
it guts to a trick with converting this

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.819 
it guts to a trick with converting this
dynasty<00:01:48.420> sign<00:01:48.750> work<00:01:49.079> will<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> fact<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
dynasty sign work will be the fact that

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
dynasty sign work will be the fact that
it's<00:01:50.070> doesn't<00:01:50.700> next<00:01:50.850> shift<00:01:50.970> register<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.570> this

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it's doesn't next shift register so this

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.450 
it's doesn't next shift register so this
is<00:01:51.930> parallel<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:53.810> control<00:01:54.810> everything<00:01:55.460> so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
is parallel to control everything so

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.819 
is parallel to control everything so
that's<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.149> my<00:01:57.360> docket<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:59.090> future<00:02:00.090> works<00:02:00.829> I

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that's that my docket for future works I

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.649 
that's that my docket for future works I
actually<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> second<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.540> these

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
actually have a second one of these

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.359 
actually have a second one of these
silent<00:02:03.960> radio<00:02:04.200> signs<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:04.950> debating

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
silent radio signs and I'm debating

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.059 
silent radio signs and I'm debating
whether<00:02:05.820> i<00:02:05.939> should<00:02:06.320> convert<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> arduino

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
whether i should convert it to arduino

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.410 
whether i should convert it to arduino
and<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.369> sell<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.209> should<00:02:09.239> just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
and then sell it or if I should just

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.380 
and then sell it or if I should just
sell<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.780> say<00:02:10.050> hey<00:02:10.520> check<00:02:11.520> out<00:02:11.640> my<00:02:11.849> blog<00:02:12.000> moppy

now serving customer number and that

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.450 
now serving customer number and that
counter<00:02:34.630> would<00:02:34.780> show<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.530> think<00:02:36.010> up<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> three

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
counter would show I think up to a three

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.170

sweet<00:03:29.370> but<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.400> just<00:03:30.610> see<00:03:30.730> they<00:03:30.970> have<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.180> two

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
sweet but I just see they have a two

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.509 
sweet but I just see they have a two
digit<00:03:31.450> counter<00:03:31.840> over<00:03:32.019> on<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.140> right<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.590> as<00:03:33.370> a

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
digit counter over on the right and as a

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.130 
digit counter over on the right and as a
normally<00:03:33.850> closed<00:03:34.090> contact<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:34.989> can<00:03:35.110> just

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
normally closed contact so you can just

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.000 
normally closed contact so you can just
increment<00:03:36.070> that<00:03:36.280> counter<00:03:36.670> pretty<00:03:36.940> easily<00:03:38.010> to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
increment that counter pretty easily to

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.720 
increment that counter pretty easily to

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730

wrong<00:03:43.890> there<00:03:44.890> we<00:03:44.980> go<00:03:45.130> actually<00:03:45.850> I<00:03:46.030> think<00:03:46.120> I

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
wrong there we go actually I think I

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.900 
wrong there we go actually I think I
just<00:03:46.299> made<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.630> count<00:03:46.810> backwards<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.500> 99<00:03:47.950> now

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
just made it count backwards to 99 now

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.370 
just made it count backwards to 99 now
serving<00:03:49.390> number<00:03:49.450> 99<00:03:50.970> anyways<00:03:52.049> that's<00:03:53.049> how

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
serving number 99 anyways that's how

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.670 
serving number 99 anyways that's how
right<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.040> should<00:03:54.519> be<00:03:57.030> compared<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.680> running

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
right it should be compared to running

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.820 
right it should be compared to running

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.390 
of you to use a PNP driver transistor
and<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.960> uln<00:04:47.500> 2003<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:49.330> 2003<00:04:50.050> would

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
and a uln 2003 you on 2003 would

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.550 
and a uln 2003 you on 2003 would
inverted<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.550> PNP<00:04:52.120> within<00:04:52.510> over<00:04:53.080> began<00:04:53.410> in

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
inverted the PNP within over began in

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.530 
inverted the PNP within over began in
the<00:04:53.590> 2003<00:04:54.520> would<00:04:54.670> give<00:04:54.790> an<00:04:54.880> open<00:04:55.120> collector

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
the 2003 would give an open collector

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.490 
the 2003 would give an open collector
drive<00:04:56.160> into<00:04:57.160> that<00:04:57.310> power<00:04:57.460> comunist<00:04:58.030> or<00:04:58.210> so

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
drive into that power comunist or so

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.690 
drive into that power comunist or so
we'll<00:04:59.500> see<00:04:59.650> what<00:04:59.770> we<00:04:59.860> can<00:04:59.950> come<00:05:00.070> up<00:05:00.160> with<00:05:00.220> but<00:05:00.430> I

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
we'll see what we can come up with but I

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.550 
we'll see what we can come up with but I
wanted<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.120> keep<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.390> really<00:05:01.540> really<00:05:02.290> simple

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
wanted to keep it really really simple

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.470 
wanted to keep it really really simple
so<00:05:02.919> that<00:05:03.100> anybody<00:05:03.310> could<00:05:03.580> look<00:05:03.730> at<00:05:03.880> it<00:05:03.910> say<00:05:04.180> hey

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
so that anybody could look at it say hey

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.930 
so that anybody could look at it say hey
I<00:05:04.720> can<00:05:05.230> do<00:05:05.320> this<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:06.010> have<00:05:06.400> pictures<00:05:06.610> on<00:05:06.820> my

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
I can do this and I have pictures on my

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.750 
I can do this and I have pictures on my
blog<00:05:06.970> like<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.360> said<00:05:07.630> in<00:05:08.080> Arduino<00:05:08.620> 7<00:05:09.550> driver

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.570 
blog like I said in Arduino 7 driver
transistors<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.650> sign<00:05:11.890> and<00:05:12.190> you're<00:05:12.460> up

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580
