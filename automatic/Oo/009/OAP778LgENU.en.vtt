00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 most people think that 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.319
 It is because of the quality of hair by 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.290
 hair quality that can be 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.700
 present hair not from the skin that 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.740
 it can present certain problems of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.109
 folliculitis that has something to do is 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.359
 independently or definitely someone 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.789
 is predisposed to this 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.279
 come out good you're right in part it's a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
 added factor but really any 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.430
 person who has an abrasion me 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.189
 I explain the word prayer a trauma 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.380
 on the skin is already seen with a blade or 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.570
 with wax or thread any method 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.450
 hair removal you use if you see it 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.670
 microscopic level there is an abrasion 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.649
 on the skin a trauma through that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.629
 trauma the bacteria that we have all 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.480
 in our skin take advantage of the most 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.890
 frequent are called Staphylococcus aureus 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.989
 take advantage they get in and produce a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.030
 inflammatory process on the hair 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.620
 those people for example men 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.750
 also that they make themselves either the bikini or 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.510
 the same beard suffers a lot from this 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.520
 process that is in how and socially 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.350
 also for them it is traumatic many 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 times and is caused precisely by 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.979
 what you said the inflammation of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 follicle reaches the bacterium or reaches 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.400
 a fungus 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.010
 and can produce those good things 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.070
 this complicates us more if we return 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.500
 again to the subject of the intimate zone by 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.370
 the excess heat let's say it like that because 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.530
 if ready he came out of his shave already 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.150
 either with wax or with machine that many 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.460
 people do not like the wax continue 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.290
 using the machine do not suddenly have 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.000
 the precautions of softening a little bit 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.950
 the skin with a little warm water 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.960
 et cetera do not use products 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.580
 to make this area 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.500
 let's say have as the temperature 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.350
 adequate not to cut so 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.450
 brusque the hair adds this that you 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.850
 presents you with folliculitis and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.680
 heat from sweat from tight clothes 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.210
 for the tight clothes already begin to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.130
 present some irritation this is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.590
 can infect like that is you have said 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.970
 better than me even secondary doctor 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.490
 that's what comes precisely 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.630
 Folliculitis for everything you said 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.190
 then take advantage of these germs and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.530
 colonize the follicle and produce the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.690
 inflammation despite that then by 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.850
 example tips milestones I told you 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.190
 warm chamomile water for example 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.200
 it's a very interesting type to apply 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.240
 in the cloths before the affected by 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.270
 example there are very good products today in 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.250
 the country that even allow in a 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.070
 100% that irritation and that 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.790
 inflammation and secondary folliculitis 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.530
 appear and then also other things 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.060
 that some of my patients are used 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.950
 that has been very successful outside the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.350
 chamomile is the calendula commented these 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.640
 natural subjects because really today by 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.560
 today one tends to be everything more 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.330
 natural and these products that I comment 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.880
 for example the interesting thing is that they are 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.070
 100% natural also yes but good 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.390
 this we can apply this because 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.820
 I know that many ladies who in their 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.100
 houses like to have these 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.930
 plants even in the former gardens or 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.400
 they have a space on their balcony where 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.870
 they have their own garden with these 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.880
 aromatic because they like it very much 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.740
 this can be done directly those 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.300
 infusions are made and applied in the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.800
 affected area with these units 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.050
 natural or it has to be a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.940
 special presentation is not like that 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.650
 example preparing your chamomile habitat 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.690
 take the water leave it there and you can put 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.180
 the warm water cloths 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.349
 and secondarily as for the pore 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.370
 a little bit because if they read words 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.750
 simple and allows then for 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.930
 example if we use our products 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.390
 as gels it will penetrate gently on 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.129
 the pore also causes the hair to 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.219
 weaken and at the time of passing the 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.260
 blade as they have cell regenerator 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:31.750
 makes the trauma less and regenerate 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.000
 the skin and prevents inflammation and 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.609
 secondarily good folliculitis 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.469
 doctor and there is not one of the many myths 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.290
 that are woven around that theme and it's 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:43.870
 which is the type of blade they use 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.879
 with the razor especially 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.859
 the gentlemen because many ebro are 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.169
 on this side they have a folliculitis 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.090
 presents very strong on this side is not 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.439
 they hold the shave they say they're going to 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.299
 rehearse then with the machine 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.129
 electric shaving it turns out that they buy the 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.590
 electric affect machine works 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:03.220
 very well two or three times maximum already 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.500
 From there, he goes back to the 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.870
 problematic that that presents them in 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.180
 What will that is very true about all 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.950
 gentlemen when they do their shave one 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.020
 always recommends today that they are 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.359
 arrangement of blades that have three 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.820
 four leaves inclusive then that does 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.019
 make it smoother shave first and 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.470
 the recommendation when a person 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.690
 Suffers from folliculitis is that it does not repeat 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.340
 blade so make an investment 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.130
 one in health has to talk is about 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.290
 investment and remove the word at once 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.450
 of spending one invests in your health yesterday 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.820
 then in that order it's from ideas to 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.700
 be investing in your health in your skin 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.110
 and with these products for example you are 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.840
 can guarantee in the case of 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.820
 men that on the subject the beard and the 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.430
 mustache especially the upper part that 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.540
 is where many times some mushrooms 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.840
 they penetrate and produce a sick woman who 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.460
 call tim if it is avoided in a 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.530
 really today you can guarantee 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.300
 that 100 percent but then 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.390
 uses for example your water cloth 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.010
 warm the shave with your product is 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.010
 Apply after and leave happy
