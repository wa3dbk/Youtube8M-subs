00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.700
 Haie is very much Hello today a 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.470
 It is not a meeting to assemble a labor bike 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.380
 Let's see the current status 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:19.100
 It looks like this 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.880
 I'm going to a used bicycle shop that I changed the hand lawrance a bit. 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.439
 It is compact version part 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.510
 This was replaced in here I a little in the short selling 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.340
 To 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.360
 This sti One 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.730
 I in order to adjust the position even though I was wearing this 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 And it passed would position of the one-time ride I have that kind of feeling before attaching a handlebar tape 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.550
 Of course I want to check for a moment 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:53.690
 I 'm working on it now, but after all there is no pedal 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:58.480
 The center of gravity is always biased forward , so today I put on a little barrel and put that barrel 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.510
 I wondered if I could adjust the position of the spi hole to a point 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.080
 I hear in you taking videos 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.970
 I hope to add apr from now 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.230
 so 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.659
 It is dull and rear Chris took it is the tool to prepare 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.600
 And get 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.140
 Here is 3 days Shimano 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.050
 What a fuck 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.330
 I do not write the part number 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.260
 ct light guy Kana This 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.180
 I went to the pan 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:38.050
 Here frequent Wa'tsu 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:42.330
 It is a guy amazing to say that the rotation of the child I wonder if a little heavy is the guy of such form 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.020
 So first on whether you here attached 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.539
 It is tool to prepare, but 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:54.829
 And successfully train shop I'd guy I Terra Rurenchi of it is this you are using yourself Baoshan 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:59.420
 It looks like that durable guy that is often used 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.940
 It is a tool to make a little expensive 2000 yen as a pedal wrench, but 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.870
 It is a little sushi 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.619
 It's pretty tough and I 'm going to keep it going 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:14.710
 I think that there is no loss if you keep it as a surrounding 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.110
 It is this pedal wrench of Baoshan will continue to use it 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:24.210
 Let's paint the sounds First grease or before that 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.720
 It's a pedal When you attach a pedal, right or left should be written somewhere 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.260
 is not it 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.540
 I wonder if I'm back in the book 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.689
 Roughly to this around this but I is written around here and the bell 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.740
 I do not write kana not write 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.760
 There are many 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.659
 Is it a really old guy? 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.659
 It has not changed- 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.020
 Well I don't write it here too 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.330
 I have a stamp 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.050
 Say left and right left 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.940
 I did not write for 5 minutes 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.690
 Let's try which way to buy it is the Ape Which or money ng examples Which one is reverse 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.890
 It is a screw 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.240
 I wonder if that was the opposite 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.190
 It is here of these left here was a positive screw 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:16.140
 a 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:20.260
 It is a first, I'd get over there probably like this it is the reverse screw here 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.110
 Let's paint the grease so that it does not solidify rust eh 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.130
 And the meeting of the chestnut number 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.130
 Let's move a little 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.519
 Please apply grease to this hole here 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.519
 I think that I do not need so much 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.930
 It feels like this 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:50.460
 Apply grease like this 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:55.160
 Making necessary arrangements to go and that us with a more and more freely grease That's that Meiji Ndee 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.630
 With this, please turn back a little and make it a little 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.860
 This is the first sound 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.860
 Please go to the Uriuri 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.909
 I wonder if you can see that entering 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.909
 Seed has entered 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.400
 It has little to Sarah Hata was is evenly go the grease it back like this 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.889
 Please give me 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.989
 And then d 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.710
 I did it next I'm tightening with a pedal wrench, but here it is fine 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.130
 that 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:30.210
 Than a Azurai part and not over torque 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:35.490
 I think it's okay to put it firmly 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:38.420
 If you put it on, you may not be able to take it this time , but you can not miss it 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.729
 Moderate weight 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.060
 I think it is better to attack 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.310
 First of all 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.380
 Please apply first 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.770
 It is privatization 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.380
 usually 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.480
 In this way 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.940
 After I went 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.940
 Let's have some next time 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.009
 It also over body weight It is a maintenance stand 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:11.319
 I'll take it off and let myself stand 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:12.159
 Do not do anything I'd quite do easy it is chain was that if Afurito stake 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.950
 Wow Looks 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:19.480
 It feels like you just tighten the power of the built 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.480
 Yes i feel like this 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.750
 Oops 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:35.200
 And Well this is good in Mon such Well Nde tacking determine the time being position 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:36.120
 I think I worry that people will think that is better to go to do from the stretched and that the chain is 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.249
 Hey you 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.249
 Oh dear 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:47.849
 I put the pedal on this and adjust the position 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:52.679
 I'd have thought that trying to do it Toka shift the wire from now is maybe Nee 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:59.009
 But this video I've done in the spirit to say Rutte and the entire process in a full-length 

00:05:52.679 --> 00:06:05.639
 A bit of a shift, there's still no boat here, maybe it will be cut 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:07.349
 I think that it will be a video to show you in the cut Still yes 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.840
 I wish I could accept it 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.820
 ao 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:16.690
 Yes, I 'm going to install the pedal this time 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:22.060
 Next seems to be a chef Shift wire Brake wire 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.720
 And I think I think that I will be in the neighborhood a little later Thank you for viewing this time 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.950
 Was 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:30.040
 If you think it was good, please come back and have a daddy 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.040
 The
