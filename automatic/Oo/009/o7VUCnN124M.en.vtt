the<00:00:56.910> last<00:00:57.210> bubble<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.140> left<00:00:58.640> do<00:00:59.640> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the last bubble that is left do I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.450 
the last bubble that is left do I
they're<00:01:00.600> doing<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> idea<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
they're doing this on the idea that you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.690 
they're doing this on the idea that you
can<00:01:02.640> fix<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.270> period<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> excess<00:01:04.949> borrowing<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
can fix a period of excess borrowing and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300 
can fix a period of excess borrowing and
excess<00:01:06.060> consumption<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.590> basically<00:01:07.770> just

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
excess consumption but basically just

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.820 
excess consumption but basically just
borrowing<00:01:08.880> more<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.750> putting<00:01:10.619> more

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
borrowing more in and putting more

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.679 
borrowing more in and putting more
consumption<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:12.000> leveraging<00:01:12.510> more

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
consumption or leveraging more

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.280 
consumption or leveraging more
consumption<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:14.100> me<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:15.119> just

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
consumption and to me that's just

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.380 
consumption and to me that's just
ludicrous<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.740> ridiculous<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.119> pretty

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
ludicrous is ridiculous and it pretty

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.870 
ludicrous is ridiculous and it pretty
much<00:01:18.479> goes<00:01:18.600> against<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> grain<00:01:19.530> I've<00:01:20.070> set<00:01:20.700> of

system<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> people<00:02:08.700> who<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.330> created

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
system so the people who have created

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.380 
system so the people who have created
the<00:02:10.170> problem<00:02:10.380> are<00:02:10.739> now<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.580> charge<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.150> bail

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
the problem are now in charge to bail

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.870 
the problem are now in charge to bail
out<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.660> system<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.470> that's<00:02:14.160> why<00:02:14.430> I'm<00:02:14.610> very

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
out the system and that's why I'm very

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.120 
out the system and that's why I'm very
skeptical<00:02:15.360> I've<00:02:15.720> been<00:02:15.959> skeptical<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:16.770> along

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
skeptical I've been skeptical all along

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.790 
skeptical I've been skeptical all along
and<00:02:17.480> I've<00:02:18.480> basically<00:02:18.810> said<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.380> wouldn't<00:02:19.650> work

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
and I've basically said it wouldn't work

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.339 
and I've basically said it wouldn't work
from<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> get-go<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.970> you've<00:02:21.959> seen<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
from the get-go and you've seen the

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.780 
from the get-go and you've seen the
product<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.769> what<00:02:22.950> happened<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> end<00:02:23.610> of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
product of what happened in the end of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.309 
product of what happened in the end of
2008<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.930> now<00:02:25.530> leading<00:02:25.800> into<00:02:26.180> 2009<00:02:27.319> really

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
2008 and now leading into 2009 really

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.559 
2008 and now leading into 2009 really
the<00:02:28.470> government's<00:02:29.010> effort<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.580> pour<00:02:29.849> money

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
the government's effort to pour money

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.780 
the government's effort to pour money
into<00:02:30.720> certain<00:02:31.470> businesses<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.430> keep<00:02:32.580> them

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
into certain businesses and to keep them

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.320 
into certain businesses and to keep them
afloat<00:02:32.910> while<00:02:33.840> letting<00:02:34.140> others<00:02:34.590> fail<00:02:35.330> has

afloat while letting others fail has

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.090 
afloat while letting others fail has
increased<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> volatility<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.680> that's<00:02:37.890> why

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
increased the volatility and that's why

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.580 
increased the volatility and that's why
we're<00:02:38.310> seeing<00:02:38.580> these<00:02:39.299> big<00:02:39.630> runs<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.230> market

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590

we're seeing these big runs up on market
big<00:02:40.830> updates<00:02:41.430> big<00:02:41.790> down<00:02:42.060> days<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:43.200> we're

big updates big down days but we're

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.660 
big updates big down days but we're

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
still in a bear market and we'll

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.699 
still in a bear market and we'll
continue<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.269> see<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.540> market<00:02:45.900> go<00:02:46.080> lower<00:02:46.350> and

continue to see the market go lower and
never<00:02:47.400> know<00:02:47.549> it's<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.790> bad<00:02:48.000> thing<00:02:48.269> seeing<00:02:48.660> these

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
never know it's a bad thing seeing these

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.559 
never know it's a bad thing seeing these
companies<00:02:49.260> go<00:02:49.410> down<00:02:49.680> these<00:02:50.580> contractions<00:02:51.360> are

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
companies go down these contractions are

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.440 
companies go down these contractions are
actually<00:02:52.019> serving<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.250> build<00:02:53.489> for<00:02:53.700> future

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
actually serving to build for future

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.199 
actually serving to build for future
strength<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.340> wheat<00:02:56.580> competitors

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
strength because the wheat competitors

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.120 
strength because the wheat competitors
are<00:02:57.330> eliminated<00:02:57.930> if<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.260> support<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.799> week

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
are eliminated if you support the week

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.800 
are eliminated if you support the week
competitors<00:02:59.819> you're<00:03:00.209> essentially

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
competitors you're essentially

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.370 
competitors you're essentially
penalizing<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.890> strong<00:03:02.190> competitors<00:03:02.819> and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
penalizing the strong competitors and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.550 
penalizing the strong competitors and
therefore<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:05.120> lot<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.239> these<00:03:06.330> people<00:03:06.690> all

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
therefore a lot of these people all

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.289 
therefore a lot of these people all
these<00:03:07.620> smart<00:03:08.130> people<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:08.670> are<00:03:08.760> saying<00:03:09.000> let

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
these smart people that are saying let

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.660 
these smart people that are saying let
the<00:03:09.450> small<00:03:09.750> companies<00:03:10.290> fail<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.190> let<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.459> big

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
the small companies fail and let the big

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.990 
the small companies fail and let the big
companies<00:03:11.940> fail<00:03:12.769> are<00:03:13.769> basically<00:03:14.340> very<00:03:14.459> very

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
companies fail are basically very very

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.900 
companies fail are basically very very
smart<00:03:15.739> there<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> chance<00:03:17.310> at<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.579> second

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
smart there is a chance at the second

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.420 
smart there is a chance at the second
half<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.269> this<00:03:18.390> year<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.840> 2009<00:03:19.560> maybe<00:03:19.890> worse<00:03:20.190> in

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
half of this year in 2009 maybe worse in

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.940 
half of this year in 2009 maybe worse in
the<00:03:20.549> first<00:03:20.790> half<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.019> markets<00:03:22.739> which

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
the first half but the markets which

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.090 
the first half but the markets which
were<00:03:23.100> oversold<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:23.970> November<00:03:24.630> last<00:03:24.660> year<00:03:25.140> may

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
were oversold in November last year may

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.740 
were oversold in November last year may
go<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> little<00:03:26.519> higher<00:03:26.820> especially<00:03:27.180> with<00:03:27.660> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
go a little higher especially with the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.289 
go a little higher especially with the
Obama<00:03:28.200> inauguration<00:03:28.620> coming<00:03:29.370> up<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.700> like

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
Obama inauguration coming up and like

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.900 
Obama inauguration coming up and like
I've<00:03:30.480> said<00:03:30.570> before<00:03:31.100> there's<00:03:32.100> nothing<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
I've said before there's nothing in the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.210 
I've said before there's nothing in the
rulebook<00:03:33.180> especially<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.440> bear<00:03:34.799> market

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
rulebook especially in this bear market

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.670 
rulebook especially in this bear market
we're<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.519> at<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.730> moment<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:37.230> says<00:03:37.500> we

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
we're in at the moment that says we

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.449 
we're in at the moment that says we
can't<00:03:37.709> have<00:03:38.250> solid<00:03:38.670> up<00:03:38.760> rallies<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.650> that

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
can't have solid up rallies so that

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.460 
can't have solid up rallies so that
brings<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.120> next<00:03:42.359> thing<00:03:42.780> let's<00:03:43.290> go

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
brings it to the next thing let's go

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.900 
brings it to the next thing let's go
over<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.890> look<00:03:43.980> at<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.310> chart<00:03:44.670> now

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
over and have a look at the chart now

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.080 
over and have a look at the chart now
the<00:03:44.970> S&amp;P<00:03:45.510> 500<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.410> see<00:03:46.709> how<00:03:46.859> this<00:03:47.040> ties<00:03:47.790> in

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
the S&amp;P 500 and see how this ties in

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.699 
the S&amp;P 500 and see how this ties in
technically<00:03:48.600> with<00:03:48.780> what's<00:03:49.049> happening<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
technically with what's happening on the

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.030 
technically with what's happening on the
map<00:03:49.889> okay<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:50.790> we<00:03:51.299> are<00:03:51.329> basically<00:03:51.739> we're<00:03:52.739> still

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
map okay so we are basically we're still

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.460 
map okay so we are basically we're still
sitting<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:53.639> a<00:03:53.790> bear<00:03:54.060> market<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:55.139> reason

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
sitting in a bear market the reason

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.309 
sitting in a bear market the reason
being<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.829> because<00:03:55.859> we<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.480> lower<00:03:57.480> highs<00:03:58.290> and

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
being is because we have lower highs and

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.900 
being is because we have lower highs and
lower<00:03:58.799> lows<00:03:59.519> so<00:04:00.030> we're<00:04:00.299> still<00:04:00.769> obviously

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
lower lows so we're still obviously

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.610 
lower lows so we're still obviously
seeing<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.090> negativity<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.109> market<00:04:04.500> if

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
seeing that negativity in the market if

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.520 
seeing that negativity in the market if
you<00:04:04.709> had<00:04:04.889> a<00:04:04.920> look<00:04:05.160> back<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.690> at<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.200> end<00:04:07.410> of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
you had a look back in the at the end of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.340 
you had a look back in the at the end of
november<00:04:07.739> we<00:04:08.459> did<00:04:08.639> have<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:09.090> i<00:04:09.350> sending

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
november we did have that i sending

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.890 
november we did have that i sending
triangle<00:04:10.980> position<00:04:11.130> normally<00:04:11.880> when<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.720> have

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
triangle position normally when you have

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.319 
triangle position normally when you have
these<00:04:13.200> sort<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.680> patterns<00:04:14.040> right<00:04:14.250> here<00:04:14.669> the

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
these sort of patterns right here the

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.449 
these sort of patterns right here the
market<00:04:15.750> normally

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
market normally

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.430 
market normally
it's<00:04:16.579> back<00:04:16.759> up<00:04:16.789> but<00:04:17.780> that<00:04:17.930> wasn't<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.259> case

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
it's back up but that wasn't the case

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.390 
it's back up but that wasn't the case
because<00:04:18.799> we're<00:04:18.979> in<00:04:19.069> a<00:04:19.190> bear<00:04:19.880> market<00:04:21.130> down<00:04:22.130> here

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
because we're in a bear market down here

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.309 
because we're in a bear market down here
we<00:04:22.550> saw<00:04:22.729> a<00:04:22.759> full<00:04:23.120> failure<00:04:23.660> of<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:23.990> pattern

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:24.319 
we saw a full failure of that pattern

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:28.779 
we saw a full failure of that pattern
and<00:04:24.680> we<00:04:25.639> actually<00:04:26.229> continued<00:04:27.229> back<00:04:27.650> down<00:04:28.310> like

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
and we actually continued back down like

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.760 
and we actually continued back down like
I<00:04:28.970> thought<00:04:29.590> just<00:04:30.590> before<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.130> holidays<00:04:31.580> there

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
I thought just before the holidays there

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.110 
I thought just before the holidays there
another<00:04:33.770> interesting<00:04:33.979> thing<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.580> mention<00:04:34.849> is

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
another interesting thing to mention is

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.050 
another interesting thing to mention is
that<00:04:35.180> this<00:04:35.930> resistant<00:04:36.500> point<00:04:36.740> up<00:04:36.919> here<00:04:37.060> when

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
that this resistant point up here when

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.480 
that this resistant point up here when
we<00:04:38.180> had<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.389> failure<00:04:39.050> at<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.889> top<00:04:40.190> there

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
we had the failure at the top there

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.450 
we had the failure at the top there
which<00:04:40.639> was<00:04:40.819> at<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.090> start<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.930> January<00:04:42.710> if<00:04:42.949> you

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
which was at the start of January if you

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.320 
which was at the start of January if you
see<00:04:43.789> that<00:04:44.110> position<00:04:45.110> there<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:46.150> what<00:04:47.150> has

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
see that position there and what has

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.719 
see that position there and what has
happened<00:04:47.750> over<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.259> last<00:04:48.289> week<00:04:48.860> we've<00:04:49.460> now

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
happened over the last week we've now

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.610 
happened over the last week we've now
gone<00:04:50.000> into<00:04:50.240> this<00:04:50.449> little<00:04:50.660> download<00:04:51.229> channel

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
gone into this little download channel

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.960 
gone into this little download channel
position<00:04:52.580> down<00:04:52.789> here<00:04:53.180> now<00:04:54.729> that's<00:04:55.729> very

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
position down here now that's very

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.450 
position down here now that's very
interesting<00:04:56.180> but<00:04:56.990> we<00:04:57.139> do<00:04:57.349> have<00:04:57.560> remember<00:04:58.340> what

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
interesting but we do have remember what

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.909 
interesting but we do have remember what
happened<00:04:58.789> last<00:04:58.820> time<00:04:59.139> with<00:05:00.139> when<00:05:00.620> we<00:05:00.650> had<00:05:00.889> a

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
happened last time with when we had a

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.980 
happened last time with when we had a
lot<00:05:01.160> of<00:05:01.190> news<00:05:01.520> with<00:05:02.090> Obama<00:05:02.449> when<00:05:02.720> he<00:05:02.750> won<00:05:02.960> the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
lot of news with Obama when he won the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.320 
lot of news with Obama when he won the
elections<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.710> market<00:05:04.039> went<00:05:04.190> up<00:05:04.280> we<00:05:05.090> could

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
elections the market went up we could

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.180 
elections the market went up we could
have<00:05:05.509> a<00:05:05.539> little<00:05:05.750> bit<00:05:06.020> of<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.229> bummer<00:05:06.560> norgren

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
have a little bit of a bummer norgren

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.450 
have a little bit of a bummer norgren
eight<00:05:07.990> inauguration<00:05:08.990> rally<00:05:09.289> sorry<00:05:09.680> which

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
eight inauguration rally sorry which

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.860 
eight inauguration rally sorry which
could<00:05:10.669> take<00:05:10.849> the<00:05:11.030> market<00:05:11.330> up<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.539> little<00:05:11.750> bit

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
could take the market up a little bit

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.120 
could take the market up a little bit
but<00:05:12.530> eventually<00:05:13.150> like<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.300> said<00:05:14.539> in<00:05:14.690> my<00:05:14.720> other

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
but eventually like I said in my other

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.339 
but eventually like I said in my other
technical<00:05:16.130> videos<00:05:16.509> we<00:05:17.509> do<00:05:17.720> have<00:05:17.930> that<00:05:18.080> low

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
technical videos we do have that low

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.649 
technical videos we do have that low
point<00:05:18.710> down<00:05:18.979> here<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:19.490> that<00:05:20.150> was<00:05:20.300> at<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:20.479> end

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
point down here and that was at the end

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.810 
point down here and that was at the end
of<00:05:20.810> november<00:05:21.050> that's<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.650> low<00:05:21.830> point<00:05:22.190> is<00:05:22.669> the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
of november that's the low point is the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.240 
of november that's the low point is the
lowest<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.419> market<00:05:23.810> has<00:05:23.990> been<00:05:24.380> but

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
lowest the market has been but

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.719 
lowest the market has been but
eventually<00:05:26.169> even<00:05:27.169> if<00:05:27.409> we<00:05:27.560> have<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:27.710> rally<00:05:28.009> from

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
eventually even if we have a rally from

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.140 
eventually even if we have a rally from
this<00:05:28.970> position<00:05:29.180> up<00:05:29.630> here<00:05:30.130> we<00:05:31.130> will<00:05:31.370> see<00:05:31.699> the

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
this position up here we will see the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.379 
this position up here we will see the
market<00:05:32.539> come<00:05:32.780> down<00:05:33.110> and<00:05:33.669> retest<00:05:34.669> those<00:05:35.000> lows

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
market come down and retest those lows

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.969 
market come down and retest those lows
back<00:05:35.870> in<00:05:36.080> november<00:05:36.770> 08<00:05:37.729> I<00:05:38.620> mean<00:05:39.620> it<00:05:39.740> won't

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
back in november 08 I mean it won't

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.339 
back in november 08 I mean it won't
happen<00:05:40.190> tomorrow<00:05:40.580> or<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.180> next<00:05:41.210> day<00:05:41.539> but

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
happen tomorrow or the next day but

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.740 
happen tomorrow or the next day but
eventually<00:05:42.800> if<00:05:43.370> you've<00:05:44.030> seen<00:05:44.300> some<00:05:44.599> of<00:05:44.719> the

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
eventually if you've seen some of the

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.930 
eventually if you've seen some of the
new<00:05:45.050> some<00:05:45.500> of<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:45.710> bailout<00:05:45.949> news<00:05:46.430> some<00:05:46.729> of<00:05:46.849> the

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
new some of the bailout news some of the

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.360 
new some of the bailout news some of the
banks<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.389> are<00:05:47.509> going<00:05:47.780> under<00:05:48.229> and<00:05:48.440> some<00:05:49.250> of

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
banks that are going under and some of

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.159 
banks that are going under and some of
the<00:05:50.139> manufacturing<00:05:51.139> numbers<00:05:52.449> retail<00:05:53.449> sales<00:05:53.840> I

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
the manufacturing numbers retail sales I

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.050 
the manufacturing numbers retail sales I
mean<00:05:54.320> that's<00:05:54.530> really<00:05:55.159> fundamentally<00:05:55.940> it's

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
mean that's really fundamentally it's

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.790 
mean that's really fundamentally it's
not<00:05:56.240> going<00:05:56.330> to<00:05:56.419> take<00:05:56.599> the<00:05:56.750> market<00:05:57.110> back<00:05:57.289> up<00:05:57.500> so

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
not going to take the market back up so

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.279 
not going to take the market back up so
eventually<00:05:58.639> technically<00:05:59.479> that's<00:05:59.630> what<00:05:59.870> I<00:05:59.900> see

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
eventually technically that's what I see

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.350 
eventually technically that's what I see
the<00:06:00.770> market<00:06:01.130> doing<00:06:01.280> go<00:06:01.639> back<00:06:01.849> and<00:06:02.030> retest

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
the market doing go back and retest

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.719 
the market doing go back and retest
those<00:06:02.630> lows<00:06:02.900> maybe<00:06:03.860> it<00:06:04.039> could<00:06:04.219> break<00:06:04.430> through

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
those lows maybe it could break through

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.270 
those lows maybe it could break through
maybe<00:06:05.539> could<00:06:05.810> have<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:05.930> bounce<00:06:06.199> back<00:06:06.440> up<00:06:06.650> this

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
maybe could have a bounce back up this

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.300 
maybe could have a bounce back up this
year<00:06:07.520> is<00:06:07.639> going<00:06:07.789> to<00:06:07.849> be<00:06:07.940> very<00:06:08.590> volatile<00:06:09.590> just
