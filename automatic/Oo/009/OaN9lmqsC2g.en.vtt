because when i first started drinking

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.670 
because when i first started drinking
water<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.730> couldn't<00:00:36.360> stand<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.870> either<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.469> was

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
water I couldn't stand it either I was

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220

and<00:00:40.620> fruity<00:00:41.160> sugary<00:00:42.030> stuff<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and fruity sugary stuff so it can be a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.900 
and fruity sugary stuff so it can be a
switch<00:00:44.070> when<00:00:44.250> you're<00:00:44.370> first<00:00:44.520> getting<00:00:44.700> started

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that is natural to our environment as

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.010 
that is natural to our environment as
adults<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:53.070> only<00:00:53.760> drink<00:00:54.120> water<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
adults we only drink water that's the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.279

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
drink lots of water and to make the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
drink lots of water and to make the
switch<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> suggest<00:01:03.359> doing<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
don't suggest adding the flavors because

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.539 
don't suggest adding the flavors because
flavors<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:09.180> chemicals<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.340> chemicals<00:01:11.340> do
