00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.400
 Maybe that's how it looks 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 directly so christian 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.799
 bonuspoints personally but otherwise 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.270
 is the answer in any case also in 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.530
 So just hide this video 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.939
 stay tuned to look 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.340
 I'll show you this again 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.640
 make wonderful gift idea yourself 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.130
 can 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.340
 Let's go for this recipe or 3 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.590
 needed the following ingredients 225 grams raw 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.750
 cane sugar 1 packet of vanilla sugar i 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.860
 Now there's this bobo vanilla from alnatura 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.380
 from dm this really great then two 420 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.180
 gram flour 1 teaspoon baking powder one 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 half teaspoon salt of 20 grams 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.140
 Crushed flaxseed gets that too 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.939
 directly at dm and 100 grams dark 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.530
 Later , the chocolate will need it 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.600
 gave the whole thing in delicious 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.030
 to turn cookies still 180 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.670
 milliliters of rapeseed oil and 125 milliliters 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.530
 Plants, for example, lays soy milk 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.390
 Here then just starts so that you 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.250
 roughly chop the chocolate 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.659
 that is really super fast and then 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.759
 are you already ready your bottle 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.320
 my here is off of me 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.909
 Link them also under info box 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.520
 if we need just one is exactly 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.349
 a liter and in there he layers then 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.600
 simply with the help of such a funnel 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.700
 your ingredients 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.250
 I took care that it was so 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.320
 beautiful light dark course is with so 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.220
 that gives me such a beautiful grain 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.010
 maybe it would all be this way 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.210
 to place a little higher because 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.060
 I therefore still such a banderole 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.660
 But that's why it's always interesting 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.430
 smarter 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.500
 So then just keep everything pure 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.660
 if that is full then once the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.360
 Cover it up or everything 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.680
 Shake it out and tap it 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.320
 the air goes out and then you can 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.520
 just fill in the rest again and me 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.240
 Have to say if I have these pictures here 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.550
 to see you again 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.870
 I love my new gray wall so 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.150
 Gray is really my absolute 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.940
 Everybody else radiates a favorite color 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.550
 Because of this, color does a lot more gray 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.680
 really my absolute favorite if the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.870
 then gave his cake mix in 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.790
 just want to transform cookies 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.890
 into a large bowl of oil and 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.570
 Plant me briefly through 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.260
 stir with it like me dust if you 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.970
 mixa goes in and then you can do that 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.040
 Thoroughly mix thoroughly and once 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.960
 will do the kneading that goes 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.070
 really super fast and then 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.810
 maybe another hands to 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.740
 then take the hands mission then stop 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.510
 always best 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.220
 and then you have such a glass ball 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.710
 you can cool for half 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.840
 hour and then the work surface 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.380
 dial in a bit and this ball too 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.180
 a thick sausage processed so so 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.550
 make a thick pond sausage out of it and 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.950
 then you can do it in 1 cm 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.720
 equal slices and equal slices 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.060
 So just give it on the baking paper 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.140
 on the baking tray with baking paper and that 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.090
 whole at 180 degrees in the oven for ten 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.370
 minutes to unpack 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.130
 The cookies you must necessarily 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.900
 take it out of the oven because 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.970
 The gentlemen from a bit to and 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.520
 if you just got out of the oven 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.690
 they are already too dry so 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.790
 they are supposed to be so beautiful 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.740
 be soft and fluffy when you get out 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.240
 decreases and then when being cold 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.310
 the a bit harder and or they too 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.290
 Delicious, I hope so, too 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.320
 from yes I saw the whole thing 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.790
 really mega simple and totally flexible 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.200
 So you can do that too in the season 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.520
 to 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.739
 I still could go in there too 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.419
 Christmas also with Christmassy 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.030
 make spices and so was the 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.859
 chocolate or you could do that too 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.680
 Take the nut instead of the chocolate because you 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.760
 Do not be such a chocolate fan and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.889
 the same are really a nice idea 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.450
 just because that's just no artificial thing 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.960
 that's how you all get by the way 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.660
 ingredients except for the bottle at dm as 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.520
 I had all of his from a tour so 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.240
 also these crushed flaxseed and 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.650
 the sugar and the and the flour and 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.100
 Somehow you get everything with that 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.850
 can be mixed little weird otherwise 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.580
 drugstore now together 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.780
 Supermarket was there I was and that 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.350
 kind of nice that after closing time 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.930
 can fast again and how ever 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.430
