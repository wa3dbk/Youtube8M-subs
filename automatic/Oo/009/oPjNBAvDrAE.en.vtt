00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.380
 welcome to my channel to kitchen with 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.559
 Now I am going to share with you one 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.820
 new recipe how to prepare some 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.820
 ribs with potatoes 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.910
 The first thing I did was that I put these 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.910
 ribs in a bowl with water and 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.170
 lemon so that it comes out a bit 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.620
 blood 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.650
 these are about 12 pounds and 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.710
 now in a saucepan I'm going to put 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.330
 well little oil if you do not 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:15.390
 they want to use oil they can put it like that 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.390
 and then I'll put them to media or fry 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.630
 after two minutes I have them 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.630
 cooking and I'm going to start giving 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.110
 back as I tell you if you do not 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.289
 they want to use oil they can put them like that 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.950
 without oil since the ribs fire 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.950
 oil 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.100
 Now I'm going to put a little salt 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.370
 Once they are medium or deep-fried 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.550
 two sides I will remove them from the 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.200
 saucepan and the oil that has the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.200
 pan that I'm going to mount 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.890
 Now I'm going to start liquefying everything 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.700
 I have already chopped everything I have already 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.470
 chopped nothing else I'm using half 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.340
 because the rest I'm going to use it for 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.430
 put it to the ribs 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.849
 I'll also put half a cup of 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.849
 Water 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:36.319
 and now in a little water 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.719
 I'm going to put a spoonful of achiote 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.280
 I'm going to start mixing 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.280
 untie all the balls 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.079
 Now I have everything ready to this 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:55.459
 I'm going to put a little pan on it 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:58.129
 oil to fry the rest of the 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.040
 Tomato the chili and onion I had 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.200
 already chopped as I tell you of everything 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.799
 I have already chopped nothing else I am using 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.549
 half and half use it for 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.549
 liquefy it 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.610
 now I 'm going to incorporate the ribs 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.320
 I want to greet everyone 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.480

 kitchen with adela dotcom in the part of 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.300
 up on the right side I 'm going to leave you 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.300
 the link 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.810
 I'm going to put the necessary salt 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.500
 then I'm going to start mixing it very 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.500
 all right 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.870
 and here what I have is a spoonful of 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.870
 spices 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.370
 I'm going to put a cup of water 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.270
 and the scourge I had ready 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.150
 of the tomato and onion that he had 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:16.060
 I'm putting a cup 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.180
 also what I put is a cube with 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.950
 beef broth flavor this cube if 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.570
 you want it too can you 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.570
 Blend with tomato and onion 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.310
 once I have put all the 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.680
 I'm going to mix it very well 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.910
 to let it cost more or 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.910
 less for about 10 minutes 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.510
 after 10 minutes I will add 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.110
 the potato since the potato cooks very 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:56.020
 fast and this dad I'll leave for 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.320
 another 15 minutes or until it costs 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.320
 all right 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:15.030
 and finally what I'm going to put is going to 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.670
 be these leaves of oregano oregano 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.910
 or mint is very important in the 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:24.530
 food since it leaves a very 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.530
 special to food 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:32.750
 after 15 minutes the papaya is 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:34.849
 well cooked as you can see these 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.580
 ribs with potatoes is very easy to 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:41.090
