00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 but here is the first 12 minutes of the debut match us 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.160
 failed no luck or some 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.639
 circumstances have played on the fact that we 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.139
 lost at the very beginning I think 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.109
 that I will not blame anyone 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.760
 my point of view as much as possible 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.930
 on the premier league sprints discuss 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
 only football players who how much 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.039
 earns and where the rested rests 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.900
 referee and when will you know your 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.490
 We all say that the Premier League is for 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.199

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.359
 Yesterday's match is worth 11 meters and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.640
 removes person of hope and tricks 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.200
 today when the last hope foul 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 tailor arbitrator runs up to see the whole 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.280
 situation he is facing this moment he 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.250
 let him see the replay okay first 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.710

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.539
 and conceded two goals 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.460
