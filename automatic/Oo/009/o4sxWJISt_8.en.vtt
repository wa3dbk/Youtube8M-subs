was<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> mistake<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.980> asteroid<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.610> had

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
was a mistake the asteroid I had

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.299 
was a mistake the asteroid I had
targeted<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.449> smaller<00:00:57.780> than<00:00:58.020> most<00:00:58.289> maybe<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
targeted was smaller than most maybe a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.060 
targeted was smaller than most maybe a
dozen<00:00:59.550> meters<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.270> side<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.620> outside

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
dozen meters on the side on the outside

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.160 
dozen meters on the side on the outside
it<00:01:02.280> looked<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> same<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.940> any<00:01:03.059> other<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it looked the same as any other just a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.890 
it looked the same as any other just a
ball<00:01:04.379> covered<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.010> frozen<00:01:05.430> gas<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.330> something

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
ball covered in frozen gas but something

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
ball covered in frozen gas but something
must<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.380> been<00:01:07.590> inside<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.700> something

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
must have been inside it something

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.140 
must have been inside it something
inactive<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.680> cold<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.790> heat<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.119> my

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
inactive in the cold the heat of my

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
blast might have triggered something or

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429

woken<00:01:14.580> something<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.299> after<00:01:16.110> I'd<00:01:16.229> hit<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
woken something up after I'd hit it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.100 
woken something up after I'd hit it
spots<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.280> light<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.820> heat<00:01:18.330> appeared<00:01:18.869> all

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
spots of light and heat appeared all

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
spots of light and heat appeared all
over<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> thin<00:01:19.920> shell<00:01:20.310> still<00:01:20.700> covering<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
over the thin shell still covering it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.390 
over the thin shell still covering it
evaporating<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> gases<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:23.220> lay

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
evaporating the gases what lay

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
evaporating the gases what lay
underneath<00:01:23.790> looked<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:25.110> sort<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
underneath looked like some sort of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.789 
underneath looked like some sort of
rocky<00:01:25.710> growth<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.659> deformed<00:01:27.659> rock<00:01:27.930> pitted<00:01:28.680> by

rocky growth a deformed rock pitted by

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.120 
rocky growth a deformed rock pitted by

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
scores of micrometeorites scars I think

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.069 
scores of micrometeorites scars I think
something<00:01:32.490> even<00:01:32.759> older<00:01:33.240> might<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.900> been

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
something even older might have been

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.230 
something even older might have been
inside<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:36.710> maybe<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.610> maybe<00:01:38.820> not

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
inside that maybe but maybe not

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.960 
inside that maybe but maybe not
it<00:01:39.689> started<00:01:40.170> rotating<00:01:40.740> faster<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.400> faster<00:01:41.610> as

it started rotating faster and faster as

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.330 
it started rotating faster and faster as

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
we watched it after a second it started

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.969 
we watched it after a second it started
