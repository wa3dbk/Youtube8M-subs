problem<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.750> can<00:02:48.990> see<00:02:49.230> how<00:02:49.410> beautifully

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
problem and I can see how beautifully

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.470 
problem and I can see how beautifully
it's<00:02:51.030> disappearing<00:02:52.700> after<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.000> applied

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it's disappearing after you applied

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.530 
it's disappearing after you applied
several<00:02:55.170> coats<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.130> base<00:02:56.430> coat<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.390> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
several coats of the base coat and you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.530 
several coats of the base coat and you
are<00:02:57.570> happy<00:02:58.050> with<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:59.310> time<00:02:59.670> to<00:03:00.030> cover<00:03:00.360> it

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
are happy with it it's time to cover it

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.470 
are happy with it it's time to cover it
with<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.930> clear<00:03:01.230> coat<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.400> manual<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.210> the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
with the clear coat the manual on the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.590 
with the clear coat the manual on the
box<00:03:03.720> says<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.710> time<00:03:04.980> between<00:03:05.220> base<00:03:05.790> coat<00:03:06.240> and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
box says the time between base coat and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.370 
box says the time between base coat and
the<00:03:07.020> clear<00:03:07.290> coat<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.830> 30<00:03:08.550> minutes<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.930> it's<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
the clear coat is 30 minutes so it's the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.920 
the clear coat is 30 minutes so it's the
same<00:03:10.740> thing<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.640> just<00:03:12.350> carefully<00:03:14.240> apply<00:03:15.240> that

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
same thing I just carefully apply that

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.760 
same thing I just carefully apply that
clear<00:03:16.440> coat<00:03:16.770> on<00:03:17.040> top<00:03:17.490> of<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.530> how

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
clear coat on top of it this is how

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.240 
clear coat on top of it this is how
looks<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.400> end<00:03:20.670> result<00:03:23.900> all<00:03:24.900> these<00:03:25.350> prime

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
looks the end result all these prime

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.130 
looks the end result all these prime
spots<00:03:26.910> are<00:03:27.209> gone<00:03:27.570> an<00:03:28.700> entire<00:03:29.700> edge<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.420> nicely

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
spots are gone an entire edge is nicely

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.360 
spots are gone an entire edge is nicely
covered<00:03:31.770> by<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.280> paint<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:36.950> think<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.100> looks

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
covered by the paint I think it looks

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.120 
covered by the paint I think it looks
pretty<00:03:38.670> good<00:03:40.100> way<00:03:41.100> better<00:03:41.400> than<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.820> was<00:03:43.130> so

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
pretty good way better than it was so

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.640 
pretty good way better than it was so
you<00:03:44.190> think<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:44.700> was<00:03:44.970> too<00:03:45.150> easy<00:03:45.320> okay<00:03:46.320> let's

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
you think this was too easy okay let's

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.280 
you think this was too easy okay let's
go<00:03:46.860> find<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.310> more<00:03:47.489> difficult<00:03:47.730> spot<00:03:48.330> let's<00:03:49.020> look

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
go find a more difficult spot let's look

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.729 
go find a more difficult spot let's look
at<00:03:49.530> these<00:03:49.800> two<00:03:50.190> large<00:03:50.670> rock<00:03:51.480> chips<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.500> let's

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
at these two large rock chips and let's

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.530 
at these two large rock chips and let's
focus<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.459> one<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.730> them<00:03:54.120> let's<00:03:54.540> say<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.680> one

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
focus on one of them let's say this one

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.440 
focus on one of them let's say this one
if<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.780> want<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.170> touch<00:03:58.380> up<00:03:58.680> such<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> small<00:03:59.640> spot

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
if I want to touch up such a small spot

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.790 
if I want to touch up such a small spot
which<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:01.110> in<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.560> flat<00:04:02.220> RL<00:04:03.260> now<00:04:04.260> there<00:04:04.620> is<00:04:04.770> a

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
which is in the flat RL now there is a

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.640 
which is in the flat RL now there is a
challenge<00:04:05.430> because<00:04:06.150> if<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.020> will<00:04:07.200> use<00:04:07.410> this

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
challenge because if I will use this

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.490 
challenge because if I will use this
brush<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.660> will<00:04:09.660> put<00:04:09.989> way<00:04:10.530> too<00:04:10.560> much<00:04:11.190> pain<00:04:11.820> at

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
brush I will put way too much pain at

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.070 
brush I will put way too much pain at
one<00:04:13.500> time<00:04:13.890> on<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.400> spot<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:15.330> will<00:04:15.690> create

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
one time on that spot and I will create

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.250 
one time on that spot and I will create
a<00:04:16.230> large<00:04:16.739> drop<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.640> paint<00:04:17.940> there<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:19.109> in

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
a large drop of the paint there so in

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.330 
a large drop of the paint there so in
this<00:04:19.470> case<00:04:19.859> we<00:04:20.790> cannot<00:04:21.120> use<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.979> we<00:04:22.979> have<00:04:23.130> to

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
this case we cannot use this we have to

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.910 
this case we cannot use this we have to
use<00:04:23.520> either<00:04:23.880> microbe<00:04:24.570> brushes

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
use either microbe brushes

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.460 
use either microbe brushes
or<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:27.060> it's<00:04:27.300> even<00:04:27.780> very<00:04:28.020> very<00:04:28.770> small<00:04:29.250> spot

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
or if it's even very very small spot

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.610 
or if it's even very very small spot
actually<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.800> great<00:04:32.130> work<00:04:33.030> can<00:04:33.510> be<00:04:33.780> achieved

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
actually the great work can be achieved

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
actually the great work can be achieved
with<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.190> toothpick<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:37.110> let<00:04:37.770> me<00:04:38.040> do<00:04:38.430> this

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
with the toothpick so let me do this

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.930 
with the toothpick so let me do this
spot<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.090> show<00:04:39.360> you<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:40.440> end<00:04:40.680> result<00:04:40.950> as<00:04:41.910> you

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
spot and show you the end result as you

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.720 
spot and show you the end result as you
can<00:04:42.420> see<00:04:42.810> if<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.200> are<00:04:43.230> careful<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:44.460> can

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
can see if you are careful I can

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.940 
can see if you are careful I can
perfectly<00:04:45.300> see<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:46.260> lower<00:04:46.590> chip<00:04:47.420> but<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:48.950> top

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
perfectly see the lower chip but the top

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.190 
perfectly see the lower chip but the top
one<00:04:51.140> was<00:04:52.140> repaired<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:54.330> good<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:55.020> it's

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
one was repaired so good that it's

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.760 
one was repaired so good that it's
almost<00:04:55.770> invisible<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.820> course<00:04:57.810> if<00:04:58.290> you<00:04:58.560> look

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
almost invisible of course if you look

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.000 
almost invisible of course if you look
from<00:04:59.040> close<00:04:59.460> you<00:05:00.030> can<00:05:00.210> always<00:05:00.390> find<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:01.080> but

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
from close you can always find it but

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.210 
from close you can always find it but
that's<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:03.120> problem<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:04.350> touching<00:05:05.040> up<00:05:05.160> the

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
that's the problem of touching up the

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.430 
that's the problem of touching up the
paint<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.330> cannot<00:05:06.750> be<00:05:07.670> put<00:05:08.670> back<00:05:09.440> absolutely

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
paint it cannot be put back absolutely

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.510 
paint it cannot be put back absolutely
