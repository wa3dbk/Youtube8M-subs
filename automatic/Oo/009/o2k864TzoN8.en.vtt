00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 a few decades ago a scientist from 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.680
 Romania called karpen developed a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.070
 battery and he said it was going to be eternal 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.349
 nobody believed you know that this battery 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.230
 it's still working now it 's in a museum 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.320
 in Romania and it's a true wonder 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.070
 maybe the principle of the solution of the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 eternal energy see you the information 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 with marilÃº carrillo 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.490
 how long have I changed the batteries of the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.990
 remote control of your TV when 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.390
 it was the last time he acquired a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.850
 battery for your car knows how much 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.680
 hard your cell phone battery imagines 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.210
 a battery that can generate energy 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.970
 continuously 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.489
 this is possible so is the stack there and 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.370
 it's called eternal battery was elaborated 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.500
 in 1922 by basile karpen who said that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.989
 would work forever and until today 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.420
 It seems that he was right as he continues 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.150
 working that seems to this invention 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.489
 arrived in 1950 at the technological museum of 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.350
 Romania under the legend machine 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.150
 perpetual movement according to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 Roman newspaper the day he went to the 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.320
 museum with specialists to measure their 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.680
 load verified that this is the same 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.240
 since the day a volt was made 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.460
 The device is composed of a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.830
 gold electrode and other platinum electrode 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.140
 electrolyte is large sulfuric acid 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.210
 purity the engineer and director of the museum 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.470
 like researchers are not 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.480
 100% sure how it works 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.860
 I get the impression that it is a system 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:35.090
 that generates electricity moves the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.060
 engine the engine rotates the blade and the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.990
 blade is connected to the batteries and 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.540
 they are recharging 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.390
 then if the engine consumes less 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.090
 energy of which the pilar of which the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.570
 then the battery is generating the recharge 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.369
 and that's why there are no sensible losses there 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.000
 you know exactly what is there 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.720
 inside the pile because this would allow 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.460
 that all the batteries that will be manufactured will 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.130
 did exactly the same and they had 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.590
 that same durability the same 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.959
 durability an eternity perhaps as 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.480
 said basil karpÃ¡n will we be 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.299
 in front of the battery of eternal energy it 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.209
 could adapt an invention of 1922 to 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.190
 21st century with the same benefit could 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.120
 that we should have a new 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.370
 culture 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.500
 provision of this type of products 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.049
 specifically regarding the stack of 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.090
 meat I think it is to be in favor of 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.370
 technology is to be in favor of a use 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.440
 efficient this battery has been exposed 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.540
 at scientific conferences in paris 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.129
 Bologna Bologna and Bucharest where 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.650
 university researchers 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.810
 they carry out special studies on this 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.790
 gadget that makes this battery of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.680
 eternal energy in the corner of the museum 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.810
 We are talking about a device that 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.450
 according to some positions challenges the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.650
 Second law of thermodynamics 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.200
 modifying our daily life and 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.599
 we would hardly imagine the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.569
 consequences the industrialists do not 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.760
 It is important that we know what we are doing 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.549
 Well, this would be something that could 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.769
 take it the state and could this 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.900
 market it for the benefit of one's own 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.659
 state will consider implementing a 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.730
 battery like this would mean forgetting 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.879
 of changing or recharging and therefore 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.090
 generate less technological waste the 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.500
 Carmen's battery possibly 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.299
 revolutionary in our day to day and 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.519
 that today we can not imagine life without 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.930
 these portable devices that 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.269
 guarantee the operation 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.920
 of different devices from a stack 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.780
 sophisticated as our 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.150
 cell phones like a small 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.700
 for clock or the best known as 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.799
 doubles but none that last as long as 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.379
 Carmen's battery that after almost 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.379
 90 years is still running
