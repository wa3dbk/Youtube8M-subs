00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
Noah the ballista is where it should be

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.930

at<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:23.000> has<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.390> strengths<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.900> weaknesses

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
at it has the strengths and weaknesses

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.210 
at it has the strengths and weaknesses
obviously<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:26.660> differs<00:01:27.110> from<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.320> DSR<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
obviously it differs from the DSR the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.970 
obviously it differs from the DSR the
other<00:01:28.370> main<00:01:28.700> bolt-action<00:01:29.060> rifle<00:01:29.870> in<00:01:30.020> that<00:01:30.680> it

other main bolt-action rifle in that it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.070 
other main bolt-action rifle in that it
is<00:01:31.190> a<00:01:31.220> lot<00:01:31.670> faster<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.180> scope<00:01:32.390> in<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.780> pull<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
is a lot faster to scope in and pull the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.770 
is a lot faster to scope in and pull the
bolt<00:01:33.260> action<00:01:33.800> there<00:01:34.250> pull<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.520> bolt<00:01:34.730> back<00:01:34.780> but

bolt action there pull the bolt back but

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.060 
bolt action there pull the bolt back but
the<00:01:36.080> trade-off<00:01:36.290> is<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.740> course<00:01:36.830> it's

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
the trade-off is that of course it's

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.200 
the trade-off is that of course it's
weaker<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.230> Bob<00:01:39.230> feel<00:01:39.760> sorry<00:01:40.760> for<00:01:41.000> those<00:01:41.060> very

question<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.620> then<00:01:54.800> why<00:01:54.980> is<00:01:55.040> this<00:01:55.310> such<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.550> late

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
question is then why is this such a late

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.090 
question is then why is this such a late
unlock<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.290> we<00:01:57.410> kind<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.650> can<00:01:57.890> look

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
unlock and so that we kind of can look

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.060 
unlock and so that we kind of can look
back<00:01:58.310> at<00:01:58.640> folder<00:01:59.240> cogs<00:01:59.830> specifically<00:02:00.830> black

the psg-1 was a sniper rifle that was
like<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.170> last<00:02:06.320> unlock<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.250> was<00:02:07.400> not<00:02:07.580> one

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
like the last unlock and it was not one

hit kill until much later we had this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.500 
hit kill until much later we had this
patch<00:02:10.819> that<00:02:11.739> somehow<00:02:12.739> gave<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:14.090> ability

in itself and how that could even work

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.080 
in itself and how that could even work
but<00:02:20.660> um<00:02:21.220> eventually<00:02:22.220> later<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.819> people

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
but um eventually later on people

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030 
but um eventually later on people
complain<00:02:23.540> enough<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.260> psg1<00:02:24.799> was

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
complain enough that the psg1 was

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.059 
complain enough that the psg1 was
patched<00:02:25.249> again<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.909> it<00:02:25.969> became<00:02:26.239> pregnant

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069

without the without the spring so um
what<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.430> can<00:02:33.579> learn<00:02:33.609> is<00:02:33.939> that<00:02:34.030> pretty<00:02:34.180> much<00:02:34.389> is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
what we can learn is that pretty much is

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.599 
what we can learn is that pretty much is
the<00:02:34.569> POC<00:02:34.780> one<00:02:35.109> all<00:02:35.230> over<00:02:35.260> again<00:02:35.739> but<00:02:36.249> this<00:02:36.549> time

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
the POC one all over again but this time

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.660 
the POC one all over again but this time
around<00:02:36.939> we<00:02:37.180> might<00:02:37.209> not<00:02:37.780> see<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:38.530> patch<00:02:39.340> to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
around we might not see a patch to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.940 
around we might not see a patch to
increase<00:02:39.999> this<00:02:40.599> one's<00:02:40.870> damage<00:02:41.319> as<00:02:41.560> we<00:02:41.799> do

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
increase this one's damage as we do

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.149 
increase this one's damage as we do
already<00:02:42.249> have<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.849> DSR<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:44.290> xbr<00:02:44.799> as<00:02:45.010> our

already have the DSR and the xbr as our

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.709 
already have the DSR and the xbr as our

main bleeding sniper rifles and black
ops<00:02:46.900> 2<00:02:47.139> so<00:02:48.040> we<00:02:48.370> might<00:02:48.519> not<00:02:48.700> need<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.689> xbr<00:02:50.139> could

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
ops 2 so we might not need the xbr could

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.069 
ops 2 so we might not need the xbr could
be<00:02:50.439> you<00:02:50.680> know<00:02:50.799> as<00:02:51.069> overpowered<00:02:51.609> and<00:02:52.079> personal

be you know as overpowered and personal

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.659 
be you know as overpowered and personal
like<00:02:53.230> where<00:02:53.379> it's<00:02:53.500> at<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.739> know<00:02:53.859> it's<00:02:54.099> it

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
like where it's at you know it's it

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.099 
like where it's at you know it's it
gives<00:02:54.879> it<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> really<00:02:55.269> nice<00:02:55.450> challenge<00:02:55.719> and

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
gives it a really nice challenge and

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.110 
gives it a really nice challenge and
well-being<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:57.489> gives<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.730> really<00:02:57.969> nice

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
well-being it gives it really nice

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.520 
well-being it gives it really nice
challenge<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.659> whole<00:02:58.780> quickscoping<00:02:59.319> thing

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
challenge the whole quickscoping thing

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.789 
challenge the whole quickscoping thing
enough<00:02:59.829> as<00:03:00.010> already<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:02.260> does<00:03:02.409> scoping<00:03:02.739> a

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
enough as already is it does scoping a

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.589 
enough as already is it does scoping a
lot<00:03:02.919> faster<00:03:03.069> so<00:03:03.519> its<00:03:03.700> strength<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.209> definitely

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
lot faster so its strength is definitely

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.869 
lot faster so its strength is definitely
there<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:06.250> know<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.340> think<00:03:06.549> it's<00:03:06.639> worth<00:03:06.790> it

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
there and you know I think it's worth it

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.819 
there and you know I think it's worth it
we<00:03:07.000> should<00:03:07.060> all<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:07.449> get<00:03:08.260> used<00:03:08.409> to<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.620> game

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
we should all just get used to the game

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.659 
we should all just get used to the game
and<00:03:09.040> learn<00:03:09.909> to<00:03:10.060> play<00:03:10.209> its<00:03:10.359> strengths<00:03:10.930> but<00:03:11.889> now

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
and learn to play its strengths but now

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.550 
and learn to play its strengths but now
that's<00:03:12.939> pretty<00:03:13.120> much<00:03:13.239> over<00:03:13.449> very<00:03:13.930> quickly<00:03:14.109> I

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
that's pretty much over very quickly I

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.559 
that's pretty much over very quickly I
didn't<00:03:15.159> expect<00:03:15.459> this<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:15.939> take<00:03:16.060> social

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
didn't expect this to take social

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.559 
didn't expect this to take social
already<00:03:16.930> had<00:03:17.079> like<00:03:17.370> my<00:03:18.370> commentary<00:03:19.209> notes<00:03:19.419> and

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
already had like my commentary notes and

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.119 
already had like my commentary notes and
all<00:03:19.689> of<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.260> want<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.799> talk<00:03:20.889> about<00:03:20.919> the

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
all of that I want to talk about the

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.860 
all of that I want to talk about the
gameplay<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.489> bit<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.939> is<00:03:22.510> now<00:03:22.689> we're

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
gameplay a bit and is now we're

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.860 
gameplay a bit and is now we're
transitioning<00:03:23.349> to<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.590> drone<00:03:23.829> gameplay<00:03:24.870> I've

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
transitioning to the drone gameplay I've

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.250 
transitioning to the drone gameplay I've
obviously<00:03:26.169> had<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:27.329> change<00:03:28.329> our<00:03:28.480> place<00:03:28.719> a<00:03:28.750> lot

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
obviously had to change our place a lot

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.869 
obviously had to change our place a lot
as<00:03:29.500> far<00:03:29.530> as<00:03:29.769> quickscoping<00:03:30.310> goes<00:03:30.489> because<00:03:30.819> a

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
as far as quickscoping goes because a

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.759 
as far as quickscoping goes because a
lot<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.269> maps<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.750> my<00:03:31.959> opinion<00:03:32.259> aren't

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
lot of the maps in my opinion aren't

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.069 
lot of the maps in my opinion aren't
that<00:03:32.889> great<00:03:33.159> there<00:03:34.060> are<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.659> little<00:03:34.930> bit

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
that great there are a little bit

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.270 
that great there are a little bit
cramped<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.680> they<00:03:35.739> have<00:03:35.889> too<00:03:36.159> many

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
cramped and that they have too many

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.770

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
areas to go without that much open area

areas to go without that much open area
turbine<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.959> an<00:03:41.139> example<00:03:41.409> of<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.680> very<00:03:41.709> open<00:03:42.009> map

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
turbine is an example of a very open map

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.569 
turbine is an example of a very open map
a<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:43.120> open<00:03:43.329> map<00:03:43.629> though<00:03:43.870> in<00:03:44.229> my<00:03:45.009> opinion<00:03:45.040> did

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
a to open map though in my opinion did

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.390 
a to open map though in my opinion did
still<00:03:45.879> is<00:03:46.209> just<00:03:47.019> too<00:03:47.169> many<00:03:47.349> levels<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:48.159> height

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
still is just too many levels of height

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.369 
still is just too many levels of height
and<00:03:48.669> it's<00:03:49.000> just<00:03:49.180> really<00:03:49.389> like<00:03:49.720> it's<00:03:50.199> really

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
and it's just really like it's really

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.199 
and it's just really like it's really
parent<00:03:50.799> I'm<00:03:50.979> really<00:03:51.340> paranoid<00:03:51.699> playing<00:03:52.030> on<00:03:52.120> my

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
parent I'm really paranoid playing on my

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.219 
parent I'm really paranoid playing on my
map<00:03:52.389> because<00:03:52.540> there's<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:52.959> so<00:03:53.079> many

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
map because there's just so many

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.089 
map because there's just so many
different<00:03:53.500> places<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.609> be<00:03:54.729> snipe<00:03:54.970> from<00:03:55.120> and

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
different places to be snipe from and

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.080 
different places to be snipe from and
pretty<00:03:57.099> much<00:03:57.159> only<00:03:57.430> way<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.609> play<00:03:57.699> that<00:03:57.909> map<00:03:58.060> is

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
pretty much only way to play that map is

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.839 
pretty much only way to play that map is
from<00:03:58.569> sniping<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.370> this<00:04:00.370> is<00:04:00.489> another<00:04:00.669> word

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
from sniping and this is another word

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.580 
from sniping and this is another word
map<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.419> just<00:04:01.540> have<00:04:01.720> one<00:04:01.959> huge<00:04:02.349> line

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
map is that you just have one huge line

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.009 
map is that you just have one huge line
of<00:04:02.620> sight<00:04:03.389> down<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:04.540> middle<00:04:04.689> and<00:04:04.810> then<00:04:04.930> you

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
of sight down the middle and then you

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.530 
of sight down the middle and then you
have<00:04:05.169> both<00:04:05.409> of<00:04:05.620> these<00:04:05.879> these<00:04:06.879> rooms<00:04:07.299> on<00:04:07.479> the

right side where I'm currently from yet
because<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.579> was<00:04:09.729> a<00:04:09.790> guy<00:04:09.939> and<00:04:11.310> these<00:04:12.449> like<00:04:13.449> the

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
because I was a guy and these like the

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.899 
because I was a guy and these like the
hold<00:04:14.019> like<00:04:14.199> tunnel<00:04:14.590> area<00:04:14.739> down<00:04:15.159> below<00:04:15.189> on<00:04:15.790> the

hold like tunnel area down below on the
left<00:04:16.090> side<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:17.709> do<00:04:18.669> play<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.060> bit<00:04:19.269> campy<00:04:19.479> on

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
left side and I do play a bit campy on

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.300 
left side and I do play a bit campy on
this<00:04:19.870> one<00:04:20.049> it's<00:04:20.380> honest<00:04:20.859> like<00:04:20.979> one<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:21.190> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
this one it's honest like one of the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.879 
this one it's honest like one of the
main<00:04:21.459> ways<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.909> just<00:04:22.090> get<00:04:22.240> by<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:22.719> map<00:04:22.930> but

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
main ways to just get by on this map but

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.100 
main ways to just get by on this map but
I<00:04:24.300> still<00:04:25.300> thought<00:04:25.419> I<00:04:25.509> was<00:04:25.630> very<00:04:25.719> entertaining

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
I still thought I was very entertaining

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.230 
I still thought I was very entertaining
that<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.380> got<00:04:26.560> my<00:04:26.650> killstreaks<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.400> now<00:04:28.090> we're

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
that I got my killstreaks and now we're

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.850 
that I got my killstreaks and now we're
starting<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.539> see<00:04:28.599> that<00:04:28.870> I'm<00:04:29.050> much<00:04:29.710> more

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
starting to see that I'm much more

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.010 
starting to see that I'm much more
comfortable<00:04:30.009> in<00:04:30.310> this<00:04:30.370> game<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.820> think<00:04:31.539> this<00:04:31.870> is

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
comfortable in this game I think this is

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.510 
comfortable in this game I think this is
like<00:04:32.229> a<00:04:32.409> while<00:04:32.620> back<00:04:32.919> i'm<00:04:33.250> currently

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
like a while back i'm currently

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.899 
like a while back i'm currently
prestiged<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.330> like<00:04:34.719> level<00:04:35.279> 20<00:04:36.279> i<00:04:36.310> think<00:04:36.610> maybe

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
prestiged to like level 20 i think maybe

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.110 
prestiged to like level 20 i think maybe
not<00:04:37.180> even<00:04:37.210> there<00:04:37.599> yet<00:04:38.460> but<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.610> is<00:04:39.669> before

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
not even there yet but this is before

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.640 
not even there yet but this is before
the<00:04:40.240> prestige<00:04:40.539> i<00:04:40.750> had<00:04:40.870> blue<00:04:41.080> camel<00:04:41.500> on<00:04:41.529> my

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
the prestige i had blue camel on my

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.350 
the prestige i had blue camel on my
ballista<00:04:42.099> and<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.370> was<00:04:42.490> just<00:04:42.789> starting<00:04:42.969> to<00:04:43.150> use

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
ballista and I was just starting to use

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.709 
ballista and I was just starting to use
a<00:04:43.389> sniper<00:04:43.719> and<00:04:45.330> obviously<00:04:46.330> you<00:04:46.389> can<00:04:46.510> see<00:04:46.599> I'm

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:46.719 
a sniper and obviously you can see I'm

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:51.450 
a sniper and obviously you can see I'm
already<00:04:46.750> used<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.229> it<00:04:47.289> and<00:04:47.940> I'm<00:04:48.940> camping<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:51.130> is

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
already used to it and I'm camping it is

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.830 
already used to it and I'm camping it is
a<00:04:51.580> little<00:04:51.729> bit<00:04:51.849> difficult<00:04:52.029> to<00:04:52.270> say<00:04:52.419> but<00:04:52.479> on

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
a little bit difficult to say but on

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.839 
a little bit difficult to say but on
this<00:04:53.440> map<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.949> personally<00:04:54.190> don't<00:04:54.460> see<00:04:54.669> that

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
this map I personally don't see that

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.120 
this map I personally don't see that
many<00:04:55.000> other<00:04:55.300> you<00:04:56.260> know<00:04:56.289> ways<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.740> deal<00:04:57.039> with

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
many other you know ways to deal with

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.700 
many other you know ways to deal with
this<00:04:57.279> which<00:04:57.490> because<00:04:57.729> of<00:04:57.760> spawn<00:04:58.060> systems

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
this which because of spawn systems

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.379 
this which because of spawn systems
sponsors<00:04:59.710> aren't<00:05:00.099> entirely<00:05:00.250> perfect<00:05:00.520> yet<00:05:00.880> if

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
sponsors aren't entirely perfect yet if

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.790 
sponsors aren't entirely perfect yet if
you're<00:05:01.690> up<00:05:01.870> here<00:05:01.900> playing<00:05:02.320> this<00:05:02.529> spot<00:05:02.770> and

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
you're up here playing this spot and

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.709 
you're up here playing this spot and
right<00:05:03.639> now<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.820> can<00:05:03.969> see<00:05:04.089> that<00:05:04.120> my<00:05:04.360> green

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 
right now you can see that my green

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.060 
right now you can see that my green
targets<00:05:05.169> on<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.320> left<00:05:05.500> are<00:05:05.650> starting<00:05:05.889> to<00:05:05.919> move

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
targets on the left are starting to move

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.459 
targets on the left are starting to move
up<00:05:06.219> it<00:05:06.370> into<00:05:06.639> the<00:05:06.760> building<00:05:07.539> babies<00:05:08.380> are

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
up it into the building babies are

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.159 
up it into the building babies are
they're<00:05:08.560> gonna<00:05:08.650> start<00:05:08.919> spawning<00:05:09.159> like<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:10.169> my

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
they're gonna start spawning like to my

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.930 
they're gonna start spawning like to my
back<00:05:11.380> left<00:05:11.680> which<00:05:12.039> I<00:05:12.250> think<00:05:12.460> I'm<00:05:12.580> gonna<00:05:12.669> check

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
back left which I think I'm gonna check

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.649 
back left which I think I'm gonna check
in<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.120> little<00:05:13.300> bit<00:05:13.449> but<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:14.550> also<00:05:15.550> hijacked<00:05:16.120> is

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
in a little bit but it also hijacked is

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.870 
in a little bit but it also hijacked is
the<00:05:17.320> worst<00:05:17.589> yes<00:05:17.949> he's<00:05:18.219> already<00:05:18.580> spawning

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
the worst yes he's already spawning

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.839
