00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.869
 city and great each one to his companion 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.659
 because it is easy jehovah with this great 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.060
 will be answered because 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.250
 they left the jehovah covenant to their god and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.860
 they worshiped other gods and served them 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.380
 do not weep the dead or of them when 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.140
 the jce I nothing bitterly for the one who 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.479
 goes because he will never come back or see the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.729
 land where he was born because he said 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.340
 jehovah about health son of Josiah 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.380
 king of Judah who reigned instead of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.899
 jose to his father and he came out of this 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 place will not come back here but 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.240
 will die in the place where they took him 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.789
 captive and you will not see this land anymore 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.039
 he who builds his house without justice and his 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.409
 room without equity using his 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.409
 bucket and not giving him the salary 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.289
 of your work that says build for me 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.509
 spacious house is airy and you 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.420
 open windows and cover it with cedar and the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.060
 Vermillion paint will reign because you 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.489
 Cedar rodeos did not eat and drank your 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.319
 father and he did justice and justice and 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.510
 then it went well 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.569
 I judge the cause of the afflicted and the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.689
 needy and then it was fine is not 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.700

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.799

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.920
 greed and to shed innocent blood 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.230
 and for oppression and to do wrong for 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.799
 so much has said jehovah about 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.129

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.540
 throwing him out of the doors of 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.930
 jerusalem goes up to lebanon claims and 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.250
 they pack your voice and everywhere 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.069
