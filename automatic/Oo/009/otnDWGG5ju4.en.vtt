this installer has done is installed
these<00:00:28.140> two<00:00:28.470> main<00:00:29.189> drains

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.299 

there's<00:00:34.250> your<00:00:34.399> main<00:00:34.550> drain<00:00:34.879> fitting<00:00:36.039> but<00:00:37.039> what

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
there's your main drain fitting but what

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.290 
there's your main drain fitting but what
what<00:00:37.550> he<00:00:37.670> did<00:00:37.910> was<00:00:38.149> he<00:00:38.390> ran<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.260> flex<00:00:40.100> line

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
what he did was he ran the flex line

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.600 
what he did was he ran the flex line
directly<00:00:41.300> into<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.809> 90<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.590> then<00:00:43.160> ran<00:00:43.460> it

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
directly into the 90 and then ran it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.200 
directly into the 90 and then ran it
around<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.030> outside<00:00:45.100> of<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.280> pool<00:00:46.489> was<00:00:46.790> in<00:00:46.969> it

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
around the outside of the pool was in it

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.020 
around the outside of the pool was in it
was<00:00:47.360> in<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:47.780> fashion<00:00:48.370> approximately<00:00:49.370> and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
was in this fashion approximately and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.630 
was in this fashion approximately and
the<00:00:50.149> problem<00:00:50.570> with<00:00:50.720> that<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:51.199> if<00:00:52.100> there's<00:00:52.370> any

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
the problem with that is if there's any

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.610 
the problem with that is if there's any
settling<00:00:53.300> whatsoever<00:00:53.960> in<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.229> backfill

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
settling whatsoever in the backfill

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.889 
settling whatsoever in the backfill
material<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.699> because<00:00:56.120> this<00:00:56.329> pool<00:00:56.629> was<00:00:56.870> built

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
material and because this pool was built

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.250 
material and because this pool was built
in<00:00:57.769> backfill<00:00:58.250> good<00:00:58.519> sand<00:00:58.879> there<00:00:59.449> absolutely

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
in backfill good sand there absolutely

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.350 
in backfill good sand there absolutely
was<00:01:00.500> sadly<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:01.010> matter<00:01:01.159> of<00:01:01.280> fact<00:01:01.460> we<00:01:01.940> found<00:01:02.210> a

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
was sadly a matter of fact we found a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.380 
was sadly a matter of fact we found a
foot<00:01:02.750> or<00:01:02.870> two<00:01:02.899> of<00:01:03.260> air<00:01:03.879> between<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.149> concrete

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
foot or two of air between the concrete

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.410 
foot or two of air between the concrete
and<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.140> apron<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.789> backfill<00:01:08.210> when

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
and the apron of the the backfill when

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.830 
and the apron of the the backfill when
we<00:01:08.570> let<00:01:08.869> me<00:01:08.990> open<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:09.710> up<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:10.880> actually<00:01:11.600> it

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
we let me open it up it actually it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.719 
we let me open it up it actually it
pushes<00:01:12.259> on<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.649> on<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.039> flex<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:13.580> can

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
pushes on the on the flex and you can

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.480 
pushes on the on the flex and you can
see<00:01:13.940> it's<00:01:14.119> turned<00:01:14.450> that<00:01:14.690> fitting<00:01:15.050> down<00:01:15.490> and

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
see it's turned that fitting down and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.980 
see it's turned that fitting down and
it's<00:01:17.030> only<00:01:17.179> a<00:01:17.240> matter<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.509> time<00:01:17.600> between

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
it's only a matter of time between

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.680 
it's only a matter of time between
before<00:01:18.740> either<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.310> pool<00:01:19.640> will<00:01:20.240> break<00:01:20.479> and

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
before either the pool will break and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.540 
before either the pool will break and
fracture<00:01:21.200> which<00:01:21.649> is<00:01:21.830> why<00:01:21.979> there's<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:22.399> much

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
fracture which is why there's so much

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.980 
fracture which is why there's so much
silicone<00:01:23.000> put<00:01:23.270> on<00:01:23.360> here<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:23.690> kind<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:23.899> a

fitting going in below grade it's

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.770 
fitting going in below grade it's
important<00:01:42.319> that<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:43.390> fitting<00:01:44.390> is<00:01:44.509> plumbed

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
important that the fitting is plumbed

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.089 
important that the fitting is plumbed
with<00:01:44.959> rigid<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:46.060> brought<00:01:47.060> straight<00:01:47.599> up<00:01:48.099> until

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099 
with rigid and brought straight up until

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:50.889 
with rigid and brought straight up until
it<00:01:49.550> gets<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.849> the<00:01:49.879> top<00:01:50.149> of<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.360> pool<00:01:50.539> and<00:01:50.720> then

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
it gets to the top of the pool and then

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.540 
it gets to the top of the pool and then
we<00:01:51.080> connect<00:01:51.440> our<00:01:51.560> flex<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.160> that's<00:01:52.280> really

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
we connect our flex and that's really

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.839 
we connect our flex and that's really
the<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:53.060> only<00:01:53.209> way<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.509> make<00:01:54.259> certain<00:01:54.500> that

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
the the only way to make certain that

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.440 
the the only way to make certain that
