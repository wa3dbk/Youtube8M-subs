00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.480 
around the book curse of the world what
am<00:06:14.510> I<00:06:14.600> saying<00:06:14.930> I<00:06:15.290> guess<00:06:15.770> this<00:06:15.950> is<00:06:16.010> what<00:06:16.130> happens

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
am I saying I guess this is what happens

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.130 
am I saying I guess this is what happens
when<00:06:16.640> you<00:06:16.820> already<00:06:17.060> shot<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.390> episode<00:06:17.930> and

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
when you already shot the episode and

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.870 
when you already shot the episode and
then<00:06:18.470> you<00:06:18.590> go<00:06:18.740> to<00:06:18.800> edit<00:06:19.160> it<00:06:19.460> and<00:06:19.580> you<00:06:19.640> realize

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
then you go to edit it and you realize

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.910 
then you go to edit it and you realize
the<00:06:20.150> whole<00:06:20.180> thing<00:06:20.540> is<00:06:20.720> fried<00:06:21.020> on<00:06:21.200> the<00:06:21.230> p2<00:06:21.590> card

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
the whole thing is fried on the p2 card

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.200 
the whole thing is fried on the p2 card
and<00:06:22.130> you<00:06:22.370> got<00:06:22.520> to<00:06:22.610> shoot<00:06:22.760> the<00:06:22.880> whole<00:06:23.030> thing

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
and you got to shoot the whole thing

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.230 
and you got to shoot the whole thing
again<00:06:23.300> I<00:06:23.690> guess<00:06:24.020> that's<00:06:24.230> what<00:06:24.380> happens<00:06:24.530> I

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
again I guess that's what happens I

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.990 
again I guess that's what happens I
guess<00:06:26.240> that's<00:06:26.450> what<00:06:26.600> happens
