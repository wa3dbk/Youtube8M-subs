00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
think the easiest way to get it will

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.780 
think the easiest way to get it will
just<00:05:10.139> be<00:05:12.169> pair<00:05:13.169> ups<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:13.560> Grizzlies<00:05:13.979> just<00:05:14.610> put

and you can that's the easiest way to
get<00:06:24.430> right<00:06:25.430> here<00:06:25.610> I<00:06:25.639> think<00:06:25.879> I<00:06:25.940> go<00:06:26.090> in<00:06:26.240> there<00:06:26.360> and

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
get right here I think I go in there and

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.480 
get right here I think I go in there and
destroy<00:06:26.780> his<00:06:26.930> base<00:06:27.110> so<00:06:27.319> they're<00:06:27.440> 15<00:06:27.919> seconds

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
destroy his base so they're 15 seconds

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.059 
destroy his base so they're 15 seconds
with<00:06:28.669> just<00:06:28.849> three<00:06:29.120> units<00:06:29.690> that<00:06:30.500> aren't<00:06:30.710> scared

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:31.069 
with just three units that aren't scared

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:32.129 
with just three units that aren't scared
of<00:06:31.219> something<00:06:31.460> come<00:06:31.639> on

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
of something come on

of something come on
but<00:06:33.139> your<00:06:33.560> probability<00:06:33.979> of<00:06:34.280> getting<00:06:34.580> a<00:06:34.819> hey<00:06:35.060> uh

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
but your probability of getting a hey uh

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.740 
but your probability of getting a hey uh
a<00:06:36.069> fourteen<00:06:37.069> star<00:06:37.400> is<00:06:37.669> like<00:06:39.819> slim<00:06:40.819> let's<00:06:41.509> just

say slim I mean you have more of a

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.610 
say slim I mean you have more of a
chance<00:06:44.240> of<00:06:44.389> getting<00:06:44.449> hit<00:06:44.870> in<00:06:45.050> the<00:06:45.080> head<00:06:45.590> with
