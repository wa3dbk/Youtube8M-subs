00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.400

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:38.740
 the staff is here with michel is going to 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.460

 finally the mayors will start 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.860
 talking about the expensive passion with which you 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.259
 arrived in this world fell in love with 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.800
 squares at last says a little how it 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.229
 that 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.150
 it is actually a passion for children and 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.399
 coming from a family, right? 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.910
 As a child, my father always had the 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:10.509
 campus there and train 45 and 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.459
 among 11 had a parati 86 looks this 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.989
 there was in memory for being a car of the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.590
 family for being a travel car 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:23.380
 Thats right, it's exactly a parati 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.250
 in a world of people's cars 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.959
 said a bit about it but has a 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.239
 It's kind of dry, but it has a lot of feeling. 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.760
 involved in this passion car is no more than 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.250
 father to son I'm going to grandson just one 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.829
 thing is very interesting happened 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.220
 with me also now one side only this 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:46.090
 expensive car is model at last spoke details 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.100
 So tell me how you found the car is a 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.350
 six months before the purchase and that today 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.130
 There are four I'm with her four months. 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.310
 and it is a searching and unsuccessful time 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.630
 because he finds a lot of cars but with 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.700
 little quality per purpose is there 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:08.320
 this table of the line generates this was the 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.950
 second that I came across and that special 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.230
 It's gls 1.8 89 so it called a lot 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.120
 attention to the details of the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.390
 conservation of the legal 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.970
 and because it is the inner detail in truth 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.640
 internal observation was what is girl 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.989
 Car eye and left closed the 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.530
 I bought it the moment I opened the doors 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.440
 and evil inside of it for those who do not know the 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.709
 gls and talks to the optional as it comes 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.700
 it is usually the same as the 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.890
 geely ne 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.890
 however she says the banks have already said 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.760
 I will recuse that it is the boy from 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.079
 guys andrÃ© is this on the line 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.720
 professionals is an account with trio 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.209
 electric and it came in very 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.989
 That's good, it already comes with headlights. 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.299
 fog is the cap already comes from series brings 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.209
 new details well already has a certain 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.209
 refinement in Jorge is distinguished by 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.849
 these particular agents is very 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.099
 very cool is an icon who knows 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:12.700
 apparatchiks gls knows that it is an icon of 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.959
 square culture finally now only for 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.030
 we finalize that we would like it 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.919
 talk down a feedback talks to who 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.320
 found the perfect square design 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.080
 What are you thinking about that nucleus of 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.200
 relationship with the cool is exactly 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.919
 as well as the criterion of finding a car 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.070
 whole in finding people a group 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.410
 that maintained a criterion one 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.280
 legal quality and choice of 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.160
 care and which is the mayor came to supply 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.810
 so when I asked to join the group 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.389
 I've come across a criterion with a 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.430
 staffing session is well that it is well 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.410
 discerning and demanding and you follow this 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.900
 so it is not necessary to keep 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.760
 The quality is also very good and there 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.070
 modesty aside I like the sensational 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.130
 has participated in some discussions 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.780
 and I see quality see the inspired galley 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.510
 and always offer culture a culture 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.030
 honest is the hype andrade sent to the field 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.070
 michel was a pleasure and will continue 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.150
 being a pleasure because the project 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.510
 a perfect nucleus of 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.790
 relationship we want 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.850
 is more personal than really 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.400
 I really like culture models of 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.450
 a form respected as classics of 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.500
 That's true. 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.500
 Thanks
