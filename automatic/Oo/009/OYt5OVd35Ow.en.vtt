00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.920
 this day - do everything possible on the premises 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.549
 so to do this we need two couples 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:15.279
 an Apple 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.279
 we're going to need some potatoes and I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 some fighters 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.900
 a little chickpeas flying a little box 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.169
 then about 100 grams of co2 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:28.439
 without big reasons 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.949
 in the studio 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.240
 of these powerful shakes 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 a little bit of trouble 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.580
 saffron 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.820
 and the equivalent of a small box 2% 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.760
 Tomato concentrate 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.240
 of course some nice slices of niro 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
 May 2, 2010 and pepper at first that run this 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.420
 cut the fruits cut the apples into wedges 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.560
 cut the countries of the mainland jump but then we can attack 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.870
 directly 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 still cooking at work at first I started putting 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.360
 olive oil I do in my wife xie 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.450
 chan put a good amount 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.120
 for these fish 6 million chf 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.510
 and so still a little but we really want the braiding will not be 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.270
 very fed as with chicken lamb 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.940
 here I have an idea 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.180
 a little more olive oil than usual 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.260
 then 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
 we will start by preparing 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.210
 % our tomato sauce 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.710
 with the ex-powers without hindrance 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 tomato paste 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 s 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 in the world 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.730
 these are it turns out we are 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 so it's a mixture of pigments to conclude this route 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.570
 I came out 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.870
 after 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 philipp hildebrand 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.879
 I do not know how to use a base for broth 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.999
 bergeron 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.619
 resf v 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:31.760
 this is a good thing 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.760
 rather strong 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.729
 so I slept 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.729
 here is a friend to come back with us and they want to read 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.509
 so it's time to add not chick 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.089
 about 100 grams of butter 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.089
 two neighbors 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.429
 p I will let his surroundings come back 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:20.899
 three minutes 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:25.219
 the basis of couscous and rookie in the world did he add on the other his 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.219
 Father 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:36.299
 i was charged 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 but he searches 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:43.289
 dissatisfied neighborhood 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:49.849
 what purpose 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.849
 narbonne 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.309
 why but like the government 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.309
 in time to dive in the water but not with the group 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.659
 the man is no longer in France 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.659
 after having flamed 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.340
 Why 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.459
 we are located in 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.379
 about 35 minutes 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.650
 on the contrary we honked had already done 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.180
 I will not take care of the customs at the level of the rise +8 points 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.949
 ap and we see goal situations 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.949
 Fourty-five minutes 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.180
 these deployments and why the post 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.569
 6 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.569
 I am proud 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.689
 but for that he considering 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.100
 benmouloud couscous cooked with vegetables and fruits over 25 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.029
 minutes 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.309
 is not just good taste our community 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.580
 the Congolese badger added 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.789
 in the office 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.340
 but it's a mistake 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.990
 a small garden 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.990
 when the fish are busy very quickly 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.919
 button which was also perfumer an error 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.569
 profusely 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.400
 volume 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.400
 I will see click the mans 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.199
 to know 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.249
 the sact france 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.249
 what I want is to stay in the game 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.439
 I am convinced that if the judge follows 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.159
 hush hush hush hush it's not easy 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.659
 but on the year 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.930
 a quarter of an hour after him but between Iran 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:19.860
 many of which go to bed and ready to be served 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.860
 so why then what are we going to do we do what we can do 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:28.190
 with a dozen jobs he was an eminence mold the vegetables 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.270
 above the fish for julie 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.270
 it's going to be super nice and it's going to be great 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.589
 the couscous to the fish that is injured 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:40.479
 or it's a soubirous couscous big apple p it's not me 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.009

 Yes
