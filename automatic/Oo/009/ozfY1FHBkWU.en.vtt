unique<00:01:22.560> feature<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.130> light<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> fact

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
unique feature of this light is the fact

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.620 
unique feature of this light is the fact
that<00:01:24.179> it<00:01:24.389> has<00:01:24.539> a<00:01:24.569> light<00:01:24.899> ring<00:01:25.350> around<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.950> edge

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
that it has a light ring around the edge

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
that it has a light ring around the edge
which<00:01:27.630> I'll<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.079> turn<00:01:29.069> some<00:01:29.310> lights<00:01:29.340> off

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
which I'll just turn some lights off

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.239 
which I'll just turn some lights off
here<00:01:32.240> which<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.270> glows<00:01:33.929> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.259> dark<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
here which just glows in the dark so if

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.849 
here which just glows in the dark so if
you<00:01:35.369> place<00:01:35.639> it<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> desktop<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.869> example<00:01:37.850> so

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
you place it on a desktop for example so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:49.830 
you place it on a desktop for example so
it<00:01:40.859> gives<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.310> 360<00:01:41.969> degree<00:01:42.719> illumination

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.020 

would<00:01:50.840> work<00:01:51.079> obviously<00:01:52.070> perfectly<00:01:52.909> as<00:01:53.000> a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
would work obviously perfectly as a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.709 
would work obviously perfectly as a
keychain<00:01:53.299> light<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.820> also<00:01:55.820> as<00:01:56.060> an<00:01:56.240> ultra

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
keychain light and also as an ultra
