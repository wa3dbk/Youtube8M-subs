00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.380 
reason I wanted to get the one row is
the<00:01:46.649> third<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.250> top<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.700> some<00:01:47.820> thirds<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the third on top and some thirds on the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.899 
the third on top and some thirds on the
bottom

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
bottom

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.850 
bottom
because<00:01:49.659> if<00:01:49.899> I<00:01:50.020> got<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.350> window<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:50.710> was

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
because if I got the window that was

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.499 
because if I got the window that was
divided<00:01:51.340> right<00:01:51.490> down<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.820> middle<00:01:51.850> was<00:01:52.299> right

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
divided right down the middle was right

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.929 
divided right down the middle was right
at<00:01:52.659> my<00:01:52.780> eye<00:01:52.810> height<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:54.340> didn't<00:01:54.610> want<00:01:54.789> to

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
at my eye height and I didn't want to

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.609 
at my eye height and I didn't want to
have<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.240> have<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.450> right<00:01:55.840> there<00:01:56.079> so<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:56.320> got

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
have to have that right there so I got

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.029 
have to have that right there so I got
the<00:01:56.770> 1/3<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.430> 2/3<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:59.289> then<00:01:59.470> sometimes<00:01:59.920> I

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
the 1/3 and 2/3 and and then sometimes I

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.130 
the 1/3 and 2/3 and and then sometimes I
even<00:02:00.159> lower<00:02:00.490> my<00:02:00.729> curtain<00:02:01.119> so<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.420> it<00:02:01.539> comes

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
even lower my curtain so that it comes

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.630 
even lower my curtain so that it comes
down<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.500> play<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.799> clock<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.189> bar<00:02:03.369> comes

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
down to play the clock the bar comes

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.700
