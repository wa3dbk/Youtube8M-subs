Google product as we just heard peter
behrens<00:00:56.550> say<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.239> why<00:00:58.170> were<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.379> needing<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
behrens say so why were they needing to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.930 
behrens say so why were they needing to
gather<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> information<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> first

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
gather this information in the first

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.580 
gather this information in the first
place<00:01:00.120> well<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.870> being<00:01:01.140> used<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
place well it's not being used for a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.840 
place well it's not being used for a
Google<00:01:01.829> product<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> thinking<00:01:02.730> behind

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
Google product but the thinking behind

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.939 
Google product but the thinking behind
it<00:01:03.210> at<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> time<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.170> might<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.860> been

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
it at the time was it might have been

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.920 
it at the time was it might have been
used<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.280> Google<00:01:05.549> product<00:01:05.760> when<00:01:06.450> Street

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
used for a Google product when Street

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.240 
used for a Google product when Street
View<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.409> started<00:01:07.740> coming<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
View they started coming up with the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.740 
View they started coming up with the
idea<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.580> basically<00:01:08.880> mapping<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.420> streets

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
idea of basically mapping your streets

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.060 
idea of basically mapping your streets
and<00:01:09.900> taking<00:01:10.110> pics<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.439> everywhere<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.979> was

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
and taking pics of everywhere it was

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.609 
and taking pics of everywhere it was
about<00:01:11.250> 34<00:01:11.820> years<00:01:12.030> ago<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.479> GPS<00:01:13.140> wasn't<00:01:13.470> very

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
about 34 years ago and GPS wasn't very

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.200 
about 34 years ago and GPS wasn't very
prevalent<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.310> certainly<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:14.820> still

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
prevalent and certainly it was still

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.999 
prevalent and certainly it was still
quite<00:01:15.299> an<00:01:15.450> expensive<00:01:15.659> bit<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.080> kit<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.890> what

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
quite an expensive bit of kit so what

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.560 
quite an expensive bit of kit so what
they<00:01:17.130> were<00:01:17.220> looking<00:01:17.310> forward<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:18.060> how<00:01:18.330> can

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
they were looking forward was how can

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.300 
they were looking forward was how can
you<00:01:18.720> map<00:01:19.080> where<00:01:19.380> somebody<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> map

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you map where somebody is on the map

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
you map where somebody is on the map
without<00:01:21.150> relying<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.750> satellites<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
without relying on satellites and the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
without relying on satellites and the
idea<00:01:23.070> was<00:01:23.100> basically<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.939> they<00:01:24.060> would<00:01:24.210> plot

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
idea was basically that they would plot

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.690 
idea was basically that they would plot
you<00:01:24.780> by<00:01:24.900> using<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> signal<00:01:25.740> strengths<00:01:26.189> from

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you by using the signal strengths from

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.120 
you by using the signal strengths from
different<00:01:27.299> wireless<00:01:28.110> networks<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.009> can

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
different wireless networks and they can

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.550 
different wireless networks and they can
work<00:01:29.220> out<00:01:29.369> roughly<00:01:29.759> where<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
work out roughly where you are if one to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.410 
work out roughly where you are if one to
the<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:31.799> view<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.369> 10<00:01:32.790> strength<00:01:33.090> almost

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the right view is is 10 strength almost

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.270 
the right view is is 10 strength almost
takes<00:01:33.659> strength<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
takes strength you are about there so it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.219 
takes strength you are about there so it
was<00:01:35.369> basically<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.759> mapping<00:01:36.390> system<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
was basically a mapping system to to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.810 
was basically a mapping system to to
find<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.680> where<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.009> physically<00:01:38.340> were<00:01:38.579> on

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
find out where you physically were on

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090 
find out where you physically were on
the<00:01:38.939> map<00:01:39.119> by<00:01:39.420> using<00:01:39.600> wireless<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.920> would

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the map by using wireless but one would

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.039 
the map by using wireless but one would
think<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.119> case<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.689> almost<00:01:42.869> like

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
think in that case it's almost like

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
think in that case it's almost like
walking<00:01:43.350> around<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> mobile<00:01:44.399> phone<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
walking around with a mobile phone and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.330 
walking around with a mobile phone and
watching<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> bars<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.350> why<00:01:46.530> would

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
watching how the bars go what why would

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.920 
watching how the bars go what why would
it<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.520> necessary<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.060> actually<00:01:48.420> look<00:01:48.570> into

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it be necessary to actually look into

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.630 
it be necessary to actually look into
the<00:01:49.020> computer<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.500> pick<00:01:49.890> out<00:01:50.070> emails<00:01:50.460> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the computer and pick out emails and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.830 
the computer and pick out emails and
passwords<00:01:50.759> well<00:01:51.360> that's<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:51.780> good

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
passwords well that's a very good

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.359 
passwords well that's a very good
question<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.530> certainly<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.100> question

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
question and that certainly the question

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.139 
question and that certainly the question
I<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.490> imagine<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> Information

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
I would imagine the Information

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
I would imagine the Information
Commissioner<00:01:54.540> will<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.720> asking<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.409> mean<00:01:55.560> in

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
Commissioner will be asking I mean in

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
Commissioner will be asking I mean in
July<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.939> information<00:01:57.060> Fischer<00:01:57.450> said

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
July that the information Fischer said

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.569 
July that the information Fischer said
that<00:01:57.930> while<00:01:58.320> data<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.829> been<00:01:58.860> collected<00:01:59.159> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that while data have been collected it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.950 
that while data have been collected it
wasn't<00:01:59.909> significant<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.780> certainly

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
wasn't significant and it certainly

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
wasn't significant and it certainly
wasn't<00:02:01.290> data<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.890> would<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.369> them<00:02:02.520> alarmed

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
