here watching the map I noticed the east

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.010 
here watching the map I noticed the east
city<00:03:15.060> has<00:03:16.060> already<00:03:16.209> been<00:03:16.450> captured<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.900> this

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
there for almost 300 damage so I push up

there for almost 300 damage so I push up
aggressively<00:03:22.240> to<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.930> top<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.350> ridge

looking<00:03:30.040> at<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.220> map<00:03:30.630> obviously<00:03:31.630> our<00:03:31.780> heavies

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
looking at the map obviously our heavies

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.600 
looking at the map obviously our heavies
are<00:03:32.170> advancing<00:03:32.590> toward<00:03:32.800> their<00:03:32.950> base<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.490> it

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
are advancing toward their base but it

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.680 
are advancing toward their base but it
looks<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:33.940> our<00:03:34.150> TDS

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
looks like our TDS

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.110 
looks like our TDS
defending<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.260> one<00:03:35.440> line<00:03:35.680> are<00:03:35.950> in<00:03:36.580> trouble<00:03:37.000> so

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
defending the one line are in trouble so

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.030 
defending the one line are in trouble so
I<00:03:37.150> go<00:03:37.300> ahead<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.510> flex<00:03:37.810> west<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.530> as<00:03:38.890> I'm

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
making my way out here we noticed that

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.710 
making my way out here we noticed that

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
there is a t1 heavy who's pushing down

on a friendly mobile player driving a

on a friendly mobile player driving a
fury<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:47.500> heavy<00:03:47.709> makes<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.220> same

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
fury and this heavy makes the same

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.530 
fury and this heavy makes the same
mistake<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.850> lot<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:49.060> players<00:03:49.209> have<00:03:49.420> made

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
mistake that a lot of players have made

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.180 
mistake that a lot of players have made
throughout<00:03:49.810> this<00:03:49.930> match<00:03:50.170> he's<00:03:50.530> over<00:03:50.860> exposing

throughout this match he's over exposing

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.870 
throughout this match he's over exposing
his<00:03:51.400> halt

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
his halt

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.600 
his halt
this<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.660> particularly<00:03:53.350> egregious<00:03:54.070> because

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
this is particularly egregious because

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.640 
this is particularly egregious because
he's<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.970> heavy<00:03:55.150> American<00:03:55.870> tank<00:03:56.320> that<00:03:56.500> has

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
he's in a heavy American tank that has

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.800 
he's in a heavy American tank that has
such<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:57.190> good<00:03:57.550> gun<00:03:57.730> depression<00:03:57.970> he<00:03:58.360> can<00:03:58.540> aim

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
such a good gun depression he can aim

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.199 
such a good gun depression he can aim
down<00:03:59.110> by<00:03:59.709> only<00:03:59.860> exposing<00:04:00.490> his<00:04:00.610> turret<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.090> he

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
down by only exposing his turret so he

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.630 
down by only exposing his turret so he
does<00:04:01.360> finish<00:04:01.660> off<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.110> fury<00:04:02.410> but<00:04:03.310> we<00:04:03.430> burned

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
does finish off the fury but we burned

does finish off the fury but we burned
down<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.630> t1<00:04:05.050> he<00:04:05.170> gave<00:04:05.320> up<00:04:05.500> most<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.860> us

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
down that that t1 he gave up most of us

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.860 
down that that t1 he gave up most of us
health<00:04:06.190> by<00:04:06.370> just<00:04:06.550> coming<00:04:06.820> over<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.270> and<00:04:07.450> over

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.120 
it has an unusually high amount of alpha
for<00:05:55.460> tier<00:05:55.639> 6<00:05:55.849> medium<00:05:56.029> so<00:05:56.419> it<00:05:56.539> does<00:05:57.139> 180<00:05:57.710> damage

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
for tier 6 medium so it does 180 damage

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.010 
for tier 6 medium so it does 180 damage
on<00:05:58.279> average<00:05:58.610> per<00:05:58.849> shot<00:05:59.120> which<00:05:59.419> is<00:05:59.449> really<00:05:59.840> good

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
on average per shot which is really good

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.629 
on average per shot which is really good
and<00:06:00.169> can<00:06:00.409> allow<00:06:00.620> you<00:06:00.680> to<00:06:00.770> trade<00:06:01.039> favorably

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
and can allow you to trade favorably

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.330 
and can allow you to trade favorably
with<00:06:01.759> other<00:06:01.940> mediums<00:06:02.360> of<00:06:02.509> the<00:06:02.569> same<00:06:02.779> tier<00:06:03.080> and

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
with other mediums of the same tier and

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.700 
with other mediums of the same tier and
as<00:06:04.340> I<00:06:04.669> talked<00:06:04.880> about<00:06:04.940> earlier<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.620> turret<00:06:06.620> is

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
as I talked about earlier the turret is

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.980 
as I talked about earlier the turret is
pretty<00:06:06.979> strong<00:06:07.250> so<00:06:07.690> those<00:06:08.690> three<00:06:08.960> things

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
pretty strong so those three things

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.769 
pretty strong so those three things
collectively<00:06:09.650> provide<00:06:10.310> a<00:06:10.639> good<00:06:11.300> basis<00:06:11.750> for

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:11.779 
collectively provide a good basis for

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.290 
collectively provide a good basis for
tank<00:06:12.169> and<00:06:12.529> here<00:06:13.370> I<00:06:13.400> get<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.849> first<00:06:14.150> shot

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
tank and here I get the first shot

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.790 
tank and here I get the first shot
opportunity<00:06:14.930> on<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.050> Hellcat<00:06:15.409> as<00:06:15.620> I<00:06:15.710> already

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
opportunity on the Hellcat as I already

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.559 
opportunity on the Hellcat as I already
knew<00:06:16.039> where<00:06:16.219> he<00:06:16.400> was<00:06:16.580> because<00:06:16.849> the<00:06:17.000> kv-1<00:06:17.419> it

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
knew where he was because the kv-1 it

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.330 
knew where he was because the kv-1 it
had<00:06:17.810> spotted<00:06:18.110> him<00:06:18.380> and<00:06:18.710> then<00:06:18.919> the<00:06:18.979> Hellcat

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
had spotted him and then the Hellcat

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.760 
had spotted him and then the Hellcat
rushes<00:06:19.699> his<00:06:19.880> shot<00:06:20.150> which<00:06:20.750> allows<00:06:21.050> me<00:06:21.319> the<00:06:21.560> easy

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
rushes his shot which allows me the easy

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.029 
rushes his shot which allows me the easy
finish<00:06:22.069> so<00:06:22.789> the<00:06:22.909> t-34<00:06:23.569> 85<00:06:23.930> really<00:06:24.620> you<00:06:24.860> know<00:06:24.949> an

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.480 
finish so the t-34 85 really you know an
