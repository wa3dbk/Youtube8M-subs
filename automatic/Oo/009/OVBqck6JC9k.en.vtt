00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.730 
download is absolutely unreal and I've
kind<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.609> cut<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:48.000> all<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.359> if<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.560> can

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
kind of cut them all out so if you can

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.069 
kind of cut them all out so if you can
kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> understand<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
kind of understand that really it's a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.539 
kind of understand that really it's a
lot<00:01:52.229> easier<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.770> me<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.130> showing<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> just

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
lot easier for me to be showing you just

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.520 
lot easier for me to be showing you just
the<00:01:53.850> gameplay<00:01:54.299> rather<00:01:54.600> than<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.409> other

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the gameplay rather than all the other

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
the gameplay rather than all the other
stuff<00:01:55.649> because<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.429> would<00:01:56.670> take<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> look<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.420> lot

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
stuff because it would take a look a lot

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.380 
stuff because it would take a look a lot
more<00:01:57.869> time<00:01:58.229> editing<00:01:58.679> because<00:01:58.999> you've<00:01:59.999> got<00:02:00.179> all

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
more time editing because you've got all

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.899 
more time editing because you've got all
the<00:02:00.539> little<00:02:00.780> stocking<00:02:01.770> start<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.789> to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the little stocking start so I have to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.970 
the little stocking start so I have to
edit<00:02:02.999> all<00:02:03.240> them<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.539> and<00:02:03.899> make<00:02:04.469> sure

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
edit all them out and make sure

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.550 
edit all them out and make sure
it<00:02:05.100> all<00:02:05.490> looks<00:02:05.730> really<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.870> find<00:02:07.470> it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
it all looks really good so I find it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.380 
it all looks really good so I find it
easier<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:07.980> doing<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.370> finger<00:02:08.910> look<00:02:09.210> like

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
easier just doing the finger look like

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.210 
easier just doing the finger look like
goal<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:09.810> can't<00:02:10.140> believe<00:02:10.260> that<00:02:10.530> even<00:02:10.740> when<00:02:10.920> I

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
goal I can't believe that even when I

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.310 
goal I can't believe that even when I
really<00:02:11.940> don't<00:02:12.120> see<00:02:12.300> how<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.750> when<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.080> just

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
really don't see how that when I just

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.590 
really don't see how that when I just
went<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.620> hit<00:02:14.130> big<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.580> he<00:02:14.970> just<00:02:15.210> managed<00:02:15.540> to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
went to hit big and he just managed to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.200 
went to hit big and he just managed to
get<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.810> beautiful<00:02:16.080> goal<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.340> did<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:18.180> I

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
get a beautiful goal but it did I was I

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.080 
get a beautiful goal but it did I was I
didn't<00:02:18.720> take<00:02:19.200> him<00:02:19.380> off<00:02:19.530> after<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:20.250> which<00:02:20.940> is

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
didn't take him off after this which is

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.730 
didn't take him off after this which is
quite<00:02:21.300> annoying<00:02:21.510> because<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:22.200> already<00:02:22.350> sent

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
quite annoying because I already sent

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.700 
quite annoying because I already sent
him<00:02:22.890> off<00:02:22.980> because<00:02:23.190> he<00:02:23.430> had<00:02:23.700> low<00:02:24.150> fitness<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:25.200> he

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
him off because he had low fitness so he

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.560 
him off because he had low fitness so he
scores<00:02:26.010> go<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.490> get<00:02:26.610> substitute<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.360> same

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
scores go and get substitute in the same

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.090 
scores go and get substitute in the same
move<00:02:28.280> really<00:02:29.280> not<00:02:29.430> your<00:02:29.550> finest<00:02:29.910> hour<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:31.100> the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
move really not your finest hour but the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.730 
move really not your finest hour but the
gameplay<00:02:32.280> will<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.850> shown<00:02:33.060> every<00:02:33.600> kind<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.020> so

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
gameplay will be shown every kind of so

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.710 
gameplay will be shown every kind of so
often<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.310> think<00:02:35.580> what<00:02:35.880> I'm<00:02:35.970> gonna<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.240> doing<00:02:36.270> is

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
often I think what I'm gonna be doing is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.540 
often I think what I'm gonna be doing is
kind<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.290> putting<00:02:37.440> them<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.680> randomly<00:02:38.130> and

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
kind of putting them on randomly and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.370 
kind of putting them on randomly and
whenever<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.300> added<00:02:39.540> them<00:02:39.630> because<00:02:40.020> when<00:02:40.320> I

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
whenever I added them because when I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.260 
whenever I added them because when I
want<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> do<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.340> schedule<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:41.910> feel<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.150> I
