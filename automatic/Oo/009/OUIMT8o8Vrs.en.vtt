00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
a short time and why once developed

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.500 
a short time and why once developed
areas<00:00:28.019> were<00:00:28.650> completely<00:00:29.279> unacceptable<00:00:30.000> and

areas were completely unacceptable and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.110 
areas were completely unacceptable and
why<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:32.189> found<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.300> disk<00:00:34.010> DLC<00:00:35.120> potentially

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
why we found on the disk DLC potentially

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.380
