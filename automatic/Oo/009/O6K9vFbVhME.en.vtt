hi<00:00:10.470> this<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.130> dr.<00:00:11.490> Ricardo<00:00:11.820> Rodriguez<00:00:12.300> I'm

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
hi this is dr. Ricardo Rodriguez I'm

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.670 
hi this is dr. Ricardo Rodriguez I'm
gonna<00:00:12.780> give<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.050> a<00:00:13.110> short<00:00:13.590> history<00:00:14.400> on

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
gonna give you a short history on

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.390 
gonna give you a short history on
liposuction<00:00:16.680> cannula

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
liposuction cannula

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.380 
liposuction cannula
okay<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:19.460> liposuction<00:00:20.460> cannula<00:00:20.670> first

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
okay so liposuction cannula first

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.260 
okay so liposuction cannula first
started<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:21.900> big<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.950> objective<00:00:23.430> done<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
started as big the objective done was to

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.750 
started as big the objective done was to
do<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.630> much<00:00:24.930> liposuction<00:00:25.680> as<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.920> could<00:00:26.160> fast

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
do as much liposuction as you could fast

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.420 
do as much liposuction as you could fast
so<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.619> started<00:00:28.949> coming<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.250> with

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
so for that they started coming up with

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.210 
so for that they started coming up with
these<00:00:29.520> big<00:00:29.760> cannulas<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.480> see<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.890> it's<00:00:31.890> got

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
these big cannulas you see that it's got

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.400 
these big cannulas you see that it's got
a<00:00:32.279> big<00:00:32.699> diameter<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.449> big<00:00:33.660> hole<00:00:33.900> so<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.230> can

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
a big diameter and big hole so you can

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.890 
a big diameter and big hole so you can
see<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:35.580> when<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.390> use<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> large

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
see that now when they use a large

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.049 
see that now when they use a large
cannulas<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.590> were<00:00:37.710> having<00:00:37.980> problems<00:00:38.059> with

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
cannulas they were having problems with

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.600 
cannulas they were having problems with
tissue<00:00:39.570> defects<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.739> they<00:00:41.250> came<00:00:41.400> up<00:00:41.460> with

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
tissue defects so they came up with

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.369 
tissue defects so they came up with
innovations<00:00:42.210> such<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.449> these<00:00:42.750> another<00:00:43.080> tooth

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
innovations such as these another tooth

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.259 
innovations such as these another tooth
to<00:00:43.589> guard<00:00:43.830> you<00:00:43.979> against<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.640> too<00:00:44.820> close<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
to guard you against going too close to

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.570 
to guard you against going too close to
the<00:00:45.390> skin<00:00:45.659> but<00:00:46.320> clearly<00:00:46.769> there<00:00:47.010> was<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.159> problem

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
the skin but clearly there was a problem

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.810 
the skin but clearly there was a problem
with<00:00:48.210> tissue<00:00:48.720> defects<00:00:49.229> so<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:50.280> next<00:00:50.580> thing

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
with tissue defects so the next thing

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.930 
with tissue defects so the next thing
they<00:00:50.970> came<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.570> was<00:00:52.229> a<00:00:52.530> smaller<00:00:53.220> cannula

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
they came up with was a smaller cannula

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.210 
they came up with was a smaller cannula
and<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.570> smaller<00:00:54.900> catalyst<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.799> can<00:00:55.979> tell

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
and the smaller catalyst you can tell

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.640 
and the smaller catalyst you can tell
are<00:00:56.519> much<00:00:56.820> smaller<00:00:57.260> especially<00:00:58.260> when

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
are much smaller especially when

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.250 
are much smaller especially when
compared<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.400> other<00:00:59.610> ones<00:00:59.879> okay<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.930> they

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
compared to the other ones okay and they

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.950 
compared to the other ones okay and they
got<00:01:01.409> three<00:01:02.129> little<00:01:02.670> holes<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.720> still

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
got three little holes in here to still

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.590 
got three little holes in here to still
make<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.559> little<00:01:05.040> bit<00:01:05.250> more<00:01:05.400> efficient<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
make it a little bit more efficient you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.200 
make it a little bit more efficient you
can<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.220> okay<00:01:08.960> but<00:01:10.790> people<00:01:11.790> were<00:01:11.940> still

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
can see that okay but people were still

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.440 
can see that okay but people were still
trying<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.690> more<00:01:13.049> Fitness<00:01:13.470> results<00:01:14.160> and<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
trying to get more Fitness results and a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.150 
trying to get more Fitness results and a
friend<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.050> mine<00:01:16.110> turned<00:01:16.650> me<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
friend of mine turned me on to this

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.100 
friend of mine turned me on to this
technique<00:01:17.490> which<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.210> neat

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
technique which is really neat

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.020 
technique which is really neat
he<00:01:19.650> used<00:01:19.800> a<00:01:19.950> cannula<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.580> used<00:01:20.730> to<00:01:20.850> use

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
he used a cannula that we used to use

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.510 
he used a cannula that we used to use
for<00:01:21.210> infusion<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.230> a<00:01:22.500> lot<00:01:23.190> smaller

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
for infusion you see it's a lot smaller

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.840 
for infusion you see it's a lot smaller
lot<00:01:24.360> smaller<00:01:24.660> horse<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.170> used<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.730> put<00:01:26.730> in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
lot smaller horse and we used to put in

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
lot smaller horse and we used to put in
the<00:01:27.030> tumescent<00:01:27.300> fluid<00:01:27.510> through<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.410> he

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the tumescent fluid through this and he

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.500 
the tumescent fluid through this and he
got<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.190> idea<00:01:29.220> let's<00:01:29.640> start<00:01:29.850> suctioning

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
got the idea let's start suctioning

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.330 
got the idea let's start suctioning
through<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> beginning<00:01:32.250> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
through it and in the beginning I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.860 
through it and in the beginning I
thought<00:01:32.550> you<00:01:32.910> know<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.060> couldn't<00:01:33.330> be<00:01:33.390> done<00:01:33.450> but

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
thought you know it couldn't be done but

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.500 
thought you know it couldn't be done but
it<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:35.640> great<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.210> gives<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
it can and it's great it gives you

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.110 
it can and it's great it gives you
really<00:01:36.870> good<00:01:37.350> smooth<00:01:37.770> results<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:39.060> is

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
really good smooth results and this is

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.360 
really good smooth results and this is
what<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> use<00:01:39.690> I<00:01:39.960> use<00:01:40.410> it<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.160> with<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
what I use I use it you know with a

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.410 
what I use I use it you know with a
really<00:01:41.670> fine<00:01:42.000> small<00:01:42.630> holes<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:45.330> know

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
really fine small holes and you know

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.830 
really fine small holes and you know
even<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:45.870> compared<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.410> this<00:01:47.330> it<00:01:48.330> can<00:01:48.660> give

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
even when compared to this it can give

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.270 
even when compared to this it can give
you<00:01:48.960> more<00:01:49.380> finesse<00:01:49.740> because<00:01:50.010> you<00:01:50.130> have

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you more finesse because you have

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.020 
you more finesse because you have
smaller<00:01:51.060> holes<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> cannula<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:53.030> when

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
smaller holes in the cannula and when

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.000 
smaller holes in the cannula and when
you<00:01:54.150> take<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.659> application<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.440> his<00:01:55.560> extreme

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
you take the application to his extreme

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.120 
you take the application to his extreme
like<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.580> face<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.659> get

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
like in the face you can get

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
like in the face you can get
ridiculously<00:01:59.130> small<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.880> mean<00:02:00.150> look<00:02:00.330> at<00:02:00.420> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
ridiculously small I mean look at this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.260 
ridiculously small I mean look at this
this<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.820> tiny<00:02:02.820> tiny<00:02:03.590> cannula<00:02:04.760> that<00:02:05.760> goes<00:02:06.000> in

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this is tiny tiny cannula that goes in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.240 
this is tiny tiny cannula that goes in
your<00:02:06.690> face<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.369> can<00:02:08.369> take<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.920> fat<00:02:10.920> I'm

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
your face and can take out fat I'm

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
your face and can take out fat I'm
making<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.790> really<00:02:12.239> smooth<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.930> really

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
making it really smooth and a really

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.009 
making it really smooth and a really
great<00:02:13.440> result<00:02:13.860> now<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.940> lot<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.629> have<00:02:15.780> heard

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
great result now a lot of you have heard

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.470 
great result now a lot of you have heard
about<00:02:16.549> ultrasound

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
about ultrasound

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.280 
about ultrasound
laser<00:02:19.470> liposuction<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> problem<00:02:22.170> with

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
laser liposuction I have a problem with

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.170 
laser liposuction I have a problem with
those<00:02:22.380> two<00:02:22.560> techniques<00:02:23.069> for<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.849> different

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
those two techniques for a different

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.110 
those two techniques for a different
reason<00:02:24.680> when<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:25.950> normal<00:02:26.520> liposuction

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
reason when you do normal liposuction

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.760 
reason when you do normal liposuction
you<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> cannula<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
you have a cannula like this and it

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.550 
you have a cannula like this and it
works<00:02:29.010> by<00:02:29.330> sucking<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.510> fat<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.020> think<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.349> fat

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
works by sucking the fat I think the fat

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.620 
works by sucking the fat I think the fat
just<00:02:31.770> sort<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.920> slips<00:02:32.250> into<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.670> hole<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
just sort of slips into the hole and the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.070 
just sort of slips into the hole and the
back<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.050> forth<00:02:34.140> motion<00:02:34.920> takes<00:02:35.190> away<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.670> fat

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
back and forth motion takes away the fat

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.860 
back and forth motion takes away the fat
now<00:02:37.080> with<00:02:37.739> laser<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.550> ultrasound<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:39.750> you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
now with laser and ultrasound what you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.130 
now with laser and ultrasound what you
get<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> destruction<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:41.069> tissue<00:02:41.340> around<00:02:41.850> it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
get is a destruction of tissue around it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.500 
get is a destruction of tissue around it
okay<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.739> heat<00:02:44.100> ultimately<00:02:44.819> its<00:02:45.090> heap<00:02:45.330> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
okay with heat ultimately its heap and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.550 
okay with heat ultimately its heap and
then<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.709> come<00:02:46.980> back<00:02:47.010> later<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:49.230> suck

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
then you come back later and you suck

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.290 
then you come back later and you suck
out<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:50.069> melted<00:02:50.700> tissue

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
out that melted tissue

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.479 
out that melted tissue
now<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.200> me<00:02:52.410> there's<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.739> problem<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.310> there's

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
now to me there's a problem that there's

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.180 
now to me there's a problem that there's
sort<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.269> third<00:02:54.690> element<00:02:55.019> in<00:02:55.620> the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
sort of like a third element in the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.520 
sort of like a third element in the
liposuction<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.810> you're<00:02:58.019> not<00:02:58.200> seeing

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
liposuction that that you're not seeing

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.770 
liposuction that that you're not seeing
I<00:02:58.709> mean<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.190> under<00:02:59.459> skin<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.090> you're

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
I mean it's all under skin and you're

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.150 
I mean it's all under skin and you're
not<00:03:00.959> seeing<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.440> damage<00:03:01.799> that's<00:03:02.010> being

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
not seeing the damage that's being

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.509 
not seeing the damage that's being
created<00:03:02.510> now<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:04.260> some<00:03:04.590> cases<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:05.040> works<00:03:05.190> but

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
created now in some cases it works but

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.990 
created now in some cases it works but
you<00:03:05.640> know<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.760> have<00:03:06.030> seen<00:03:06.239> some<00:03:06.299> disasters<00:03:07.200> from

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
you know I have seen some disasters from

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.390 
you know I have seen some disasters from
ultrasonic<00:03:09.000> liposuction<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:10.190> right<00:03:11.190> now

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
ultrasonic liposuction and right now

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.670 
ultrasonic liposuction and right now
they're<00:03:11.819> even<00:03:12.150> even<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.989> people<00:03:13.260> who<00:03:13.290> are

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
they're even even the people who are

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.979 
they're even even the people who are
working<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.340> laser<00:03:14.640> liposuction<00:03:15.030> they'll

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
working on laser liposuction they'll

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.729 
working on laser liposuction they'll
tell<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.470> clearly<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.489> our<00:03:17.670> scientific

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
tell you clearly in our scientific

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.900 
tell you clearly in our scientific
expositions<00:03:19.739> they'll<00:03:19.920> tell<00:03:20.160> us<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.519> they're

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
expositions they'll tell us that they're

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.069 
expositions they'll tell us that they're
still<00:03:21.209> working<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.049> dosages<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.930> be

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
still working out the dosages so to be

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.460 
still working out the dosages so to be
the<00:03:25.410> gold<00:03:25.650> standard<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:27.480> small<00:03:27.959> cannula

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
the gold standard is the small cannula

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.949 
the gold standard is the small cannula
with<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.799> smaller<00:03:29.130> holes<00:03:29.519> we<00:03:30.209> get<00:03:30.390> great

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
with a smaller holes we get great

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.240 
with a smaller holes we get great
results<00:03:31.170> with<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.180> if<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.359> try<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.980> love

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
results with it and if you try you love

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.960 
results with it and if you try you love
it<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.519> mean<00:03:35.549> it's<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.540> really<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.410> best

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
it I mean it's it really is the best

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.490 
it I mean it's it really is the best
anyways<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.209> was<00:03:39.239> my<00:03:39.359> short<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:40.079> history
