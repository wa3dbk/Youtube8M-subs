00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.100
 but 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.310
 but 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.080
 but 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.929
 but 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.769
 but 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.250
 but 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.250
 but 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.580
 and hello to everyone with you court and this is the second 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.860
 issue heading 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.140
 tuning scale models of cars means 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.720
 this issue will be dedicated to what i'm 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.190
 bought for tuning scale models 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.920
 cars 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.370
 means the first in the store bought 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.860
 marker marker to color 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.230
 interrogate the six black and also small 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.600
 if i need to paint something else 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.960
 black color and marketing by the way ok 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.800
 steal the fact that he is permanent it can 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.800
 remove the alcohol wipe 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.030
 so if that machine can be cleaned 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.460
 Now I think I'll be a little bit 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:17.030
 you will not have enough time to use 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:19.820
 also i bought myself glue second super 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.850
 instant book 3 grams i think 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.840
 enough because because you need a lot 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.509
 glue the parts to them in the machines and if 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.759
 underestimate something not really need glue 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:37.880
 but I'm going to be enough for three grams 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:41.030
 also bought all the boxed box for 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.020
 and small parts of the machines here are thoughts 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.210
 he has lights there too 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.990
 any other part of the bumper cars 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:56.140
 Here I will keep in the box to give and I 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:00.950
 bought a nail polish remover 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.829
 here is each jar of 30 milliliters and 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.219
 also cotton swabs 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.219
 here are cotton pads 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.980
 actually not needed for that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.280
 so that the machines are removed just yes there is 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.080
 watermelon typewriter help remove the paint here 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.930
 so that the designation is that technical assistance and 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.280
 I will have it near the hro golden 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.500
 colors and so to take a marker because 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.740
 that all the same alcohol wipes 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.770
 enough for him a convenient option 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.400
 because I don't end up fast 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.580
 I do not know exactly where you can buy them 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.260
 so I also bought myself another varnish first 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.080
 it seemed that he bought little but only 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.850
 just five bubbles 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:52.390
 but then it turned out that there is even a lot 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:56.260
 since it is rare not only three pieces 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.690
 but the truth is that you have more than 2 shades 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.180
 gray two green and one such 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.060
 purple burgundy can even rather 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.540
 purple all the same here is not necessary 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.130
 in order to steal the cars here and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.030
 I can even show what I have already begun 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.070
 gray lacquer dye 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.600
 this night six I first with her 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.880
 removed the identification marks that the MCH and 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.660
 at the same time took the marker true but his 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.890
 obviously and painted about gray and painted 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.890
 body gray gray lacquer 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.549
 the truth is that not until the end from will to 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.110
 steal to the piece of the trunk under the roof 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:44.950
 object of ridicule glad of the time 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:47.739
 lada priora fast and furious 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.239
 You see this box, I unpacked the way 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.980
 By the way the choice was not so big 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.930
 but there were really a lot of them 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.900
 that is, the same machines were 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.790
 a lot lay on the window but the choice 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.360
 still not so big there was 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.019
 literally six fire was here 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.329
 the fast and the furious largus period the militia is the same 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.680
 fire lada granta 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:18.340
 technical assistance and all new there was every 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.230
 My code for each model is OK. 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.030
 twenty . 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.790
 in the shop window and so I unpacked the priors 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.930
 afterburner 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.410
 first punished me enough 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:36.420
 ok done but i was wrong means 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.580
 To begin with it should be seen in the headlights 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.210
 will cut plastmaski because not 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.350
 stick out 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:47.130
 it looks ugly as well here 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.260
 the black bar will call such here 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.330
 moments of this vinyl is very bad 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.030
 inflicted very here that sure can be seen here 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.410
 here's something else is not paint 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:05.940
 for some reason, but here on the side of the fibers 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.250
 painted badly enough and big myself 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.170
 such a minus 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:17.400
 although they will still be quite a lot 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:19.760
 This body of the braids as you can see the curve is not 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.860
 will have to straighten or hammer or 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:29.340
 with pliers he was even this big 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.080
 Myself - and how much is the dome of a typewriter from 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.470
 of the time and bought them already on 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.890
 for six years and the most here is 1 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.840
 cars they were very high quality were 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.600
 worked out traced and to have them 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.670
 there was something with the body here first 1 3 h 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.140
 Of course, I have Th eight 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.670
 which is something with a trunk 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:53.190
 Well, there is a little defect in it but not really 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:59.460
 much visible but this is the most such 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:04.710
 big minus and also i want to compare with 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:08.880
 Priory Valley It turned out that Priory 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.880
 Were better than from the time we start with 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.060
 bottom bottom as you can see very 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:22.130
 By the way, worked out in detail 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:22.130
 time and conditionally standard 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:30.530
 true here u here is minus this axis 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:33.800
 front 1010 autumn everything is fine but here 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.710
 on the pir rims here are not painted 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.920
 ok and here they are painted 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.770
 together with rubber and just here here 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.320
 tires are usually here 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:49.190
 low profile but it's not particularly like that 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.230
 minus is even better is more convenient and also translation 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.760
 to coloring again here's an icon 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.530
 even goats ap made and salon more 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.430
 detailed than here I am already 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.140
 I will then show them promoted 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.000
 I show but here it is not even a minus 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.430
 This trunk will open here 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.690
 It opened but it is not particularly 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:15.940
 It means the detail because what you did 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.940
 not through you it covers all the frames 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.890
 so of the time now cars 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.220
 go too bad and lie buy everything 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.990
 back off 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:30.980
 okay this i think i will finish this 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.450
 release because i showed what i bought 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.810
 In the next issue I will be on the edge 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:38.000
 show painting machines here if 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.770
 At first it can put a pine edge 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.060
 Like to call friends and with you there was a course and 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.060
 good luck to everyone and all good bye
