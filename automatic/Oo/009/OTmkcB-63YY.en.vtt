00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.270 
nice idea you've got unlock effects as
well<00:02:29.110> which<00:02:29.290> currently<00:02:29.650> grayed<00:02:29.920> out<00:02:30.100> because

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
well which currently grayed out because

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.160 
well which currently grayed out because
I've<00:02:30.489> got<00:02:30.700> one<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.630> other<00:02:31.780> features

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
I've got one of the other features

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.080 
I've got one of the other features
turned<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.829> think<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.579> multiple

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
turned on I think it's the multiple

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.789 
turned on I think it's the multiple
widgets<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:35.019> effectively<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.560> just

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
widgets but effectively that just

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.289 
widgets but effectively that just
changes<00:02:36.130> whether<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.370> get<00:02:36.489> ink<00:02:36.760> effect<00:02:36.910> or

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
changes whether you get ink effect or

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.530 
changes whether you get ink effect or
the<00:02:37.420> nice<00:02:37.570> light<00:02:37.900> effect<00:02:38.290> groovy<00:02:39.100> but<00:02:40.000> let's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
the nice light effect groovy but let's

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.150 
the nice light effect groovy but let's
go<00:02:40.690> back<00:02:40.720> now<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.380> let's<00:02:41.620> have<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.799> look<00:02:41.980> at<00:02:42.100> the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
go back now and let's have a look at the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.350 
go back now and let's have a look at the
lockscreen<00:02:42.489> now<00:02:43.269> we've<00:02:43.420> made<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:43.720> change

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
lockscreen now we've made this change

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.210 
lockscreen now we've made this change
now<00:02:46.360> skip<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.200> up<00:02:47.320> now<00:02:47.530> if<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.680> swipe<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.190> from

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
now skip it up now if you swipe in from

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.699 
now skip it up now if you swipe in from
the<00:02:48.489> side<00:02:48.780> doesn't<00:02:49.780> always<00:02:49.930> work<00:02:50.260> quite<00:02:50.620> as

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
the side doesn't always work quite as

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.530 
the side doesn't always work quite as
reliably<00:02:51.160> as<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.370> would<00:02:51.549> like<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.030> Samsung

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
reliably as I would like this Samsung

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.800 
reliably as I would like this Samsung
could<00:02:52.660> do<00:02:52.810> making<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.320> little<00:02:53.620> change<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.660> it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
could do making a little change but it

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.740 
could do making a little change but it
should<00:02:56.110> allow<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.680> there<00:02:56.890> we<00:02:56.950> go<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.880> get<00:02:58.480> into

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
should allow you there we go to get into

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.330 
should allow you there we go to get into
these<00:02:58.840> widget<00:02:59.140> areas<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.590> from<00:02:59.769> here<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.190> can

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
these widget areas and from here you can

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.310 
these widget areas and from here you can
then<00:03:00.519> pick<00:03:00.790> any<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.450> your<00:03:01.540> standard<00:03:01.989> widgets

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
then pick any of your standard widgets

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.039 
then pick any of your standard widgets
that<00:03:02.620> already<00:03:03.010> installed<00:03:03.700> or<00:03:03.930> whatever<00:03:04.930> you

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
that already installed or whatever you

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.020 
that already installed or whatever you
might<00:03:05.200> choose<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.430> think<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.760> can<00:03:06.880> have<00:03:06.970> a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
might choose so I think I can have a

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.460 
might choose so I think I can have a
Google<00:03:07.299> now<00:03:07.420> widget<00:03:07.750> appearing<00:03:08.200> on<00:03:08.260> my<00:03:08.290> home

my<00:03:08.739> lockscreen<00:03:09.160> if<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:10.570> want<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:12.450> could<00:03:13.450> also

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
my lockscreen if I want to I could also

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.580 
my lockscreen if I want to I could also
put<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.769> Samsung<00:03:15.489> watch<00:03:15.700> on<00:03:15.910> application<00:03:16.590> so

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
put the Samsung watch on application so

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.840 
put the Samsung watch on application so
then<00:03:17.920> I've<00:03:18.040> got<00:03:18.220> full<00:03:18.430> control<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.760> my
