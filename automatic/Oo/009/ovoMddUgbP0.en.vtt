00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
he be Floyd Mayweather then he his claim

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.470 
he be Floyd Mayweather then he his claim
to<00:03:21.810> fame<00:03:21.989> well<00:03:22.440> he<00:03:23.400> think<00:03:23.820> we<00:03:23.880> learned<00:03:23.940> morally

enough<00:03:24.660> money<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.140> also<00:03:26.040> think<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.489> by<00:03:26.790> him

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
enough money I also think that by him

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.479 
enough money I also think that by him
being<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:28.170> Floyd<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.799> aware<00:03:28.980> they<00:03:29.100> have<00:03:29.310> nothing

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
being a Floyd be aware they have nothing

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.560 
being a Floyd be aware they have nothing
much<00:03:29.760> more<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.060> prove<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.670> those<00:03:33.209> are<00:03:33.239> two

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
much more to prove so those are two

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.160 
much more to prove so those are two
roots<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.260> think<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.820> sense<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.450> believe

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
roots so I think in that sense I believe

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.690 
roots so I think in that sense I believe
that<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.980> fight<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:40.310> again<00:03:41.310> for<00:03:41.640> those

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
that this fight is again for those

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.530 
that this fight is again for those
people<00:03:41.940> who<00:03:42.120> don't<00:03:42.690> like<00:03:44.900> now<00:03:45.900> Manny<00:03:46.290> Pacquiao

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
down and down to a point now where he

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.379 
down and down to a point now where he
can<00:04:52.889> negotiate<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.490> point<00:04:53.730> well<00:04:53.880> he<00:04:54.060> can<00:04:54.180> get

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
can negotiate to point well he can get

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.629
