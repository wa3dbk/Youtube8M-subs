them off when I was doing the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
comparisons so firing rate wise all

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.569 
comparisons so firing rate wise all
three<00:01:39.540> guns<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.049> exactly<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> same<00:01:40.860> firing

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579

three guns have exactly the same firing
rate<00:01:41.790> both<00:01:42.570> scar<00:01:42.990> lights<00:01:43.229> actually<00:01:43.500> had<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
rate both scar lights actually had the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.520 
rate both scar lights actually had the
same<00:01:44.250> reload<00:01:44.700> speed<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> m4<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> slightly

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
same reload speed but the m4 is slightly

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.319 
same reload speed but the m4 is slightly
slower<00:01:46.979> than<00:01:47.189> both<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> them<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.850> I'll<00:01:47.939> replay

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
slower than both of them and I'll replay

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
slower than both of them and I'll replay
it<00:01:48.420> again<00:01:48.570> slow<00:01:49.110> motion<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.159> see

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it again slow motion so that you can see

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.630 
it again slow motion so that you can see
the<00:01:50.490> difference

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.610 

and<00:01:59.090> then<00:01:59.420> finally<00:01:59.630> you<00:01:59.840> probably<00:02:00.170> guessed<00:02:00.380> it

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
and then finally you probably guessed it

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.350 
and then finally you probably guessed it
by<00:02:00.650> now<00:02:00.800> but<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.280> skylight<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:01.970> skylight

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
by now but the skylight and the skylight

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.969 
by now but the skylight and the skylight
red<00:02:02.570> dragon<00:02:02.870> have<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.110> same<00:02:03.350> drawer<00:02:03.650> speed

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
red dragon have the same drawer speed

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
faster than to the two so i'll also

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.059

replay<00:02:08.270> again<00:02:08.810> slow<00:02:09.110> motion<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:09.920> can

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
replay again slow motion so that you can

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.570 
replay again slow motion so that you can
see<00:02:10.250> properly<00:02:11.410> now<00:02:12.410> there's<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.770> very<00:02:13.040> very

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
see properly now there's a very very

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.690 
see properly now there's a very very
simple<00:02:13.970> way<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.300> describe<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:14.959> gun<00:02:15.170> and

simple way to describe this gun and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.180 
simple way to describe this gun and
input<00:02:16.700> personally<00:02:17.350> it's<00:02:18.350> overpowered

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190

there's<00:02:19.640> nothing<00:02:20.030> more<00:02:20.180> than<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.480> can<00:02:20.630> say

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
there's nothing more than you can say

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.050 
there's nothing more than you can say
about<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.860> fact<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.310> does<00:02:22.490> 100<00:02:22.970> at

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
about it the fact that it does 100 at

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.910
