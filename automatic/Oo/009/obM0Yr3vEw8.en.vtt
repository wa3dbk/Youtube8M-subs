00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
benchmarking on this device right now so

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:32.950 
benchmarking on this device right now so
let's<00:00:17.760> get<00:00:17.940> started<00:00:18.060> we'll<00:00:18.480> start<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:18.930> n<00:00:19.140> 22

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.260 

there<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.050> go<00:00:34.200> our<00:00:34.530> devices<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
there we go our devices right at the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:46.130 
there we go our devices right at the
bottom<00:00:37.460> 6505<00:00:39.559> we're<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> restart<00:00:45.140> next

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
bottom 6505 we're going to restart next

00:00:46.140 --> 00:01:00.910 
bottom 6505 we're going to restart next
up<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.530> quadrant<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.250> our<00:00:56.520> device<00:00:57.289> 1884

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:18.070 

next<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:02.070> cake<00:01:02.789> pans<00:01:03.000> 3

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.070 

there<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.460> 366<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:21.120> attach<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> score

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there you go 366 that attach the score

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.040 
there you go 366 that attach the score
we<00:01:22.290> consider<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> multi-core<00:01:23.520> score<00:01:23.810> this<00:01:24.810> call

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
we consider a multi-core score this call

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.470 
we consider a multi-core score this call
is<00:01:25.080> also<00:01:25.350> important<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.970> comparison

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
is also important but for comparison

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:43.580 
is also important but for comparison
sake<00:01:27.740> we<00:01:28.740> take<00:01:29.150> 366<00:01:32.060> next<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.210> Nana<00:01:33.540> mock<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:42.590> do

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
sake we take 366 next up Nana mock to do

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.070 
sake we take 366 next up Nana mock to do
you<00:01:43.650> see<00:01:44.030> 49.9<00:01:45.030> FPS<00:01:45.510> out<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.990> 60<00:01:46.500> FPS<00:01:47.930> next<00:01:48.930> up

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
you see 49.9 FPS out of 60 FPS next up
