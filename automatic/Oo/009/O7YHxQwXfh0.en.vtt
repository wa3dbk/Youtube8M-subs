00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the original this is a new fork that i

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.420 
the original this is a new fork that i
just<00:01:47.790> bought<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.360> had<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.200> dirt<00:01:49.770> jumper<00:01:50.159> fork

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
just bought it had a dirt jumper fork

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.399 
just bought it had a dirt jumper fork
which<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.149> kind<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> bought<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.200> pinch

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
which I kind of bought in a pinch

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.810 
which I kind of bought in a pinch
because<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> only<00:01:53.009> fork<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.549> had<00:01:53.670> in

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
because it was the only fork they had in

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.490 
because it was the only fork they had in
stock<00:01:53.850> at<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.270> time<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.930> fit<00:01:55.380> this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
stock at the time that that fit this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.459 
stock at the time that that fit this
bike<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.549> fork<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:57.329> heavy<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.990> looked<00:01:58.259> good

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
bike the fork was heavy it looked good

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.870 
bike the fork was heavy it looked good
on<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.710> court<00:01:58.950> because<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.189> was<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.340> big<00:01:59.520> beefy

they're generally all carbon fiber and
they<00:03:39.980> cost<00:03:40.370> like<00:03:40.610> seven<00:03:40.940> eight<00:03:41.030> nine<00:03:41.090> thousand

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
dollars complete so now I'm kind of

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.510 
dollars complete so now I'm kind of
curious<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.590> i'm<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:45.950> close<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.220> getting

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
curious that i'm so close to getting

this thing under 20 pounds so i've made
a<00:03:49.940> couple<00:03:50.180> changes<00:03:50.480> i<00:03:50.720> grabbed<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.050> lightest

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380
