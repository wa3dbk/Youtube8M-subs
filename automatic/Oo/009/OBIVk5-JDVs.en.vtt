00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.789
 coaching benches with some laugh 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.849
 stir mamatkulov noted pass 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.689
 which is a very small technical area in 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.019
 this team 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.630
 so dangerous as the Terek can even be killed 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.320
 here for the marsh help out another blow 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.480
 and the ball leaves the field location but not 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.280
 he was the main character want 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.370
 also participated in this attack Ivanov 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.700
 made a great transfer and why not 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.970
 The main thing is that the blow itself was yes 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.630
 Here is a breakthrough left back and 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:49.210
 the saber saves we saves you 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.430
 come back to Ekaterinburg earrings 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.830
 the next attack is the most dangerous moment of her 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.160
 the hand was or not the Fedotov divorced 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.790
 hands in the sides of the trophims too 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.920
 completely different 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.840
 day to him by whom let him watch this 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.260
 still a blow from a very close distance myth 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.810
 comes across the arm of salt offices but I won't 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.640
 take the assessment of this episode 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.860
 because it seems to me here 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.160
 any decision of the arbitrator can be found 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.530
 excuse from very close range 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.570
 punched Mauricio but he punched 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.030
 absolutely yourself possibly blocked the way 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.190
 the sword that flew the gate is not a fact that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.860
 there the goalkeeper could react and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.350
 team feed now will be and years hit 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.300
 on goal 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.229
 angled up hooked the ball nikolai 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.720
 the marshland is now talking to his 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.590
 weldon defenders another dangerous 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.590
 attack of the Terek 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.600
 yes really not just hooked 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.340
 rescued this blow marshy 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.390
 saved his team now though very 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.490
 hard it was not a free kick fine 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.800
 new here please review forced 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.800
 join the game and save your team 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.630
 problems with practice but more precisely just their 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.710
 let's call and cues is almost 40 year old 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.160
 Alexander Shovkovsky 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.500
 but no coval or walkie-talkie player replay I 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.080
 I will not translate here because oh 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.710
 what a moment and grabs his head and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.690
 Alexander Tarkhanov 2 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.750
 Grigory frets there already jumped into 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.840
 technical area later look 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.480
 what is to the very best angle 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.410
 fine he actually has the ball after 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.690
 strike head away from the gate flew by 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.190
 pause in the game and the house start from 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.450
 the flu positions were but no no you 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.450
 faces will be stopped 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.400
 no it caught 105 that's what he just 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.440
 and required blunt too deep 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.110
 settled down the second half 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.500
 It was built with the Zod of the risks and pizza 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.470
 wilton and so here again saves 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.870
 zabolotnogo and here so the telly opens 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.870
 by while we are eating and watching 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.660
 doronin himself succeeded in the attack 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.280
 which we will remember not as 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.090
 disrupt dangerous 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.090
 at the sun 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.630
 swamp a and in the morning the ball is coming here 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.660
 so began here a lot 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.960
 free Ivanov shifted to the center is not 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.950
 no one meets him where 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.410
 opornikov I want to ask where Dodge 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.330
 charge because it is not central 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.510
 advocates you must meet the swamps 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.280
 here of course I didnâ€™t guess what 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.040
 claims to the goalkeeper if you let 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.000
 a player like Ivanov in the penalty area 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.000
 area and to 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.930
 the hardest test for anyone 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.600
 player 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.310
 From the side look so fights and 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.410
 trying to achieve your result 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.210
 urala team still can be shot 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.430
 to hammer in the snow 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:21.250
 for loyalty to the holes already outside 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.250
 fields even covered this ball and hitting 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:34.690
 to also luck of course turns away from 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.690
 urala at a crucial moment here
