00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.660 
like we can do our minecraft series but
I'm<00:00:24.029> still<00:00:24.359> also<00:00:24.630> doing<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.650> texture<00:00:26.490> pack

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
I'm still also doing the texture pack

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.730 
I'm still also doing the texture pack
showcase<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.990> still<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.470> what

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
showcase so you can still like what

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.009 
showcase so you can still like what
texture<00:00:29.039> pack<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.340> good<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.119> instead<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
texture pack is good like you instead of

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.389 
texture pack is good like you instead of
doing<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> 10<00:00:31.679> minute<00:00:31.949> video<00:00:32.040> just

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
doing like a 10 minute video just

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.650 
doing like a 10 minute video just
showing<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> box<00:00:33.059> look<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.570> can

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
showing what the box look like you can

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.459 
showing what the box look like you can
see<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> gameplay<00:00:34.440> looks<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:36.469> know

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
see what the gameplay looks like I know

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.950 
see what the gameplay looks like I know
that<00:00:37.590> doesn't<00:00:37.800> really<00:00:37.890> make<00:00:38.040> kind<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.280> sense

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
that doesn't really make kind of sense

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.319 
that doesn't really make kind of sense
but<00:00:39.960> umm<00:00:40.200> it'll<00:00:40.430> work<00:00:41.430> because<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.149> right

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
but umm it'll work because like right

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.180 
but umm it'll work because like right
now<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> Jolly<00:00:42.809> craft<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.890> like

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
now the Jolly craft like it's it I like

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.760 
now the Jolly craft like it's it I like
this<00:00:44.370> jolly<00:00:44.610> crap<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.020> little<00:00:46.320> too<00:00:46.500> bright

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this jolly crap it's a little too bright

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
this jolly crap it's a little too bright
for<00:00:46.980> my<00:00:47.430> eyes<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:48.059> honest<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
for my eyes to be honest like it's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.380 
for my eyes to be honest like it's
really<00:00:49.320> bright<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.730> darken<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
really bright like if they darken it a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.600 
really bright like if they darken it a
little<00:00:51.539> bit<00:00:51.750> it'd<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:51.960> cool<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:53.190> lot<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
little bit it'd be cool and a lot of the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
little bit it'd be cool and a lot of the
textures<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.930> kind<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.230> seemed<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
textures on this just kind of seemed to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.580 
textures on this just kind of seemed to
smudge<00:00:56.039> together<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> mean<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.440> not

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
smudge together so I mean it's not

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.389 
smudge together so I mean it's not
really<00:00:58.859> smooth<00:00:59.550> per<00:01:00.120> se<00:01:00.350> but<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> mean<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
really smooth per se but I mean it's a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.920 
really smooth per se but I mean it's a
really<00:01:02.640> good<00:01:02.850> texture<00:01:03.210> backer<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
really good texture backer I like this a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
really good texture backer I like this a
lot<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:04.979> things<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.580> be

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
lot it's just I think things will be

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.940 
lot it's just I think things will be
toned<00:01:06.060> down<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:07.950> much

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
toned down a little bit little bit much

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.800 
toned down a little bit little bit much
but<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> water<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:12.000> pretty<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
but the water is really pretty like I

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
but the water is really pretty like I
like<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> water<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.070> haven't<00:01:14.549> seen<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
like the water here I haven't seen the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
like the water here I haven't seen the
lobby<00:01:15.030> yet<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> water<00:01:16.560> looks<00:01:16.860> really

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
lobby yet but the water looks really

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
lobby yet but the water looks really
pretty<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> animations<00:01:18.810> are<00:01:18.960> very

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
pretty like the animations are very

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:31.249 
pretty like the animations are very
smooth<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.159> fluid<00:01:20.490> oh<00:01:29.000> my<00:01:30.000> god<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.689> almost<00:01:30.869> got
