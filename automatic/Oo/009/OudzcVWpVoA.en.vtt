00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.740 

so<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.100> lot<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.250> people<00:00:02.370> might<00:00:02.639> argue<00:00:02.700> that<00:00:03.270> the

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
so a lot of people might argue that the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.180 
so a lot of people might argue that the
Protoss<00:00:04.080> ball<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.440> death<00:00:04.589> is<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.830> little<00:00:05.100> too

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
Protoss ball of death is a little too

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.940 
Protoss ball of death is a little too
strong<00:00:05.600> so<00:00:06.600> protons<00:00:07.200> doesn't<00:00:07.560> really<00:00:07.710> need

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
strong so protons doesn't really need

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.070 
strong so protons doesn't really need
new<00:00:08.130> units<00:00:08.460> in<00:00:08.580> heart<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.849> swarm<00:00:09.030> but<00:00:09.780> even

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
new units in heart of the swarm but even

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.870 
new units in heart of the swarm but even
the<00:00:10.170> mighty<00:00:10.380> protests<00:00:10.950> suffers<00:00:11.580> from<00:00:11.730> some

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the mighty protests suffers from some

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.390 
the mighty protests suffers from some
issues<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.389> we<00:00:12.840> try<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.080> hope<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.590> solve<00:00:14.219> these

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
issues and we try to hope to solve these

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.140 
issues and we try to hope to solve these
issues<00:00:14.460> through<00:00:15.059> new<00:00:15.269> units<00:00:16.880> so<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> first

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
issues through new units so the first

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.519 
issues through new units so the first
problem<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.600> protests<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.260> wings<00:00:19.439> of

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
problem that protests have in wings of

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.630 
problem that protests have in wings of
liberty<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.949> they<00:00:20.130> don't<00:00:20.220> really<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
liberty is they don't really have a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.970 
liberty is they don't really have a
solid<00:00:21.140> constant<00:00:22.140> rating<00:00:22.439> option<00:00:22.769> throughout

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
solid constant rating option throughout

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.200 
solid constant rating option throughout
the<00:00:23.100> whole<00:00:23.220> game<00:00:23.250> especially<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> early

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the whole game especially in the early

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.380 
the whole game especially in the early
mid<00:00:24.570> game<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.609> thing<00:00:26.820> about<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> rating

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
mid game so one thing about the rating

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
mid game so one thing about the rating
units<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.869> wanted<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.199> avoid<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.769> pretty

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
units that we wanted to avoid was pretty

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.070 
units that we wanted to avoid was pretty
much<00:00:29.429> every<00:00:29.760> single<00:00:29.970> rating<00:00:30.359> unit<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.810> wings

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
much every single rating unit in wings

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.530 
much every single rating unit in wings
of<00:00:31.170> Liberty<00:00:31.500> focuses<00:00:32.250> around<00:00:32.399> how<00:00:32.850> fast<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
of Liberty focuses around how fast you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.090 
of Liberty focuses around how fast you
kill<00:00:33.719> workers<00:00:34.050> how<00:00:34.260> effectively<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.890> kill

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
kill workers how effectively you kill

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.819 
kill workers how effectively you kill
workers<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.090> for<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.960> new<00:00:37.200> cast<00:00:37.469> your<00:00:37.559> unit

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
workers so for this new cast your unit

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.770 
workers so for this new cast your unit
we<00:00:37.980> wanted<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:38.399> sure<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:39.629> don't

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
we wanted to make sure that we don't

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.139 
we wanted to make sure that we don't
really<00:00:39.930> focus<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.739> killing<00:00:41.010> units<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
really focus on killing units at the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.930 
really focus on killing units at the
same<00:00:42.329> time<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.690> wanted<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.020> cancer<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.530> be

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
same time you wanted this cancer to be

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.920 
same time you wanted this cancer to be
viable<00:00:44.940> throughout<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> course<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
viable throughout the course of the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
viable throughout the course of the
whole<00:00:46.110> game<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.950> very<00:00:47.340> powerful<00:00:47.640> option

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
whole game and a very powerful option

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.279 
whole game and a very powerful option
throughout<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> whole<00:00:49.530> game<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.890> well

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
throughout the whole game as well

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.450 
throughout the whole game as well
Protoss<00:00:52.289> also<00:00:52.559> suffers<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> little<00:00:53.160> bit<00:00:53.309> from

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
Protoss also suffers a little bit from

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.910 
Protoss also suffers a little bit from
the<00:00:53.789> lack<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.090> AOE<00:00:54.570> anti-air<00:00:55.079> especially<00:00:55.739> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the lack of AOE anti-air especially in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.340 
the lack of AOE anti-air especially in
the<00:00:56.010> late<00:00:56.160> game<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:57.210> sure<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:58.140> those

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the late game so I'm sure all those

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.510 
the late game so I'm sure all those
Protoss<00:00:58.739> players<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.190> have

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
Protoss players out there have

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.580 
Protoss players out there have
experience<00:01:00.030> fighting<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.449> insert<00:01:00.780> who

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
experience fighting and insert who

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.770 
experience fighting and insert who
builds<00:01:01.920> say<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.219> 40<00:01:02.640> or<00:01:02.760> 50<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.239> even<00:01:03.390> more

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
builds say like 40 or 50 or even more

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.240 
builds say like 40 or 50 or even more
muralists<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> late<00:01:04.680> game<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
muralists in the late game and you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.500 
muralists in the late game and you
really<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.729> what<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.880> build<00:01:06.119> because

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
really don't know what to build because

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.030 
really don't know what to build because
you<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.439> anything<00:01:07.680> against

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
you don't really have anything against

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
you don't really have anything against
that<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.670> Phoenix<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:09.060> good<00:01:09.210> against<00:01:09.689> small

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that the Phoenix are good against small

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.870 
that the Phoenix are good against small
groups<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.409> mutalisks<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.520> scale<00:01:11.729> gets

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
groups of mutalisks but if a scale gets

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.219 
groups of mutalisks but if a scale gets
that<00:01:12.030> big<00:01:12.210> there's<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.810> much<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> can

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that big there's really not much you can

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.940 
that big there's really not much you can
do<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.600> Terrans<00:01:16.049> protest<00:01:16.710> does

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
do so just like the Terrans protest does

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
do so just like the Terrans protest does
not<00:01:17.130> suffer<00:01:17.490> from<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.909> having<00:01:18.060> options<00:01:18.840> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
not suffer from not having options in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
not suffer from not having options in
terms<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.590> having<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:20.549> around<00:01:20.880> 200<00:01:21.630> pop

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
terms of having that all around 200 pop

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.710 
terms of having that all around 200 pop
supply<00:01:22.290> army<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.430> our<00:01:23.880> direction<00:01:24.390> when

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
supply army so our direction when

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.440 
supply army so our direction when
creating<00:01:25.020> these<00:01:25.259> new<00:01:25.439> units<00:01:25.770> was<00:01:26.100> while<00:01:26.939> we

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
creating these new units was while we

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.060 
creating these new units was while we
could<00:01:27.689> replace<00:01:28.049> some<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.350> those<00:01:28.530> units<00:01:28.920> in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
could replace some of those units in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
could replace some of those units in
that<00:01:29.220> ball<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.549> death<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:30.030> didn't<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.450> want

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that ball of death we didn't really want

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.140 
that ball of death we didn't really want
to<00:01:30.869> increase<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.560> effectiveness<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.189> that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
to increase the effectiveness of that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.219 
to increase the effectiveness of that
huge<00:01:33.540> stack<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.200> army<00:01:35.689> all<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:37.079> going

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
huge stack of army all right I'm going

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
huge stack of army all right I'm going
to<00:01:37.290> talk<00:01:37.380> about<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.890> new<00:01:38.280> products<00:01:38.640> unit<00:01:38.939> called

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
to talk about a new products unit called

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.410 
to talk about a new products unit called
The<00:01:39.869> Tempest<00:01:40.340> The<00:01:41.340> Tempest<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.970> new<00:01:42.150> capital

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
The Tempest The Tempest is a new capital

carrier alright silver alright these are

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.709 
carrier alright silver alright these are
very<00:01:58.229> powerful<00:01:58.469> AOE<00:01:59.250> anti<00:02:00.090> air<00:02:00.210> unit<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.659> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
very powerful AOE anti air unit as a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.569 
very powerful AOE anti air unit as a
flyer<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.560> he's<00:02:01.649> something<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.219> defend

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
flyer so he's something that can defend

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.139 
flyer so he's something that can defend
your<00:02:02.790> base<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.750> mass<00:02:04.020> muta<00:02:04.350> lists<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:06.030> he

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
your base from mass muta lists and he

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.730 
your base from mass muta lists and he
also<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.600> fire<00:02:06.780> against<00:02:07.079> ground<00:02:07.290> units<00:02:07.619> so

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
also can fire against ground units so

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.290 
also can fire against ground units so
he's<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> decent<00:02:08.129> air<00:02:08.520> assault<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.270> well

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
he's a decent air assault in it as well

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.449 
he's a decent air assault in it as well
it<00:02:09.660> gives<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.020> Protoss<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.619> really<00:02:11.220> powerful

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
it gives the Protoss a really powerful

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.720 
it gives the Protoss a really powerful
reason<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.239> way

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
reason in way

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.850 
reason in way
to<00:02:12.940> deal<00:02:13.209> with<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.810> ate<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.409> end<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.709> game

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
to deal with that ate that end of game

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.619 
to deal with that ate that end of game
utilized<00:02:15.310> scenario<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.849> david<00:02:16.150> was<00:02:16.180> talking

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
utilized scenario that david was talking

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.020

up

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.130 

that<00:02:51.970> look<00:02:52.150> perfect<00:02:52.570> nothing<00:02:52.840> wrong<00:02:52.960> with

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
that look perfect nothing wrong with

that look perfect nothing wrong with
that<00:02:53.260> that's<00:02:53.500> fantastic<00:02:54.720> all<00:02:55.720> right<00:02:55.870> I'm<00:02:56.140> not

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
that that's fantastic all right I'm not

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.080 
that that's fantastic all right I'm not
sure<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.620> day<00:02:56.770> but<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:57.040> explain<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
sure of the day but to explain the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.380 
sure of the day but to explain the
replica<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.100> replicant<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.880> new<00:03:01.090> unit

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
replica so the replicant is a new unit

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.930 
replica so the replicant is a new unit
after<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.750> robotics<00:03:02.170> facility<00:03:02.640> it's<00:03:03.640> got<00:03:03.820> no

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
after the robotics facility it's got no

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.850 
after the robotics facility it's got no
attack<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:04.690> only<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.230> ability<00:03:05.590> allows

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
attack and it's only one ability allows

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.250 
attack and it's only one ability allows
it<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.070> transform<00:03:06.970> into<00:03:07.210> any<00:03:07.570> unit<00:03:07.960> that<00:03:08.140> you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
it to transform into any unit that you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.020 
it to transform into any unit that you
have<00:03:09.070> vision<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.670> game<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.880> can

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
have vision of in that game so you can

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.100 
have vision of in that game so you can
copy<00:03:13.240> units<00:03:13.600> such<00:03:13.720> as<00:03:13.750> siege<00:03:14.350> tanks<00:03:14.770> or<00:03:16.110> ghost

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
copy units such as siege tanks or ghost

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.870 
copy units such as siege tanks or ghost
stuff<00:03:17.500> like<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.710> but<00:03:18.340> there's<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:18.700> huge

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
stuff like that but there's a huge

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.690 
stuff like that but there's a huge
downside<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.630> this<00:03:19.720> unit<00:03:20.080> which<00:03:20.710> is<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.520> high

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
downside to this unit which is the high

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.810 
downside to this unit which is the high
cost<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.210> unit<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.570> costs<00:03:23.230> 200<00:03:24.010> minerals

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
cost of the unit it costs 200 minerals

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.970 
cost of the unit it costs 200 minerals
200<00:03:25.300> gas<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.750> for<00:03:25.930> pop<00:03:26.140> right<00:03:26.320> now<00:03:26.440> which

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
200 gas and for pop right now which

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.130 
200 gas and for pop right now which
means<00:03:27.220> if<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.460> copy<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.910> Templar<00:03:28.570> then<00:03:28.960> that

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
means if you copy a Templar then that

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.020 
means if you copy a Templar then that
means<00:03:29.260> you're<00:03:29.470> spending<00:03:29.920> double<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.700> cost<00:03:30.850> of

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
means you're spending double the cost of

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.260 
means you're spending double the cost of
the<00:03:31.120> Templar<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.690> copy<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.760> upside<00:03:33.910> to

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
the Templar to copy it but the upside to

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.120 
the Templar to copy it but the upside to
this<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:35.080> actually<00:03:35.350> get<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.710> all<00:03:35.950> the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
this is you actually get the all the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.950 
this is you actually get the all the
upgrades<00:03:36.280> enabled<00:03:36.880> when<00:03:37.210> you<00:03:37.300> copy<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.570> unit<00:03:37.810> so

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
upgrades enabled when you copy a unit so

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.530 
upgrades enabled when you copy a unit so
for<00:03:38.140> example<00:03:38.200> if<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.490> copy<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.820> banshee<00:03:40.060> that

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
for example if you copy a banshee that

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.880 
for example if you copy a banshee that
doesn't<00:03:40.870> have<00:03:40.960> cloak<00:03:41.200> enabled<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.860> can

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
doesn't have cloak enabled you can

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.090 
doesn't have cloak enabled you can
actually<00:03:42.160> use<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.910> Banshee<00:03:43.240> with<00:03:43.390> cloak<00:03:44.100> so

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
actually use the Banshee with cloak so

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.560 
actually use the Banshee with cloak so
we're<00:03:45.250> hoping<00:03:45.490> that<00:03:45.550> because<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.240> can<00:03:46.360> copy

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
we're hoping that because you can copy

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.000 
we're hoping that because you can copy
so<00:03:46.810> many<00:03:46.960> units<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.470> bring<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:47.920> many

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
so many units and bring so many

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.580 
so many units and bring so many
different<00:03:48.940> units<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.690> Protoss<00:03:49.990> army<00:03:50.350> that

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
different units to the Protoss army that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.380 
different units to the Protoss army that
this<00:03:50.830> will<00:03:51.010> cause<00:03:51.250> create<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:51.970> lot<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.270> new

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
this will cause create a lot of new

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.140 
this will cause create a lot of new
strategy<00:03:53.640> again<00:03:54.640> this<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:54.850> under

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
strategy again this is under

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.360 
strategy again this is under
construction<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:56.410> our<00:03:56.500> play<00:03:56.709> test<00:03:56.950> we

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
construction and in our play test we

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.729 
construction and in our play test we
found<00:03:57.580> that<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.840> part<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.260> strength<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.650> say

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
found that the part the strength of say

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.550 
found that the part the strength of say
like<00:03:59.920> a<00:03:59.950> siege<00:04:00.190> tank<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.610> different<00:04:01.200> when<00:04:02.200> used

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
like a siege tank is different when used

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.040 
like a siege tank is different when used
but<00:04:03.160> with<00:04:03.459> in<00:04:03.940> combination<00:04:04.540> with<00:04:04.570> Marines

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
but with in combination with Marines

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.560 
but with in combination with Marines
versus<00:04:05.590> when<00:04:05.920> used<00:04:06.130> with<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.610> bunch<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.150> zealots

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
versus when used with a bunch of zealots

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.780

stalkers especially force fields on

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.290 
stalkers especially force fields on
centuries<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:11.310> we're<00:04:12.310> having<00:04:12.610> slight

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
centuries so we're having slight

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.850 
centuries so we're having slight
difficulties<00:04:13.780> in<00:04:13.989> really<00:04:14.470> gauging<00:04:14.830> the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
difficulties in really gauging the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.860 
difficulties in really gauging the
strength<00:04:15.160> of<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.340> unit<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:16.299> any<00:04:16.510> feedback

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
strength of this unit so any feedback

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
strength of this unit so any feedback
would<00:04:16.900> would<00:04:17.830> definitely<00:04:18.310> be<00:04:18.430> welcomed<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:20.799> in

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
would would definitely be welcomed so in

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.200 
would would definitely be welcomed so in
this<00:04:20.980> video<00:04:21.130> you'll<00:04:21.489> see<00:04:21.580> a<00:04:21.940> bunch<00:04:22.120> of

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
this video you'll see a bunch of

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.850 
this video you'll see a bunch of
replicants<00:04:22.720> going<00:04:22.960> in<00:04:23.080> copying<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.680> siege

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
replicants going in copying the siege

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.470 
replicants going in copying the siege
tanks<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.400> all<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.790> marines<00:04:25.060> are<00:04:25.210> killed<00:04:25.419> by

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
tanks and all the marines are killed by

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.480 
tanks and all the marines are killed by
the<00:04:25.630> splash<00:04:25.930> damage<00:04:26.110> of<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.440> siege<00:04:26.650> tanks<00:04:26.950> so

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
the splash damage of the siege tanks so

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.280 
the splash damage of the siege tanks so
obviously<00:04:27.910> this<00:04:28.090> isn't<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.450> only<00:04:28.480> use<00:04:28.990> of<00:04:29.020> the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
obviously this isn't the only use of the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.170 
obviously this isn't the only use of the
