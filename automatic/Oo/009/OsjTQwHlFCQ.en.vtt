00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello to all the matheus spoil everything in 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.150
 musical tips 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.580
 If you liked this video, do not 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.820
 enjoy and share with your friends 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
 write on the channel right now in the video is not 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 dedicated exclusively to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.060
 guitar players but any instrumentalist 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.080
 You can take advantage of this, but I 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.480
 I'll talk about the experience of a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.850
 guitarist I will cite examples of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.580
 musicians who are guitarists 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.769
 just to illustrate but the theme 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.949
 today is the missing link 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.840
 it seems a bit mythological is that phrase 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 but it's something I've commented on in the world 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.520
 with my students or let me open 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.620
 the school of the hour in classes is not the people 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.899
 ends up having a climate of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.989
 discuss some of their forms daily 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.670
 and much has come out exactly this 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.489
 when we are sometimes passing 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.039
 there for class a concept of scale by 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.520
 example of the peju sea I usually play 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.030
 Here guys are frying mode tridea. 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.370
 here is the tridea in the most melodic way 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.359
 sometimes you change the model a way of 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.189
 run 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.680
 if you want a result sometimes more 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.939
 melodic you want a result of 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.470
 velocity 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.720
 It's what I'm going to say that I think is 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.580
 extreme importance is the missing link 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.799
 because I say I lost the link 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.979
 example right started playing guitar 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.100
 in the 1990s my generation was 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.400
 past generation of 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.990
 guitar such as Gilbert 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.549
 low v neckline 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.310
 steve goes satriani and mouse is right né 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.890
 these were the guys that the guys that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.189
 influence when shouting from the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.590
 my farmers in them the symbols of 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.020
 guitar of that moment in our life 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.810
 were these guys were still zico 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.229
 moment and then we end up 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.890
 looking at these guys and catching a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.329
 side of their music, which is not always the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.969
 The plus side is more emotional 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.740
 is the most proficient side of the 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.129
 music and we end up sometimes 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.330
 absorbing one side and leaving aside one 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.000
 another aspect that is extremely 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.490
 important that it developed 10 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.760
 lelo melo 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.349
 develop motives what happens is not 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.080
 It's us sometimes have a mentality 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.060
 very wrong when it's starting I 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.459
 I talk a lot, this is the mentality of everything 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.989
 here inside how you listen to music 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.390
 people will listen to music in a 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.160
 different then sometimes we hear 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.709
 those guys playing the cast had 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.630
 cassette tapes that I just put 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.060
 of soil that I liked and all 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.560
 excerpts were already at that stretch with 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.930
 Speed ​​is not 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.620
 the technical things that had this 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.850
 very aesthetic appeal and then I do not 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.790
 linked to both the né part of the 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.840
 the expression of the tools 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.150
 articulations and this is exactly part of 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.459
 this link was lost that was not 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.160
 lost and lost if they continue 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.880
 losing perhaps more and more due to 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.980
 how we see music is like 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.709
 captain but the influences and why 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.900
 some fifth ritas both important 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.239
 have become a reference for a new 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.310
 generation as well as began to 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.299
 being to me is you pick up demanding test 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.220
 that I mentioned they had as reference 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.510
 extremely melodic musicians and lay there 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.579
 eric clapton jeff beck is many others 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.250
 guys from the hendrix team we can cite 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:40.380
 several but I to dilma and good taste but 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.030
 has a facility to communicate 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.090
 melodies right 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.590
 to express itself sparingly then 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.060
 that's what you get in my story 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.070
 every song 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.470
 there was always no need to 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.410
 breakup sometimes with the very wind 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.200
 more logical is the jazz had its moment in the 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.870
 ibope area that arrived with the pendulum 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.109
 with a more melodic line of jazz and 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.720
 putting so much virtuosity there then 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.660
 rock also had that moment from 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.209
 of the 1970s I saw this breakup with a 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.880
 classic rock more melodic seen faces 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.810
 who started to play more 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.150
 fast 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.400
 maybe there at the time of the eddie van 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.810
 halen later with all these musicians 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.760
 how do you need 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.880
 but I'm just going to get these musicians who 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.250
 broke with one 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.620
 highly my logic and lyrical 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.920
 start playing more 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.370
 harder but faster and more 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.740
 circus until they have had this base 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.760
 extremely biological icb these faces 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.670
 that I mentioned 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.370
 Although they are virtuosos , they have 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.410
 a very strong logic base I was 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.960
 seeing recently some videos time 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.360
 go to the tournament in Brazil from dogs 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.130
 that you gave it and you see it sometimes 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.770
 times music that is played with che 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.560
 guevara and want to impress the touch 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.660
 send and do things right phrases 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.300
 effect you see the chile goes and time 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.740
 worried about creating phase 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.110
 interesting to interact with the public 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.020
 creates melodic lines 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.510
 it comes with the ideas of wheels but you 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.760
 sees that there is a solid foundation and 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.500
 check the musical maturity heard 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.950
 developed internally 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.990
 So it's these musicians give that were 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.100
 reference in my generation they had 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.960
 this element 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.940
 but my generation of a generation more 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.630
 newcomer ended up watching the music of a 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.610
 Otherwise I only need musicians. 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.890
 year corrupted us that that movement 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.420
 more melodic in that there was only one side 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.880
 stolen god 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.680
 leaving aside the articulation all the 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.690
 expression tools that I spoke to and 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.550
 excluding this and leaving only one 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.250
 other side so much that nowadays when 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.960
 If we talk about a buggy, then the action is done. 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.480
 is no longer a pejorative expression 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.260
 they really saw a modality I'm 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.690
 speaking against this I'm talking about 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:07.560
 only have this and deleted another part 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:11.250
 then that link that has to be rescued 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.740
 of the younger musicians if the reference 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.020
 of you just this one these 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.290
 virtuoso musicians 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.780
 if you do not have that link you ask 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.270
 most important tool of music that 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.790
 is the side that connects emotionally with 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.040
 these people for example you'm 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.950
 music that I really like and sleeps 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.950
 night you see he has a virtuous side 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.190
 but he has an extremely 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.900
 a face that plays 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.900
 emotional and sentimental and I 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.870
 eg expose this more virtuous side too 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.330
 it 's just a more emotional giveaway is 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.820
 actually have the influences within it 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.740
 and these things spring naturally 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.979
 so I want to leave this message alone 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.830
 here if you feel that this is the 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.650
 was lost try to listen more requires 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.449
 songs that create this basis only of what is 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.740
 extremely important not only in the 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.530
 guitar but any other instrument 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.780
 you can develop your music from 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.970
 emotional way also take advantage of and 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.380
 talk of the school of history kelly of 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.020
 music that now also a school 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.539
 virtual and you can do all 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.690
 classes that we have in the classroom 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:24.150
 that are recorded and placed on the site by 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.169
 less than half the school 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.760
 presential 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:29.130
 you have access to all classes of 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.889
 unlimited form I am entitled to 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.130
 access a north zap support group

 practically connected 24 hours a day does not 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.699
 also lets you see the material 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:46.250
 totally chronological 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:46.250
 future of brazil in nascar with god
