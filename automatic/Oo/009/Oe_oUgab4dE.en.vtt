to<00:00:50.510> aggressive<00:01:00.109> start<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.649> important

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
to aggressive start up here so important

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.660 
to aggressive start up here so important
because<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.270> long<00:01:03.449> flat<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.080> 20<00:01:04.769> seconds

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
because it's a long flat it's 20 seconds

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.340 
because it's a long flat it's 20 seconds
of<00:01:05.820> flat<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.510> there's<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.900> lot<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.200> little

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
of flat and there's a lot of little

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
of flat and there's a lot of little
trends<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> know<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.430> train<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.910 
guys on the US team we come up here
before<00:01:15.740> like<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:17.100> November<00:01:17.970> sometime

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
before like in November sometime

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.499 
before like in November sometime
practice<00:01:19.920> our<00:01:20.070> starts<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.150> what's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
practice our starts and we know what's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.240 
practice our starts and we know what's
the<00:01:21.689> fastest<00:01:22.170> start<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:22.890> brings<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the fastest start and what brings the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.760 
the fastest start and what brings the
most<00:01:23.400> speed<00:01:23.700> onto<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.470> that's<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
most speed onto that and that's just a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.440 
most speed onto that and that's just a
subtle<00:01:25.979> little<00:01:26.189> advantage<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.299> it's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
subtle little advantage we have but it's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.060 
subtle little advantage we have but it's
I<00:01:27.840> think<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.950> makes<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.280> big<00:01:29.490> difference

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.020 

we're<00:01:32.760> here<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:34.800> steepest<00:01:35.670> part<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
