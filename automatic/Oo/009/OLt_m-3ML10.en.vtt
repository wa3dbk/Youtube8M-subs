00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.530
 a priori great motorcycle 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.379
 what you get is not buying a snow leopard 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.309
 paying 5000 rubles steel pendulum 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.070
 speak because well there it is worth 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.840
 front fork she's pretty good 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.500
 is amortizing and the fork stroke is pretty there 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.720
 tall for 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.170
 motocross motorcycle it is acceptable as 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.960
 how can I buy a snow leopard? 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.700
 thousand and now buy a snow leopard this is the same 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.770
 to play Russian roulette 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.200
 never guess there is a cartridge or 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.110
 I also never guess with snow leopards 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.420
 good or bad to me now many 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.799

 already the second year and I have everything with him 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.509
 fine I do not argue there are such people but 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.610
 only you are very lucky 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.950
 there are those people who have snow leopards 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.719
 fold up just a month after driving 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.549
 only 20 moto hours and they already have everything 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.729
 there are already problems with the gearbox 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.020
 and with a partner the band is easy as lucky 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.410
 may be lucky may not be lucky 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.250
 why does it need to be explained to them 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.890
 no need here you get a carburetor 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.930
 he has n 26 which is just awesome 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:25.460
 japanese carburetor please japan 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.040
 there you get such a Russian 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.480
 carburetor with knobs in the floor you just 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.250
 he will start to choke on the owners 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.820
 snow leopard try pushing your pen in 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.720
 the floor you will choke here 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.370
 there is no such thing but seriously what can I do 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.620
 I don't understand, but explain to me why 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.200
 pay extra without paying 5000 rubles 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.310
 buy a motorcycle that you have 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.370
 well I don't know percent 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.140
 60 I do not know how much to take 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.020
 statistics of those people who bought 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.239
 snow leopard and take the percentage from which 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.120
 the snow leopard does not break and then from there everything is 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.070
 it will be clear which bike is better for me 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.530
 Many write in lichku here is how that 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.450
 advice and the like those who would buy 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.220
 with still never I did not write that here at 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.070
 I have some problems there 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.690
 I have something went wrong there was one 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.670
 the man who cleaned the carburetor 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.350
 something wrong he connected because 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.260
 now it won't start but it's clean 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.570
 his fault and not the fault of the motorcycle 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.340
 that there I switched the transfer yes there with 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.760
 I lost my clutch there 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.890
 Box was not such as to have never 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.400
 difference from snow leopards when there simply if 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.580
 you will type 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.830
 irbis ttr 125 google and then you get 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.350
 there is a package of reviews where people 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.739
 write here in my clutch fell off 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.810
 4 bolts turned everything to me 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.540
 primary shafts and secondary times 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.730
 tore me a coil in the generator and 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.130
 the whole engine under the replacement is easier 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.350
 buy a new motorcycle emma but 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.060
 agree this is nonsense or maybe something I 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.420
 don't understand serious I was shocked when 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.000
 I saw the price now the snow leopard and the price here 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.350
 this is a motorcycle in my opinion this motorcycle 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.930
 he is much better than u loves or maybe i 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.000
 wrong if I'm wrong well correct me 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.160
 that's basically all i wanted to say 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.350
