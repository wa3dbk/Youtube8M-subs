00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.170

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.430
 Monte Romero Monte Electro Monte 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:17.670
 they are the 'top ten' books that I 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:19.140
 led to the university I did not know how 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.029
 call this video because it is not a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.529
 top ten but yes that are the days books 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.300
 that I have decided to go to university 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.189
 well now today I'm moving 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.650
 that today I take ten books for the uni 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.269
 for the tamper to come to live so 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.150
 I decide to teach them to see what you think 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.430
 a video that have made several boost Ã¼ber 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.660
 so nothing now she the pants and the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.890
 shirt that you will see along the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.460
 video I leave it in the warm description 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.050
 portion of interest is worth the first book 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.580
 that I've been carrying more been channels of 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.770
 shadow the origins the first part 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.940
 angel medium disco by cassandra clare 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.590
 because as you know law and the saga of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.080
 hunters of shadows and the truth is that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.300
 it did not convince me much and well I did not read the 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.440
 saga law the first book did not convince me 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.570
 a lot and then I swallowed the piece 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.950
 after the movie how does it end 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.360
 third book then at the end then 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.620
 decides to leave the saga because he did not have 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.110
 a lot of desire 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.610
 the origins so I started with a 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.230
 exchange with many thanks here have 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.540
 to the girls with whom I exchange it 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.040
 and I take it to the university to see 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.510
 if I start the trilogy the things that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.340
 I want to have the first three and the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.010
 three integral parts start reading it 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.560
 but well you'll see in the Pongo no longer 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.980

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.280
 I liked them although I did not love them 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.260

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.630
 saga I'm not clear about the truth 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.160
 lauren oliver surely know of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.260
 the trilogy delirium models and no 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.910
 I wake up to myself but awake I loved it 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.710
 and the delirium trilogy I liked it was not 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.570
 everything I expected and had many 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.640
 I wanted to read for nick because I saw the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 synopsis as soon as it came out before 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.820

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.979
 about what was I saw the seamstress 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.560

 is in English and it is not known if it is going to 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.190
 translate in Spanish it's weird that still 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.599
 no editorial is to say sm that is the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.000

 has a great looking normal person's 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.110
 benito bring is a book that is not 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.819
 sells in bookstores in Spain and what 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.349
 I bought in book depository all world 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.000
 says where I bought it and it's there 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.620
 who bring them with free shipping expenses and 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.629
 it's super cheap I think it cost me 7 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.459
 euros or left the description box on 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.750
 link and if you want to buy it and a 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.670
 book those who speak the likes see 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.560
 Marian Hispanic Americans for example 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.760
 it was a lot of Alberto Villarreal and 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.959
 I really wanted to read it 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.109
 because I have been recommended more 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.819
 heap and it's already mine I bought it I'm going to 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.829
 read pronitito especially by marianna 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.620
 because I'm giving the book hype 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.709
 I hope to read it and give my opinion and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.959
 that normal person should try I love 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.329
 I say game of rooms and ferb is the fourth 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.050
 part of the trilogy but read it are already 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.340
 little liars 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.530
 we should know taking little by little 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.220
 because there are 16 books you know weeks of 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.570
 the most and the last one that I have here in 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.710
 house I hope to buy in the fifth and the 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.700
 sixth when I finish it because the 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.400
 true that a saga that I like 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.690
 quite and I really want to read it 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.370
 so I'm taking it is in English 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.570
 you also have it in Spanish 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.950
 I know up to what number is it public in 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.540
 Spanish but in Spanish it's not worth it 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.310
 because they probably will not publish 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.020
 the entire saga and because they are also the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.690
 twice as expensive this book cost I think 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.520
 six euros or five degrees 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.320
 fulminada de jennifer bosworth is a 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.370
 novel that he gave me is in the channel fa 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.900
 in which mattel frei who wants it for 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.780
 here thank you very much gave it to me in 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.920
 union the calera and in a novel of the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.690
 I heard a lot of talk 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.040
 I have read very good reviews the truth 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.500
 is that they have to read it and they have mine 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.640
 own and is one of the novels that I 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.110
 helped because not all of those that I have 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.760
 accumulated by reading the ones I have 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.650
 you win and I hope to sink your tooth soon 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.800
 I also got to infinite others the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.780
 mind is to say my book and I'll take it 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.580
 because I have some copies that I 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.170
 belong by author and I wanted to have one 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.060
 there on the bookshelf to record and 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.980
 because many times they ask me what 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.989
 book is cali which someone ends my 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.459
 home and want me to teach it so 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.910
 I decide to the world of my copy and 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.910
 I developed 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.410
 and I do not know if it seems like a song for 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.910
 you dislike that in another book of the 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.760
 same author who also wins the draw 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.800
 I am thank you very much, I am and 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.300
 I'm reading I've been a quarter of the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.040
 book and you'll see that I'm loving it for 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.530
 that officially have them read other 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.180
 books of the author and is that I did not expect 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.410
 that I liked for nothing as much as I 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.550
 He is enjoying taking out books because 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.990
 the other two I liked so much without 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.700
 But this is delighting me 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.920
 moment takes a 5 out of 5 to see how 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.420
 he continues I like it a lot I do not know if 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.740
 I have read this book thank you I think 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.240
 which is the most famous in Spain 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.580
 is the most famous besides the one that most 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.590
 speaks and I'm really enjoying that and 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.540
 will come out in the September rap of meis 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.400
 James ways yesterday is a very novel 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.290
 famous no longer know super famous a 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.610
 excellent ipod and jandrÃ­n game to the 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.490
 hunger or albert heijn games 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.990
 divergent is from this novel or under the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.450
 same star that they become super famous 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.400
 I have it since June of which I speak was 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.780
 of an exchange and the truth that I have 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.280
 very much you want what happens that for 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.470
 some reason I'm lazy and that's why 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.700
 It's very long I'm looking forward to it 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.110
 I think that among other things I feel lazy 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.510
 because as I have it 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.190
 parties with much pleasure to wait but 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.840
 yes that one of the novels that I have 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.400
 You want to read, you do not recommend me 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.530
 l'esplai although you think I should do 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.300
 less then in the comments but I the 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.160
 I'm going to come back just in case 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.170
 by the head read it already and finally 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.880
 I wanted to show the driver and cars the 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.710
 third part of the trilogy I take 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.450
 to carry the trilogy once you 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.670
 I commented in the book tal de taylor swift 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.800
 known here you have seen me 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.570
 do what you start what I left him a 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.130
 I left it a little bit because it suits me 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.410
 very large spoiler of what happens to the 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.120
 end of legal I want to read it I said it 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.680
 in the video I also think read it what 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.480
 It happens that I feel a lot of pain 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.830
 I've eaten but I'll take it 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.270
 because I have to finish this trilogy so 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.370
 famous I want to finish it before 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.290
 leave the last movie evidently 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.760
 so if I see it on the shelf with 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.560
 just nine more books I think I'm going to 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.000
 feel the obligation to read it and nothing 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.280
 up here the ten books that I'm going to 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.900
 take huelva in the books of 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.130
 publishing books and gifts and 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.840
 all of that from now on I'm going to 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.670
 start to get to the floor so that already 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.320
 I will teach it in a boom hall as always 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.760
 these books there will be some that already 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.700
 you have seen others that you have not 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.960
 seen before and well you can tell in 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.820
 the comments that you want him to 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.680
 before I do not know what I'm going to do the truth
