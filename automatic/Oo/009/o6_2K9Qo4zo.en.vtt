now I'm talking as if it's a foregone
conclusion<00:02:38.099> I'm<00:02:38.790> speculating<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.870> me

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
conclusion I'm speculating but to me

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.750 
conclusion I'm speculating but to me
this<00:02:40.200> seems<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.560> yeah<00:02:41.250> they<00:02:41.430> know<00:02:41.609> they

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
this seems like yeah they know they

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.099 
this seems like yeah they know they
can't<00:02:42.000> open<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.420> same<00:02:42.629> day<00:02:42.659> and<00:02:42.870> they<00:02:42.989> will

can't open on the same day and they will

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.509 
can't open on the same day and they will
probably<00:02:43.290> move<00:02:43.500> Shep<00:02:43.799> how<00:02:43.889> do<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.069> see<00:02:44.189> it<00:02:44.219> I
