 mike congratulations on the victory in dresden im 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.539
 last third bit hectic yes it 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.579
 was hard work in the beliefs 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.070
 first 40 minutes we have relative 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.699
 Compact played and on our chances 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.370
 Waited and unfortunately we were 1 0 1 im 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.629
 but residue in the second third 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.910
 expert times 2 1 in leadership 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.920
 but that started again 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.530
 and we were up front and then we out 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.320
 undecided pressure and then to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.600
 final concert 33 we just have to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.150
 accept and in overtime we have 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 Good chances got and then in the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.900
 shootout have our guys a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.670
 Chance ice cold exploited 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.040
 that was the difference today i have to 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.830
 say is long you have outstanding 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.650
 held today and we were always in 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.689
 Game case he has the first first 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.530
 shot and then our defense 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:18.750
 after tidying up and cleaning up today 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.070
 yes it shows something okay that would be 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.840
 team makes mistakes 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.240
 but in the end we have that good 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.600
 made and we found a way 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 the two today to get the victory 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.700
 you had the feeling of being so innovative 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.109
 rely on jonas and play the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.130
 time and time we have seen this wrong 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.710
 or was that a bit tactical 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.439
 never before in the first first change 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.229
 I do not mean that with my intention 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.390
 but the defender has no free 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.219
 seen pass 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.770
 played back and then but then 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.090
 since I'm there we 're at four-five 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.249
 good chances come 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.340
 and second, there is a sick one 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:59.969
 went in but yes that was not 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.789
 Intention that was only the first player 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.689
 have done and they have earlier 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.689
 embellish that I like that
