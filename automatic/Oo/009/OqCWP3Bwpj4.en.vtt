just wanted to show you this starter

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.390 
just wanted to show you this starter
here

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
here

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.530 
here
it's<00:02:42.000> got<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.360> significant<00:02:43.230> damage

significant<00:02:45.540> damage<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.290> starter<00:02:46.739> equals

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
significant damage to the starter equals

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.130 
significant damage to the starter equals
significant<00:02:47.970> damage<00:02:48.359> to<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.660> pockets

significant damage to the pockets

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.330 
significant damage to the pockets
because<00:02:50.540> these<00:02:51.540> run<00:02:51.900> about<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.829> hundred<00:02:53.220> hours

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
because these run about a hundred hours

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.300

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
for 80 80 to 100 for the cheapest ones

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.460 
for 80 80 to 100 for the cheapest ones
so<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.069> nice<00:02:59.250> hit<00:02:59.489> today<00:03:00.290> procede<00:03:01.290> all

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
right we got our new starter about to do

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.300 
right we got our new starter about to do
the<00:03:03.840> install<00:03:05.870> nice<00:03:06.870> shiny<00:03:07.260> brand<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.859> starter

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the install nice shiny brand the starter

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.370 
the install nice shiny brand the starter
I<00:03:08.340> got<00:03:08.639> already<00:03:09.090> comes<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> lead<00:03:10.049> right

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
I got already comes with a lead right

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.729 
I got already comes with a lead right
here<00:03:10.799> which<00:03:13.549> shrink-wrapped<00:03:15.109> and<00:03:16.109> all's<00:03:16.680> you

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
here which shrink-wrapped and all's you

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.270 
here which shrink-wrapped and all's you
got<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:16.950> do<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.400> where<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.730> cut<00:03:17.940> your<00:03:18.090> wire

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
got to do is where you cut your wire

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.920 
got to do is where you cut your wire
slip<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.549> there<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.880> crimp<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.239> I'm<00:03:21.630> using

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
slip it in there and crimp it I'm using

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.379 
slip it in there and crimp it I'm using
this<00:03:22.170> instead<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.430> connector<00:03:24.239> on

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
this instead because the connector on

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.000 
this instead because the connector on
the<00:03:24.420> one<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.079> they<00:03:25.230> give<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.709> like

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
the one that they give you is like

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.530 
the one that they give you is like
pretty<00:03:26.280> garbage<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.120> doesn't<00:03:27.420> really

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
pretty garbage and it doesn't really

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.479 
pretty garbage and it doesn't really
hold<00:03:27.810> too<00:03:28.049> tight<00:03:28.079> so<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.590> basically<00:03:28.859> stripped

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
hold too tight so I basically stripped

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.030 
hold too tight so I basically stripped
the<00:03:29.609> wire<00:03:29.790> off<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.540> I'm<00:03:31.260> gonna<00:03:31.650> put<00:03:31.889> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
the wire off that and I'm gonna put the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.069 
the wire off that and I'm gonna put the
blue<00:03:32.250> piece<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:32.910> between<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.420> two<00:03:33.600> crimp<00:03:33.959> them

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
blue piece in between the two crimp them

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.650 
blue piece in between the two crimp them
together<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.709> then<00:03:35.340> I'll<00:03:35.459> heat<00:03:36.060> shrink<00:03:36.480> the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
together and then I'll heat shrink the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.080 
together and then I'll heat shrink the
thing<00:03:37.650> with<00:03:37.859> my<00:03:37.980> lighter<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.549> that'll<00:03:38.880> be<00:03:38.970> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
thing with my lighter and that'll be the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.729 
thing with my lighter and that'll be the
end<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.389> that<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:40.470> so

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.309 

and<00:03:47.739> then<00:03:47.859> they're<00:03:48.450> crimp<00:03:49.450> up<00:03:49.629> your<00:03:49.810> end

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
and then they're crimp up your end

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.949 
and then they're crimp up your end
make<00:03:51.310> sure<00:03:51.489> that's<00:03:51.670> real<00:03:52.000> nice<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:52.900> tight

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
make sure that's real nice and tight

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.190 
make sure that's real nice and tight
when<00:03:53.379> you<00:03:53.469> do<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:54.269> now<00:03:55.269> slide<00:03:55.780> your<00:03:55.810> heat

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
when you do it now slide your heat

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.809 
when you do it now slide your heat
shrink<00:03:56.560> over<00:03:57.180> get<00:03:58.180> out<00:03:58.269> your<00:03:58.510> heat<00:03:59.819> proceeded

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
shrink over get out your heat proceeded

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.599 
shrink over get out your heat proceeded
to<00:04:00.969> shrink<00:04:03.750> hopefully<00:04:04.750> we<00:04:04.870> don't<00:04:05.400> melt<00:04:06.400> the

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
to shrink hopefully we don't melt the

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:14.210 
to shrink hopefully we don't melt the
song<00:04:06.819> bitch<00:04:12.120> looks<00:04:13.120> good<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.420> me

little bit on the back side a little bit
I'm<00:04:21.280> not<00:04:21.340> sure<00:04:21.849> that<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.509> proper<00:04:22.840> way

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
I'm not sure that this is the proper way

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.430 
I'm not sure that this is the proper way
to<00:04:22.990> do<00:04:23.199> this<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:24.490> that's<00:04:24.669> what<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:24.940> got
