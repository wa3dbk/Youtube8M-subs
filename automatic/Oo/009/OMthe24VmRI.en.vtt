00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.320
 really famous because today around 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.400
 own thing namely the quality 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.680
 I have the times already them 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.430
 I've been talking about how 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.990
 Can you actually the quality of 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 nutritional supplements of dietary 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.080
 foods depending on how you use them 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.029
 how would you like to call that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.510
 Actually , I've already realized 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.009
 Mentioned the raw materials are 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.899
 actually the quality of the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.030
 composition of the products above 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.739
 You can of course argue heard 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.559
 her also honest opinion information 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.840
 just at tnt we are respectively 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.450
 I am always evidence based too 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.100
 work just as evidence-based 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.020
 the prob already have as general about 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.629
 Training and nutrition gge knows there 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.820
 determines my video for that I love 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.460
 By the way, all of you here on the left here 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.980
 below of which I am now in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.410
 speak this video and there I have 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 just in this it was about bcaa are im 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.700
 I just mentioned video in the video 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.460
 yes, the raw materials are actually that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.229
 important in the whole story so 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.850
 and then I thought about it okay 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.890
 would like every single raw material 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.960
 actually take and every single one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.030
 raw material with me just in the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.380
 give analysis or the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.150
 Analysis certificates of 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.979
 raw material suppliers more simply times 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.000
 I'm sure that mine 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.770
 wages manufacturer makes it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 usually so that if he 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.420
 actually, raw materials from another 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.640
 land bought as germany she bought 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.060
 Nevertheless, with their German dealers theirs 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.470
 already done homework 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.689
 but not necessarily mean that now 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 means trust is good control 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.310
 So we better leave all raw materials 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.970
 which are used with us simply 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.229
 times I certify or analyze 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.820
 I have been there for a very long time with that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.590
 wage manufacturers entertained and very much 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.780
 often and very much like e-mails 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.369
 and forth and correspondence pipapo and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.070
 then we realized that was very 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.510
 very very very very expensive 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.740
 and really much too 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.890
 complicated to even see that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.590
 that will somehow be 40 pages 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.410
 Paperwork per product has been so now 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.050
 I said the moment I have 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.070
 yes finished products already with me 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.270
 stand 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:21.120
 we already have tnt enters vision 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.940
 technology 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.790
 that means we have finished now 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.430
 Products taken and have them 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.270
 hygienic microbiological 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.820
 subjected to tests and these 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.630
 Analysis certificates we have the whole 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:43.380
 again at ao pop in mainz made the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.120
 also care for other industry internal 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.840
 companies that means they have others 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.910
 Manufacturer 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.920
 but the labels do checks there 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.830
 we are the only one I am now 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.180
 at least I know him too 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.840
 microbiological analyzes of Yeni 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.820
 does or this 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.190
 published for the quality 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:06.020
 to highlight and I link you 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.580
 is below under here in these 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.120
 will then words under this words 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.670
 Video 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.360
 in the description you have a link 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.300
 to our homepage to our brands 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.769
 homepage / quality there we still explain 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.800
 everything we do in things 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.570
 quality assurance and all that 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.330
 Of course it has its costs 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.950
 that's probably why tnt is a bit 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.019
 higher priced than our second 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.730
 Team for example for us 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.000
 many of these just do not analyze 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.400
 make or maybe even maybe 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.130
 even almost all of this analysis is not 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.290
 because of course the whole thing 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.630
 price of a product always experienced that 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.430
 goes over the selling price of the customer 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.959
 that is logical above all else 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.690
 with such a small manufacturer as us 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.310
 the whole thing is I love you all the way 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.860
 down times topsy here 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.340
 because we go so far and say 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.959
 okay with tnt we want the quality 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.480
 not only assert but also prove 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.500
 and that's just as regular as 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.970
 the cologne list 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.040
 he is a journalist at the cologne list 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.630
 Duty once a year we will 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.970
 not once a year but we do 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.280
 will do it more often and also at the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.530
 microbiological investigations 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.720
 now more often these examinations in 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.140
 give order to make it very clear 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.030
 that these products really are from 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.830
 highest quality are not just after 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.840
 the highest quality standards 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.770
 Of course they are produced as it is in 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.750
 Germany is the case 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.400
 but I can also go after the highest 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.280
 standards a simple raw material 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.280
 process and the finished products 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.980
 all raw materials already have them all 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.669
 even the smallest are many raw materials 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.580
 in there 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.890
 that is when the complete product is in 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.900
 order is then also the raw materials 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.090
 ok and you can still find 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.130
 Let's explain what exactly we did there 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.130
 we have that in the future and 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.900
 if you then on the assortment side 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.090
 goes and then the product itself 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.960
 there you can also find on the right 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.580
 page the microbiological analyzes like 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.930
 said we want one again 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.780
 a pioneering role 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.780
 not only that in it is what it says 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.160
 but that what's in it too 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.150
 qualitatively absolutely ok and of 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.150
 highest quality is
