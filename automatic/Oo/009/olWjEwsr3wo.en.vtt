00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.130 
having your body over the line we want
to<00:01:37.909> do<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:38.390> we<00:01:38.509> can<00:01:38.659> get<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:38.930> much

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
to do that so we can get this much

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.200 
to do that so we can get this much
closer<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.560> automatically<00:01:40.310> cut<00:01:40.640> a<00:01:40.670> tenth<00:01:41.000> off

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
closer and automatically cut a tenth off

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.170 
closer and automatically cut a tenth off
of<00:01:41.360> our<00:01:41.509> forty<00:01:41.810> time<00:01:42.520> so<00:01:43.520> what<00:01:43.700> we<00:01:43.820> want<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.030> do

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.410 
of our forty time so what we want to do
is<00:01:44.420> we<00:01:44.869> want<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.080> have<00:01:45.200> our<00:01:45.380> foot<00:01:45.710> six<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:47.240> nine

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
is we want to have our foot six to nine

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.749 
is we want to have our foot six to nine
inches<00:01:47.720> from<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.200> line<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.680> try<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.460> get<00:01:49.640> as

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
inches from the line I try to get as

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.120 
inches from the line I try to get as
close<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.479> line<00:01:50.659> as<00:01:50.689> possible<00:01:51.350> what

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
close to the line as possible what

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.710 
close to the line as possible what
you'll<00:01:52.310> have<00:01:52.400> to<00:01:52.490> do<00:01:52.670> here<00:01:52.939> is<00:01:53.210> play<00:01:53.450> with<00:01:53.509> this

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
you'll have to do here is play with this

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.719 
you'll have to do here is play with this
stance<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.590> figure<00:01:55.159> out<00:01:55.189> what's<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.579> most

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
stance and figure out what's the most

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.330 
stance and figure out what's the most
comfortable<00:01:56.270> for<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:56.659> taller<00:01:57.079> athletes<00:01:57.740> are

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
comfortable for you taller athletes are

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.530 
comfortable for you taller athletes are
going<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.579> have<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.880> move<00:01:59.030> back<00:01:59.210> farther

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
going to have to move back farther

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.440 
going to have to move back farther
shorter<00:02:00.350> athletes<00:02:00.799> can<00:02:01.040> move<00:02:01.220> closer<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.360> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
shorter athletes can move closer to the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.510 
shorter athletes can move closer to the
line<00:02:02.630> but<00:02:03.140> we<00:02:03.200> want<00:02:03.439> to<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:03.619> as<00:02:03.770> close<00:02:04.220> as

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
line but we want to get as close as

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.370 
line but we want to get as close as
possible<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.479> line<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:05.899> we<00:02:06.049> can<00:02:06.079> turn<00:02:06.290> this

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
possible to the line so we can turn this

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.020 
possible to the line so we can turn this
into<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.740> thirty<00:02:06.979> nine<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:07.399> a<00:02:07.460> half

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
into a thirty nine and a half

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.110 
into a thirty nine and a half
-<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:09.530> next<00:02:09.740> thing<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:10.069> where<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.399> put<00:02:10.429> your

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
pointing straight ahead so you can run a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.150 
pointing straight ahead so you can run a
straight<00:02:44.330> line<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.840> get<00:02:44.989> all<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.350> power<00:02:45.560> that

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
straight line and get all the power that

you're going to push off with in your
stance<00:02:47.840> straight<00:02:48.560> ahead<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.400> first<00:02:49.670> thing

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
stance straight ahead so the first thing

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.580 
stance straight ahead so the first thing
to<00:02:49.880> do<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.690> we're<00:02:50.810> gonna<00:02:50.900> get<00:02:50.989> up<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.260> our<00:02:51.350> toes

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
to do is we're gonna get up on our toes

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.400 
to do is we're gonna get up on our toes
and<00:02:51.920> we're<00:02:52.519> gonna<00:02:52.610> creep<00:02:53.000> out<00:02:53.300> as<00:02:53.810> far<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:54.230> we

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
and we're gonna creep out as far as we

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.770 
and we're gonna creep out as far as we
can<00:02:54.680> over<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.190> line<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:56.150> reason<00:02:56.420> why<00:02:56.510> we<00:02:56.630> do

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
can over the line the reason why we do

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.380 
can over the line the reason why we do
this<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.230> because<00:02:57.500> we<00:02:58.340> want<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.610> mimic<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.180> as

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
this is because we want to mimic this as

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.600 
this is because we want to mimic this as
much<00:02:59.600> as<00:02:59.630> possible<00:03:00.050> in<00:03:00.560> our<00:03:00.709> stance<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.370> we<00:03:01.459> can

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
much as possible in our stance so we can

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.640 
much as possible in our stance so we can
actually<00:03:01.790> have<00:03:02.060> our<00:03:02.120> body<00:03:02.420> over<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> line<00:03:03.019> the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
actually have our body over the line the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.880 
actually have our body over the line the
next<00:03:03.950> thing<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:04.190> do<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.550> creep<00:03:05.180> back<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.390> few<00:03:05.890> put

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
next thing to do is creep back a few put

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.400 
next thing to do is creep back a few put
your<00:03:07.069> hand<00:03:07.250> behind<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.700> line<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.410> we're

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
your hand behind the line and we're

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.320 
your hand behind the line and we're
going<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.590> try<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:09.860> hold<00:03:10.160> this<00:03:10.610> body<00:03:10.970> lean

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
going to try to hold this body lean

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.720 
going to try to hold this body lean
position<00:03:12.019> that<00:03:12.170> we're<00:03:12.320> in<00:03:12.350> when<00:03:13.100> we<00:03:13.220> take<00:03:13.489> off

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
position that we're in when we take off

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.729 
position that we're in when we take off
the<00:03:14.420> reason<00:03:14.660> we<00:03:14.750> do<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.079> is<00:03:15.290> because<00:03:15.410> it

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
the reason we do this is because it

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.680 
the reason we do this is because it
automatically<00:03:16.220> gives<00:03:16.459> us<00:03:16.579> weight<00:03:16.790> forward<00:03:17.269> so

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
automatically gives us weight forward so

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.530 
automatically gives us weight forward so

is we're going to keep it in a 90 degree

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.319 
is we're going to keep it in a 90 degree
angle<00:04:04.219> put<00:04:05.219> it<00:04:05.310> on<00:04:05.400> our<00:04:05.430> button<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.000> reason<00:04:06.239> we

he<00:04:16.650> sees<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:16.919> down<00:04:17.310> he<00:04:18.269> starts<00:04:18.600> at<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.720> top

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
he sees that down he starts at the top

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.529 
he sees that down he starts at the top
so<00:04:19.769> we<00:04:19.919> want<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.220> kind<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.430> fool<00:04:20.639> him<00:04:20.910> maybe
