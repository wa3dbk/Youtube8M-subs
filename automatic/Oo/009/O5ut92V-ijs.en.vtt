00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
it's a difficult step if you're stopping

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.830 
it's a difficult step if you're stopping

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
and then trying to move it's a

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.629 
and then trying to move it's a
continuous<00:05:13.440> action<00:05:13.620> but<00:05:13.949> I'm<00:05:14.039> trying<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.400> show

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
continuous action but I'm trying to show

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.070 
continuous action but I'm trying to show
you<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:15.030> action<00:05:15.870> of<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.320> slow<00:05:17.130> quick-quick

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
you the action of that slow quick-quick

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.830 
you the action of that slow quick-quick
there<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.229> a<00:05:19.260> slight<00:05:20.160> pause<00:05:20.550> for<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.060> man<00:05:21.270> so

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
there is a slight pause for the man so

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.659 
there is a slight pause for the man so
you<00:05:21.900> can<00:05:22.080> complete<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.590> turn<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:23.070> danced<00:05:23.520> it

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
you can complete the turn I danced it

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.219 
you can complete the turn I danced it
one<00:05:23.789> more<00:05:23.970> time<00:05:24.180> in<00:05:24.450> the<00:05:24.539> opposite<00:05:24.810> direction

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
one more time in the opposite direction

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.890 
one more time in the opposite direction
so<00:05:26.810> we're<00:05:27.810> here<00:05:28.229> we<00:05:28.560> danced<00:05:28.800> slow<00:05:29.760> quick<00:05:30.660> quick

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
so we're here we danced slow quick quick

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.120 
so we're here we danced slow quick quick
I<00:05:32.599> think<00:05:33.599> a<00:05:33.690> very<00:05:34.020> important<00:05:34.590> point<00:05:34.800> for<00:05:35.039> the

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
I think a very important point for the

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.190 
I think a very important point for the
man<00:05:35.250> at<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.460> end<00:05:35.490> is<00:05:35.849> it<00:05:36.330> can<00:05:36.479> complete<00:05:36.960> his

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
man at the end is it can complete his

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.920 
man at the end is it can complete his
left<00:05:37.500> side<00:05:37.770> round<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.460> meet<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.789> girl<00:05:39.060> it's<00:05:39.690> no

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
left side round to meet the girl it's no

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.690 
left side round to meet the girl it's no
good<00:05:40.139> creating<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.830> turn<00:05:41.070> at<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.340> end<00:05:41.370> and

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
good creating the turn at the end and

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.070 
good creating the turn at the end and
finishing<00:05:42.389> like<00:05:42.630> this<00:05:43.530> open<00:05:44.570> you<00:05:45.570> must<00:05:45.900> be

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
finishing like this open you must be

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.350 
finishing like this open you must be
able<00:05:46.169> to<00:05:46.320> complete<00:05:46.710> that<00:05:46.740> turn<00:05:47.190> around<00:05:48.030> his

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
able to complete that turn around his

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.920 
able to complete that turn around his
right<00:05:48.660> foot<00:05:48.990> I<00:05:49.729> think<00:05:50.729> a<00:05:51.000> key<00:05:51.210> point<00:05:51.479> for<00:05:51.660> this

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
right foot I think a key point for this

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.189 
right foot I think a key point for this
step<00:05:52.229> is<00:05:52.560> I<00:05:52.860> believe<00:05:53.370> Marcus<00:05:54.150> starts<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:54.930> step

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
step is I believe Marcus starts the step

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.390 
step is I believe Marcus starts the step
so<00:05:55.680> he<00:05:55.919> starts<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:56.760> finished<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.870> Ronde<00:05:58.320> I<00:05:58.560> hold

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
so he starts I finished the Ronde I hold

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.029 
so he starts I finished the Ronde I hold
myself<00:05:59.610> very<00:06:00.120> still<00:06:00.599> so<00:06:01.080> that<00:06:01.229> he<00:06:01.500> completes

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
myself very still so that he completes

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.089 
myself very still so that he completes
the<00:06:02.190> turn<00:06:02.599> so<00:06:03.599> in<00:06:03.660> fact<00:06:03.900> although<00:06:04.110> he<00:06:04.500> starts

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
the turn so in fact although he starts

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:11.510 
the turn so in fact although he starts
he<00:06:05.669> starts<00:06:06.020> I'll<00:06:07.020> go<00:06:07.440> I<00:06:07.770> stop<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:08.849> he<00:06:09.539> goes<00:06:10.520> we

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
he starts I'll go I stop and he goes we

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.180 
he starts I'll go I stop and he goes we
don't<00:06:11.729> both<00:06:12.000> try<00:06:12.360> to<00:06:12.419> turn<00:06:12.930> at<00:06:13.320> the<00:06:13.620> same<00:06:13.860> time

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
don't both try to turn at the same time

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.300 
don't both try to turn at the same time
in<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:14.760> same<00:06:15.030> space<00:06:15.530> again<00:06:16.530> we're<00:06:16.949> keeping
