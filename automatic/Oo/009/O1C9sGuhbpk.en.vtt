hi<00:00:05.430> hey<00:00:05.760> you're<00:00:05.910> doing<00:00:06.180> Justin<00:00:06.660> here<00:00:06.930> with

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
hi hey you're doing Justin here with

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.379 
hi hey you're doing Justin here with
another<00:00:07.470> quick<00:00:07.800> tip<00:00:08.069> for<00:00:08.310> you<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.700> today<00:00:09.120> I'm

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
another quick tip for you and today I'm

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.360 
another quick tip for you and today I'm
going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.630> be<00:00:09.750> explaining<00:00:10.260> when<00:00:10.950> you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
going to be explaining when you

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.240 
going to be explaining when you
shouldn't<00:00:11.820> learn<00:00:12.000> scales<00:00:12.510> now<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.740> course<00:00:14.040> I

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
shouldn't learn scales now of course I

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.709 
shouldn't learn scales now of course I
think<00:00:14.340> scales<00:00:14.790> are<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.330> important

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
think scales are a really important

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.610 
think scales are a really important
thing<00:00:15.750> there's<00:00:16.049> loads<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.320> them<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.530> my

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:16.620 
thing there's loads of them on my

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.990 
thing there's loads of them on my
website<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.070> I've<00:00:17.160> got<00:00:17.280> lessons<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.820> stuff

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
website and I've got lessons and stuff

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.730 
website and I've got lessons and stuff
on<00:00:18.150> them<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.450> obviously<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.200> important<00:00:19.650> but

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
on them so obviously it's important but

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.530 
on them so obviously it's important but
there<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:19.950> times<00:00:20.310> when<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.820> shouldn't<00:00:21.330> learn

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
there are times when you shouldn't learn

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.940 
there are times when you shouldn't learn
them<00:00:21.780> and<00:00:22.050> that's<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.530> I<00:00:22.560> want<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.860> go

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
them and that's what I want to go

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.080 
them and that's what I want to go
through<00:00:23.250> with<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.520> today<00:00:23.700> so<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.060> first

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
through with you today so the first

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.180 
through with you today so the first
reason<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.290> shouldn't<00:00:25.590> learn<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> scale

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
reason that you shouldn't learn a scale

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.950 
reason that you shouldn't learn a scale
is<00:00:26.430> when<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.060> don't<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.510> what<00:00:27.780> you're

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
is when you don't know what you're

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
is when you don't know what you're
learning<00:00:28.350> at<00:00:28.440> 4<00:00:28.740> right<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.670> lot<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.940> people

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
learning at 4 right a lot of people

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.700 
learning at 4 right a lot of people
learn<00:00:30.330> scales<00:00:30.690> and<00:00:31.170> they<00:00:31.230> don't<00:00:31.440> know<00:00:31.560> why

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
learn scales and they don't know why

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.780 
learn scales and they don't know why
they're<00:00:31.920> learning<00:00:32.009> scales<00:00:32.399> they're<00:00:32.640> learning

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
they're learning scales they're learning

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.970 
they're learning scales they're learning
scales<00:00:33.090> because<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:34.110> heard<00:00:34.379> that<00:00:34.410> scales

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
scales because they heard that scales

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.310 
scales because they heard that scales
are<00:00:35.219> good<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> learn<00:00:35.719> or<00:00:36.719> something<00:00:37.079> really

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
are good to learn or something really

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470 
are good to learn or something really
you<00:00:37.920> know<00:00:37.949> uncompelled<00:00:38.699> like<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.420> just

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you know uncompelled like that it's just

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.119 
you know uncompelled like that it's just
doesn't<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.410> sense<00:00:40.469> doesn't<00:00:40.980> learn

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
doesn't make sense doesn't learn

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.500 
doesn't make sense doesn't learn
something<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:41.609> you<00:00:41.910> think<00:00:42.179> all<00:00:42.359> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
something because you think all you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.000 
something because you think all you
heard<00:00:42.690> somebody<00:00:43.109> said<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.530> important

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
heard somebody said it was important

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.250 
heard somebody said it was important
once<00:00:44.190> right<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.210> figure<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.659> why<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
once right you can figure out why it is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.599 
once right you can figure out why it is
that<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> should<00:00:46.559> learn<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
that you should learn it there is

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.540 
that you should learn it there is
absolutely<00:00:48.329> no<00:00:49.079> point<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.739> learning<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
absolutely no point in learning the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.399 
absolutely no point in learning the
super<00:00:50.909> low<00:00:51.030> korean<00:00:51.359> mode<00:00:51.569> if<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.260> know

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
super low korean mode if you don't know

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.739 
super low korean mode if you don't know
what<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:52.999> because<00:00:53.999> it's<00:00:54.179> for<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> very

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
what it's for because it's for a very

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.599 
what it's for because it's for a very
specific<00:00:55.199> purpose<00:00:55.769> that<00:00:56.069> you<00:00:56.159> learn<00:00:56.399> those

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
specific purpose that you learn those

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.329 
specific purpose that you learn those
type<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.909> scales<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.839> for<00:00:58.499> many<00:00:58.679> of<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
type of scales so for many of you the

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:00.709 
type of scales so for many of you the
first<00:00:59.579> scale<00:00:59.819> let<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> learn<00:01:00.359> will<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.600> either

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
first scale let you learn will be either

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.360 
first scale let you learn will be either
the<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.019> minor<00:01:01.350> pentatonic<00:01:01.679> or<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> major

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the a minor pentatonic or the major

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.000 
the a minor pentatonic or the major
scale<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.749> the<00:01:03.870> minor<00:01:04.080> pentatonic<00:01:04.290> for

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
scale so with the minor pentatonic for

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.749 
scale so with the minor pentatonic for
example<00:01:05.659> you've<00:01:06.659> learnt<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:06.960> scale<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
example you've learnt your scale and you

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.139 
example you've learnt your scale and you
can<00:01:08.939> play<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.329> and<00:01:09.509> down<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:10.880> that's<00:01:11.880> not

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
can play it up and down right that's not

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.480 
can play it up and down right that's not
using<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.719> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.500> play<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.890> scale<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
using it you can play the scale up and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.100 
using it you can play the scale up and
down<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.939> playing<00:01:15.329> scales<00:01:15.719> can<00:01:16.049> be

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
down and and playing scales can be

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.959 
down and and playing scales can be
really<00:01:16.890> good<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.250> technique<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.880> your

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
really good for your technique for your

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.609 
really good for your technique for your
picking<00:01:18.329> accuracy<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:18.990> stuff<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
picking accuracy and stuff on that and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.109 
picking accuracy and stuff on that and
finger<00:01:19.920> flexibility<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
finger flexibility and the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
finger flexibility and the
synchronization<00:01:21.899> between<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.320> two<00:01:22.469> hands<00:01:22.710> so

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
synchronization between the two hands so

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.459 
synchronization between the two hands so
learning<00:01:23.399> a<00:01:23.729> scale<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.329> not<00:01:24.539> a<00:01:24.570> bad<00:01:24.810> idea<00:01:25.020> just

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
learning a scale is not a bad idea just

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:26.929 
learning a scale is not a bad idea just
for<00:01:25.710> all<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.009> those<00:01:26.100> kind<00:01:26.399> of<00:01:26.520> technical

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
for all of those kind of technical

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
for all of those kind of technical
reasons<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.780> until<00:01:28.079> you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.320> make<00:01:28.350> music<00:01:29.039> out

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
reasons but until you can make music out

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.120 
reasons but until you can make music out
of<00:01:29.219> it<00:01:29.430> there's<00:01:29.969> no<00:01:30.090> point<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.930> learning<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
of it there's no point in learning the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.399 
of it there's no point in learning the
next<00:01:32.399> position<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.840> say<00:01:34.109> this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
next position of it so this say this

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.469 
next position of it so this say this
same<00:01:34.649> scale<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.880> I'm<00:01:36.149> just<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
same scale if I do I'm just going to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.880 
same scale if I do I'm just going to
play<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.689> starting<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> root<00:01:37.770> note<00:01:37.829> there

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.300 

I<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.120> same<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.540> pattern<00:01:42.870> two<00:01:46.160> you<00:01:47.160> can

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
I do the same and pattern two you can

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
I do the same and pattern two you can
hear<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.610> exactly<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> same<00:01:48.390> notice<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> if

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
hear it's exactly the same notice so if

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.420 
hear it's exactly the same notice so if
you<00:01:52.110> can't<00:01:52.320> make<00:01:52.500> music<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:53.010> of<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.190> first

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430

going to help at all you have to learn

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.960 
going to help at all you have to learn
how<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.850> be<00:02:00.030> musical<00:02:00.660> in<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:01.320> pattern<00:02:01.970> make

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
how to be musical in one pattern make

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.850 
how to be musical in one pattern make
something<00:02:03.420> out<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.870> before<00:02:04.080> you<00:02:04.470> start

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
something out of it before you start

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.760 
something out of it before you start
trying<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.220> learn<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:05.760> second<00:02:06.540> pattern<00:02:06.900> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
trying to learn that second pattern the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.410 
trying to learn that second pattern the
second<00:02:08.130> pattern<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.429> useful<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.940> reason<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
second pattern is useful the reason that

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.090 
second pattern is useful the reason that
we<00:02:09.570> have<00:02:09.750> these<00:02:09.899> different<00:02:10.110> patterns<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.740> to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
we have these different patterns is to

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.800 
we have these different patterns is to
be<00:02:11.250> able<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.520> talk<00:02:11.760> about<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.420> know<00:02:12.540> get

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
be able to talk about you know get

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.630 
be able to talk about you know get
through<00:02:12.959> range<00:02:13.410> from<00:02:13.800> low<00:02:14.010> notes<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.459> very

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
through range from low notes to very

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.940 
through range from low notes to very
high<00:02:14.910> notes<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.200> true<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.709> certain

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
high notes and it is true that certain

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.370 
high notes and it is true that certain
licks<00:02:17.400> work<00:02:17.760> better<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.630> different<00:02:19.170> patterns

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
licks work better in different patterns

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.290 
licks work better in different patterns
but<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.160> still<00:02:20.520> need<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:20.820> able<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> make

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
but you still need to be able to make

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.699 
but you still need to be able to make
music<00:02:21.420> out<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.840> one<00:02:21.989> pattern<00:02:22.260> before<00:02:22.440> you

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
music out of one pattern before you

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.710 
music out of one pattern before you
learn<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.890> second<00:02:23.340> one<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:24.120> really<00:02:24.480> really

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
learn the second one it's really really

every scale but not be able to use any
of<00:02:44.520> them<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.910> just<00:02:45.120> make<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.330> basic

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
of them to just make a basic

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.050 
of them to just make a basic
improvisation<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.769> was<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.640> bad

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
improvisation and that was really bad

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.000 
improvisation and that was really bad
like<00:02:48.570> every<00:02:48.930> time<00:02:49.140> I'd<00:02:49.320> much<00:02:49.530> rather<00:02:49.560> hear<00:02:49.950> a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
like every time I'd much rather hear a

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.620 
like every time I'd much rather hear a
guy<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.310> knows<00:02:50.459> one<00:02:50.730> scale<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.420> make<00:02:51.600> a

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
guy that knows one scale and can make a

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.380 
guy that knows one scale and can make a
great<00:02:51.959> solo<00:02:52.260> using<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.920> then<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.209> play

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
great solo using it then you can play

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.300 
great solo using it then you can play
scales<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.170> down<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.320> mean<00:02:55.560> how<00:02:55.950> many<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.250> us

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
scales up and down I mean how many of us

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.680 
scales up and down I mean how many of us
would<00:02:56.489> go<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.820> concert<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.390> see<00:02:57.540> the

would go to a concert to see the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.229 
would go to a concert to see the
greatest<00:02:57.959> scale<00:02:58.590> player<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.220> all<00:02:59.370> time<00:02:59.640> huh

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
greatest scale player of all time huh

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.229 
greatest scale player of all time huh
really<00:03:01.080> I'm<00:03:01.470> not<00:03:01.530> trying<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.010> go<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.310> see<00:03:02.489> BB

King or Eric Clapton who use only just a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.740 
King or Eric Clapton who use only just a
couple<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.910> different<00:03:06.269> patterns<00:03:06.570> you

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
couple of the different patterns you

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.289 
couple of the different patterns you
know<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.890> not<00:03:08.100> about<00:03:08.370> playing<00:03:08.580> scales<00:03:09.060> it's

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
know it's not about playing scales it's

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.750 
know it's not about playing scales it's
about<00:03:09.450> making<00:03:09.660> music<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.620> making<00:03:11.190> music<00:03:11.610> out

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
about making music so making music out

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.509 
about making music so making music out
of<00:03:11.880> them<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.780> really<00:03:13.049> important<00:03:13.470> part

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
of them is the really important part

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.949 
of them is the really important part
exactly<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.640> same<00:03:14.850> with<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.060> major<00:03:15.330> scope<00:03:15.720> a

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
exactly the same with the major scope a

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.710 
exactly the same with the major scope a
lot<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:17.010> guys<00:03:17.130> spent<00:03:17.430> too<00:03:17.790> much<00:03:17.970> time<00:03:18.030> learning

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
lot of guys spent too much time learning

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.449 
lot of guys spent too much time learning
all<00:03:19.019> five<00:03:19.320> positions<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.010> major<00:03:20.190> scale

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
all five positions of the major scale

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.310 
all five positions of the major scale
before<00:03:20.790> they<00:03:20.910> making<00:03:21.269> music<00:03:21.570> out<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.930> but

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
before they making music out of it but

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.050 
before they making music out of it but
it's<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.590> same<00:03:22.769> thing<00:03:23.040> if<00:03:23.160> we<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.580> G<00:03:23.820> major

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
it's the same thing if we do G major

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.390 
it's the same thing if we do G major

that you get into making music out of

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.140 
that you get into making music out of
your<00:03:55.200> scales<00:03:55.470> before<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.489> learn<00:03:56.730> more

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
your scales before you learn more

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.449 
your scales before you learn more
patterns<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.840> same<00:03:58.019> scale<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:58.590> make<00:03:59.190> sure

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
patterns of the same scale and make sure

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.479 
patterns of the same scale and make sure
you<00:03:59.700> know<00:03:59.909> why<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:01.440> are<00:04:01.470> learning<00:04:01.769> your<00:04:02.160> scale

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
you know why you are learning your scale

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.890 
you know why you are learning your scale
so<00:04:02.819> when<00:04:03.239> you're<00:04:03.390> learning<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.720> minor

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
so when you're learning the minor

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.270 
so when you're learning the minor
pentatonic<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.560> might<00:04:04.739> be<00:04:04.860> doing<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.160> for

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280

technique you might be doing it for

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.150

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
doing the major scale you're probably

that is played over if you into

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.200 
that is played over if you into
neoclassical<00:04:29.280> rock<00:04:29.490> like<00:04:29.699> Yngwie<00:04:30.060> Malmsteen

and<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.840> kind<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.110> stuff<00:04:31.320> then<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.130> know

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
and that kind of stuff then you know

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.830 
and that kind of stuff then you know
learning<00:04:32.610> that<00:04:32.849> scale<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.210> really<00:04:33.360> important

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
learning that scale is really important

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.570 
learning that scale is really important
but<00:04:33.930> if<00:04:34.020> you're<00:04:34.139> not<00:04:34.260> into<00:04:34.590> doing<00:04:34.740> that<00:04:34.979> it's

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
but if you're not into doing that it's

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.730 
but if you're not into doing that it's
absolutely<00:04:36.060> useless<00:04:36.630> it's<00:04:37.260> not<00:04:37.380> going<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.590> do

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
absolutely useless it's not going to do

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.350 
absolutely useless it's not going to do
any<00:04:37.950> good<00:04:38.160> at<00:04:38.250> order<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.580> complete<00:04:38.940> waste<00:04:39.150> of

any good at order to complete waste of

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
time

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.890

so<00:04:40.440> when<00:04:40.950> not<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.669> learn<00:04:41.820> scales<00:04:42.210> is<00:04:42.510> when<00:04:42.810> you

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
so when not to learn scales is when you

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.629 
so when not to learn scales is when you
don't<00:04:43.110> know<00:04:43.260> what<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.500> for<00:04:43.740> what<00:04:44.039> it's<00:04:44.220> for<00:04:44.400> or

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
don't know what it for what it's for or

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.940 
don't know what it for what it's for or
you<00:04:45.240> can't<00:04:45.510> make<00:04:45.660> music<00:04:46.080> out<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.380> one<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.740> the

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
you can't make music out of one of the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.159 
you can't make music out of one of the
same<00:04:47.190> type<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:47.760> you've<00:04:48.180> already<00:04:48.360> learned<00:04:48.690> so

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
same type that you've already learned so

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.050 
same type that you've already learned so
hope<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:49.830> safety<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.370> whole<00:04:50.550> bunch<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:50.820> time

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
hope that safety a whole bunch of time

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.750 
hope that safety a whole bunch of time
and<00:04:51.470> I'll<00:04:52.470> see<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.830> for<00:04:53.010> plenty<00:04:53.190> more<00:04:53.370> lessons
