00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:33.139 
simple to me so they took over the tip
field<00:06:31.289> see<00:06:32.159> there's<00:06:32.399> always<00:06:32.729> room<00:06:32.939> for

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:33.149 
field see there's always room for

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:35.029 
field see there's always room for
improvement<00:06:33.269> in<00:06:33.899> that<00:06:34.169> kind<00:06:34.409> of<00:06:34.469> ballpark<00:06:34.860> of

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
improvement in that kind of ballpark of

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.180 
improvement in that kind of ballpark of
that<00:06:35.159> strategy<00:06:35.749> but<00:06:36.979> how<00:06:37.979> can

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.950 

I've<00:06:40.910> actually<00:06:41.090> turn<00:06:41.360> it<00:06:41.480> into<00:06:41.600> a<00:06:41.660> dating

I've actually turn it into a dating
strategy<00:06:42.170> do<00:06:43.120> but<00:06:44.120> it's<00:06:44.750> just<00:06:45.020> powerful<00:06:45.670> how

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
strategy do but it's just powerful how

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.160 
strategy do but it's just powerful how
can<00:06:46.880> you<00:06:46.970> continue<00:06:47.150> to<00:06:47.360> hate<00:06:47.450> for<00:06:47.690> sudden<00:06:47.870> you

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
can you continue to hate for sudden you

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.140 
can you continue to hate for sudden you
if<00:06:48.380> people<00:06:48.800> find<00:06:49.010> stuff<00:06:49.340> that<00:06:49.490> works<00:06:49.700> for<00:06:50.000> them

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
I mean instead of hating maybe we should

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.540 
I mean instead of hating maybe we should
all<00:06:54.020> start<00:06:54.470> finding<00:06:54.890> something<00:06:55.130> that<00:06:55.340> works
