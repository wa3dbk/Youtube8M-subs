this as well this one no had really good
reviews<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.030> seems<00:00:51.210> pretty<00:00:51.420> simple<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
reviews and it seems pretty simple to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.810 
reviews and it seems pretty simple to
work<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.620> actually<00:00:52.800> does<00:00:53.190> work<00:00:53.489> which<00:00:53.789> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820

work and it actually does work which is
the<00:00:54.059> main<00:00:54.210> thing<00:00:54.239> I've<00:00:54.539> tried<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> number<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the main thing I've tried a number of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
the main thing I've tried a number of
them<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.890> had<00:00:56.309> really<00:00:56.340> good<00:00:56.670> luck<00:00:56.730> with

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
them and not had really good luck with

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.430 
them and not had really good luck with
some<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.629> one's<00:00:57.809> pretty<00:00:58.020> good<00:00:58.320> at

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
some but this one's pretty good at

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.200 
some but this one's pretty good at
transferring<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.039> files<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.090> are<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
transferring your files so here are the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.049 
transferring your files so here are the
steps<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.840> you'd<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> set<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.059> okay

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
steps if you'd like to set this up okay

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.520 
steps if you'd like to set this up okay
first<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.510> all<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.750> need<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> make<00:01:04.140> sure<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
first of all you need to make sure that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
first of all you need to make sure that
NFC<00:01:04.949> feature<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.880> turned<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.869> phone

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
NFC feature is turned on on your phone

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.850 
NFC feature is turned on on your phone
so<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> settings<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.880> that

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
so you got to go to settings for that

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.730 
so you got to go to settings for that
and<00:01:11.299> it's<00:01:12.299> under<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.630> first<00:01:12.930> category<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and it's under this first category of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.440 
and it's under this first category of
networks<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.400> connections<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.390> two

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
networks and connections here go two

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.100 
networks and connections here go two
more<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.220> here<00:01:17.220> you'll<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.460> NFC<00:01:18.210> underneath

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
more and here you'll see NFC underneath

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.380 
more and here you'll see NFC underneath
of<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.619> Android<00:01:20.159> Beam<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.119> grayed

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
of that is Android Beam which is grayed

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.380 
of that is Android Beam which is grayed
out<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.140> we've<00:01:22.320> got<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.560> turn<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.950> NFC

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.380 

and<00:01:27.409> when<00:01:28.409> NFC<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.890> turned<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.280> Android<00:01:30.119> Beam

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and when NFC is turned on Android Beam

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.969 
and when NFC is turned on Android Beam
becomes<00:01:30.780> available<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.710> need<00:01:31.860> to
