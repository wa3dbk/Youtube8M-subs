00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
3 so today we are going to draw a meme

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.290 
3 so today we are going to draw a meme
most<00:00:14.549> commonly<00:00:15.059> known<00:00:15.330> as<00:00:16.070> derp<00:00:17.090> now<00:00:18.090> there

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
most commonly known as derp now there

most commonly known as derp now there
are<00:00:18.330> many<00:00:18.660> derps<00:00:19.130> in<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.310> mean<00:00:20.550> collection

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
are many derps in the mean collection

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.000 
are many derps in the mean collection
but<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.260> def<00:00:22.939> makes<00:00:23.939> me<00:00:24.269> crack<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:24.960> all<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
but this def makes me crack up all the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.839 
but this def makes me crack up all the
time<00:00:26.810> I'm<00:00:27.810> not<00:00:28.109> master<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.039> drawing<00:00:29.340> but

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
time I'm not master at this drawing but

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.269 
time I'm not master at this drawing but
i'm<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.779> show<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.019> how<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.619> was

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
i'm just going to show you how it was

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.030 
i'm just going to show you how it was
usually<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.820> drawn<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.079> would<00:00:34.469> start<00:00:34.770> out

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
usually be drawn so you would start out

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:47.029 
usually be drawn so you would start out
by<00:00:35.520> making<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.809> sideways<00:00:40.190> oval<00:00:45.320> like<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.530> pack

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
by making it sideways oval like a pack

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.290 
by making it sideways oval like a pack
of<00:00:47.070> big<00:00:47.760> c<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> top<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:53.879> ear

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
of big c and then at the top of your ear

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.840 
of big c and then at the top of your ear
and<00:00:54.329> make<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> eyes<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.710> first<00:00:59.219> size<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and make the eyes and the first size is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
and make the eyes and the first size is
always<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> cover<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> whole<00:01:01.079> thing

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
always going to cover up the whole thing

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.969 
always going to cover up the whole thing
and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.049> make<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> pupils<00:01:04.739> go

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and then you can make the pupils go

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.450 
and then you can make the pupils go
anywhere<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> want<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.060> then<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:08.220> make<00:01:08.430> the

and<00:01:18.880> then<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.650> make<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.220> mouth<00:01:21.580> which<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:21.910> the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
and then you make the mouth which is the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.090 
and then you make the mouth which is the
main<00:01:22.720> part<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.230> it<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:25.900> have<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.530> kind<00:01:26.890> of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
main part of it so you have to kind of

make kind of like a horn shaped ago I

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.240 
make kind of like a horn shaped ago I
mean<00:01:33.730> like<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.930> trumpet<00:01:34.930> or<00:01:35.200> something<00:01:35.560> then

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
mean like a trumpet or something then

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.630 
mean like a trumpet or something then
you<00:01:36.340> want<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.610> make<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.900> kind<00:01:37.900> of<00:01:38.020> eight<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:39.490> of

just<00:02:21.910> get<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.180> expression<00:02:22.720> out<00:02:23.820> um<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:26.620> have

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
just get that expression out um we have

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.530 
just get that expression out um we have
to<00:02:26.770> color<00:02:27.070> items<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:27.880> don't<00:02:28.090> feel<00:02:28.270> like<00:02:28.390> doing
