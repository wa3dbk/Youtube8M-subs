00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.910
 now let's learn some ideas 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.340
 to combine a fringe skirt like 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.040
 is here 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.180
 first of all I have taken a shirt 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.529
 as transparent as you can appreciate 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.840
 Now that he has a white shirt 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.660
 below to not be noticed is worth the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.300
 T-shirt as transparent in raw 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.189
 and it is with a quite romantic touch what 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.430
 that gives it a look, that's it 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.550
 romantic more feminine you can see a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.579
 little more black stud booties 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.200
 or you can follow the same aesthetic with 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.750
 more dancers who wear the two 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.630
 colors and that they continue the look 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.470
 in the second place I bet on a tone 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.470
 more white white and with baby collars 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.960
 in black so that it makes a color 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.500
 seemed like it looks pretty good 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.710
 break the whole set 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.900
 if you do not have a two-tone shirt so 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.180
 You can do it with a white shirt 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.460
 those of a lifetime perfectly 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.660
 and you can find it as a jacket 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:18.740
 American black knit blazer equal 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.860
 because some black shoes or how are two 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.180
 very basic colors are not going to call the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.780
 attention neither of the two 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.470
 you can choose to introduce some shoes 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.460
 of color such as red ones 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.380
 and so you will have a more feminine look 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.840
 and male sing 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.610
 well, the last place chosen in 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.560
 what I understand that may not be 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.130
 like everyone because it's a look 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.829
 very striking very daring and totally 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.049
 of full trend that is with a 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.470
 sweatshirt if you have heard well a 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.939
 sweatshirt as you see this is wood has 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.619
 that touch the one that does not get to be 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.850
 sporty to have the letters of 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.819
 sequins but equally it would be worth 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.700
 an exactly the same and smooth to play 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.890
 a little more with that touch between the case 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.650
 chip that is between sports but that 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.010
 at the same time be fixed then 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.290
 we have included a jewelery necklace 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.120
 if you want and with this you think that 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.610
 you are too showy 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.920
 you can adjust for some basic shoes 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.560
 normal living room blacks 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.290
 if on the contrary you dare everything 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.440
 that I encourage you to truly 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.540
 try and see that although you 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.640
 you feel more comfortable because we can include 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.319
 even some tacks on 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.600
 this flat case would therefore be 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.250
 perfect to make the mix in this 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.280
 action sport code with arranged 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.620
 in the same place but as well as you
