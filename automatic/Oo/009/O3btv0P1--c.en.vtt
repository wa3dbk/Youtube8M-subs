00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the minecraft gls shader finally has 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.629
 the offerers for the version 1.7 point 2 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.250
 leave and is now fine with that 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.019
 compatible and that's why we tell you in 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.880
 this video vienna very simple with 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.880
 Opti enemy can install together 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.900
 hello dear man fled and cordially 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.279
 welcome here for further tutorial 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.600
 from 2007 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.700
 We have already had it recently 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.380
 once a jungle is supposed to 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.059
 shader made that you can find here now 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.860
 linked now it is possible 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.090
 the skull together with whether deep 1 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.320
 install and we want to in 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.730
 do this video once 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 for that we go first to the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 developer side shaders for 1.2 that 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.820
 Whole works, of course, for 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.170
 more versions and we will be one 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.980
 scroll down a little then we see 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.809
 Click here before minecraft 1.7.2010 thing 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.430
 Let's get started and about we will 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.960
 then we passed the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 we just have to skip advertising 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.379
 quite simply at dropbox 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.180
 double click irrsee the version is 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.280
 really very up to date and then up 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.229
 save file now we still need 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.909
 next to the case mod whether the fine because we 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.409
 want to opti fine with the whole year 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.150
 install together so we go up 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.010
 the opti fine side scroll a little bit 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.950
 down and look for us now once 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.909
 opti fine hdc 7 standard version her 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.920
 probably also another 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.020
 optics take a version try it 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 but for security s.besten with 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.920
 the standard version for 1.7 point 4 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.390
 Unfortunately we can not do that yet 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.670
 we have to install now or 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.259
 versions click on the spyder and in 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.969
 a little down the show on show 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.009
 scorer we have here whether the download 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:40.920
 fine 1.7.2010 100 button and next to it 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.210
 is compatible wÃ¶lffer 998 and on it 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.070
 we have to go to the board right away 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.899
 First of all, you should be sure about the optimal results 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.700
 download-button about download 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.469
 and again after advertising 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.570
 skip the download of opti here 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.429
 confirm fine with save file 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.140
 Now we still need researching 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.399
 and a very special version like 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.030
 yes, but if they are already falling 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.039
 was see 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.749
 and that is what we have to do here on files 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.740
 points minecraft projection save link 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.929
 is of course also in the video 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.789
 Scroll down the description until we 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.590
 to the corresponding number 9 98 998 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.480
 and then we just had it 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.530
 installer for windows down you can 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.490
 the whole but also with the normal 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.319
 make installer 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.700
 should then synonymous for mac 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.380
 we work as always wait 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.300
 advertising and then we have the same 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.740
 also forge installed when we are on 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.120
 click Skip Advertising and then 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.860
 Save on file is us 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.780
 at least once downloaded 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.700
 Now we need a shader 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.550
 pack and there we take the course 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.740
 love sonic 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.720
 shape ex this really the most beautiful 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.370
 which you can get on the market 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.870
 here for example this is here 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.090
 with the beautiful clouds that is 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.560
 but still in work and was still 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.270
 not with that the fine tested so 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.580
 Just download one of these 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.930
 shader packs down here with it 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.430
 you are also guaranteed to have more 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.330
 shader base is also available everywhere in the world 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.830
 to find internet 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.020
 and we'll just take this one now 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.450
 version standard in this case and 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.950
 again the download free and 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.350
 then forward to media 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.850
 celebrate download and only ok then 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.400
 we would have saved the file 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.170
 after all this downloads we have 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.060
 now finally fell file you have to 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.340
 also have shaders mod chor ob the fine 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.430
 the research dollar as well as a check 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.100
 In my case, vw scene should be standard 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.140
 and now we double-click 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.200
 41 points 7 points 2 out on the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.860
 installer for windows and click on 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.960
 now a little opens 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.550
 dialog window there we choose install 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.350
 client from check again very briefly 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.820
 the file drive it all right so far 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.470
 linked to our minecraft and us 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.570
 Click on ok then it can be quite complete 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.450
 take a short time and then we get the 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.030
 news july into stagger profi 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.950
 brisk and so on we confirm that 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.540
 whole with ok and now we press 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.760
 windows button and he on ours 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.230
 keyboard and then open out lead 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.489
 in this execute dialog we give 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.070
 percent from 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.440
 and now click on 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.540
 ok now we go to point minecraft 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.220
 and put that first to the side 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.570
 either you have already in the case here 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.739
 a murder folder or not because 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.720
 We start now only once 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.190
 minecraft and did we do that 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.750
 here is the right over the to play 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.310
 minecraft 1.725 again this 998 version 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.530
 which is compatible with opti fein 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.600
 if you press play now and that 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.760
 occurs that minecraft closes it 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.380
 and then again the launcher opens and 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.090
 do not start then just look this one 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.799
 troubleshooting tutorial this is left 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.600
 mislaid up there we show you as you 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.460
 he really fixes this error 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.470
 circumstances really annoying right 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.570
 can and does not have a lot of time 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.490
 but minecraft has opened 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.870
 impeccably opened only with it 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.610
 we'll close it right now 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.020
 can we close that if mine 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.330
 head back is the whole again with 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.770
 the button explains game and at the latest 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.360
 now minecraft has in your point 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.210
 folder a pug folder of ford 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.680
 generated 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.389
 this we go again purely to date is 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.060
 still empty but now he is with us 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:49.919
 the shaders motto filled as well as whether the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.599
 Fine 1.728 you really have to do this 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.680
 version also use otherwise 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.340
 not very fast 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.569
 function 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.819
 and now we start again 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.440
 minecraft is over the launcher 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.849
 minecraft would start now if 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.199
 in a world already still not her 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.819
 shader appears we are changing now 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.349
 and we click on options and 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.940
 then we have a new button 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.080
 shaders if that's what you have 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.970
 installation up here with you 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.740
 flawlessly worked and now click 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.970
 We on shaders we only have it 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.490
 two selection points 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.139
 but we are interested in openscape xv 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.849
 the button because then opens here 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.620
 the folder into which we now ours 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.570
 we have to import schipek 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.250
 only our saas v10 stood 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.199
 downloaded and we pull that now 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.520
 here we go 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.110
 again in minecraft here we see 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.729
 appear 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.949
 bv10 standard that would be us now 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.840
 just look and if we have this now 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.729
 Here we go 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.650
 once adorned three of our shader model 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.780
 and can any minecraft here 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.150
 beautiful with pictures and sun 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.419
 enjoy the water is there and see 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.440
 everything looks wonderful and beautiful 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.940
 More shader packs plaster as I said 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.740
 everywhere on the internet but otherwise was 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.030
 it's from this tutorial if you 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.039
 you would like to have some more 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.520
 our side skull computer science 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.380
 look at 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.080
 which is linked to the top right or directly 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.789
 including our motto view to the daisy bot 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.560
