nose I noticed a lot 1 i'm I using the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.179 
nose I noticed a lot 1 i'm I using the
exoskeleton<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.380> this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.650> kind<00:00:23.070> of

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
exoskeleton here and this is a kind of

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.310 
exoskeleton here and this is a kind of
an<00:00:23.310> auto<00:00:23.580> aim<00:00:23.820> thing<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:25.160> if<00:00:26.160> you're<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.820> me

cross<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:33.649> you<00:00:34.649> see<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:36.440> up<00:00:37.440> arrow<00:00:37.649> on

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
cross here you see on the up arrow on

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.420 
cross here you see on the up arrow on
the<00:00:37.980> crosshair<00:00:38.520> anyway<00:00:39.559> you'll<00:00:40.559> notice<00:00:41.129> stuff

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the crosshair anyway you'll notice stuff

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
the crosshair anyway you'll notice stuff
the<00:00:42.260> bolts<00:00:43.260> are<00:00:43.559> will<00:00:44.190> move<00:00:45.090> slightly<00:00:45.539> towards

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the bolts are will move slightly towards

the enemy so you don't exactly have to
eat<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.770> at<00:00:50.100> him<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.879> close<00:00:51.300> enough<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.989> I

something stub or sliced anyway so

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.409 
something stub or sliced anyway so
there's<00:04:43.259> a<00:04:43.349> bit<00:04:43.650> then<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:47.220> started<00:04:47.820> saying<00:04:48.300> I'm

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
there's a bit then it started saying I'm

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.900 
there's a bit then it started saying I'm
not<00:04:48.479> moving<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:48.990> right<00:04:49.110> toy<00:04:49.349> stick<00:04:49.680> that's<00:04:50.550> a

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
not moving the right toy stick that's a

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.469 
not moving the right toy stick that's a
that<00:04:51.660> I<00:04:51.720> disagree<00:04:52.440> with<00:04:53.030> disagree<00:04:54.030> with<00:04:54.180> into

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
that I disagree with disagree with into

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.810 
that I disagree with disagree with into
meditation<00:04:55.099> you<00:04:56.099> don't<00:04:56.310> need<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:58.610> I'll<00:04:59.610> take

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
meditation you don't need that I'll take

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.450 
meditation you don't need that I'll take
that<00:04:59.880> thank<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.330> very<00:05:00.479> much

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.059 

so<00:05:05.120> other<00:05:06.020> than<00:05:06.139> that<00:05:06.350> I<00:05:06.380> don't<00:05:06.530> think<00:05:06.889> that

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
so other than that I don't think that

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.610 
so other than that I don't think that
when<00:05:07.280> you're<00:05:07.460> actually<00:05:07.669> rotating<00:05:08.539> it'll<00:05:09.350> walk

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
when you're actually rotating it'll walk

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.529 
when you're actually rotating it'll walk
on<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:10.100> someone<00:05:10.430> but<00:05:10.699> I<00:05:10.759> think<00:05:11.030> that<00:05:11.210> if<00:05:11.360> you're

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
on to someone but I think that if you're

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.450 
on to someone but I think that if you're
not<00:05:11.810> moving<00:05:12.199> your<00:05:12.350> choice<00:05:12.590> take<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:13.160> you'll

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
not moving your choice take it you'll

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.080 
not moving your choice take it you'll
notice<00:05:13.940> that<00:05:13.970> it<00:05:14.389> it<00:05:14.870> is<00:05:15.199> um<00:05:15.530> kind<00:05:16.490> of<00:05:16.550> doing

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
notice that it it is um kind of doing

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.730 
notice that it it is um kind of doing
the<00:05:17.180> auto-aim<00:05:17.449> thing<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:20.470> don't<00:05:21.470> think<00:05:21.620> that

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
the auto-aim thing so I don't think that

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.490 
the auto-aim thing so I don't think that
that<00:05:21.830> needs<00:05:22.190> to<00:05:22.280> be<00:05:22.370> implemented<00:05:22.789> gorilla<00:05:23.539> but

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
that needs to be implemented gorilla but

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.260 
that needs to be implemented gorilla but
you<00:05:24.949> know<00:05:25.039> everything<00:05:25.430> else<00:05:25.580> I<00:05:25.759> lovely<00:05:26.090> I
