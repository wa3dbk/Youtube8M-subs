00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.509

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.420
 much about 11 is also lacking there is much 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.580
 novelty and community 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.269
 the first novelty is the hair of 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.760
 technician 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:54.760
 What the fuck is that institution raised in 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.559
 you do not likes comments there if you 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.869
 causing tens of comment likes 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.869
 bags is the east destination 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.970
 fellow old goiano 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.170
 and arrived early to see the environment here 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.980
 I'm very excited, I do not know how to talk about 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.980
 everyone is nervous 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.350
 it's about this thing that I hear a lot 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.010
 talk people talking so the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.520
 auchan media changed the behavior 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.590
 I go the other way because I eat 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.170
 every child born in the 80's 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.900
 attended a program of the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.480
 ooo sérgio mallandro and there was something 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.020
 funny on the program that was time for 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.730
 draw the cards the child sent 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.220
 that letter and stayed for a month waiting 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.020
 to be drawn because she wanted to 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.940
 comment here saying you enjoy it 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.100
 send a kiss to her mother then in 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.900
 truth already existed this is this desire 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.140
 latent latency of people to be 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.510
 heard to participate and this actually 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.720
 technology has shortened the process 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.040
 I think I should stay a little like this 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.620
 We are living today so much. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.050
 as retail so you know I think every 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.930
 each type sales counter even so knows 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.870
 every person who goes there and who has seen 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.160
 video that entered your site she also 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.959
 saw there it is a a customer came out under it 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.430
 you may be paying nothing for what you 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.380
 is taking away from you 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.760
 but he 's there now he's paying 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.620
 For his time, right? 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.739
 I know how they want money should 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.440
 earn a buck and now I like 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.300
 to play bomb on social networks 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.239

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.590
 a buzz around this one from this release 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.230

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.269
 our audience is young is an an idea 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.160
 cool to see a cultural contest I 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.200
 I think it's really cool if it 's about this. 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.300
 that people are isolated from 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.200
 people who live in Bahia then here in 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.209
 Sao Paulo 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.890
 we could do something like that. 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.410
