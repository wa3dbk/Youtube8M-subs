this<00:00:01.510> here<00:00:01.750> is<00:00:01.930> an<00:00:02.080> elm<00:00:02.379> tree<00:00:02.500> an<00:00:03.010> elm<00:00:03.670> trees

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.000 
this here is an elm tree an elm trees

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.699 
this here is an elm tree an elm trees
are<00:00:04.210> a<00:00:04.270> tree<00:00:04.509> that<00:00:04.660> we<00:00:04.779> tend<00:00:05.049> to<00:00:05.169> associate

00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:05.709 
are a tree that we tend to associate

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:07.799 
are a tree that we tend to associate
with<00:00:05.950> death<00:00:06.279> there's<00:00:06.970> an<00:00:07.089> old<00:00:07.209> saying<00:00:07.539> in

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:07.809 
with death there's an old saying in

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:09.810 
with death there's an old saying in
Britain<00:00:08.080> elm<00:00:08.320> hate<00:00:08.710> earth<00:00:08.950> man<00:00:09.160> and<00:00:09.340> waiteth

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
Britain elm hate earth man and waiteth

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.850 
Britain elm hate earth man and waiteth
and<00:00:09.970> there's<00:00:10.660> two<00:00:10.840> possible<00:00:11.350> reasons<00:00:11.500> for

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
and there's two possible reasons for

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.770 
and there's two possible reasons for
that<00:00:11.980> one<00:00:12.310> possibility<00:00:12.730> is<00:00:12.970> that<00:00:13.090> it's

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
that one possibility is that it's

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.630 
that one possibility is that it's
because<00:00:14.050> often<00:00:14.410> large<00:00:14.650> trees<00:00:14.980> drop<00:00:15.310> branches

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
because often large trees drop branches

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.880 
because often large trees drop branches
quite<00:00:16.269> suddenly<00:00:16.720> and<00:00:16.930> perhaps<00:00:17.620> people

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
quite suddenly and perhaps people

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.680 
quite suddenly and perhaps people
walking<00:00:18.400> in<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:18.580> forests<00:00:19.000> used<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:19.330> get<00:00:19.480> hit

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
walking in the forests used to get hit

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.450 
walking in the forests used to get hit
by<00:00:19.720> them<00:00:20.110> and<00:00:20.710> also<00:00:21.100> because<00:00:21.310> it<00:00:21.430> was

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
by them and also because it was

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.160 
by them and also because it was
traditionally<00:00:22.060> a<00:00:22.090> good<00:00:22.390> source<00:00:22.630> of<00:00:22.780> coughing

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
traditionally a good source of coughing

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.540 
traditionally a good source of coughing
wood<00:00:23.350> so<00:00:23.590> maybe<00:00:23.770> it<00:00:23.920> was<00:00:24.010> because<00:00:24.280> we<00:00:24.400> got

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
wood so maybe it was because we got

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.700 
wood so maybe it was because we got
buried<00:00:24.910> in<00:00:25.060> them<00:00:25.210> but<00:00:26.140> there's<00:00:26.320> another<00:00:26.440> thing

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
buried in them but there's another thing

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.920 
buried in them but there's another thing
we<00:00:26.860> associate<00:00:27.430> death<00:00:27.910> with<00:00:28.150> elm<00:00:28.330> about<00:00:28.630> and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
we associate death with elm about and

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.720 
we associate death with elm about and
that's<00:00:28.990> in<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.320> 1960s<00:00:30.250> you<00:00:30.310> may<00:00:30.490> have<00:00:30.580> heard

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
that's in the 1960s you may have heard

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.910 
that's in the 1960s you may have heard
about<00:00:30.850> Dutch<00:00:31.270> elm<00:00:31.539> disease<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:32.619> one<00:00:32.739> of<00:00:32.860> the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
about Dutch elm disease and one of the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.560 
about Dutch elm disease and one of the
reasons<00:00:33.250> you<00:00:33.340> don't<00:00:33.460> tend<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.850> see<00:00:33.910> big<00:00:34.360> elm

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
reasons you don't tend to see big elm

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.350 
reasons you don't tend to see big elm
trees<00:00:34.899> in<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.500> UK<00:00:35.860> anymore<00:00:36.250> is<00:00:36.550> because<00:00:36.790> a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
trees in the UK anymore is because a

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.930 
trees in the UK anymore is because a
fungal<00:00:38.110> disease<00:00:38.140> which<00:00:38.649> is<00:00:38.829> spread<00:00:39.160> by<00:00:39.399> a<00:00:39.430> bark

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
fungal disease which is spread by a bark

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.840 
fungal disease which is spread by a bark
boring<00:00:40.480> beetle<00:00:40.780> got<00:00:41.739> taken<00:00:42.220> around<00:00:42.309> all<00:00:42.670> the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
boring beetle got taken around all the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.240 
boring beetle got taken around all the
elm<00:00:43.000> trees<00:00:43.329> in<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.630> UK<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.230> any<00:00:44.770> elm<00:00:45.010> tree

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
elm trees in the UK and any elm tree

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.870 
elm trees in the UK and any elm tree
above<00:00:45.610> say<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:47.050> kind<00:00:47.410> of<00:00:47.530> diameter<00:00:48.219> was

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
above say that kind of diameter was

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.700 
above say that kind of diameter was
killed<00:00:49.180> by<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.510> bark<00:00:49.870> beetle<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.320> it's<00:00:50.500> still

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
killed by the bark beetle and it's still

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.560 
killed by the bark beetle and it's still
around<00:00:50.829> at<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.250> moment<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:51.969> large<00:00:52.270> elm

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
around at the moment and so large elm

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.389 
around at the moment and so large elm
trees<00:00:52.809> still<00:00:53.020> tend<00:00:53.290> to<00:00:53.350> get<00:00:53.469> taken<00:00:53.920> out<00:00:54.040> by<00:00:54.340> it

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
trees still tend to get taken out by it

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.510 
trees still tend to get taken out by it
but<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.030> owls<00:00:55.180> have<00:00:55.510> survived<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.520> they

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
but the owls have survived this they

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.250 
but the owls have survived this they
some<00:00:57.969> of<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.120> species<00:00:58.390> not<00:00:58.780> this<00:00:58.960> particular

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
some of the species not this particular

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.229 
some of the species not this particular
species<00:00:59.710> but<00:01:00.010> many<00:01:00.219> species<00:01:00.460> around<00:01:00.789> sucker

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
species but many species around sucker

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.630 
species but many species around sucker
they<00:01:01.480> produce<00:01:01.660> roots<00:01:02.620> that<00:01:02.920> can<00:01:03.070> then<00:01:03.190> grow<00:01:03.520> up

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
they produce roots that can then grow up

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.030 
they produce roots that can then grow up
into<00:01:03.789> new<00:01:04.059> trees<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.659> even<00:01:05.530> when<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.799> large

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
into new trees and even when the large

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.250 
into new trees and even when the large
stems<00:01:06.430> die<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.850> roots<00:01:07.299> still<00:01:07.570> survive<00:01:07.990> and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
stems die the roots still survive and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.600 
stems die the roots still survive and
they<00:01:08.350> can<00:01:08.530> come<00:01:08.740> up<00:01:08.770> from<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.100> ground<00:01:09.130> again

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
they can come up from the ground again

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.820 
they can come up from the ground again
so<00:01:09.820> things<00:01:10.060> like<00:01:10.240> this<00:01:10.420> small<00:01:10.750> elm<00:01:11.049> here<00:01:11.320> are

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
so things like this small elm here are

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.500 
so things like this small elm here are
hanging<00:01:12.220> around<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.760> under<00:01:13.000> stories<00:01:13.390> of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
hanging around in the under stories of

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.120 
hanging around in the under stories of
forests<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.140> they'll<00:01:14.320> come<00:01:14.590> back<00:01:14.799> again<00:01:15.070> in

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
forests and they'll come back again in

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.280 
forests and they'll come back again in
the<00:01:15.280> future<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.750> other<00:01:16.869> thing<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.170> bear

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
the future and the other thing to bear

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.320 
the future and the other thing to bear
in<00:01:17.470> mind<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:17.890> Elms<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.369> all<00:01:18.520> died<00:01:18.790> before

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
in mind is that Elms of all died before

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.710 
in mind is that Elms of all died before
in<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.689> past<00:01:19.930> so<00:01:20.770> we<00:01:20.950> think<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.250> this<00:01:21.720> 1960s

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
in the past so we think that this 1960s

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.570 
in the past so we think that this 1960s
killing<00:01:23.080> of<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.290> elm<00:01:23.439> trees<00:01:23.740> was<00:01:23.920> this<00:01:24.070> rare

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
killing of the elm trees was this rare

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.090 
killing of the elm trees was this rare
and<00:01:24.610> incredible<00:01:25.600> event<00:01:26.170> but<00:01:26.680> actually<00:01:27.010> it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
and incredible event but actually it's

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.100 
and incredible event but actually it's
happened<00:01:27.430> many<00:01:27.549> times<00:01:27.700> in<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.240> past<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
happened many times in the past in the

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.810 
happened many times in the past in the
18th<00:01:29.500> century<00:01:29.650> used<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.310> be<00:01:30.400> able<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.640> buy

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
18th century used to be able to buy

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.999 
18th century used to be able to buy
insurance<00:01:31.030> for<00:01:31.659> your<00:01:31.780> elm<00:01:31.990> trees<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.590> why

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
insurance for your elm trees and why

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.469 
insurance for your elm trees and why
would<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.189> need<00:01:33.340> insurance<00:01:33.490> for<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.090> tree<00:01:34.299> if

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
would you need insurance for a tree if

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.420 
would you need insurance for a tree if
