ice cream maker at Walmart about ten
years<00:02:14.459> ago<00:02:16.099> putting<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.160> cover<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.180> then

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
years ago putting the cover on and then

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.410 
years ago putting the cover on and then
you're<00:02:18.569> pouring<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.560> mixture<00:02:20.240> one<00:02:21.240> thing

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
you're pouring in the mixture one thing

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.120 
you're pouring in the mixture one thing
I<00:02:21.510> noticed<00:02:21.810> right<00:02:21.960> away<00:02:22.020> was<00:02:22.620> when<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.800> poured

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
I noticed right away was when I poured

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.120 
I noticed right away was when I poured
this<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.610> realized<00:02:23.820> that<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.360> recipe

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
this in I realized that this recipe

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.280 
this in I realized that this recipe
actually<00:02:25.400> was<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.550> very<00:02:25.790> large<00:02:26.120> recipe<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.840> lot

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
actually was a very large recipe a lot

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.960 
actually was a very large recipe a lot
bigger<00:02:27.500> than<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.830> other<00:02:27.980> ice<00:02:28.280> cream<00:02:28.580> recipes

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
bigger than the other ice cream recipes

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.600 
bigger than the other ice cream recipes
I've<00:02:29.090> tried<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:30.350> kind<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.710> overfilled<00:02:31.310> my

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
I've tried and I kind of overfilled my

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.700 
I've tried and I kind of overfilled my
machine<00:02:32.030> as<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.330> look<00:02:32.810> inside<00:02:32.990> here<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.560> can

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
machine as you look inside here you can

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.100 
machine as you look inside here you can
see<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:34.010> right<00:02:34.190> at<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.400> top<00:02:34.930> once<00:02:35.930> it

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
see it's right at the top once it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.660 
see it's right at the top once it
started<00:02:36.530> turning<00:02:36.860> into<00:02:37.130> ice<00:02:37.310> cream<00:02:37.550> and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
started turning into ice cream and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.580 
started turning into ice cream and
crystallizing<00:02:38.390> ice<00:02:38.570> crystals<00:02:39.020> were<00:02:39.170> formed

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
crystallizing ice crystals were formed

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.220 
crystallizing ice crystals were formed
it<00:02:40.060> actually<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.180> volume<00:02:41.360> increases<00:02:41.960> so<00:02:42.170> I

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
it actually the volume increases so I

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.720 
it actually the volume increases so I
ended<00:02:42.410> up<00:02:42.470> having<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.830> take<00:02:43.040> about<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.340> third<00:02:43.430> of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
ended up having to take about a third of

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.820 
ended up having to take about a third of
the<00:02:43.790> mixture<00:02:44.120> out<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.290> would<00:02:45.410> all<00:02:45.560> fit

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
the mixture out so that it would all fit

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.590 
the mixture out so that it would all fit
in<00:02:46.040> there<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.460> made<00:02:46.640> my<00:02:46.820> ice<00:02:47.000> cream<00:02:47.270> in<00:02:47.420> two

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
in there and I made my ice cream in two

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.060 
in there and I made my ice cream in two
batches<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.880> let<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.150> machine<00:02:50.480> run<00:02:51.070> until

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
batches so you let the machine run until

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.510 
batches so you let the machine run until
the<00:02:52.520> ice<00:02:52.850> cream<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.240> crystallized<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.520> then

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
the ice cream is crystallized and then

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.710 
the ice cream is crystallized and then
you<00:02:55.640> remove<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.180> put<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.450> into<00:02:56.690> a

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
you remove it and put it into a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.000 
you remove it and put it into a
container<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.380> you're<00:02:57.500> going<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.710> put<00:02:57.890> into

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
container that you're going to put into

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.570 
container that you're going to put into
the<00:02:58.190> freezer

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
the freezer

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.030 
the freezer
I<00:02:58.760> didn't<00:02:59.720> let<00:02:59.960> this<00:03:00.170> freeze<00:03:00.470> as<00:03:00.650> hard<00:03:00.860> as<00:03:00.950> I

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
I didn't let this freeze as hard as I

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.440 
I didn't let this freeze as hard as I
normally<00:03:01.100> would<00:03:01.460> because<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:01.940> wanted<00:03:02.390> to

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
normally would because I wanted to

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.780 
normally would because I wanted to
incorporate<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.380> brownie<00:03:03.650> pieces<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.610> I

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
didn't want them to break apart when I

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.410 
didn't want them to break apart when I
