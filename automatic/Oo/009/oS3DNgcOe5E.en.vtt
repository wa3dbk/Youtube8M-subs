little<00:06:04.289> B<00:06:04.380> pawn<00:06:04.560> at<00:06:04.680> 3<00:06:04.919> but<00:06:05.490> I<00:06:05.759> don't<00:06:06.030> know<00:06:06.090> it's

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
little B pawn at 3 but I don't know it's

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.730 
little B pawn at 3 but I don't know it's
still<00:06:06.330> it's<00:06:06.570> cool<00:06:06.750> down<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.169> then<00:06:07.320> we<00:06:07.380> have

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
still it's cool down and then we have

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.189 
still it's cool down and then we have
two<00:06:08.190> stars<00:06:08.669> we<00:06:08.909> have<00:06:08.940> a<00:06:09.060> little<00:06:09.690> toggle<00:06:09.870> or

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
two stars we have a little toggle or

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.020 
two stars we have a little toggle or
small<00:06:10.500> toggle<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:11.220> he<00:06:11.280> looks<00:06:11.460> so<00:06:11.490> sad<00:06:11.789> for

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
small toggle and he looks so sad for

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.219 
small toggle and he looks so sad for
some<00:06:12.180> reason<00:06:12.419> I'm<00:06:12.479> not<00:06:12.630> really<00:06:12.750> sure<00:06:12.990> why<00:06:13.169> I

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
some reason I'm not really sure why I

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.360 
some reason I'm not really sure why I
guess<00:06:13.470> he's<00:06:13.590> just<00:06:13.650> sort<00:06:13.860> of<00:06:13.889> a<00:06:13.979> little<00:06:14.009> bit<00:06:14.280> of

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
guess he's just sort of a little bit of

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.550 
guess he's just sort of a little bit of
a<00:06:14.430> grump<00:06:14.699> and<00:06:14.880> then<00:06:15.210> we<00:06:15.330> also<00:06:15.479> have<00:06:15.750> big<00:06:16.020> toggle

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
a grump and then we also have big toggle

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.020 
a grump and then we also have big toggle
it<00:06:16.919> would<00:06:17.070> be<00:06:17.190> cool<00:06:17.430> they<00:06:17.639> could<00:06:17.820> have<00:06:17.909> made

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
it would be cool they could have made

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.689 
it would be cool they could have made
big<00:06:18.479> toggle<00:06:18.900> a<00:06:18.930> little<00:06:19.259> wider<00:06:19.650> but<00:06:20.039> besides<00:06:20.550> I

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
big toggle a little wider but besides I

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.700 
big toggle a little wider but besides I
he's<00:06:20.849> actually<00:06:21.090> really<00:06:21.570> cool<00:06:21.720> his<00:06:22.199> head<00:06:22.470> is<00:06:22.590> a

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
he's actually really cool his head is a

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.020 
he's actually really cool his head is a
really<00:06:23.039> interesting<00:06:23.310> shaped<00:06:23.729> like<00:06:23.909> I<00:06:23.970> don't

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
really interesting shaped like I don't

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.670 
really interesting shaped like I don't
know<00:06:24.300> some<00:06:24.930> of<00:06:25.020> these<00:06:25.110> guys<00:06:25.349> are<00:06:25.500> really

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
know some of these guys are really

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.409 
know some of these guys are really
weird-looking<00:06:26.099> but<00:06:26.550> I<00:06:26.699> would<00:06:27.030> have<00:06:27.180> liked<00:06:27.360> to

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
weird-looking but I would have liked to

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.659 
weird-looking but I would have liked to
see<00:06:27.659> him<00:06:27.810> like<00:06:27.960> thicker<00:06:28.289> and<00:06:28.710> wider<00:06:28.770> and<00:06:29.430> stuff

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
see him like thicker and wider and stuff

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.159 
see him like thicker and wider and stuff
I<00:06:29.789> think<00:06:29.849> that<00:06:30.060> would<00:06:30.150> make<00:06:30.330> him<00:06:30.479> more<00:06:30.509> remnant

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
I think that would make him more remnant

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.710 
I think that would make him more remnant
or<00:06:31.289> you<00:06:31.860> know<00:06:32.009> similar<00:06:32.789> to<00:06:32.970> toggle<00:06:33.389> but<00:06:33.599> either
