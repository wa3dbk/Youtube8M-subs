00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
work very well I mean if you're in a

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.599 
work very well I mean if you're in a
really<00:01:48.210> dark<00:01:48.600> house<00:01:48.960> or<00:01:49.259> hallway<00:01:49.499> then<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
really dark house or hallway then it

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.279 
really dark house or hallway then it
works<00:01:50.819> a<00:01:50.939> little<00:01:51.060> bit<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.719> they're<00:01:52.109> really

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
works a little bit but they're really

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.139 
works a little bit but they're really
just<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.740> show<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.549> terms<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.939> battery

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
just for show now in terms of battery

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.389 
just for show now in terms of battery
they<00:01:54.600> say<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.109> you<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> 10-mile<00:01:56.069> range

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
they say that you have a 10-mile range

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.459 
they say that you have a 10-mile range
on<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> single<00:01:57.179> charge<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.079> didn't<00:01:58.289> really

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
on a single charge but I didn't really

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.020 
on a single charge but I didn't really
have<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.710> type<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.549> range<00:01:59.819> especially

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
have that type of range especially

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.149 
have that type of range especially
outside<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.079> because<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.649> mean<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.069> you're

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
outside just because I mean if you're

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.469 
outside just because I mean if you're
going<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.729> down<00:02:02.819> hills<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.299> going<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
going up and down hills it's going to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.789 
going up and down hills it's going to
wear<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> battery<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> whole<00:02:04.439> lot<00:02:04.619> more

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
wear on the battery a whole lot more

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.069 
wear on the battery a whole lot more
than<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.100> you're<00:02:05.249> inside<00:02:05.670> inside<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.869> seemed

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
than if you're inside inside it seemed

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.740 
than if you're inside inside it seemed
to<00:02:07.229> last<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.829> very<00:02:07.859> very<00:02:08.520> long<00:02:08.789> time<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.420> just

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
to last a very very long time so just

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.669 
to last a very very long time so just
keep<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.289> mind

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
keep that in mind

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.140 
keep that in mind
so<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:10.920> take<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> closer<00:02:11.370> look<00:02:11.520> at<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
so if we take a closer look at this you

notice<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.790> though<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.270> build<00:02:53.570> quality<00:02:53.780> is

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
notice that though the build quality is

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.960 
notice that though the build quality is
actually<00:02:54.320> very<00:02:54.920> good<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.460> holds<00:02:55.700> up<00:02:55.820> really

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
have to press this every time you want

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.500 
have to press this every time you want
to<00:03:15.560> turn<00:03:15.740> it<00:03:15.890> on<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.730> actually<00:03:17.030> goes<00:03:17.210> into

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
to turn it on it actually goes into

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.330 
to turn it on it actually goes into
sleep<00:03:17.750> mode<00:03:17.810> if<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.290> leave<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.770> on<00:03:18.860> it's<00:03:19.160> not

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
sleep mode if you leave it on it's not

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.920 
sleep mode if you leave it on it's not
very<00:03:19.550> long<00:03:19.730> either<00:03:19.970> probably<00:03:20.480> like<00:03:20.630> five

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
very long either probably like five

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.750 
very long either probably like five
minutes<00:03:21.320> or<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.190> that's<00:03:22.400> really<00:03:22.550> nice

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
minutes or so so that's really nice

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.060 
minutes or so so that's really nice
because<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.240> conserves<00:03:23.750> battery<00:03:24.110> now<00:03:24.890> right

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
because it conserves battery now right

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.680 
because it conserves battery now right
next<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.490> we<00:03:25.730> have<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.060> charging

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
next to that we have the charging

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.880 
next to that we have the charging
station<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.560> where<00:03:27.650> you're<00:03:27.740> going<00:03:27.830> to

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
basically saying that they're connected

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.290 
basically saying that they're connected

and that you can ride it now if this
thing<00:04:02.360> is<00:04:02.600> red<00:04:02.870> then<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.680> want<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:03.980> hop<00:04:04.190> back

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
thing is red then you want to hop back

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.070 
thing is red then you want to hop back
off<00:04:04.670> just<00:04:04.910> because<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.510> thing<00:04:05.690> has<00:04:05.900> not

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
off just because this thing has not

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.410 
off just because this thing has not
connected<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.590> this<00:04:06.920> side<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:07.820> it<00:04:08.120> can<00:04:08.270> be<00:04:08.390> a

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
connected to this side so it can be a

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.180 
connected to this side so it can be a
little<00:04:08.600> wonky<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.230> kind<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.500> jack<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:09.830> up<00:04:09.860> and

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
little wonky and kind of jack you up and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.590 
little wonky and kind of jack you up and
you<00:04:10.250> probably<00:04:10.610> are<00:04:11.030> going<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.180> fall<00:04:11.420> until

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
you probably are going to fall until

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.500 
you probably are going to fall until
this<00:04:11.870> thing<00:04:12.110> syncs<00:04:12.890> up<00:04:12.980> on<00:04:13.220> both<00:04:13.400> sides<00:04:13.480> now<00:04:14.480> I

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
this thing syncs up on both sides now I

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.000 
this thing syncs up on both sides now I
probably<00:04:14.750> could<00:04:14.990> have<00:04:15.020> got<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> free<00:04:15.590> review

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
probably could have got a free review

you<00:04:42.230> know<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.650> have<00:04:42.950> them<00:04:43.190> backed<00:04:43.490> me<00:04:43.700> up<00:04:43.729> but

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220
