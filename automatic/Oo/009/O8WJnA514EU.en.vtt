00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
so they most route fishermen know that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.170 
so they most route fishermen know that
yeah<00:01:01.620> no<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.310> don't<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.790> them<00:01:02.910> sort<00:01:03.150> of

fish what about the fighting qualities

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.280 
fish what about the fighting qualities
phenomenal<00:01:14.760> well<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.240> always<00:01:15.870> think<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
phenomenal well I always think on the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
phenomenal well I always think on the
fin<00:01:16.470> there's<00:01:16.650> two<00:01:16.800> types<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.220> fish<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.730> take

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
fin there's two types of fish that take

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
fin there's two types of fish that take
you<00:01:18.240> there's<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.200> ones<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.470> are<00:01:19.620> running

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
you there's the ones that are running

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
you there's the ones that are running
entering<00:01:20.370> pools<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.760> leading<00:01:21.030> pools<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
entering pools and leading pools that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
entering pools and leading pools that
are<00:01:21.450> very<00:01:21.659> aggressive<00:01:21.870> and<00:01:22.409> sometimes<00:01:22.920> when

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
are very aggressive and sometimes when

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
are very aggressive and sometimes when
you'll<00:01:23.400> hook<00:01:23.520> those<00:01:23.760> fish<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.720> more

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you'll hook those fish there be more

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
you'll hook those fish there be more
sort<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> dogged<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.650> will<00:01:25.860> play<00:01:26.130> within<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150

for fishing it's not a big white river
and<00:02:10.830> when<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:12.000> hook<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.930> fish

there's<00:02:14.700> better<00:02:14.880> sport<00:02:15.530> playing<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.680> ton<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.160> a

rod of that size the type of fly or the
type<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.630> line<00:02:22.020> would<00:02:22.790> vary<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.810> level

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
type of line would vary with the level

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.260 
type of line would vary with the level
of<00:02:25.470> water<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> river<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.910> have<00:02:27.060> high

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
of water in the river if you have high

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.960 
of water in the river if you have high
water<00:02:27.540> you'd<00:02:28.260> have<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.530> be<00:02:28.620> using<00:02:29.010> large<00:02:29.400> tube

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970

flies maybe three inches long but with

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.150 
flies maybe three inches long but with
maybe<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.810> know<00:02:33.930> definitely<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> sink<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:34.950> line

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
maybe you know definitely a sink in line

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.550 
maybe you know definitely a sink in line
maybe<00:02:35.489> even<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.880> fast<00:02:36.120> sink<00:02:36.390> in<00:02:36.510> line<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.900> then

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
maybe even a fast sink in line and then

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.710 
maybe even a fast sink in line and then
as<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.860> water<00:02:38.070> level<00:02:38.549> drops<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.540> water

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
as the water level drops and the water

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.080 
as the water level drops and the water
level<00:02:40.110> drops<00:02:40.140> very<00:02:40.739> very<00:02:41.010> rapidly<00:02:41.459> yeah<00:02:41.850> yeah

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
level drops very very rapidly yeah yeah

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.880 
level drops very very rapidly yeah yeah
and<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> couple<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.690> hours<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.560> need<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.799> be

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
and a couple of hours you need to be

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.840 
and a couple of hours you need to be
changed<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.370> down<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:45.110> maybe<00:02:46.850> an

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
typical day on the fin what would I use

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.030 
typical day on the fin what would I use

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
Rob's of a single barbless but I find in

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.490 
Rob's of a single barbless but I find in
lower<00:03:04.490> conditions<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.480> would<00:03:05.900> generally<00:03:06.350> go

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
lower conditions I would generally go

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500 
lower conditions I would generally go
for<00:03:06.530> smaller<00:03:07.069> patterns<00:03:07.490> you<00:03:07.910> know<00:03:08.060> classic

type<00:03:09.380> fliers<00:03:10.209> here<00:03:11.209> this<00:03:11.420> would<00:03:11.600> be<00:03:11.630> very

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
type fliers here this would be very

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
would go down even smaller sizes you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.040 
would go down even smaller sizes you
