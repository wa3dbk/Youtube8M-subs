00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
the menu button which on this one is on

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.000 
the menu button which on this one is on
the<00:00:17.970> right<00:00:18.119> hand<00:00:18.150> side<00:00:18.390> find<00:00:19.230> white<00:00:19.590> balance

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the right hand side find white balance

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.390 
the right hand side find white balance
in<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> options<00:00:20.880> which<00:00:21.270> here<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> second

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
in the options which here is a second

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.599 
in the options which here is a second
from<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.550> top<00:00:24.680> go<00:00:25.680> into<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> right

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
from the top go into it with the right

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.550 
from the top go into it with the right

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.389 
mode so the different white balance
settings<00:00:30.840> will<00:00:31.439> change<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> color<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> you

just I'm talking about how to change it
now<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.399> cases<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.789> quite<00:00:44.969> difficult

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
now in some cases it's quite difficult

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.779 
now in some cases it's quite difficult
to<00:00:45.420> set<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> white<00:00:45.960> balance<00:00:46.399> by<00:00:47.399> choosing

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to set the white balance by choosing

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.000 
to set the white balance by choosing
options<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.690> even<00:00:48.719> auto<00:00:49.170> doesn't<00:00:49.680> slip<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
options or even auto doesn't slip to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.260 
options or even auto doesn't slip to
correctly<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.640> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> set<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
correctly and you want to set it

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.540 
correctly and you want to set it
manually<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.949> need<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> slip

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
manually so to do that you need to slip

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.850 
manually so to do that you need to slip
one<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> these<00:00:53.969> custom<00:00:54.570> options<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.739> I've
