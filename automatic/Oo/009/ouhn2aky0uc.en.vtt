we'll put the notch in the top of the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.689 
we'll put the notch in the top of the
middle<00:00:16.529> section<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.359> then<00:00:18.359> fit<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.410> the

middle section and then fit it to the
the<00:00:20.699> lid<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:21.840> make<00:00:21.960> sure<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.350> it

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
the lid so that we can make sure that it

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.109 
the lid so that we can make sure that it
won't<00:00:22.680> pinch<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:24.109> probes<00:00:25.760> first<00:00:26.760> thing<00:00:27.000> I'm

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
won't pinch the probes first thing I'm

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.070 
won't pinch the probes first thing I'm
going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.359> do<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.470> rotate<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
going to do is I'm going to rotate the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.530 
going to do is I'm going to rotate the
middle<00:00:31.080> section<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.149> where<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.180> want<00:00:33.450> to

middle section so that where I want to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.119 
middle section so that where I want to
cut<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.960> probe<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.800> slot<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.899> towards<00:00:36.899> me<00:00:37.129> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
cut the probe the slot is towards me to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.360 
cut the probe the slot is towards me to
make<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> easier<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> use<00:00:38.879> my<00:00:39.149> angle<00:00:39.540> grinder

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
make it easier to use my angle grinder

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.650 
make it easier to use my angle grinder
I'm<00:00:41.370> using<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.910> Dewalt<00:00:42.420> angle<00:00:43.140> grinder<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
I'm using a Dewalt angle grinder with a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.860 
I'm using a Dewalt angle grinder with a
quarter<00:00:45.660> inch<00:00:46.430> grinding<00:00:47.430> wheel<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.149> that's

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
quarter inch grinding wheel and that's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.319 
quarter inch grinding wheel and that's
the<00:00:49.110> size<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> slot<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.730> want<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> cut

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the size of the slot that I want to cut

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.350 
the size of the slot that I want to cut
now<00:00:52.170> we're<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.000> figure<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.120> where

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
now we're going to figure out where

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.670 
now we're going to figure out where
we're<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> cut<00:00:54.809> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.870 

okay<00:01:02.680> now<00:01:02.860> we<00:01:02.920> can<00:01:03.040> see<00:01:03.310> it<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.430> little<00:01:03.550> better<00:01:03.730> I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
okay now we can see it a little better I

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:14.790 
okay now we can see it a little better I
just<00:01:04.090> moved<00:01:04.300> it<00:01:10.740> touch<00:01:11.740> every<00:01:12.220> way<00:01:13.530> does<00:01:14.530> have

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
just moved it touch every way does have

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.600 
just moved it touch every way does have
some<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:17.560> moving<00:01:17.890> some<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.220> metal<00:01:18.490> to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
some it's moving some of the metal to

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:33.580 
some it's moving some of the metal to
the<00:01:18.640> outside<00:01:19.000> I'll<00:01:19.150> clean<00:01:19.420> that<00:01:19.450> up<00:01:19.600> later

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.060 

now<00:01:34.590> try<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.840> again<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.790> right<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:40.070> it's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
now try it again you see right now it's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.460 
now try it again you see right now it's
pretty<00:01:41.550> much<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:42.330> about<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.080> mean<00:01:43.320> if

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
pretty much right about there I mean if

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.830 
pretty much right about there I mean if
I<00:01:43.740> barely<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.790> barely<00:01:45.500> nicked<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.950> edge<00:01:47.130> here

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
I barely I barely nicked the edge here

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.370 
I barely I barely nicked the edge here
now<00:01:48.840> I'll<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.130> move<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.310> off<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.630> I'll<00:01:52.259> let

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
now I'll just move this off and I'll let

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.710 
now I'll just move this off and I'll let
you<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:55.310> it's<00:01:56.310> barely<00:01:56.640> nicked<00:01:57.060> there<00:01:59.720> on

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
you see the it's barely nicked there on

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.290 
you see the it's barely nicked there on
the<00:02:00.960> inside<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.710> see<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.880> under

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
the inside you can see it's just under

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.250 
the inside you can see it's just under
the<00:02:06.420> rim<00:02:06.660> so<00:02:07.289> now<00:02:07.500> we'll<00:02:07.680> put<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.539> top<00:02:09.539> on

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.040 

we're<00:02:13.260> gonna<00:02:13.410> use<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.700> gray<00:02:14.700> cord<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.959> you

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
we're gonna use a gray cord here so you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.110 
we're gonna use a gray cord here so you
can<00:02:16.170> see<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.530> little<00:02:16.560> better<00:02:16.860> take<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.880> top

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
can see it a little better take the top

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.460 
can see it a little better take the top
off<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.980> put<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:20.989> cordon<00:02:21.989> as<00:02:22.140> if<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.380> was

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
off just put this cordon as if it was

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.979 
off just put this cordon as if it was
going<00:02:22.739> into<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.100> turkey<00:02:23.519> or<00:02:23.790> something<00:02:24.209> and

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
going into a turkey or something and

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.110 
going into a turkey or something and
just<00:02:25.019> lay<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.500> there<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:26.070> now<00:02:26.790> we'll<00:02:26.940> take<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
just lay it there and now we'll take a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.290 
just lay it there and now we'll take a
look<00:02:27.330> at<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:29.489> fits<00:02:29.730> perfectly<00:02:30.150> it

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
look at it and it fits perfectly it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.770 
look at it and it fits perfectly it
still<00:02:30.510> goes<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.959> out<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:32.550> if<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.600> look

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
still goes in and out and if you we look

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.229 
still goes in and out and if you we look
at<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.049> real<00:02:34.320> closely<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.850> rotate<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:38.090> if<00:02:39.090> we

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
at it real closely we rotate this if we

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.050 
at it real closely we rotate this if we
look<00:02:39.420> at<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.690> real<00:02:39.870> close<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.410> see

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
look at it real close you can see

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.050 
look at it real close you can see
there's<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.209> enough<00:02:42.870> gap<00:02:43.110> there<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:44.670> gets<00:02:44.910> us

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
there's just enough gap there it gets us

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.360 
there's just enough gap there it gets us
throw<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.320> put<00:02:46.470> probably<00:02:46.890> two<00:02:47.220> or

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
throw and you can put probably two or

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.789 
throw and you can put probably two or
three<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.970> these<00:02:48.060> probes<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.870> there<00:02:49.079> without<00:02:49.620> a

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
three of these probes in there without a

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.690 
three of these probes in there without a
problem<00:02:51.079> so<00:02:52.079> once<00:02:52.350> again<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:52.769> can<00:02:52.920> see<00:02:54.140> how<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
problem so once again we can see how the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.890 
problem so once again we can see how the
wire<00:02:56.700> here<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:58.410> below<00:02:58.739> where<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.900> tops

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
wire here is just below where the tops

the top again top weighs a ton and let's
see<00:05:12.960> how<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.229> fits<00:05:14.870> it's<00:05:15.870> perfect<00:05:17.090> fits<00:05:18.090> like<00:05:18.240> a

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
see how it fits it's perfect fits like a

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.429 
see how it fits it's perfect fits like a
champ<00:05:20.240> once<00:05:21.240> again<00:05:21.919> right<00:05:22.919> up<00:05:23.069> against<00:05:23.490> the

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
champ once again right up against the

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:29.149 
champ once again right up against the
notch<00:05:25.439> there<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:27.319> gonna<00:05:28.319> be<00:05:28.499> plenty<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.949> room

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
notch there and gonna be plenty of room

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.420 
notch there and gonna be plenty of room
but<00:05:29.879> not<00:05:30.300> too<00:05:30.569> much<00:05:30.749> room<00:05:30.990> as<00:05:31.409> you<00:05:32.039> can<00:05:32.219> see

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
but not too much room as you can see

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.600 
but not too much room as you can see
once<00:05:33.089> again<00:05:33.210> we<00:05:34.169> cut<00:05:34.439> it<00:05:34.529> out<00:05:34.650> was<00:05:35.039> very<00:05:35.310> easy

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
once again we cut it out was very easy

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.579 
once again we cut it out was very easy
to<00:05:35.759> do<00:05:36.800> okay<00:05:37.800> so<00:05:37.860> we<00:05:38.430> cut<00:05:38.819> two<00:05:39.060> notches<00:05:39.589> one

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:40.589 
to do okay so we cut two notches one

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:45.159 
to do okay so we cut two notches one
over<00:05:40.830> here<00:05:41.189> and<00:05:41.400> one<00:05:42.150> on<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.659> far<00:05:42.839> side<00:05:43.789> again

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
over here and one on the far side again

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.019 
over here and one on the far side again
you<00:05:46.169> can<00:05:46.319> see<00:05:46.560> how<00:05:46.740> they<00:05:47.039> just<00:05:47.370> barely<00:05:47.669> cut

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
you can see how they just barely cut

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.279 
you can see how they just barely cut
through<00:05:48.389> the<00:05:49.169> rim<00:05:50.330> where<00:05:51.330> it<00:05:51.419> curls<00:05:51.779> down<00:05:52.020> onto

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
through the rim where it curls down onto

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.010 
through the rim where it curls down onto
the<00:05:52.409> vertical<00:05:53.069> part<00:05:53.490> which<00:05:54.270> allows<00:05:54.569> up<00:05:54.900> to

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
the vertical part which allows up to

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.279 
the vertical part which allows up to
three<00:05:55.379> probes<00:05:56.279> at<00:05:56.580> least<00:05:56.969> to<00:05:57.210> go<00:05:57.360> in<00:05:57.569> without

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
three probes at least to go in without

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.740 
three probes at least to go in without
being<00:05:58.589> pinched<00:05:59.129> and<00:06:00.349> it<00:06:01.349> would<00:06:01.529> look<00:06:01.770> maybe

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
being pinched and it would look maybe

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.670 
being pinched and it would look maybe
about<00:06:04.399> 30<00:06:05.399> seconds<00:06:05.939> to<00:06:05.969> cut<00:06:06.270> each<00:06:06.389> notch<00:06:06.680> once

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
about 30 seconds to cut each notch once

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.769 
about 30 seconds to cut each notch once
again<00:06:07.889> I<00:06:07.979> used<00:06:08.219> a<00:06:08.430> quarter<00:06:08.819> inch<00:06:09.120> grinding

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:09.779 
again I used a quarter inch grinding

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.469 
again I used a quarter inch grinding
wheel<00:06:09.960> it<00:06:10.949> was<00:06:11.219> extremely<00:06:11.639> easy<00:06:11.789> it<00:06:12.360> took
