 One prisoner to the ground so John Paul in the back by a 4 * 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.320
 Then you're surprised and pretty, so let's hear it's the cause of the sword. 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.320
 Ahhh 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:01.120
 It's a massive booze that makes the entire town bustle. 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:07.090

 When I got out of the house , 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:21.990
 I searched around, but it's unknown for a month. 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.990
 It's the only installment Articles 10 currently in the recording which happened around the same 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:31.539
 The first person to hear the sound is the native of the village. 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:35.890
 Have you ever heard no new powers under the description I'll make the team teukwoo 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.500
 Oh, did you hear me? 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:46.500
 So, ah 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 Each and every one of them has compactness. 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:01.670
 It's similar, but it's definitely different from romantic sounds that stimulate nostalgia . 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:06.850
 How true is this rich even now this is happening for the first time a straightedge Oh xt sound 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.850
 It's not the 30 notes that I recorded every day. 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.500
 It's a very weak land. 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:18.680
 Bang without notice 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.569
 I can hear it for over 30 minutes in a month . 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.570
 It's midnight. 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.570
 I started tracking to identify the binge. 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.900
 on 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.220
 7 You'll have a lot. 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.860
 You need to know where you come from if you want to know the substance in a lump. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.850
 The first and most audible sound was heard from around the house observing the camera 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.600
 Installed 9 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.600
 I've been waiting.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.220
 A plain and quiet residential area 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.350
 It's an emergency because of the sound every day . 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.670
 If you eat until dawn, you have to find enough to endure until I have one. 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.630
 Exhausted again 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.430
 Yeah. So it's not a turn . 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.430
 Because the sense of direction is shorter 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.340
 U 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.540
 Waiting indefinitely 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.330
 I'm waiting for the watch after Hangul . 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.170
 U shell 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.360
 How I did suggest waiting 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:55.670
 I heard a sound that drew much from here in June this Unattended 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.629
 I'm do you want this application I think I heard this tremendous foundation for a larger hunger 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.620
 No increase 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.620
 My Tzu width L 10 itneyo raunchy sound'll play any more this chart

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.720
 222 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.720
 U 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.000
 43 What I wrote haneungeo 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.789
 so 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.380
 I'm going to hear a sound 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.300
 Nothing. 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:36.669
 Is it the sound of this connecting coral? 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:40.130
 Oh , you were so big under me . 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:44.780
 I could hear a whistling sound. 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.160
 All the sounds from the observation cameras installed around the initial informant house 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.050
 I got it. 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.350
 Except for the road to the coral, the source of sound is estimated to be the center of the residential area 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.350
 I'm stuck. 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:05:01.680
 I do not know why. 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.680
