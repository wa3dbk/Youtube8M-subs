00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.380
 it's personal global warming is a reality 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.489
 but it's good that there are people who are thinking of alternatives to 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.689
 reverse what is happening 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:18.289
 many of them work environmentally friendly companies and contribute to 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.900
 for everyone's global warming 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.749
 like faber-castell 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:28.149
 in fact since its foundation in 1771 it is a company that works in 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.179
 responsible way I am collaborating with the environment and society 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.280
 for example did you know that the factory to the end of the largest manufacturer of lakes 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.530
 from the reforested wood 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.850
 the faber-castell planting the trees that give rise to the pencils without admitting

 florida valdemir provv of expertises 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.929
 wood is never removed from the native forests that are 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.190
 nature reserve maintained by faperj castelÃ£o 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.530
 it is not usual the screen has the fsc stamp 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.970
 the international institution that accredits environmentally 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.360
 in different countries 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.080
 where has this service has to be done by forests works socially 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.110
 just sustained 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.330
 you may be wondering but here 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.370
 all this has to do with global warming global warming is caused 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.920
 by the excess of free calls of the greenhouse effect one of the main is the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.730
 carbon dioxide that is solved by the process of photosynthesis of the 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.930
 only it has a detail growing young trees the most chapter 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.840
 10 than the states 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.230
 to faber-castell all the areas cultivated in its maximum 25 years this 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.230
 number is much higher than what is required for diesel production 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.170
 as a result of this work 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.049
 Today, Faber-Castell Brasil performs all of the duties of Riva 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.010
 but it is not this new industrial production that 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.840
 reverse the effects of global warming 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.430
 when it comes to changing our reality 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.250
 well what an aberration 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.600
 That's why faber-castell develops projects that protest 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.249
 recover native forests 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.329
 in the city of petulant silver mines' 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.699
 faber-castell has areas of tree planting used in the manufacture of 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.769
 preserving and restoring extensive areas of native forest 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:27.209
 the natural vegetation of the region is the cerrado because it is very simple what 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.269
 facilitates the occurrence of incidents such as awards the factory bets on the 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.019
 research center that mediocrity of air at temperature the direction of the winds 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.509
 the arts and defenses this is more 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:45.829
 in direct confrontation, moreover, faber-castell could have been the consumption 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:46.980
 of electricity 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.049
 headband on the market 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.329
 the maximum rate that everything that is generated in your games 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.010
 today at seul factory 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.570
 even the most difficult to use 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.540
 and is also one of the great advantages of using 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.020
 wood for the production of the sides is that there is no waste 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.200
 study products that are used in activities such as chicken farms 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.200
 industry has already banned the dose of factories at one 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.289
 that's why the sides of woods are better for nature than 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:18.759
 sides and plastic 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.939
 but knew that the waste of a person's optimization have to do with 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.939
 maximum seven years to decompose in nature 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.959
 already in the case of plastic seals 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.500
 are jobs 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.760
 waste can remain in the environment because many years ago 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.499
 besides the energy spent to produce plastic plates is rather a 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.800
 greater risk than meaning 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800
 much more carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.239
 we have to keep our eyes open wide to choose what is best for Flemish 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.209
 and for more and more people to know how important issues are 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.290
 socio-environmental to faber-castell develops the program well woman 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.209
 community that promotes actions of local and global interest with the 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.000
 addressing the importance of respecting people 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.479
 resources 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.509
 who treats for example only in the first stage of the project felt a thousand people 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.560
 will be trained to teach the various 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.689
 ways of caring for the planet 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.669
 Look, everyone saw how 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.189
 a better world is possible 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.870
 the proposal is ruled out the possibility of 

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:29.580
 conquest of Chinese city 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.139
 every day that passes more data released by the research institute 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.139
 applied by Members in the House of 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.080
 even so 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.479
 concerned about the risk of the
