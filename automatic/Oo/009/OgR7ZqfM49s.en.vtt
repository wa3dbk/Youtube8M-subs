 it takes them up to Manuel de 44 some 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.450
 they played together only with the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.890
 brothers with cousins â€‹â€‹in the neighborhood 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 never coincided in a team of 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.510
 football no no no because it was always more 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.989
 boy like me when he was very much 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.030
 time out so this is the only 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.989
 Once we are together after so much 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.110
 weather 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.210

 how about a hug well well tell me 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.930
 votes more midfielders than forward 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.489
 beyond these goals that are 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.040
 appearing in this very important stretch 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.410
 if we always play hook more 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.070
 late 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.070
 cute teacher is putting me 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.770
 forward and the truth that if before 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 we play a little more delayed your brother 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.410
 He talks to you, he guides you, he follows you because there is 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.030
 to say it good more if it is already in 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.570
 the pedestal of contrariados already left 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.229
 Flamengo Mexico and you are attracting her 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.160
 back without insurance anymore and always not 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.520
 I'm talking about incentivizing so 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.540
 mutually we are always following not 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.040
 do not 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.190
 your contract with independent is 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.130
 when it is now mid- year and you 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.920
 immediate objective what is 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.710
 and that some big club here 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.649
 not because I would not love to play in a 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.340
 big Paraguayan club but something else 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.890
 not people constantly remember more 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.369
 in this situation you are the cousins 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.670
 of lionel messi did not tell them the second 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.170
 surname yours cuccitini federico las las 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.759
 mothers are sisters I say this for 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.039
 classify people for all people 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.569
 you know but I say to you 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.250
 I have one bothers you when you make a 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.330
 great performance that always remember to 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.810
 your cousin considers that this is 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.120
 inevitable either one like that 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.140
 I'm used to it, I think in Paraguay 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.510
 the only country where they knew me 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.040
 first by my name and then I think that 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.349
 they knew the kinship that he had with 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.660
 another pig like that I have in favor 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.430
 the olympic people like not to 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.790
 I really like that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.890
 always tries to recognize me so 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.140
 that is me and after good with what 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.489
 is outside the press get used 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.590
 Flamengo was in mexico and so is the 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.379
 lio messi's cousin is always always 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.720
 the shadow of neighbor but good is so 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.660
 general a rare one is kept at 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.760
 prime size margin also though 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.000
 will occupy detach you see because in addition 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.860
 has remained hyper effective has gone 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.959
 growing in theirs in recent years 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.239
 set aside like you sometimes get to a 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.459
 club and says that the first month arrives and it 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.260
 thinks that messi does not retire and 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.720
 obvious that nothing to see so for 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.299
 that one one knows what it is and 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.360
 he knows his limitations and trained to 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.590
 to be able to improve what madness is not as if 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.209
 will win a championship of that goal 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.840
 we were looking at that touch on the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.930
 hour 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.549
 yes yes it was beautiful to be able to convert in that 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.680
 moment there was a lot of attention a lot of cargo 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.170
 emotional in the establishment and in the environment 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.660
 also and yes because of what had happened 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.180
 week was a pretty tough week for 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.209
 we lose those partners is so 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.970
 important and good the game had been 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.709
 presented very difficult we have many 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.690
 situations we can convert and just 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.710
 in the last move, turning was what 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.530
 best 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.540
 is going to be going to be alive very important not 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.010
 Definitory is still missing a stretch but 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.380
 it's going to be very important for you 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.110
 beat national to get to recess 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.960
 with the five points of advantage yes yes of 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.140
 we really have to think that it's going to be 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.480
 a very difficult game again and as 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.240
 adhesive to try to win to go 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.400
 to recess that and be able to recover 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.250
 companions that are coming from 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.890
 injuries in independent manuel seems 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.239
 have found the course I say after 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.210
 of these victories are much more 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.230
 comfortable in the table of averages 6 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.450
 safe 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.440
 we have been making good matches already 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.740
 Sometimes the results were not given 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.660
 now I think that against just clean and 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.490
 hill we play very well and luckily 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.160
 we could get the three points and we're 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.690
 calmer could play with your 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.520
 brother could go to Olympia as I saw from 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.020
 I would love the hand I would love 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.320
 we always say it would be a dream to play 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.780
 together in Olympia or wherever the truth is 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.409
 what would be a dream cake 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.289
 belonging to 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.360
 my cake also be able to so 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.279
 now in the middle of the year it's done 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.139
 with independent and we'll see what happens and 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:03.569
 the representatives are different 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.939
 different no no no the entrepreneur is the 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.720
 same so you have racing marquez 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.480
 grab and gloves 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.970
 de manuel a big hug and follow 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.680
 continue on this path 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.150
 I always say when the boys play 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.300
 against the great 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.860
 there is a great exhibition is a great life 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.150
 but after all this you have to confirm 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.889
 in the parties that remain in the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.169
 safe championship 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:31.249
 I already said that playing with olympia and hill 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.710
 has an extra plus no but not already 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.930
 those games passed and now we have the 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.930
 Sunday with carapeguÃ¡ and will continue 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.349
 trying to get good results for 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.499
 stay in first 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:44.300
 mcs and finally listening to 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:47.180
 statements of your hair 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.219
 within the campus is already given as a 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.719
 question settled from the case of the 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.419
 three players who are separated 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.460
 you say we lost three companions 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:59.120
 let's continue you have to look for 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.750
 forward and everything else I think of 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.389
 gerardo was very clear he is the one who has 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.120
 the skin was clear with you if these 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.789
 boys are outside it was very clear here 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.370
 I think there was a mistake and good 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:15.590
 unfortunately, stop for all to 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.510
 all the Olympians 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.450
 we have great players but this 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.460
 this continues and well I think that not 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.310
 you have to talk about it anymore I think 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.780
 it's happened more and the affection the appreciation of 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.780
 always a big hug in the snow
