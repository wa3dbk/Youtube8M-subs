 ifa unmissable show where we were 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.119
 again this year in 2012 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.860
 hi to all and it's back to school 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.600
 techno chain you see us we're a 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.450
 little more tanned than in the month of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.290
 July his sledge and roman hi franÃ§ois 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.329
 welcome hello to all 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.610
 and yes it's back to school and welcome 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.219
 from berlin we are here to smooth 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 it's in the heart of the big ifa fair 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.410
 berlin you know it like every year 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.180
 it's the point to go back yes it's the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.780
 show that marks the beginning of the season 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.539
 high tech 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.539
 we will begin to dive in this lake 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.280
 of this this ifa with any of the themes 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.140
 major is one of the big news of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.850
 the ifa 2012 is the google tv 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.600
 arrive and especially at the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 sony builder 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.770
 she arrives in France the park 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 installed flat tv also has a lot 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 evolved since now there is 80% of 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.490
 French homes that have a flat TV 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.150
 so it seemed to us opportune 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.159
 not to revive a google tv in 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.680
 as such but rather to imagine a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.990
 housing that can add to its 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.200
 many TVs already installed in the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.200
 French homes 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.820
 here is one of the products events of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.890
 set to 2012 we are on the stand of 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.540
 samsung and this is the galaxy note 2 them 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 differences between the galaxy note 1 and the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.049
 guest note 2 especially at the level of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.260
 design so a bigger screen so of 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.870
 5.5 inches 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.270
 compare in kokkalis note 1 that was 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.390
 5.3 inches so we are always sure 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.560
 on a technology of super amoled hd 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.210
 however a screen that is in format 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.650
 16 9th on the new device what will 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.950
 allow for a better grip 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.660
 in hand 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.920
 so the longer longer ccao 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.810
 here it is longer so it holds 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.370
 better in India it is less broad and 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.600
 high level of technical specificities 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.100
 change from previous 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.330
 well yes to changes in the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.380
 bullets to the previous ones since we 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.510
 is either a processor that is a lot 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.890
 more powerful on the galaxy note 2 so 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.680
 there we are on a quad core processor of 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.210
 1.6g guy with a RAM of 2 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.500
 gigas which allows to have a navigation 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.850
 much more fluid and much more 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.850
 fast at the device 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.140
 we thought we had the most beautiful 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.610
 TVs from the world since we bought 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.530
 all HDTVs 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.440
 you who sold your school car and a 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.970
 new screen that's very bad 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.190
 new we will be able soon any of 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.500
 put all in the trash and yes since 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.150
 your beautiful full hd screen that you have 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.740
 paid a fortune is almost worth 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.170
 Finally, nothing is exaggerated still there 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.760
 grows the line yeah since during 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.830
 to satisfy we could already see the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.560
 televisions of future generations 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.790
 it's ultra high definition so 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.530
 what is the ultra high 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.650
 definition giro it's all simple we put 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.750
 even more pixels in the TV 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.250
 explanations in fact we multiplied the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.630
 full hd resolution we know well 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.400
 what we call definitions 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.959
 we multiplied by 4 that is to say that he 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 there are twice as many points in on the 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.140
 lines and twice as many points on 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.090
 the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.860
 on the columns so it gives an image 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.319
 much finer and that is a lot 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.870
 more realistic and who loves me is enough 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.400
 surprising when we look at 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.260
 prototypes that we will ride on the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.780
 stand and that even gives aspects of 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.700
 3d why because the images being 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.840
 so precise better cut out we have 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.420
 really feel like I have some 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:33.030
 relief and to have real 3d and so 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.890
 we will discover the galaxy camera in fact 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.780
 which is a camera with 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.910
 high-end specifics but which has the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.700
 particularity of being connected at a time 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.260
 in 3g with a 3g chip but also in 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.120
 wifi what will you actually allow 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.530
 to access the world of the smartphone 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.690
 love so much jerome that is to say that you 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.730
 take a picture you can transform it 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.920
 with instagram with two apps from 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.500
 photo processing send it by mms 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.330
 by email on the cloud and so on 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.620
 is called the galaxy camera explanation 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.030
 of this extraordinary device 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.010
 so that works extremely 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.500
 you just have to take a 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.959
 photo a picture of a portal or a 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.570
 landscape and one click you can 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.090
 send your photo either directly to 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.860
 the network be on facebook or if 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.890
 you want to retouch your photo 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.930
 can first retire on 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.510
 applications like photoshop and then 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.270
 you send it on social networks 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.820
 you can send it also on an email 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.300
 and then you can also because he is 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:34.930
 entitled to send you 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.729
 ms with the photo that is attached here 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.650
