pretty<00:03:03.030> expendable<00:03:03.810> as<00:03:03.930> well<00:03:04.109> so<00:03:04.440> yeah<00:03:05.250> they

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
pretty expendable as well so yeah they

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.740 
pretty expendable as well so yeah they
will<00:03:05.549> have<00:03:05.670> their<00:03:05.820> own<00:03:05.880> mo<00:03:06.239> which<00:03:06.390> i<00:03:06.510> think<00:03:06.570> is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
will have their own mo which i think is

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.080 
will have their own mo which i think is
really<00:03:06.900> interesting<00:03:07.310> but<00:03:08.310> how<00:03:08.489> they<00:03:08.700> working

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
really interesting but how they working

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
as well in the world bro and that gives

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.229 
as well in the world bro and that gives
this<00:03:10.980> kind<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.250> really<00:03:11.459> unique<00:03:11.700> flavor<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.150> the
