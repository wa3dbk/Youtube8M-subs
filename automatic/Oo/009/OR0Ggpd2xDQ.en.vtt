00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.400
 camper is the small reference that is 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.370
 valid for two people who comes in 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 this nylon case to carry not as 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.000
 transport 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.910
 the drum set is made in 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.060
 Teflon material next to aluminum 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.509
 It includes 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.399
 a frying pan with a diameter of about 20 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.820
 centimeters that also serves us as 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.820
 table 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.720
 novelty wears these two covers which 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.180
 difference we are going to find with 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.190
 been top preferential to another or others 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.980
 similar products first that are from 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.370
 a plastic material carry a board 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.309
 here of rubber to make it more more 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.860
 watertight but that is more in the in 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.780
 the hot pot much faster and in 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.089
 the time for example to cook liquids or 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.059
 know pasta comes a decanter these 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.130
 holes that would serve us 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.640
 with the same dung lid to empty it 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.640
 of the liquid 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.490
 these would be the two tapas this will be 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.150
 for the small pot in vitro means 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.240
 19 centimeters and this would be for a 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.640
 large 2 liters carry here a 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.790
 hole so that it goes out 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.410
 its permanent 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.000
 would be his life for the pan and for her 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.560
 as a novelty with respect to others in the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.140
 market we have not seen that they are already 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.420
 totally of a straight piece and are in 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.090
 This piece is not worn here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.690
 a great little boy we will see now how 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.190
 it's a lot 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.430
 and to close what I eat much less 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.960
 space is pointing it used to be about 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.630
 the small pot as commented on 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.300
 Flower interior and aluminum base 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.330
 this would be the pot 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.640
 big this would be the 2 liter pot in 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.890
 the bottom part we will find a 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.080
 pvc cap of aircraft region 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.380
 also a cutting cap for the time 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.230
 of betting on music we are there in the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.180
 field brings directly we say a 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.480
 stone or wood we would put this 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.420
 top 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.510
 good as has been commented these would be 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.560
 the two leaves that would be their 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.560
 corresponding tops 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.220
 and this would be 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.530
 for the feminine as you can see it closes 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.320
 very well and as I said here what about 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.800
 the holes for his time 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.110
 decanting this stage that is art that 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.840
 will also serve us as he touches and as 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.140
 we comment 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.670
 we open 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.670
 we have words here this 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.110
 now 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.930
 and we would have it hooked have 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.050
 adopted in the pan as in the two 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.400
 dreams 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.000
 to remove the personalities from behind 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.000
 but this 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.470
 it would be perfectly 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.720
 and do not do a test perfectly if 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.260
 it also does not look to be even smaller 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.810
 something we can close there directly 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.780
 one is a being that stops pale for two 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.129
 people an adult and a child but the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.150
 information has helped us 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.150
 between kim
