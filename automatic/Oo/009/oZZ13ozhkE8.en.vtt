00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
a guy throw a ball at a guy like that

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.879 
a guy throw a ball at a guy like that
it's<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.389> code<00:04:50.719> and<00:04:51.080> that's<00:04:51.500> what's<00:04:51.740> in

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
it's the code and that's what's in

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.709 
it's the code and that's what's in
hockey<00:04:52.250> -<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.789> if<00:04:52.939> I<00:04:53.030> maybe<00:04:53.240> that's<00:04:53.479> like<00:04:53.689> a
