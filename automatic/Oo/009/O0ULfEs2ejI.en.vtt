like we're playing at the 12th fret so

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.490 
like we're playing at the 12th fret so
for<00:00:39.059> instance<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:39.629> I'm<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> 11th

until<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> get<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.920> pitch<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:52.100> literally

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
until I get to this pitch I literally

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.830 
until I get to this pitch I literally
bend<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> string<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.590> also<00:00:55.710> bend<00:00:56.100> it

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
bend the string up you can also bend it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.840 
bend the string up you can also bend it
commonly<00:00:57.840> only<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.440> bending<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.980> towards<00:00:59.640> one

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
commonly only see bending up towards one

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.490 
commonly only see bending up towards one
or<00:00:59.879> two<00:01:00.120> frets<00:01:00.359> above<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.989> pitch<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.199> you're

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
or two frets above the pitch that you're

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.020 
or two frets above the pitch that you're
at<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.920> case<00:01:02.129> I'm<00:01:02.340> bending<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:02.760> towards

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
at in this case I'm bending up towards

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.010 
at in this case I'm bending up towards
13<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.290> here's<00:01:04.500> my<00:01:04.650> pitch<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:05.549> 11<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.810> want

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
13 so here's my pitch at 11 and I want

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.310 
13 so here's my pitch at 11 and I want
it<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> sound<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:08.180> 13<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> pretty<00:01:10.049> far

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it to sound like 13 so it's a pretty far

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.880 
it to sound like 13 so it's a pretty far
Bend<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.930> hear<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.290> though<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.710> hear

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
Bend you can hear it though you can hear

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.109 
Bend you can hear it though you can hear
that<00:01:13.979> same<00:01:14.220> pitch<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> bend

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that same pitch so we have to bend

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.749 
that same pitch so we have to bend
pretty<00:01:15.450> far<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:16.189> for<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> most<00:01:17.430> part<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
pretty far up for the most part you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.270 
pretty far up for the most part you
really<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.119> push<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> string<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.280> takes

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
really just push on the string it takes

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.649 
really just push on the string it takes
a<00:01:20.369> little<00:01:20.490> bit<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.700> ear<00:01:20.909> training<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.450> can

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
a little bit of ear training but you can

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.210 
a little bit of ear training but you can
really<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.110> hear<00:01:22.380> when<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.500> matches<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
really you can hear when it matches a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.590 
really you can hear when it matches a
lot<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.790> times<00:01:23.970> you'll<00:01:24.150> want<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.330> check

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
lot of the times you'll want to check

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.020 
lot of the times you'll want to check
the<00:01:25.200> note<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.530> you're<00:01:25.650> reaching<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the note that you're reaching for and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.510 
the note that you're reaching for and
then<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.869> hit<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.049> note<00:01:28.520> you'll

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
then see if you can hit that note you'll

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
then see if you can hit that note you'll
also<00:01:29.700> sometimes<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.750> kind<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> case

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
also sometimes see this kind of case

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.700 
also sometimes see this kind of case
where<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.220> 11<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.850> bend<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> 12<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.530> then

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
where I see 11 I bend up to 12 but then

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
where I see 11 I bend up to 12 but then
I<00:01:34.799> bend<00:01:35.009> back<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.549> 11<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.659> saying<00:01:36.990> I'm

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
I bend back to 11 so it's saying I'm

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
I bend back to 11 so it's saying I'm
going<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> start<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.829> note<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:38.850> going

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
resembles this 11 12 11 so we would do

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.660 
resembles this 11 12 11 so we would do
this<00:02:22.319> leg<00:02:23.319> up<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.799> back<00:02:23.860> again<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.340> we<00:02:24.459> end

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
this leg up and back again and we end

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.420 
this leg up and back again and we end
where<00:02:24.850> we<00:02:24.880> started<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.600> case<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:27.280> those

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
where we started in that case so those

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.710 
where we started in that case so those
are<00:02:27.549> three<00:02:27.760> common<00:02:28.090> types<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.420> where<00:02:28.569> you'll

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
are three common types of where you'll

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.870 
are three common types of where you'll
you'll<00:02:29.049> see<00:02:29.230> bending<00:02:29.709> written<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:30.549> guitar

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
you'll see bending written in guitar
