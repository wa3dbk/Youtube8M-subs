phones<00:00:06.420> racing<00:00:08.690> it's<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.960> big<00:00:10.679> muscle<00:00:11.219> engine

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
phones racing it's a big muscle engine

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.250 
phones racing it's a big muscle engine
with<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> supercharger

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.800 

we're<00:00:16.680> running<00:00:17.010> right<00:00:17.190> now<00:00:17.400> around<00:00:17.810> 700

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
we're running right now around 700

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.190 
we're running right now around 700
horsepower<00:00:19.130> it's<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.250> fairly<00:00:20.520> big<00:00:21.000> vehicle<00:00:21.630> so

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
horsepower it's a fairly big vehicle so

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.470 
horsepower it's a fairly big vehicle so
with<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.610> we<00:00:23.610> need<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.880> build<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:24.120> a<00:00:24.180> lot<00:00:24.390> of

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
with that we need to build up a lot of

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.570 
with that we need to build up a lot of
traction<00:00:24.780> to<00:00:25.320> keep<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> speed<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> really

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
traction to keep up the speed it really

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.250 
traction to keep up the speed it really
is<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.790> at<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.150> about<00:00:27.360> this<00:00:27.690> going<00:00:27.930> sideways

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
is not at all about this going sideways

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.619 
is not at all about this going sideways
is<00:00:28.560> about<00:00:28.770> going<00:00:28.920> fast<00:00:29.340> sideways

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.400 

they're<00:00:34.140> also<00:00:34.260> running<00:00:34.500> KW<00:00:35.219> suspense<00:00:35.640> around

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
they're also running KW suspense around

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
they're also running KW suspense around
which<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.620> very<00:00:37.859> important<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.519> have<00:00:38.670> coil

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
which is very important to have coil

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.360 
which is very important to have coil
over<00:00:39.899> two<00:00:40.050> adjustable<00:00:40.440> suspension<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.309> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
over two adjustable suspension so you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.450 
over two adjustable suspension so you
can<00:00:41.519> adjust<00:00:41.850> ride<00:00:42.690> height

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
can adjust ride height

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.950 
can adjust ride height

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
shocks and the spring rates the way you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.689 
shocks and the spring rates the way you
want

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699
