what<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> kind<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.790> cut<00:01:20.970> them<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
what I like to do is kind of cut them a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.910 
what I like to do is kind of cut them a
little<00:01:21.450> bit<00:01:21.600> closer<00:01:21.930> probably<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
little bit closer probably about the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100 
little bit closer probably about the
midway<00:01:23.280> point<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.600> kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> just

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
midway point that way to kind of just

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.719 
midway point that way to kind of just
cover<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.500> traps<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.610> your

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
cover your traps but you do see your

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
cover your traps but you do see your
full<00:01:26.970> shoulders<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.170> other<00:01:28.350> thing<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
full shoulders the other thing what I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.109 
full shoulders the other thing what I
want<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.280> cut<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.909> we're

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
want to do when we cut this is we're

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.520 
want to do when we cut this is we're
going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.299> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> want<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.869> loop<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.350> out

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
going to kind of want to loop it out

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.840 
going to kind of want to loop it out
we're<00:01:32.100> not<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> want<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.670> make<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
we're not going to want to make a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210 
we're not going to want to make a
straight<00:01:33.329> cut<00:01:33.470> necessarily<00:01:34.470> because<00:01:34.860> again

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
straight cut necessarily because again

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.980 
straight cut necessarily because again
what<00:01:35.520> happens<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> cut<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.780> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
what happens is when you cut this and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.960 
what happens is when you cut this and
wear<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> straight<00:01:38.460> line<00:01:38.490> it's

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
wear it if you have a straight line it's

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
wear it if you have a straight line it's
going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.420> hang<00:01:39.720> over<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> lot<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.530> part

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
going to really hang over a lot of part

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.800 
going to really hang over a lot of part
of<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:40.950> arms<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.490> front<00:01:41.790> shoulders<00:01:42.270> so

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
of your arms and your front shoulders so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.940 
of your arms and your front shoulders so
we're<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> kind<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.590> loop<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
we're going to kind of want to loop it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
we're going to kind of want to loop it
out<00:01:44.100> almost<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> basketball

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
out almost think of it like a basketball

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.020 
out almost think of it like a basketball
jersey<00:01:46.110> type<00:01:46.500> cut<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> first<00:01:47.790> thing<00:01:47.939> we're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
jersey type cut so the first thing we're

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.219 
jersey type cut so the first thing we're
going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:48.750> ahead<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.049> cut

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
going to do is just go ahead and cut

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.539 
going to do is just go ahead and cut
right<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.439> I'm<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.310> about

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
right here I'm going to go in about

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.539 
right here I'm going to go in about
three<00:01:50.880> inches<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.360> right<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> center<00:01:52.549> and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
three inches in right in the center and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.880 
three inches in right in the center and
I'm<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.119> ahead<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.420> cut<00:01:54.570> down

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.380 

and<00:01:58.890> again<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.549> cut<00:01:59.759> down<00:01:59.790> I'm<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.329> to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
and again as I cut down I'm going to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.060 
and again as I cut down I'm going to
kind<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.570> want<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> keep<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.140> general<00:02:01.680> swoop

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
kind of want to keep this general swoop

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.630 
kind of want to keep this general swoop
that<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:04.310> don't<00:02:05.310> want<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> go<00:02:05.579> too

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that we have here I don't want to go too

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.059 
that we have here I don't want to go too
far<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:06.299> past<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.990> actual<00:02:07.350> armpit<00:02:07.860> line

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
far down past the actual armpit line

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.050 
far down past the actual armpit line
because<00:02:08.819> what<00:02:08.940> ends<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.239> happening<00:02:09.300> again

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
because what ends up happening again

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.240 
because what ends up happening again
you<00:02:10.179> get<00:02:10.300> this<00:02:10.450> really<00:02:10.780> wide<00:02:11.170> old<00:02:11.500> shirt<00:02:11.950> and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
you get this really wide old shirt and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.430 
you get this really wide old shirt and
in<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.970> long<00:02:13.239> run<00:02:13.270> what's<00:02:13.870> going<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.050> happen

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
in the long run what's going to happen

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.050 
in the long run what's going to happen
is<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.709> going<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.860> end<00:02:15.040> up<00:02:15.190> tearing<00:02:15.610> and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
is it's going to end up tearing and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.270 
is it's going to end up tearing and
stretching<00:02:16.510> quite<00:02:16.780> easily<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:17.860> there<00:02:18.040> we<00:02:18.160> have

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
stretching quite easily so there we have

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.920 
stretching quite easily so there we have
the<00:02:18.310> first<00:02:18.580> cut<00:02:18.910> as<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.390> see<00:02:19.569> it's<00:02:19.690> more

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the first cut as you can see it's more

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.170 
the first cut as you can see it's more
of<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.110> loop<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:21.040> if<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.250> take<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.489> look<00:02:21.730> here<00:02:22.060> at

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
of a loop and if I take a look here at

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.030 
of a loop and if I take a look here at
my<00:02:22.209> actual<00:02:22.480> sleeve<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.319> can<00:02:23.440> kind<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.739> see<00:02:23.920> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
my actual sleeve you can kind of see the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.520 
my actual sleeve you can kind of see the
progression<00:02:24.400> path<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.060> cut<00:02:25.420> now<00:02:26.230> when<00:02:26.440> we

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
progression path that I cut now when we

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.110 
progression path that I cut now when we
do<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.800> other<00:02:26.920> side<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.580> make<00:02:27.790> sure<00:02:27.970> that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
do the other side just to make sure that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.699 
do the other side just to make sure that
we're<00:02:28.269> keeping<00:02:28.390> everything<00:02:28.870> even<00:02:29.200> what<00:02:29.680> I

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
we're keeping everything even what I

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.170 
we're keeping everything even what I
like<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.069> do<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.459> just<00:02:30.489> like<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.880> put<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
like to do is I just like to put the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.870 
like to do is I just like to put the
other<00:02:31.300> one<00:02:31.540> down<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.519> can<00:02:33.700> see

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
other one down just so you can see

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.089 
other one down just so you can see
exactly<00:02:34.239> where<00:02:34.569> we<00:02:34.750> need<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:34.959> cut<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.349> here<00:02:35.620> now

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
exactly where we need to cut it here now

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.199 
exactly where we need to cut it here now
I'm<00:02:36.190> not<00:02:36.310> going<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.489> keep<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.790> here<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.030> try<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
I'm not going to keep it here and try to

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.460 
I'm not going to keep it here and try to
trace<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.690> whole<00:02:37.810> time<00:02:38.019> because<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
trace it the whole time because the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.600 
trace it the whole time because the
shirt<00:02:38.650> lines<00:02:38.890> up<00:02:39.069> different<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.519> you're

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
shirt lines up different and you're

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.430 
shirt lines up different and you're
going<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> end<00:02:39.940> up<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:40.209> weird<00:02:40.480> marks<00:02:40.870> but

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
going to end up with weird marks but

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.390 
going to end up with weird marks but
we're<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.560> going<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.800> go<00:02:41.890> ahead<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.250> cut

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
we're just going to go ahead and cut

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.650 
we're just going to go ahead and cut
this<00:02:42.580> one<00:02:42.760> as<00:02:42.850> well<00:02:47.850> again<00:02:48.850> keeping<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.299> same

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
this one as well again keeping that same

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.530 
this one as well again keeping that same
general<00:02:50.380> loop<00:02:53.910> now<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:54.970> next<00:02:55.299> thing<00:02:55.390> with

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
general loop now the next thing with

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.270 
general loop now the next thing with
this<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:55.989> if<00:02:56.049> you<00:02:56.200> really<00:02:56.470> mess<00:02:56.650> up<00:02:56.680> after

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
this to it if you really mess up after

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.650 
this to it if you really mess up after
you<00:02:57.370> try<00:02:57.549> this<00:02:57.610> on<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.060> can<00:02:58.209> make<00:02:58.420> some

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
you try this on you can make some

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.809 
you try this on you can make some
adjustments<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.560> it's<00:02:59.769> better<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.220> kind<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.670> be

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
adjustments so it's better to kind of be

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.059 
adjustments so it's better to kind of be
conservative<00:03:01.480> at<00:03:01.690> first<00:03:02.019> that<00:03:02.650> way<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:02.920> have

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
conservative at first that way you have

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.130 
conservative at first that way you have
some<00:03:03.310> material<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.790> play<00:03:04.000> with<00:03:04.209> otherwise

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
some material to play with otherwise

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.720 
some material to play with otherwise
what<00:03:05.349> ends<00:03:05.590> up<00:03:05.650> happening<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.340> cut<00:03:06.549> too

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
what ends up happening is you cut too

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:15.370 
what ends up happening is you cut too
much<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.180> end<00:03:07.330> up<00:03:07.450> ruining<00:03:07.660> your<00:03:07.989> shirt

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.370 

so<00:03:15.950> there<00:03:16.160> we<00:03:16.250> go<00:03:16.700> there<00:03:16.970> we<00:03:17.150> have<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.540> now<00:03:18.140> some

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
so there we go there we have it now some

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.170 
so there we go there we have it now some
people<00:03:18.710> again<00:03:18.950> don't<00:03:19.310> like<00:03:19.460> these<00:03:19.670> corners<00:03:20.060> on

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
people again don't like these corners on

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.210 
people again don't like these corners on
the<00:03:20.300> end<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.660> find<00:03:20.930> this<00:03:21.110> it's<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.770> best<00:03:22.010> this

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
the end I find this it's the best this

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.710 
the end I find this it's the best this
way<00:03:22.460> you're<00:03:23.060> also<00:03:23.210> going<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.420> want<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.600> make

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.920
