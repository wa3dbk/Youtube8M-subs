that was deals went out no I I can't pin

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.139 
that was deals went out no I I can't pin
for<00:01:07.539> a<00:01:07.600> while<00:01:07.750> I<00:01:07.780> mean<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.729> should<00:01:09.759> just<00:01:10.000> have

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
for a while I mean you should just have

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.609 
for a while I mean you should just have
stretches<00:01:10.479> during<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.930> year<00:01:11.020> sometimes<00:01:11.410> of

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
stretches during the year sometimes of

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.040 
stretches during the year sometimes of
course<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:12.009> don't<00:01:12.100> want<00:01:12.340> them<00:01:12.460> but<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:13.050> think

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
course you don't want them but I think

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.800 
course you don't want them but I think
it's<00:01:14.429> if<00:01:15.429> you<00:01:15.610> think<00:01:15.820> can<00:01:16.060> find<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.420> good<00:01:16.450> thing

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
it's if you think can find a good thing

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.480
