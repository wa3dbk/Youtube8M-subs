like<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:29.360> also<00:02:29.620> because<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.860> added<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.280> fact

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
like but also because I added that fact

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.810 
like but also because I added that fact
it's<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.660> reason<00:02:32.930> why<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.519> reverse<00:02:34.519> sounding

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
it's the reason why the reverse sounding

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.759 
it's the reason why the reverse sounding
so<00:02:35.000> important<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.510> because<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:36.080> because

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
so important is because like because

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.350 
so important is because like because
when<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.130> add<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.310> fact<00:02:37.820> that's<00:02:38.090> all<00:02:38.239> I

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
when you add that fact that's all I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.270 
when you add that fact that's all I
could<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:38.989> rid<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.410> because<00:02:39.620> your

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
could just get rid of it because your

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.660
