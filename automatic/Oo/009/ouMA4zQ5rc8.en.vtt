but<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.900> color<00:02:18.170> goes<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.709> beautifully<00:02:20.920> just

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
but the color goes on beautifully just

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.010 
but the color goes on beautifully just
really<00:02:22.459> nice<00:02:22.640> coloring<00:02:23.090> really<00:02:23.660> brings<00:02:23.900> out

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
really nice coloring really brings out

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.410 
really nice coloring really brings out
the<00:02:24.170> figure<00:02:24.440> nicely<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.850> actually<00:02:26.180> just

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
the figure nicely this is actually just

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.600 
the figure nicely this is actually just
off<00:02:26.660> my<00:02:26.900> bandsaw<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.650> hadn't<00:02:27.920> even<00:02:28.100> sanded<00:02:28.459> this

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
off my bandsaw I hadn't even sanded this

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.809 
off my bandsaw I hadn't even sanded this
shut<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.709> then<00:02:30.860> let's<00:02:31.040> try<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:32.470> aqua<00:02:33.470> green

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.310 

beautiful<00:02:48.760> coloring<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.690> like<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:49.990> said<00:02:50.050> this

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
beautiful coloring and like I said this

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.140 
beautiful coloring and like I said this
is<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.770> off<00:02:50.950> my<00:02:51.160> bandsaw

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
is just off my bandsaw

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.880 
is just off my bandsaw
it's<00:02:52.540> not<00:02:52.690> even<00:02:52.930> sanded<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.680> looks

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
it's not even sanded and it looks

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.380 
it's not even sanded and it looks
spectacular<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:57.250> thing<00:02:57.460> I<00:02:57.550> did<00:02:57.730> notice<00:02:57.910> about

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
spectacular one thing I did notice about

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.940 
spectacular one thing I did notice about
these<00:02:58.600> other<00:02:58.810> dyes<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.530> if<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.770> wasn't

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
these other dyes is that if it wasn't

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.560 
these other dyes is that if it wasn't
bare<00:03:00.310> wood<00:03:00.580> if<00:03:00.790> there<00:03:00.940> was<00:03:01.030> something<00:03:01.330> already

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
bare wood if there was something already

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.390 
bare wood if there was something already
on<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.840> wood<00:03:02.050> that<00:03:02.230> that<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:02.830> thing<00:03:03.040> going

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
on the wood that that this thing going

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.020 
on the wood that that this thing going
so<00:03:03.610> well

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
so well

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.390 
so well
this<00:03:04.930> was<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.260> gold<00:03:05.500> wash<00:03:05.740> piece<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.280> was

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
this was the gold wash piece I was

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.520 
this was the gold wash piece I was
testing<00:03:06.880> on<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.690> took<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.020> dye<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.260> I

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
testing on and I took the dye and I

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.890 
testing on and I took the dye and I
tried<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.860> rub<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.540> actually

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
tried to rub it in and that actually

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.440 
tried to rub it in and that actually
didn't<00:03:11.140> come<00:03:11.170> out<00:03:11.290> nicely<00:03:12.190> at<00:03:12.280> all<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:13.270> has

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
didn't come out nicely at all this has

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.270 
didn't come out nicely at all this has
got<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.750> go<00:03:13.870> into<00:03:14.170> bare<00:03:14.410> wood<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.860> can't<00:03:15.070> have

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
got to go into bare wood you can't have

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.520 
got to go into bare wood you can't have
any<00:03:15.430> other<00:03:15.640> coating<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:16.240> it<00:03:16.450> I'm<00:03:16.780> not<00:03:16.990> sure<00:03:17.200> if

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
any other coating on it I'm not sure if

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.430 
any other coating on it I'm not sure if
this<00:03:17.680> would<00:03:17.890> work<00:03:18.070> well<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:19.050> as<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.110> lacquer

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
this would work well on as a lacquer

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.890 
this would work well on as a lacquer
tint<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.370> something<00:03:21.700> along<00:03:21.970> those<00:03:22.120> lines

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
tint to something along those lines

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.290 
tint to something along those lines
smells<00:03:23.620> thinner<00:03:23.920> base<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.910> would<00:03:25.180> be

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
smells thinner base but I would be

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.590 
smells thinner base but I would be
careful<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:26.830> with<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.430> paint<00:03:27.970> already<00:03:28.330> down

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
careful this with the paint already down

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.080 
careful this with the paint already down

the<00:04:10.959> colors<00:04:11.349> pick<00:04:11.590> up<00:04:11.769> each<00:04:11.950> other<00:04:12.299> so<00:04:13.299> you<00:04:13.329> can

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
the colors pick up each other so you can

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.670 
the colors pick up each other so you can
do<00:04:13.599> a<00:04:13.629> lot<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.810> fading<00:04:15.720> how's<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.989> red<00:04:17.229> now<00:04:17.560> I'm
