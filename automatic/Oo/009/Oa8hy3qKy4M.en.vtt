00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.900
 by the way you are superstitious 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.480
 no but just in case I do it from time to time 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.310
 when it is a superstition yes yes what 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.200
 I like to make it like salt and 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.840
 all that then in the end that you're 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.790
 counting me together with people what they 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.529
 without knowing it like the roll when as is 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.469
 like when you throw drink in the 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:47.339
 at the table that you have to throw you out 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.339
 by the shoulder as 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:53.259
 If I'm eating with you and I drop my 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.879
 cocacola I take it for granted that I'm going to see 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.719
 someone throwing himself with the salt shaker for the 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.719
 shoulder like the roll 

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:05.969
 Right now I'm giving something like that because 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.929
 it's going very well for me to be told 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:16.050
 now that it says it sounds like a 

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:17.940
 superstition asshole but this one 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.980

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.660

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.320
 coefficient for both 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.940
 I'm really practical in the 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.940
 superstitions and practice 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.600

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.000
 but that's what happens uncle 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.650

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.760
