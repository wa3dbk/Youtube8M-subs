00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.710
 continues with the improvement of the Jorge Stadium 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.180
 Suarez Landaverde which is one of the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.680
 construction works of the calero equipment 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.780

 concacaf league champions in their stadium 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.720
 for that reason the north grandstand was demolished 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 to expand the playing field the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.039
 field of the calero will have a measure of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.310
 100 x 70 meters in addition to improving the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.900
 lighting before July 15 will 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.300
 is in gramado and the part that is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.010
 Tier demolished northern sector of the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.320
 tapiales are about to finish 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.480
 same way to give it the environment of 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.489
 stadium security we are giving 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.010
 290 against court behind the frame that 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.379
 we are going through 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.670
 the minimum since there are 250 to avoid 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.910
 accidents and by calling it on the sides there 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.769
 is going to have a part is going to have this 250 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.989
 and the other part is going to have 350 the area 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.969
 where are the referees 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.309
 The capacity of Calero Suarez has been 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.559
 reduced to 4,500 people 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.870
 to compensate the area will be rebuilt 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.880
 of shade and grandstands to add a 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.560
 second level of seats 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.200
 and we will recover all that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.969
 Molise mos and we will recover 30% 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.439
 more than we expect the 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.539
 Mayor of Metapán works in the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.009
 construction of a sports complex in 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.259
 the neighborhoods of the municipal cemetery 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.750
 it highlights the stadium that will have a 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.850
 capacity for almost 15,000 people with 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.700
 all the necessary amenities for the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.340
 soccer practice but jacuzzi do 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.689
 a work regeneration cuvette 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.159
 possibly a gym there is a vision 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.140
 quite a problem because it said 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.270
 something of the mayor in metapán you have 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.310
 they like things well the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 excavation of land and the model for 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.509
 the construction of the stadium which has 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.599
 entered a pause since the urgent 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.610
 is the improvement of the calero suárez people 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.319
 who was working on the machinery 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.209
 is behind in the stadium that is 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.979
 building everything moved here 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.390
 for the demolition the grandstand and everything that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.849
 is on land let's start again 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 because that stadium and with juande 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.729
 Of course it's going to be done and that's going to be 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.429
 the stadium is not going to stop that 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.799
 the new stadium is on pause more 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.440
 not the training pitch with measures of 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.760
 105 x 78 meters and constantly 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.709
 maintenance 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.900
 team of isidro metapán performs there 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.090
 some of his practices is a 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.909
 millionaire investment is made by the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.129
 metapaneca commune as advice and to say 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.799
 we already made the decision that we are going to leave 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.420
 2 million to invest up to where 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.459
 let's get the 2 million, well let's go there 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.379
 to stop because we can not invest so much 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.940
 silver in the other stadium so that 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.190
 we are modifying this to not be 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.230
 running in addition to the new stadium it 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.840
