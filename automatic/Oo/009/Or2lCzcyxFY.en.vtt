00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 if you want more in your movie 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:05.730
 want to display text elements around 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.960
 for example, to describe something or 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.059
 to explain 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.260
 then you know you can do that with him 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.509
 to do a title 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.030
 But the title has a certain effect 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.170
 length or play duration and if they are 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.119
 for example, a title on ten 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 seconds limit then it is so 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.350
 that certain people can read that and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.510
 others maybe the kitas too fast 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.789
 or maybe too slow 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.019
 now if only 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.970
 display text information 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.800
 maybe you want more information 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.480
 to your project or maybe one 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.790
 address of your website or 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.829
 Maybe your contact details where you get them 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.930
 can reach and so on then there 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.870
 It's an elegant way to do it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.000
 can do with a menu and that'll be 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.879
 I now just another disc menu 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.920
 Add and look for this one time 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:57.570
 empty template i just pull this 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.750
 in this menu list I am going to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.989
 first of all here in the first menu one 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.689
 add another button so a text 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:15.150
 element for example infos and would that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:18.020
 shrink something like that and I'm going to do that now 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.220
 create as a normal button 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.930
 this button I will now 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.720
 link to menu 2 and this menu 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.009
 I'll work that way now 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:37.820
 Here in principle only one text element 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:41.100
 returns so that should be a normal one 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:46.460
 to be a button and I will continue 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.460
 now here further information 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:59.820
 and just add the information if you 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:59.820
 then ask for more information 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:14.550
 contact me and then 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:18.840
 then here would be your address and more 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.100
 details stand 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.660
 Of course you can do it graphically 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.790
 customize with a background picture 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.570
 maybe a picture of those below 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.790
 and so I confirm the menu once 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.380
 leave this editor and this one 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.130
 Of course I would have to go back now 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.880
 I link with the menu 1 because I play 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.490
 now this disc editor from here 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.980
 first the interest will be quenched 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.450
 appears and now the menu appears 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.580
 I can now for example the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.570
 select individual chapter to directly 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.940
 to see the movie 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.010
 but if I just see more info 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.010
 I would like to choose this option 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.140
 and i get these texts chalkboard and 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.420
 that will be displayed until now 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.790
 the viewer again the button 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.310
 select back because this title is 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.280
 not an element of the film but simply 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.260
 an empty menu that only has one 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.739
 button has back in 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.280
 main menu 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.870
 so it's all about certain 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.340
 text information a certain duration 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.250
 show 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.950
 with a click on it you get back 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.989
 back to the main menu and can 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.080
 then again the individual chapters 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.390
 choose 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.850
 as a supplement they could have one more 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.620
 I will go on and I will 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:41.019
 Now here's another one 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.489
 add button so that would be 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.320
 now been info 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:50.520
 I will copy this one now 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.610
 and would say that 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.340
 cru so there would be now then would be 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.760
 everything has gone through I say again 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.810
 okay and you see this button 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.660
 is not linked 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.600
 So now I will have another menu 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:15.570
 Add and this goes to menu 3 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:23.040
 Menu 3 in turn receives an element 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:27.810
 back then back to the main menu 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:31.200
 would link these text elements 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:36.420
 I clear out once insinuating 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.490
 Now a new I that nice from 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.580
 middle and then I will be easy now 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:47.210
 Write crew and who participated 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.210
 has for example camera that is peter 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:05:06.769
 Cut is the max light is the core 

00:05:02.049 --> 00:05:09.709
 the script wrote the banner 

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:12.649
 and so on a classic smaller one 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:16.989
 credits or a small listing of 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:20.569
 crew I will get these texts now 

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:24.709
 could of course could center here 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.779
 even different then individual 

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:30.619
 text elements are slightly smaller 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:32.209
 So maybe that's the name 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:35.029
 maybe it's just bigger 

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:37.279
 something more interesting still looks like this 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:39.829
 but now everything has nothing in principle 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:42.319
 to do with what I show them 

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:46.550
 but just wants one more 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:53.299
 small addition to this element is now 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:55.969
 just as credits are displayed and 

00:05:53.299 --> 00:05:57.619
 Although about motion at im face I have 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.589
 the possibility now a so-called 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:02.059
 to put a roll title 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.550
 do that once so that they are in 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:07.659
 to see the preview 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.279
 then this crew would be displayed 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:12.739
 if you have a lot of text right now 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:14.569
 So maybe hundreds of names then 

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:16.939
 it is then necessary that they are the length 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.739
 adjust the menu accordingly that the 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:20.389
 menu then maybe a minute two 

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:22.339
 minutes three minutes and so on 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:26.800
 So here they would go for 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:29.779
 one minute when you enter 100 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.079
 with a click on ok you can again 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:36.769
 back and they still have this 

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:39.289
 link to menu 1 and I 

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:42.820
 leave me the whole thing now 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:45.280
 show that way 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.560
 now comes this main menu here 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.710
 I come to the information and here to the crew 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.020
 get that out and in the beginning you can see 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.880
 nothing at all but then everyone will 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.300
 they were going through, yes, then 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.670
 displayed if the viewer does not know that 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.460
 to be able to display a full menu 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.650
 at any time with back again to the first 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.180
 menu and also seen in the same 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.000
 moment or relax ready 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.950
 he was played again 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.150
 again 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.760
 but you have the choice here 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.410
 at any time to go back and how 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.690
 you have seen this guy 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:23.050
 not in the movie itself on the timeline 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.320
 but actually as an empty menu on 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:29.190
 evening at this end almost optional 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.190
 to have a look at or be shown
