00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.880
 Hey people are doing it again today 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.369
 are made of delicious exotic snoopy 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.109
 bananas from mango and with coconut milk 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.270
 yes, if you want to see how we do it 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.310
 will prepare recipe easy even think about it 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.490
 should the ig metal measuring cup and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.230
 a banana this over a once 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.290
 peel and then ever something small 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.190
 break in here go so wrong one 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.350
 mango peel at once and then 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.879
 the book meat relatively small small 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.219
 rough cut is no matter which 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.890
 Actually, anyway, everything is at one 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.899
 mango we start by giving the mango 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.899
 and cuts once at the core long down 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:09.810
 so it is always so good to be 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:12.960
 you could just waste the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.500
 possibly still cancel sender 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.500
 have it 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.150
 you see their voting rights that can only 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:34.380
 and we'll just go now 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:37.500
 then we'll take a measuring cup 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.320
 a dose of coconut milk I take this 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.560
 Coke with the pretty of coconut 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.950
 share and this coconut milk is too 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 not searched for here is namely only 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:56.210
 coconut water and we are not in it like that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.340
 described how they already divorce but 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.860
 you see, it always forms here 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.850
 such a layering gives everything 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.080
 in here 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.800
 and because the dose does not do what I do 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.800
 you would like to do it differently now 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.810
 oh well and that's just lifting everything 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.900
 You've seen that a bit down 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.830
 with spoon and now we give up for 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.090
 the sweet one teaspoon honey each 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.190
 or in my case nice and dark 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.459
 maple syrup to that still has with 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.260
 caramel note that's why I take the and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.100
 I take a little more flavor 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.030
 some vanilla extract also about 1 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.459
 I can teaspoon this man extra 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.780
 below you linked the infobox resp 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.480
 I find also on my with 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:59.450
 linked to my blog in the shop and now 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.500
 perform once more and then came 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.350
 me so then I have here in 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.690
 Double-walled glass is filled with ice 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.180
 double glass is actually 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.970
 Dimitrenko tracks because it knows maybe 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.890
 different eldebrink old that's why I have 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.230
 this glass simply took me for it 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.430
 decided now I give this 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.750
 loose style here purely so and what 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.739
 Let's make it even more decorate it 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.030
 once if you live something now 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.380
 grated cocoa often has big children 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.910
 ball coconut flakes take now I have 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:42.769
 and we sprinkle 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:48.290
 then on top everyone knows how 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:50.060
 delicious coconut and then we are 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.709

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.519
