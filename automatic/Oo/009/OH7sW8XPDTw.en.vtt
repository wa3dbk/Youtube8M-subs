00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
strikes should be structured not just

the strikes from the top usually two

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
lower arm there are also schools that

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.040 
lower arm there are also schools that
start<00:00:44.590> with<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.890> lower<00:00:45.100> arm<00:00:45.630> strike<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:46.870> rib

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.560 
start with the lower arm strike the rib
area<00:00:47.350> first<00:00:48.060> in<00:00:49.620> my<00:00:50.620> opinion<00:00:51.190> it's<00:00:51.850> better<00:00:52.270> to

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
area first in my opinion it's better to

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.979 
area first in my opinion it's better to
deliver<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.230> strikes<00:00:53.559> to<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.130> limbs<00:00:54.370> first

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
deliver the strikes to the limbs first

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.780 
deliver the strikes to the limbs first
because<00:00:55.989> there<00:00:56.230> is<00:00:56.350> more<00:00:56.590> power<00:00:56.829> in<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.280> upper

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
because there is more power in the upper

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.650 
because there is more power in the upper

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
arms in Slavic practices the strike

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.069 
arms in Slavic practices the strike
initiates<00:01:02.410> from<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:03.010> shoulder<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:04.540> makes<00:01:04.930> a

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
initiates from the shoulder that makes a

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.709 
initiates from the shoulder that makes a
strike<00:01:05.379> more<00:01:05.740> natural<00:01:06.219> and<00:01:06.490> powerful<00:01:07.329> of

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
strike more natural and powerful of

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.580 
strike more natural and powerful of
course<00:01:08.850> depending<00:01:09.850> on<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.119> situation<00:01:10.990> this

course depending on the situation this
can<00:01:11.829> be<00:01:12.009> different<00:01:12.459> therefore<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:14.139> practice

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
can be different therefore we practice

can be different therefore we practice
both<00:01:14.920> variations<00:01:16.350> strikes<00:01:17.350> are<00:01:17.649> delivered<00:01:17.709> by

both variations strikes are delivered by
