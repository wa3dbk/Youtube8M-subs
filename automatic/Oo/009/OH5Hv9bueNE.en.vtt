00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.800 

not<00:01:56.049> yeah<00:01:56.260> and<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:57.280> think<00:01:57.729> it<00:01:58.000> will<00:01:58.150> come<00:01:58.360> up<00:01:58.420> but

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
not yeah and I think it will come up but

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.020 
not yeah and I think it will come up but
I<00:01:58.869> think<00:01:59.170> as<00:01:59.470> this<00:01:59.860> goes<00:02:00.100> on<00:02:00.280> our<00:02:00.580> policy

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
I think as this goes on our policy

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.580 
I think as this goes on our policy
becomes<00:02:01.270> clearer<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.750> clearer<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.110> think<00:02:02.470> it

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
becomes clearer and clearer I think it

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.560 
becomes clearer and clearer I think it
