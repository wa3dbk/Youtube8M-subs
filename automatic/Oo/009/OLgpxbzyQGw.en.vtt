00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello it's marco dr von we find ourselves 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.390
 today for the unpacking video 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.170
 which precedes of course the test video of the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.750
 sony xperia c4 dual a mobile that has been 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.870
 marketed by sony at the client price 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.369
 maximum advised of 349 euros 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.170
 good, of course, it's August 2015 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.400
 when I make this video and we arrive 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.970
 already find it a bit cheaper on 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 the web all the same the sony xperia c4 from 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.949
 to the year not his price would be that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.300
 by his price already one and he considered 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.880
 or maybe considered a way 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.989
 range in terms of specifications of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.370
 we go to the details very quickly 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.450
 today according to the pictograms that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.890
 are at the back of the box but that's 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.829
 especially during the test we will see 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.899
 if this phone answers that to 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.969
 wallace promises he keeps his promises 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.100
 then face before the box what is it 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.140
 we find sony xperia c4 dual so 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.539
 model mark we find a visual of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.890
 front face of the mobile screen is lit 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.140
 always more fun it gives more desire 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.030
 to buy by man it is a question of a 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.609
 dual sim so double sim format nano on 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.739
 see here it's flu kills usim card 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.120
 we can see that it's nano side 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.320
 left of the box nothing on the south the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.500
 legal notice on the right side of the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.510
 serial number and on the bottom of the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.340
 mobile of the box for nothing at all 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.650
 and at the back of the bottom box there is 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.770
 goes the three declinations color white 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.560
 green here to turquoise a bit bitter 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.150
 bluish and black here the lead version is going 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.770
 to have it's white version 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.090
 - you know in a little more fan of the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.280
 white version but it's the one that has 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.750
 decided to send me this version 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.460
 rear photo sensor is an ex dead 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.340
 and that's good rest of the sonic 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.799
 more radios and function 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.299
 improvement of the scion as xloud we have 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.229
 also a logo benefited while the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.610
 phone is a very good 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.799
 way we also find the nfc logo at 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.119
 the back of the mobile can be seen here it 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.740
 is an android phone 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.090
 anyway anyway 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.340
 today sony no longer makes windows 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 phone it does not in any case we have 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.960
 well a certified wi-fi logo it is good 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.869
 wifi processor oak gives you one cooked 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.270
 heart with July 7th chaka photo sensor 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.540
 3 megapixel rear 5 megapixel to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.579
 the front a diagonal of 5.5 inches for 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.100
 the screen so necessarily and the resolution 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.320
 full hd so nothing on the full hd already 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.050
 yes could we say we are of course a 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.340
 mobile trend 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.750
 at the mid-range we will not say high 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.890
 range and top of the mid range because 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.810
 the moving lot the box has already been 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.209
 unpacked I want to thank besides 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.380
 clearly left the tester wanted 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.120
 leave fingerprints for 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.410
 that I can recognize it someday 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.300
 shape anyway we are of course 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.360
 the white version of mobile to mobile 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.220
 who presents the sony stylistic code 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.540
 especially by the side we play with this 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.310
 rounded it's really from the figure of 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.900
 sony style including once again from 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.390
 more with the button is what the camera 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.750
 going to do his little focus is what are we going 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.060
 get there 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.170
 I may not get there you can 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.910
 knew difficult 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.970
 So here we have the little button on / off 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.250
 here typical sony here is the design 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.290
 well sony a mobile that goes anyway 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.880
 a mobile that weighs a bit its weight is 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.830
 in the diagonal necessarily forces you 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.300
 to use at tomorrow there are small 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.739
 style notes that are nice when 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.440
 even on the mobile I like 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.480
 the eyecup around the photo sensor 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.739
 cl is nice I also like this 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.150
 is on the front with a small 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.950
 metal ring around except that he 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.810
 was a little bit embossed so good 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.239
 notes maybe it can protect him so 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.080
 it's not bad here it's not bad alain 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.850
 boil in any case there are some good 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.620
 figures of style and design enough 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.760
 friendly sony but that's it 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.739
 had said it every time you were 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.260
 symphony polluting his head we like 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.820
 the face then in the box that is 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.870
 launch too much little documentation 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.170
 very fast to fast start bed 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.030
 up 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.130
 thanks to testers previous guide 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.150
 quick start that for once and in 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.500
 English necessarily we must have a 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.850
 international version and we do not have the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.200
 French version which I leave very 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.799
 serious in itself so when you buy the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.380
 French version 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.420
 rest assured you have it in French on 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.840
 also find hop I'll try a 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.209
 USB micro USB cable round quite 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.130
 classic standard found 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.260
 the power adapter also carrying 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.090
 the mention green who wants everything 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.380
 simply say that they respond to 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.690
 standards of ecological requirements 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.220
 especially for example he had charge 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.900
 is theoretically the phone when 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.250
 the latter charged says the stop of 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.900
 swing of the game so it's still 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.660
 not bad good the whole thing is packed you 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.960
 imagine it carefully in the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.910
 plastic paper 1 but I notice 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.320
 as we are on a version of the is the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.060
 pedestrian kit was not provided with 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.710
 there is really only for France and the 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.150
 rest of europe so england does 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.100
 not particularly at the level 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.239
 of europe finally you know they have 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.900
 their small demands and their small 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.459
 particularities 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.350
 apparently the English did not feel 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.250
 obliged to put the pedestrian kit for not 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.040
 Anyway, there is one 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.510
 rest assured in France so fast 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.710
 video finally unpacking my half 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.600
 complete rather video presentation 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.700
 very fast of the mobile itself 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.280
 present I recall a design 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.500
 nice but it's good sony 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.330
 taken in hand but use tomorrow 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.390
 it is a fable is and consequent weight 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.670
 still we talk to them about the test 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.990
 a mobile that has been marketed for to 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.050
 its launch in any case taken customers 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.790
 maximum adviser by sony of 349 euros 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.290
