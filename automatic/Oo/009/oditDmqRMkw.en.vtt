00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
video on these but this time we're

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.220 
video on these but this time we're
installing<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:18.119> save<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.690> carbon

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
installing it with my save on carbon

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.650 
installing it with my save on carbon
fiber<00:00:19.439> hood<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.390> there<00:00:21.390> any<00:00:21.570> difference<00:00:22.369> no

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
fiber hood is there any difference no

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.210 
fiber hood is there any difference no
pretty<00:00:24.660> much<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> same<00:00:25.050> tutorial<00:00:25.560> but

pretty much the same tutorial but
there's<00:00:26.789> enough<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.300> difference<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
there's enough of a difference to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.429 
there's enough of a difference to
justify<00:00:28.260> remaking<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.980> tutorial<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.570> let's

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
justify remaking this tutorial so let's

box<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.410> two<00:00:34.680> rods<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.579> brackets<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
box you get two rods for brackets and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.720 
box you get two rods for brackets and
some<00:00:36.780> pins<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> washers<00:00:37.559> try<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> lose

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
some pins and washers try not to lose

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.860 
some pins and washers try not to lose
these<00:00:38.910> pins<00:00:39.180> because<00:00:39.329> they're<00:00:39.660> very

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
these pins because they're very

plastic piece here and bolt it down like
so<00:01:16.010> now<00:01:16.850> starting<00:01:17.300> with<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.480> top<00:01:17.510> first<00:01:18.020> take

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
so now starting with the top first take

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.620 
so now starting with the top first take
one<00:01:18.860> of<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.040> rods<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.520> put<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.090> first<00:01:20.390> ball

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
one of the rods and put the first ball

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.080 
one of the rods and put the first ball
in<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.990> socket<00:01:21.380> now<00:01:22.280> take<00:01:22.520> one<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.760> your<00:01:22.850> pins

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
in the socket now take one of your pins

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.820 
in the socket now take one of your pins
and<00:01:23.300> lock<00:01:23.660> it<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:23.870> place<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.470> ball<00:01:24.650> won't

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
and lock it in place so the ball won't

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.430 
and lock it in place so the ball won't
come<00:01:25.040> out<00:01:25.690> here's<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.780> better<00:01:26.900> look<00:01:27.020> at<00:01:27.260> how<00:01:27.380> to

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
come out here's a better look at how to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.680 
come out here's a better look at how to
insert<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.920> pins<00:01:28.130> you'll<00:01:28.670> notice<00:01:29.000> two<00:01:29.330> little

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
insert the pins you'll notice two little

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.600 
insert the pins you'll notice two little
holes<00:01:29.810> right<00:01:30.080> here<00:01:30.140> stick<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.160> pin<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.430> from

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
holes right here stick the pin in from

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.070 
holes right here stick the pin in from
the<00:01:31.730> bottom<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:32.330> should<00:01:32.510> go<00:01:32.690> through<00:01:32.930> to

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
the bottom and it should go through to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.740 
the bottom and it should go through to
the<00:01:33.200> top<00:01:33.460> then<00:01:34.460> push<00:01:34.850> it<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.360> wraps<00:01:35.630> around

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
the top then push it so it wraps around

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.530 
the top then push it so it wraps around
the<00:01:35.960> rod<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.380> you're<00:01:37.190> all<00:01:37.310> set<00:01:37.550> now<00:01:38.390> we're

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
the rod and you're all set now we're

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.910 
the rod and you're all set now we're
moving<00:01:38.660> on<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.050> bottom<00:01:39.380> part<00:01:39.530> basically

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
moving on to the bottom part basically

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.859 
moving on to the bottom part basically
it's<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.369> same<00:01:40.430> steps<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:41.479> you'll<00:01:41.660> need<00:01:41.810> to

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
it's the same steps but you'll need to

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.260 
it's the same steps but you'll need to
raise<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.290> hood<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.500> little<00:01:42.920> higher<00:01:43.090> also<00:01:44.090> it

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
raise the hood a little higher also it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.609 
raise the hood a little higher also it
helps<00:01:44.390> if<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.690> have<00:01:44.810> another<00:01:45.020> person<00:01:45.470> with

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
helps if you have another person with

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.640 
helps if you have another person with
you<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:45.950> help<00:01:46.100> hold<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:46.520> hood<00:01:46.760> for<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.650> now

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
you to help hold the hood for you now

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.050 
you to help hold the hood for you now
moving<00:01:48.979> on<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.280> driver's<00:01:49.670> side<00:01:49.700> it's

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
moving on to the driver's side it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.240 
moving on to the driver's side it's
basically<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.479> same<00:01:50.750> thing<00:01:50.810> same<00:01:51.530> steps<00:01:51.860> just

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
basically the same thing same steps just

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.080
