00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
things are lettered so I think you just

things are lettered so I think you just
put<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.459> let<00:04:08.700> these<00:04:09.030> things<00:04:09.180> are

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.490 
put the the let these things are
lettered<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.840> think<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.110> just<00:04:10.140> put<00:04:10.380> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
lettered so I think you just put the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.480 
lettered so I think you just put the
lettered<00:04:10.770> one<00:04:10.920> in<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.150> says<00:04:12.330> L<00:04:13.310> put<00:04:14.310> this

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
lettered one in so it says L put this

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:24.939 
lettered one in so it says L put this
like<00:04:14.760> this<00:04:18.080> just<00:04:19.080> slide<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.770> in<00:04:19.920> there<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:21.020> guess
