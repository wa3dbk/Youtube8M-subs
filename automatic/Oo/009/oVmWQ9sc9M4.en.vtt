00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
further but this is kind of the step

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.240 
further but this is kind of the step
that<00:03:48.810> I've<00:03:48.989> stopped<00:03:49.290> at<00:03:49.530> because<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.859> like<00:03:50.069> to

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
this up and to put this part in fast

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.140 
this up and to put this part in fast
motion<00:05:10.620> but<00:05:10.979> it's<00:05:11.099> really<00:05:11.310> simple<00:05:11.639> you<00:05:11.820> just

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
motion but it's really simple you just

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.390 
motion but it's really simple you just
take<00:05:12.330> your<00:05:12.449> paintbrush<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.889> just<00:05:14.099> kind
