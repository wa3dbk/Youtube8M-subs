little force moving the blade you can

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.800 
little force moving the blade you can
see<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.920> blade<00:02:56.130> is<00:02:56.160> not<00:02:56.630> moving<00:02:57.630> that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
see that the blade is not moving that

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.580 
see that the blade is not moving that
much<00:02:59.329> now<00:03:00.329> I'm<00:03:00.420> going<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.660> do<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.930> same<00:03:01.200> thing

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
much now I'm going to do the same thing

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.220 
much now I'm going to do the same thing
to<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:02.090> Maddox<00:03:03.090> I'm<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.660> move<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.019> a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
to this Maddox I'm going to move it a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.530 
to this Maddox I'm going to move it a
little<00:03:04.320> bit<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.519> it's<00:03:06.450> moving<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:07.170> much<00:03:08.540> now

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
little bit and it's moving that much now

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.599 
little bit and it's moving that much now
I'm<00:03:09.690> going<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.079> take<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.890> put<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.370> lot<00:03:11.579> of

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
I'm going to take this and put a lot of

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.370 
I'm going to take this and put a lot of
force<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.299> moving<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.720> blade<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:12.989> see<00:03:13.320> how

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
force and moving the blade and see how

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.170 
force and moving the blade and see how
much<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.739> moved<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:17.040> then<00:03:17.190> I'm<00:03:17.430> going<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.940> do

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
much it moved and then I'm going to do

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.710 
much it moved and then I'm going to do
that<00:03:18.390> with<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.690> one<00:03:19.109> also<00:03:20.000> see<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.120> moves<00:03:21.420> a

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
that with this one also see it moves a

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.880 
that with this one also see it moves a
lot<00:03:22.230> more

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.900 

and<00:03:25.370> after<00:03:25.819> we<00:03:25.970> deploy<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.690> blade

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.760 

there<00:03:32.510> is<00:03:32.780> no<00:03:33.620> up<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.130> down<00:03:34.250> at<00:03:34.670> all<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.770> there

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
there is no up and down at all and there

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.670 
there is no up and down at all and there
is<00:03:37.010> like<00:03:38.470> no<00:03:39.470> flex<00:03:40.160> at<00:03:41.150> all<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:42.260> is<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.500> very

is like no flex at all this is a very
solid<00:03:43.160> solid<00:03:44.150> knife<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:45.620> one<00:03:45.920> there<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.610> some

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
solid solid knife this one there is some

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.040 
solid solid knife this one there is some
side<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.240> side<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:47.870> always<00:03:48.080> had<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.620> and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
side to side it's always had that and

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.900 
side to side it's always had that and
there<00:03:51.050> is<00:03:51.290> no<00:03:51.800> up<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.250> down<00:03:52.370> movement

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
there is no up and down movement

there is no up and down movement
whatsoever<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:54.350> ball<00:03:54.650> lock<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.160> really

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
whatsoever that ball lock it really

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.750 
whatsoever that ball lock it really
locks<00:03:55.700> in<00:03:55.970> there<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:59.300> lock-up

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
locks in there and the lock-up

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.130 
locks in there and the lock-up
percentage<00:04:01.760> you'll<00:04:02.090> see<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:02.990> on<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:05.140> tan

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
percentage you'll see that on the tan

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.850 
percentage you'll see that on the tan
one<00:04:06.730> there's<00:04:07.730> very<00:04:08.240> little<00:04:08.480> space<00:04:09.290> left<00:04:09.680> for

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
one there's very little space left for

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.930 
one there's very little space left for
the<00:04:10.160> ball<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.640> go<00:04:10.790> forward<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.480> lock<00:04:11.720> up<00:04:11.990> so

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
the ball to go forward and lock up so

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.280 
the ball to go forward and lock up so
it's<00:04:13.940> pretty<00:04:14.240> late<00:04:14.510> on<00:04:14.750> lock<00:04:15.020> up<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:16.959> on<00:04:17.959> this

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
it's pretty late on lock up and on this

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.570 
it's pretty late on lock up and on this
one<00:04:18.620> you'll<00:04:19.250> see<00:04:19.520> the<00:04:19.730> gap<00:04:20.000> is<00:04:20.330> much<00:04:20.900> larger<00:04:21.580> so

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
one you'll see the gap is much larger so

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.460 
one you'll see the gap is much larger so
there's<00:04:23.180> much<00:04:23.480> more<00:04:23.690> room<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.140> accommodate

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
there's much more room to accommodate

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.190 
there's much more room to accommodate
breaking<00:04:25.400> in<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.350> we're<00:04:28.480> so<00:04:29.480> it'll<00:04:29.810> be<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:29.960> long

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
breaking in and we're so it'll be a long

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.290 
breaking in and we're so it'll be a long
time<00:04:30.500> for<00:04:30.830> this<00:04:31.010> one<00:04:31.220> sees<00:04:31.460> any<00:04:31.700> up<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.180> down

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
time for this one sees any up and down

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.320 
time for this one sees any up and down
play<00:04:32.600> play<00:04:32.840> whereas<00:04:33.290> this<00:04:33.560> one<00:04:34.180> there's<00:04:35.180> no

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
play play whereas this one there's no

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.800 
play play whereas this one there's no
telling<00:04:37.930> i'm<00:04:38.930> sure<00:04:39.230> it's<00:04:39.970> it's<00:04:40.970> very<00:04:41.330> broken

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
telling i'm sure it's it's very broken

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.080 
telling i'm sure it's it's very broken
in<00:04:41.960> already<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:42.680> i'm<00:04:43.370> sure<00:04:43.550> it's<00:04:43.700> not<00:04:43.850> going<00:04:44.000> to

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
in already so i'm sure it's not going to

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.960 
in already so i'm sure it's not going to
go<00:04:44.180> past<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.780> but<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:46.460> better<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.820> have

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
go past that but it's better to have

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
go past that but it's better to have
more<00:04:47.800> more<00:04:48.800> than<00:04:48.950> enough<00:04:49.220> room<00:04:49.520> for<00:04:49.790> lockup<00:04:50.210> if

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
more more than enough room for lockup if

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.770 
more more than enough room for lockup if
you<00:04:51.169> want<00:04:51.380> to<00:04:51.560> last<00:04:51.770> several<00:04:52.520> years<00:04:53.210> if<00:04:53.660> you

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
you want to last several years if you

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.580 
you want to last several years if you
plan<00:04:53.990> on<00:04:54.200> using<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.650> everyday<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:56.590> another

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
plan on using it everyday and another

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.740 
plan on using it everyday and another
thing<00:04:57.980> I<00:04:58.130> noticed<00:04:58.580> is<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.850> Jinping<00:04:59.810> is<00:05:00.070> done

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
thing I noticed is the Jinping is done

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.860 
thing I noticed is the Jinping is done
better<00:05:02.750> on<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.410> sprint<00:05:03.860> run<00:05:04.480> you'll<00:05:05.480> see<00:05:05.750> it's

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
better on the sprint run you'll see it's

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.430 
better on the sprint run you'll see it's
much<00:05:06.169> more<00:05:06.440> aggressive<00:05:07.010> and<00:05:07.130> sharper<00:05:08.230> rose<00:05:09.230> on

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
much more aggressive and sharper rose on

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.070 
much more aggressive and sharper rose on
the<00:05:09.590> regular<00:05:10.130> Mannix<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:10.910> jumping<00:05:11.510> is<00:05:11.690> there

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
the regular Mannix the jumping is there

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.420 
the regular Mannix the jumping is there
but<00:05:12.680> it's<00:05:12.860> just<00:05:13.220> not<00:05:13.430> as<00:05:14.050> aggressive<00:05:15.160> it<00:05:16.160> does

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
but it's just not as aggressive it does

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.310 
but it's just not as aggressive it does
work<00:05:17.080> but<00:05:18.080> this<00:05:18.530> it<00:05:19.370> locks<00:05:19.700> it<00:05:19.970> in<00:05:20.090> there<00:05:20.320> your

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
see everything else is pretty much the

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.560 
see everything else is pretty much the
same<00:05:50.220> except<00:05:51.220> for<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.490> blade<00:05:51.760> thickness<00:05:52.150> and

same except for the blade thickness and

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.810 
same except for the blade thickness and
shape<00:05:55.140> shape<00:05:56.140> is<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.530> same<00:05:56.770> but<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.190> grinds

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
shape shape is the same but the grinds

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.910 
shape shape is the same but the grinds
are<00:05:57.940> different<00:05:58.390> say<00:05:58.810> full<00:05:59.110> flat<00:05:59.350> grind<00:05:59.650> and
