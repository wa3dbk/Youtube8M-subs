00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.790
 Elite bodybuilders favor the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.590
 biased product view of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.210
 steroids for them it's hard to win 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.720
 in the steroid contest and the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.090
 bodybuilding 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.890
 from mister universe to the boy of 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.560
 next any athlete can be 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.740
 tempted by steroids including the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.740
 best 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.029
 i 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.500
 of all competencies infected by 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.989
 the steroids the tour of france is not 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.989
 neither the oldest nor the most prestigious 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.829
 at the summer Olympics of the year 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.980
 2002 in sydney the American athlete 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.809
 marion jones won five medals the 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.820
 sports columnists crowned her 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.979
 as the best athlete in the world not 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.780
 However, in 2007 he admitted having 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.000
 used steroids while training 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.820
 for summer games 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.150
 his world records were invalidated 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.910
 his medals confiscated at 31 years old 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.490
 one of the most important athletes of 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.490
 world announced its retirement from sport 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.939
 as a coach I want my athletes 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.640
 use steroids well obviously not 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.399
 but as a consumer one demands demands 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.530
 demands the best of the athletes and the 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.469
 athletes will do what they can to make that happen 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.840
 happen and in doing so they start to push 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.729
 your limits and that is a limit that 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.899
 unfortunately it has to do with the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.899
 anabolic steroids 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.040
 for some athletes the reward of the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.530
 victory weighs more than being caught 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.360
 just one year after he floyd 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.370
 withdraw the prize obtained in the tour 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.610
 from france 'the steroids came back 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.180
 in 2007 an important cyclist 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.370
 He was expelled for running into steroids 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.230
 if the athletes use steroids in 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.630
 one of the competitions where more 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.380
 they carry out anti-drug tests where they do not 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.380
 they would use them 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.550
 in a steroid ocean a bunch of 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.650

 a sport infected by steroids 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.730
 these athletes reject steroids 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.710
 both the benefits and the costs and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.320
 nobody knows the costs better than their 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.700

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.400

 contestant number 8 michael my girlfriend 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.410
 the most formidable opponent is here 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.180
 invisible the temptation to win is 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.460
 intoxicant and the steroids are 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.310
 tempting even for a man who 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.770
 they almost killed 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.080
 and I had to go through a stroke 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.770
 an infarct hepatic disorders 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.770
 mental disorders mental anguish but 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.530
 I would do it again if I heard the 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.750
 attraction that generates for a moment 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.140
 spirit was the best on the planet earth 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.349
 number one is hard not to have that in 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.349
 account 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.230
 show me at your long island gym 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.190
 mija lic trains a new generation of 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.400
 bodybuilders to do what 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.440
 he tells them not what he did these 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.210
 guys and these adults need a 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.980
 leader someone who has lived something like this 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.840
 someone to take us to the place where 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.840
 they want to go without getting sick or hurt 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.439
 endure pain avoid embarrassment what 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.390
 What I try to do is teach the 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.299
 subject how to exercise and have the level 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.709
 muscle that your genetics allows you and you 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.709
 I understand that it will not go any further 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.400
 you're missing another 10 I'm looking at those 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.780
 muscles go on like this is done 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.360
 it's hard for them to win in the 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.440
 steroid contest and in the 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.940
 bodybuilding but they can win 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.120
 cleanly at certain levels of 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.090
 professional golf competitions at 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.330
 bodybuilding but after that no 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.330
 there is more 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.770
 a harsh reality for athletes to 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.230
 many steroids can be 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.810
 valuable the difference between a salary 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.080
 and a fortune between mediocrity and 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.180
 stardom one of our patients what 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.650
 summed up in this because I must be clear 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.650
 that when I can be superman 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.450
 If there was a drug that would allow 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.820
 the journalist earning a pulitzer or me 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.980
 win me the Nobel prize I'm sure that 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.930
 they would be injecting me here in the 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.930
 Pennsylvania State University 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.259
 other experts blame someone else I think 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.240
 that people blame us 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.800
 spectators are at fault 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.289
 we want to see numbers we want to see 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.229
 performance we want to see more home runs 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.939
 we want to see faster races the 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:31.979
 reality is that the public wants 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:31.979
 our athletes use steroids 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.290
 while the debate continues and the 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.380
 science seeks answers a fact 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.350
 alarming is still true the use of 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:48.360
 steroids is spreading and it's not going to 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.360
 disappear in the near future
