00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
other products that I'll show you that

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.420 
other products that I'll show you that
is<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> constant<00:02:36.900> characteristic<00:02:37.770> they<00:02:38.250> don't

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
is a constant characteristic they don't

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.040

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
obviously you expect something that is a

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.280 
obviously you expect something that is a
heavier<00:05:19.320> cream<00:05:20.000> although<00:05:21.000> it's<00:05:21.240> not<00:05:21.360> like<00:05:22.080> the

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:02.529 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.219 

will<00:06:03.129> fully<00:06:03.429> cover<00:06:03.759> that<00:06:04.059> mole<00:06:04.359> or<00:06:04.629> that<00:06:04.839> spot

skin is really just using the warmth of
your<00:06:47.949> fingers<00:06:48.429> because<00:06:48.789> it's<00:06:48.969> a<00:06:49.059> very<00:06:49.089> heavy

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:49.629 
your fingers because it's a very heavy

your<00:06:53.289> skin<00:06:53.709> though<00:06:53.889> it<00:06:54.069> doesn't<00:06:54.279> give<00:06:54.909> you

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:55.059 
your skin though it doesn't give you
