00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639

choice but let's say your budget needs
to<00:07:12.729> be<00:07:12.820> around<00:07:13.150> 400<00:07:13.449> dollars<00:07:13.960> or<00:07:14.110> less<00:07:14.139> then

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
to be around 400 dollars or less then

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.560 
to be around 400 dollars or less then
you'd<00:07:15.160> want<00:07:15.340> to<00:07:15.400> decide<00:07:15.699> between<00:07:15.880> the<00:07:16.210> sound

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 
you'd want to decide between the sound

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.960 
you'd want to decide between the sound
base<00:07:16.810> and<00:07:17.080> sound<00:07:17.500> bar<00:07:17.740> setup<00:07:18.130> if<00:07:18.310> having

base and sound bar setup if having

base and sound bar setup if having
something<00:07:19.270> as<00:07:19.389> compact<00:07:19.900> as<00:07:20.050> possible<00:07:20.139> as<00:07:20.740> the

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
something as compact as possible as the

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.590 
something as compact as possible as the
bigger<00:07:21.010> priority<00:07:21.490> then<00:07:21.940> the<00:07:22.120> sound<00:07:22.389> base

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:22.600 
bigger priority then the sound base

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.570 
bigger priority then the sound base
would<00:07:22.750> be<00:07:22.810> the<00:07:22.900> way<00:07:23.050> to<00:07:23.080> go<00:07:23.320> otherwise<00:07:23.979> if<00:07:24.370> it's

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580 
would be the way to go otherwise if it's

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.790 
would be the way to go otherwise if it's
more<00:07:24.820> about<00:07:24.970> sound<00:07:25.360> quality<00:07:25.479> then<00:07:26.350> it<00:07:26.500> will<00:07:26.620> be

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 
more about sound quality then it will be

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.529 
more about sound quality then it will be
between<00:07:27.070> the<00:07:27.250> two<00:07:27.280> different<00:07:27.550> sound<00:07:28.000> bars<00:07:28.240> and

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:28.539 
between the two different sound bars and

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:30.510 
between the two different sound bars and
as<00:07:28.660> I<00:07:29.020> mentioned<00:07:29.350> earlier<00:07:29.680> it's<00:07:29.919> then<00:07:30.190> just<00:07:30.430> a

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
as I mentioned earlier it's then just a

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.860 
as I mentioned earlier it's then just a
matter<00:07:30.699> of<00:07:30.789> whether<00:07:31.240> you<00:07:31.389> want<00:07:31.600> the<00:07:31.690> best

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:31.870 
matter of whether you want the best

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.439 
matter of whether you want the best
sounding<00:07:32.260> sound<00:07:32.620> bar<00:07:32.830> or<00:07:33.039> the<00:07:33.760> more<00:07:33.940> immersive

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449 
sounding sound bar or the more immersive

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.960 
sounding sound bar or the more immersive
sound<00:07:34.960> bar<00:07:35.199> speaker<00:07:35.560> system<00:07:35.919> so<00:07:36.639> ultimately

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:36.970 
sound bar speaker system so ultimately

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.089 
sound bar speaker system so ultimately
you<00:07:37.630> can't<00:07:38.020> go<00:07:38.229> wrong<00:07:38.440> with<00:07:38.500> any<00:07:38.710> of<00:07:38.979> these

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:39.099 
you can't go wrong with any of these

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:40.620 
you can't go wrong with any of these
choices<00:07:39.370> as<00:07:39.789> they're<00:07:40.090> all<00:07:40.240> outstanding
