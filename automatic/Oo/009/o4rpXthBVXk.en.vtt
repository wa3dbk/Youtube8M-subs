Irwin coolant but the coolant is really
expensive<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:46.500> much<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.070> take<00:01:47.280> my

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
expensive and as much as I take my

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.710 
expensive and as much as I take my
computer<00:01:47.759> apart<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.399> mean<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.689> $20<00:01:51.689> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
computer apart it's I mean that's $20 a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.469 
computer apart it's I mean that's $20 a
bottle<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.299> went

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
bottle so you know I just I just went

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.830 
bottle so you know I just I just went
with<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.840> distilled<00:01:55.409> water<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:57.439> UV<00:01:58.439> red

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
with the distilled water and UV red

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.920 
with the distilled water and UV red
tubing<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:04.189> you<00:02:05.189> know<00:02:05.310> also<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:06.060> noticed

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
tubing here so you know also I noticed

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.830 
tubing here so you know also I noticed
that<00:02:07.170> when<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.350> drained<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:09.209> swapped<00:02:09.629> out

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that when I drained it and swapped out

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.910 
that when I drained it and swapped out
every<00:02:10.200> swapped<00:02:10.619> everything<00:02:10.979> out

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
every swapped everything out

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.280 
every swapped everything out
or<00:02:12.099> one<00:02:12.280> left<00:02:12.550> like<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.849> red<00:02:13.150> like<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> residue

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
or one left like a red like a residue

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.280 
or one left like a red like a residue
inside<00:02:14.709> my<00:02:15.190> tubing<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.930> I'm<00:02:17.020> sure<00:02:17.260> that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
inside my tubing so I'm sure that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.470 
inside my tubing so I'm sure that
residue<00:02:17.980> was<00:02:18.250> probably<00:02:18.790> inside<00:02:19.209> all<00:02:19.360> my

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
residue was probably inside all my

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.160 
residue was probably inside all my
blocks<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.110> everything<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:22.000> flushed<00:02:22.360> out<00:02:22.569> my

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
blocks and everything it flushed out my

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.490 
blocks and everything it flushed out my
blocks<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.830> my<00:02:24.390> old<00:02:25.390> radiator<00:02:25.989> but<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.410> know

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
blocks and my old radiator but you know

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.059 
blocks and my old radiator but you know
I<00:02:26.560> might<00:02:26.739> would<00:02:26.800> use<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.160> anymore<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:30.010> know

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
I might would use it anymore so you know

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.110 
I might would use it anymore so you know
that's<00:02:30.280> another<00:02:30.520> reason<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.850> don't<00:02:30.880> really

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
that's another reason I don't really

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:40.410 
that's another reason I don't really
want<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.360> use<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.690> stuff<00:02:38.190> as<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.489> had<00:02:40.030> shown

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
want to use this stuff as I had shown

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.930 
want to use this stuff as I had shown
you<00:02:40.660> guys<00:02:41.019> before<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.830> my<00:02:41.950> previous<00:02:41.980> videos<00:02:42.730> is

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
you guys before in my previous videos is

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.550 
you guys before in my previous videos is
the<00:02:42.970> switch<00:02:43.480> here<00:02:45.180> down<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.450> 5<00:02:46.720> volts<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.350> then

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
the switch here down is 5 volts and then

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.720 
the switch here down is 5 volts and then
if<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.769> flip<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.100> up<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:50.260> 12<00:02:50.620> volts<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.220> these<00:02:51.400> 3

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
if I flip it up it's 12 volts to these 3

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.000 
if I flip it up it's 12 volts to these 3
fans<00:02:52.030> at<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.019> top<00:02:53.260> here<00:02:55.380> basically<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.739> 12

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
fans at the top here basically the 12

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.009 
fans at the top here basically the 12
volt<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.459> mean<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:57.819> puts<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.540> fans<00:02:58.780> of

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
volt I mean it just puts the fans of

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.820 
volt I mean it just puts the fans of
maximum<00:03:00.180> speed<00:03:01.209> these<00:03:01.900> fans<00:03:02.230> are<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.650> inner

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830

double-sided<00:05:29.870> 3m<00:05:30.080> tape<00:05:31.749> so<00:05:32.749> you<00:05:32.779> know<00:05:33.139> I<00:05:33.169> just

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:33.439 
double-sided 3m tape so you know I just

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.159 
double-sided 3m tape so you know I just
you<00:05:33.710> know<00:05:33.800> pull<00:05:34.039> it<00:05:34.129> out<00:05:34.389> you<00:05:35.389> know<00:05:35.509> here<00:05:35.779> take

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
you know pull it out you know here take

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.749 
you know pull it out you know here take
off<00:05:36.319> the<00:05:36.499> tube<00:05:36.740> and<00:05:37.009> the<00:05:37.099> water<00:05:37.310> just<00:05:37.580> drains

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
off the tube and the water just drains

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.420 
off the tube and the water just drains
out<00:05:38.150> real<00:05:38.479> easy<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:41.060> comes<00:05:41.659> out<00:05:41.870> of<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.080> pump

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
out real easy so comes out of the pump

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.709 
out real easy so comes out of the pump
up<00:05:43.430> to<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:43.759> radiator<00:05:44.379> and<00:05:45.379> then<00:05:46.240> in<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.479> block

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
up to the radiator and then in the block

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.760 
up to the radiator and then in the block
back<00:05:48.289> in<00:05:48.529> the<00:05:48.589> ring<00:05:48.860> with<00:05:49.460> reservoir<00:05:50.770> how

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
back in the ring with reservoir how

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.019 
back in the ring with reservoir how
might<00:05:52.009> amps<00:05:52.689> with<00:05:53.689> the<00:05:53.870> XS<00:05:54.560> PC<00:05:55.029> radiator

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:56.029 
might amps with the XS PC radiator

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.589 
might amps with the XS PC radiator
compared<00:05:56.779> to<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.050> 240<00:05:57.800> Black<00:05:58.520> Ice<00:05:58.699> GT<00:05:59.149> stealth

compared to the 240 Black Ice GT stealth
we've<00:06:00.319> dropped<00:06:00.560> like<00:06:00.860> 10<00:06:01.129> degrees<00:06:03.009> it's

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
we've dropped like 10 degrees it's

we've dropped like 10 degrees it's
raining<00:06:04.339> is<00:06:04.460> a<00:06:04.550> lot<00:06:05.089> quieter<00:06:05.710> as<00:06:06.710> far<00:06:06.949> as

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
raining is a lot quieter as far as

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.980 
raining is a lot quieter as far as
pushing<00:06:07.399> air<00:06:07.699> through<00:06:07.729> it<00:06:08.979> so<00:06:09.979> you<00:06:10.009> know<00:06:10.399> I

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
pushing air through it so you know I

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.309 
pushing air through it so you know I
definitely<00:06:11.990> happy<00:06:12.620> with<00:06:12.800> this<00:06:12.949> build<00:06:13.659> I<00:06:14.659> might

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
definitely happy with this build I might

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.540 
definitely happy with this build I might
even<00:06:16.419> buy<00:06:17.419> a<00:06:17.449> water<00:06:17.779> block<00:06:18.050> for<00:06:18.319> this<00:06:18.439> 570<00:06:19.339> I

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
even buy a water block for this 570 I

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.559 
even buy a water block for this 570 I
don't<00:06:20.000> know<00:06:20.149> yet<00:06:20.389> I<00:06:20.719> mean<00:06:21.580> it<00:06:22.580> does<00:06:22.849> fine<00:06:23.180> and<00:06:23.509> I

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:25.189 
don't really do a lot of overclocking on

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:29.709 
don't really do a lot of overclocking on
the<00:06:25.310> cards<00:06:25.789> so<00:06:27.339> it<00:06:28.339> I<00:06:28.639> mean<00:06:28.789> if<00:06:28.969> I<00:06:29.089> did<00:06:29.300> I<00:06:29.330> would

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:29.719 
the cards so it I mean if I did I would

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:33.459
