 that came out is to paint is 19.03 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.250
 point 15 and well before talking about 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.440
 the game I want to invite you to 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.840
 join this page that believes that I believe 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.080
 only one who believes us that to the game 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.160
 so that we can play it online 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.100
 and apart from that he also wants 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.620
 invite them to these groups this he believed 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:46.600
 30 this one the chronic and that already 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.190
 we created between three friends and I was worth 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.180
 the groups are going to be that they can 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.730
 create as I tell them I can agree 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.350
 with other people to play games 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.730

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.140
 post your images as you can see 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.460
 here your images your videos and your doubts 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.320
 and they can also do it on the page 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.780
 although the page would believe me that is more 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.740
 intended to inform about what 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.470
 new game news and information and 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.360
 I hope to be one and already leaving this topic 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.880
 apart let's minimize down here and 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.710
 let's talk about the game is worth before 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.100
 of this version came out a version that is 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.510
 the 09 03 15 as you can see here but the 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.120
 truth there are not many changes so 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.980
 if not upload or video 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.820
 on how to install that theme because 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.680
 well there was already one of this 04 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.200
 but in the latter and there are several 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.240
 changes so I wanted to show you what 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.670
 first is that when they go install the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.370
 game is going will not give them option 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.110
 that they choose the location of the game at 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.200
 then automatically they are going to 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.490
 install on the local disk itself and here it 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.020
 is going to create a folder that is going to 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.020
 call is to paint is in case 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.190
 want to change the route or move the game 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.620
 all they have to do is 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.520
 select the folder and give it control 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.790
 x to cut and stick it where they want 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.650
 OK 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.200
 apart from that I also wanted to inform you 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.780
 that or at least for those who saw my 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.220
 previous video of the how-to tutorial 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.960
 install already this topic I had them 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.480
 left some mods 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.550
 so they can download and remove 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.110
 more profit to the game what to spend with 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.030
 this version is that those maps that I 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.710
 I had let them know what to look for 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.960
 here 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.300
 to games 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.730
 for home as I said those maps that 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.250
 I had left them in that in that video not 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.390
 they will be compatible with this version 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.910
 these who are here do not do they are not going to 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.590
 be compatible with this because the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.030
 I really have no idea 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.020
 The fact is that they are not compatible 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.290
 what 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:52.210
 this time, it 's the favor of 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.150
 pass me a 60 pack of 60 sorry 59 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.620
 maps is that they only work in this 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.140
 version is worth then here as they 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.960
 can see are more or less from here yes 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.650
 although up 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.090
 over here then eleven are all these 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.820
 those who are going to come in the pack are worth 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.830
 all the links are going to find them in 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.910
 the description of the video 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.090
 the weight of the heavy maps 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.280
 compressed they weigh 7 gigas around and 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.290
 decompressed weigh 25 gigs worth 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.420
 so if in case they go to 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.130
 download go away a good 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.500
 space is worth 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.740
 the download of the 59 maps come by 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.720
 a torrent file and 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.060
 by obligation they will have to have the 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.550
 torrent is worth separate I also give them 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.300
 I wanted to inform you that I am doing 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.970
 before this version a pack of cars and 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.740
 on maps as you can see here but 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.720
 as necessary they are compatible as 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.730
 I'm going to leave them they're going to leave 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.230
 who do not want to change the version or 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.060
 at least want to keep several 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.800
 Versions of various versions of the game 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.540
 ok then here are 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.260
 are 20 maps 20 22 22 maps is worth it because 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.989
 this one that is here counts for 3 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.090
 and apart from that they will leave a pack 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.950
 of cars or at least the ones that I have to 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.750
 this works in all versions already 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.819
 I tested them also on the new one in that 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.280
 last in this that will give you also 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.780
 in the description and they work 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.620
 perfectly the cars what not 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.150
 it works are the old maps but the 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.639
 new and so it's your decision 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.240
 and if they want to change and this whole issue 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.949
 it then good and not being more them 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.440
