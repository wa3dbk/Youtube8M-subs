00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
yeah this is pretty good and its really

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.810 
yeah this is pretty good and its really
useful<00:03:13.450> even<00:03:14.350> when<00:03:14.710> I'm<00:03:14.830> playing<00:03:15.100> drunk<00:03:15.580> right

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
useful even when I'm playing drunk right

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
here you can see um just by putting this

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.780 
here you can see um just by putting this
in<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.110> cancels<00:03:20.560> out<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.680> lot<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.130> noises<00:03:21.550> and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
in it cancels out a lot of noises and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.510 
in it cancels out a lot of noises and
it's<00:03:24.790> really<00:03:25.350> useful<00:03:26.350> when<00:03:26.830> i<00:03:26.950> print<00:03:27.160> playing

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520

would barely hear the drums when i'm
playing<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.030> it's<00:03:34.870> really<00:03:35.140> good<00:03:36.600> um<00:03:37.600> it's

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
playing it so it's really good um it's

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.070 
playing it so it's really good um it's
pretty<00:03:38.320> much<00:03:38.440> it's<00:03:38.830> something<00:03:39.670> very<00:03:40.080> special

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
pretty much it's something very special

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.470 
pretty much it's something very special
but<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.530> is<00:03:41.680> special<00:03:42.160> um<00:03:42.400> it's<00:03:42.940> really<00:03:43.300> good

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
but it is special um it's really good

cancelling<00:03:48.550> year<00:03:48.730> but<00:03:48.880> but<00:03:49.810> in<00:03:49.960> Japan<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.320> think

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
cancelling year but but in Japan I think

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.100 
cancelling year but but in Japan I think
this<00:03:50.740> is<00:03:50.800> pretty<00:03:51.130> old<00:03:51.400> because<00:03:51.850> my<00:03:52.240> grandma

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
this is pretty old because my grandma

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.800 
this is pretty old because my grandma
she<00:03:53.500> bought<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.460> for<00:03:54.700> me<00:03:54.820> when<00:03:55.300> she<00:03:55.450> went<00:03:55.690> to

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
she bought it for me when she went to

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.750 
she bought it for me when she went to
the<00:03:55.840> local<00:03:57.240> electronics<00:03:58.240> or<00:03:59.310> they<00:04:00.310> asked<00:04:00.730> for

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
the local electronics or they asked for

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.900 
the local electronics or they asked for
it<00:04:01.030> but<00:04:01.240> then<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:02.050> people<00:04:02.590> said<00:04:02.770> that<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
it but then the people said that the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.910 
it but then the people said that the
employee<00:04:04.210> said<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:04.600> they<00:04:05.260> don't<00:04:05.770> know<00:04:05.830> if

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
employee said that they don't know if

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.710 
employee said that they don't know if
they<00:04:06.040> have<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.550> then<00:04:06.640> when<00:04:06.820> they<00:04:06.970> went<00:04:07.600> to

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
they have it and then when they went to

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.620 
they have it and then when they went to
in<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.470> back<00:04:08.680> storage<00:04:09.430> room<00:04:09.730> they<00:04:10.270> only<00:04:10.390> found

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
in the back storage room they only found

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.900 
in the back storage room they only found
one<00:04:10.840> left<00:04:11.290> so<00:04:11.770> I<00:04:11.800> was<00:04:11.980> pretty<00:04:12.190> lucky<00:04:12.460> women

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
one left so I was pretty lucky women

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.790 
one left so I was pretty lucky women
about<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.270> so<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:13.750> think<00:04:14.110> there's<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.560> newer

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
about this so I think there's a newer

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.720 
about this so I think there's a newer
version<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.489> this<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.799> they<00:04:18.130> probably<00:04:18.370> have

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
version of this so they probably have

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.110 
version of this so they probably have
less<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:20.650> yeah<00:04:20.890> well<00:04:21.400> that's<00:04:21.700> pretty<00:04:21.910> much<00:04:22.060> it

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
less so yeah well that's pretty much it

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
less so yeah well that's pretty much it
and<00:04:22.510> I<00:04:22.630> read<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:24.450> four<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:25.600> half<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.990> five

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
and I read this four and a half to five

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.550 
and I read this four and a half to five
stars<00:04:26.590> as<00:04:27.180> it's<00:04:28.180> good<00:04:28.450> for<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.960> prices<00:04:29.410> on

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
stars as it's good for the prices on

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.000 
stars as it's good for the prices on
their<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.740> hundred<00:04:30.040> bucks<00:04:30.419> reasonable<00:04:31.419> price

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
their a hundred bucks reasonable price

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.909

good<00:04:33.010> pair<00:04:33.310> of<00:04:33.340> earbuds<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:34.180> yeah<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:35.110> do

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
good pair of earbuds and yeah I do

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.020 
good pair of earbuds and yeah I do
recommend<00:04:36.340> this<00:04:36.640> but<00:04:36.910> one<00:04:37.690> downside<00:04:38.200> is<00:04:38.440> the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
recommend this but one downside is the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.250 
recommend this but one downside is the
big<00:04:41.370> noise<00:04:42.370> cancelling<00:04:42.940> device<00:04:43.300> thing<00:04:43.630> so

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
big noise cancelling device thing so

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.200 
big noise cancelling device thing so
when<00:04:45.070> you're<00:04:45.160> carrying<00:04:45.520> around<00:04:45.640> it<00:04:46.000> can

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
when you're carrying around it can

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.560 
when you're carrying around it can
sometimes<00:04:47.140> fall<00:04:47.650> off<00:04:47.860> if<00:04:48.010> we're<00:04:48.220> hanging<00:04:49.090> it

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
sometimes fall off if we're hanging it

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.470 
sometimes fall off if we're hanging it
like<00:04:50.110> this<00:04:50.470> when<00:04:51.190> you're<00:04:51.340> listening<00:04:51.550> then

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
like this when you're listening then

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.140 
like this when you're listening then
you're<00:04:52.660> hanging<00:04:53.080> this<00:04:53.230> down<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:54.820> would

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
you're hanging this down it would

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150 
you're hanging this down it would
sometimes<00:04:55.660> fall<00:04:55.960> off<00:04:56.169> so<00:04:56.410> that<00:04:56.440> gets<00:04:56.770> all<00:04:56.980> it

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
sometimes fall off so that gets all it

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.760 
sometimes fall off so that gets all it
online<00:04:57.310> but<00:04:57.790> overall<00:04:58.180> it's<00:04:58.480> really<00:04:58.720> good<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:59.140> do

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
online but overall it's really good I do

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.760 
online but overall it's really good I do
recommend<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.490> so<00:05:01.110> yeah<00:05:02.880> it's<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.770> radius

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
recommend it so yeah it's the radius

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.840 
recommend it so yeah it's the radius
