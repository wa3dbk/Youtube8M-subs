of<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:51.430> bearing<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.230> good<00:00:53.380> idea<00:00:53.500> not<00:00:53.800> to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
of the bearing it's a good idea not to

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.730 
of the bearing it's a good idea not to
fully<00:00:54.190> disassemble<00:00:54.970> it<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.440> have<00:00:56.590> it

off<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.860> there<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.280> go<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:07.210> is<00:01:07.240> how<00:01:07.630> you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
off and there you go that is how you

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.270 
off and there you go that is how you
pull<00:01:07.960> one<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.140> those<00:01:08.200> out<00:01:08.410> as<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:08.979> can<00:01:09.100> see<00:01:09.220> you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
pull one of those out as you can see you

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.480 
pull one of those out as you can see you
have<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.460> seal<00:01:09.700> inside<00:01:10.090> here<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:11.560> washer<00:01:12.310> and

I<00:02:57.019> think<00:02:57.470> that's<00:02:57.620> by<00:02:57.769> design<00:03:03.220> alright<00:03:04.220> go

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
I think that's by design alright go

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.569 
I think that's by design alright go
ahead<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.269> finish<00:03:05.570> off<00:03:05.900> my<00:03:06.170> last<00:03:06.440> bolt<00:03:07.100> there
