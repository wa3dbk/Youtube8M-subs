minutes<00:03:47.900> short<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.560> then<00:03:49.160> take<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.489> out

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
minutes short of that then take it out

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
and cook it in pasta sauce itself and

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.860 
and cook it in pasta sauce itself and
that's<00:03:52.700> when<00:03:52.970> it's<00:03:53.120> going<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.359> absorb<00:03:53.630> what's

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
that's when it's going to absorb what's

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.270 
that's when it's going to absorb what's
happening<00:03:54.230> right<00:03:54.350> now<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.650> that<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.859> pasta<00:03:55.190> is

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
happening right now is that the pasta is

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.920 
happening right now is that the pasta is
now<00:03:55.400> becoming<00:03:55.700> softer<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.209> softer<00:03:56.329> it's

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
now becoming softer and softer it's

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.660 
now becoming softer and softer it's
creating<00:03:57.350> an<00:03:57.440> environment<00:03:57.709> where<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.459> will

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
creating an environment where it will

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.520 
creating an environment where it will
start<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.060> absorb<00:03:59.389> and<00:03:59.690> absorb<00:03:59.989> even<00:04:00.290> more<00:04:00.440> of

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
start to absorb and absorb even more of

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.050 
start to absorb and absorb even more of
the<00:04:00.620> water<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.040> then<00:04:01.489> when<00:04:01.639> it<00:04:01.760> starts<00:04:02.000> to

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
the water and then when it starts to

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.430 
the water and then when it starts to
absorb<00:04:02.389> the<00:04:02.480> sauce<00:04:02.690> in<00:04:02.900> here<00:04:03.019> you'll<00:04:03.170> see<00:04:03.319> that

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
absorb the sauce in here you'll see that

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.449 
absorb the sauce in here you'll see that
the<00:04:03.590> whole<00:04:03.709> thing<00:04:03.889> comes<00:04:04.069> together<00:04:04.220> and

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
the whole thing comes together and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.250 
the whole thing comes together and
become<00:04:04.700> something<00:04:04.910> really<00:04:05.209> special<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:06.139> I'm
