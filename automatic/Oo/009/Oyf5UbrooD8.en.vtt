00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.100 
the bruin thingamajig you can do it on
this<00:00:38.250> I'd<00:00:38.969> say<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.600> whatever<00:00:39.809> I'll

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
this I'd say you know what whatever I'll

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
this I'd say you know what whatever I'll
just<00:00:40.140> make<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> new<00:00:40.590> video<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:41.550> apparently

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
just make a new video because apparently

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.069 
just make a new video because apparently
they<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.300> they're<00:00:42.540> too<00:00:42.690> lazy<00:00:42.840> to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
they don't know they're too lazy to

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.160 
they don't know they're too lazy to
search<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:44.489> bastards<00:00:45.059> alright<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
search you bastards alright so the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.139 
search you bastards alright so the
concept<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.680> very<00:00:46.739> simple<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.550> how<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> place

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
concept is very simple it's how to place

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.790 
concept is very simple it's how to place
I<00:00:48.360> don't<00:00:48.539> friends<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.930> things<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.350> basically

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
I don't friends on things that basically

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.029 
I don't friends on things that basically
when<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.070> click<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.550> them<00:00:50.870> like<00:00:51.870> they<00:00:52.559> enable

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
when you click on them like they enable

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
when you click on them like they enable
the<00:00:53.160> item<00:00:53.489> rights<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> can't<00:00:54.780> place

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the item rights it's like I can't place

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
the item rights it's like I can't place
nine<00:00:55.260> frame<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:56.360> furnaces<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:58.289> thing<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
nine frame I furnaces that thing now it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.849 
nine frame I furnaces that thing now it
does<00:01:00.059> work<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.690> survival<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.530> course<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
does work in a survival of course I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.700 
does work in a survival of course I
tested<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:02.699> that's<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> whole<00:01:03.059> point

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
tested it because that's the whole point

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.890 
tested it because that's the whole point
um<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.570> know<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.869> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
um but you see that you know all of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.620 
um but you see that you know all of
these<00:01:07.080> things<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> left<00:01:07.830> click<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.280> them

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
these things if you left click on them

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.420 
these things if you left click on them
like<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.810> can't<00:01:10.020> put<00:01:10.200> an<00:01:10.320> item<00:01:10.770> frame<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.280> them

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
like you can't put an item frame on them

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.630 
like you can't put an item frame on them
okay<00:01:12.110> but<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.610> i

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
okay but you can that what you can so i

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.090 
okay but you can that what you can so i
did<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.509> survival<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.200> glass<00:01:16.500> obviously

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
did it in survival with glass obviously

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.600 
did it in survival with glass obviously
that's<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.670> most<00:01:17.820> cost-effective<00:01:18.270> way

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
that's not the most cost-effective way

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.800 
that's not the most cost-effective way
but<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.119> anything<00:01:21.509> so

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
but you can do it with anything so

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.109 
but you can do it with anything so
basically<00:01:22.320> i'm<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.009> creative<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.850> it'll<00:01:24.030> be

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
basically i'm in creative so it'll be

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.450 
basically i'm in creative so it'll be
very<00:01:24.299> very<00:01:24.540> simple<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:24.990> me<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.799> i

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
very very simple for me to do it so i

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.550 
very very simple for me to do it so i
don't<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.020> everything

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
don't know that it's like everything

see this room look sort of the old one
that's<00:03:07.099> when<00:03:07.219> I<00:03:07.250> did<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.609> other<00:03:07.639> video<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.150> you

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
that's when I did the other video if you

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.899 
that's when I did the other video if you
put<00:03:08.419> a<00:03:08.449> block<00:03:08.659> in<00:03:08.810> front<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:09.139> it<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:10.400> normally

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
put a block in front of it that normally

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.229 
put a block in front of it that normally
messes<00:03:11.269> it<00:03:11.419> up<00:03:12.370> well<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.400> guess<00:03:13.609> not<00:03:13.639> I<00:03:13.909> wants<00:03:14.180> to

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
messes it up well I guess not I wants to

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.949 
messes it up well I guess not I wants to
be<00:03:14.359> too<00:03:17.889> weird<00:03:18.889> maybe<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:20.239> was<00:03:20.599> doing<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.870> with

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
be too weird maybe I was doing it with

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.449 
be too weird maybe I was doing it with
glass<00:03:21.229> again<00:03:21.560> when<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.739> was<00:03:21.859> doing<00:03:22.280> and

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
glass again when I was doing and

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.490 
glass again when I was doing and
survival<00:03:23.000> maybe<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:23.449> because<00:03:23.599> it<00:03:24.169> kind<00:03:24.439> of

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
survival maybe it's because it kind of

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.849 
survival maybe it's because it kind of
like<00:03:24.739> goes<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:26.599> it's<00:03:26.930> visible<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.739> then
