 when to always make first step 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.820
 Brigadier is only to separate the Brigadier 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.400
 So we can continue with the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.619

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.140
 Today, he is my friend. 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.790
 Business run the stove or else 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 what are we going to do we stay here 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.549
 our fire 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.500
 we put our two cans of 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.680
 condensed milk in the pan 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.860
 may already be at once here the butter 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.060

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.310
 We'll keep stirring it up. 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.960
 from that point of Brigadier that when 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.850
 I was coming back from the pan 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.079

 I bet 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.920
 well here we have now reached the 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.200
 point that we also need not to 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.210
 start to loosen the pan from the sides 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.710
 people can even see the bottom of the pan 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.960
 if you spin faster 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.080
 This is the point that we need then. 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.000
 We'll turn the fire off and go outside. 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.890
