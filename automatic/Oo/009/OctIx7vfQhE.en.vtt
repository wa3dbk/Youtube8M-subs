00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.100
Hi and welcome to The Vegan Corner.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.490
When it comes to vegan cheese, it’s
fair to say we’re not 100% happy

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.790
with what the world has to offer at the moment.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.860
However, there is one cheese that
can be mimicked quite well,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.140
and that is mozzarella.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.780
We’re taking advantage of the properties
of starch to obtain not one,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.150
but four soft and meltable
mozzarella-like cheeses.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.000
And did we mention they’re quite delicious?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.020
The ingredient list is in the description
below the video.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.940
To begin with, place the ingredients
into the jug of a blender,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.340
and blend at medium to high speed
for roughly 30 seconds

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.680
or until you obtain a smooth liquid.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.130
The kind of mozzarella we are going to
make is perfectly suited to be used

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.940
for pizzas and for all of those dishes
that require a good-looking layer

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.030
of melted cheese.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.270
So if you came here looking for a
way to fix a caprese salad,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.660
you are in the wrong place.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.980
Does this cheese taste like real mozzarella?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.810
Not really, but it is delightful

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.930
and it has a consistency and a
mouth feel to die for.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.800
I’m using tofu to obtain the
creamiest result possible

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.340
but there are at least 7 other good
options to replace the tofu

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.480
if you’d rather use them,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.480
and you will find them listed below the video.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.810
Some of these options are not low-fat,
but they all yield fantastic results,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.390
so don’t complain, ok?

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.070
After all we didn’t just create one
version of this amazing

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.480
easy-to-melt delicacy, but four of them.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.840
If your blender is not particularly powerful,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.220
you might want to strain the sauce before using it,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730
to remove any unwanted solid parts.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.730
Once the ingredients are properly blended,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.830
simply place your favourite non-stick
pan onto a medium heat

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.230
and pour in the mixture.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.610
Start stirring the sauce and keep
doing so until it thickens

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.020
into the final cheese.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.910
If you see some lumps forming at first, don’t worry!

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.080
As soon as the sauce begins to thicken properly,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.910
the lumps will dissolve into the
most amazing and creamy

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.400
molten cheese consistency.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.940
However, to make this happen, make sure to
stir vigorously as the sauce thickens.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.870
You want to cook the sauce just until
it begins to boil, and after that,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.750
you can turn off the heat and cool it
down completely before using it.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.180
To cool down the sauce and prevent the
skin from forming on top of it,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.650
you can either keep stirring like a crazy
person for roughly 30 minutes,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.850
which I do not recommend,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.960
or place the bowl into another bowl
filled with cold water

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.830
and stir until it cools down.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.640
The most important thing in this recipe

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.200
is the proportion between the liquids
and the starch,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.910
and If for some reason you want to obtain
a mozzarella of a different consistency,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.530
you will find some useful tips in
the video description.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.490
Personally I like to make this mozzarella
the day I need it,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.860
but do know that it keeps well in the
fridge for a couple of days.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.750
And here you have the final mozzarella,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.780
ready to be used as a topping for a
phenomenal vegan pizza.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.360
And just in case you are wondering
if a recipe for pizza

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.880
will soon become a reality, the answer is yes.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.370
So you might want to start preparing yourself
in both a cooking sense

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.390
and an emotional one, as it is going to be memorable.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.880
