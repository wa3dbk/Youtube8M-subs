00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.230
 follows gives the debriefing of the season 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.139
 would be flawed tv with today the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.029
 favorite for the best rookie of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.820
 the season is that in f1 it is not 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.150
 obvious to begin today for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.039
 young pilots even if we have more 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.769
 in younger who arrives it will be still 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.900
 the case in 2015 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.189
 ziv on the whole season 2014 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 for you, which is better 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.059
 performed but frankly worried 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.750
 really i was amazed by daniil kvyat 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.719
 you this young man of 19 years arrives right 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.000
 of the gp3 a formula that is not 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.399
 really now he 's 20 but he 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.559
 happened the beautiful had not dissolve and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.020
 he feels immediately at ease 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.850
 in formula 1 he immediately showed 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.520
 his qualities of the first beer 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.160
 test session remember interlagos 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.750
 in free practice 1 effect the 8th time 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.059
 in the rain already we understood that he 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.830
 was a caliber and then the whole season 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.470
 he showed his speed spike and a 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.689
 incredible maturity I observed at 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.400
 monaco every test session at the beginning 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.689
 they were at five seconds it is at 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.159
 three seconds he took his time to 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.380
 learn the circuit by learning the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.090
 meanders of this difficult circuit and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 finally and and in qualifying 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.960
 he qualifies himself very well the boy has 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.000
 really a lot of qualities and at 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 red bull he did not get it wrong 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.170
 he's the one who chose him for 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 replace vettel so that's really 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.950
 he is good the kid yes I will not say 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.540
 luck for jean-eric vergne because 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.369
 it's true that falling under ricardo and 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.650
 then on viatte it really fell to 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.329
 two and that jean-eric not big case 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.990
 something to be blamed if not 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.070
 actually this small lack of 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.250
 aggression in qualifications to this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.960
 little small grain of madness that makes 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.850
 sometimes the difference because in the race 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.509
 jean eric was still very very 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.119
 mature he he was very solid even though 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.189
 at the end of the season probably a little 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.619
 more a little mentally worn by this 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.869
 absolutely unbearable pressure eh 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.549
 well he has he cracked a little 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.730
 share while at the beginning of the year good he 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.840
 had his share of 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.390
 abandonment and technical incidents 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.030
 who did that good it was not obvious 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.950
 to support the comparison but see 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.570
 arrive as you say this young Russian from 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.000
 neck comes from nowhere and that is 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.770
 already immediately able to do it 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.540
 at least on a par with him it had to 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.990
 work and because the stake he's the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.540
 knew 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.990
 unfortunately we know the outcome of 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.370
 this case 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.040
 so I'm going to choose another 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.290
 rookie same sylvia is obviously it's 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.120
 an obvious choice i'm going to talk about kevin 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.190
 manu scene you guessed it excellent 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.780
 also because remember big 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.940
 australia price a magnus women who 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.380
 arrive and that makes us a podium for 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.100
 a very first grand prize for a guy 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.620
 someone does not like a lot 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.080
 of experience few kilometers in f1 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.670
 a few steps but the bo not 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.280
 easy circuit new blunder it's 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.280
 very tricky and there the guy he does a 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.010
 Exemplary race johnson button has 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.480
 badly and that was the case elsewhere in 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.500
 early season because the mclaren 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.959
 was competitive 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.820
 it did not last long the few 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.360
 flyers wandered at the beginning of the season and 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.610
 then after mclaren has dived has not 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.950
 really managed to follow the 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.299
 development of others and then good I 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.340
 think they rocked all their 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.540
 resources on 2015 pretty quickly 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.030
 so to bring me scene it was hard 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.280
 because it was he had started very 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.680
 strong unlike grid is attacked 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.850
 as you say is ramped up 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.100
 magnus ny had started very hard and 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.450
 then we had to manage for a young 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.019
 it's not obvious either that 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.209
 this is the f1 it is first there the material 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.519
 the car that makes the result and 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.980
 magnusson I find was pretty 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.090
 copy also in the very side 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.940
 professional then a little 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.489
 Scandinavian obviously he does not breathe 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.380
 not charisma even though he has some 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.630
 charm i would say kevin it's a guy 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.510
 intelligent he expresses himself well I believe 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.910
 he learned a lot from jason button 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.590
 button fought well at the end of the season 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.209
 because like every size but he 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.880
 know that you have to be there and 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.380
 magnus she was not buried by 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.030
 oim boat from far away far away 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.020
 it was not rolled by Breton and 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.000
 breton is a customer still gives me 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.290
 a lot of qualities he's not in 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.850
 end of career for me we have 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.400
 certainly still two beautiful three 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.050
 years before him so 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.970
 magnusson had a power advantage 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.440
 learn from a world champion and 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.270
 to be able to enjoy his experience 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.180
 but on the other hand it can be a 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.630
 double-edged sword if you do yourself 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.550
 dominated ah good so we're actually going 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.350
 you do not have the level but he has it true 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.850
 very, very often, he is evenly matched 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.950
 shown very very good qualities 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.690
 so he deserves a big second year 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.730
 dilemma for mac the meat then under 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.470
 the rain frankly I saw a magnus 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.290
 scene too and that's where we see the 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.150
 intrinsic talent 1 the innate gift he 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.230
 is there when frankly I love 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.950
 johnson autumn is a guy 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.840
 wonderful 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.240
 but for me he is at the end of his career 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.620
 and the fact that he is not clearly 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.880
 makes a difference with a beginner 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.330
 like with scenes sorry that wants 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.310
 to say that tony me there it went out of fashion 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.570
 a last word because there were two 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.340
 other cookies on the grid finally a 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.960
 little more if we consider the pilots of the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.510
 Friday but who took the departure 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.950
 a grand prize has two or three 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.930
 marcus ericsson angry caterham all 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.660
 three but marcus ericsson 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.890
 well that's really at the same time 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.540
 do not always shoot the pianist 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.830
 was really not good in the 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.140
 first half of the season only 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.450
 he had a few races where he was 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.070
 not too ridiculous I would say in September 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.080
 october so is there a reason 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.960
 technical to politics I do not know 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.530
 it's after the change of management 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.020
 or from or how to say property 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.090
 even though it was very nebulous but 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.620
 still he was not the weight faced 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.510
 to kobayashi and he's still 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.040
 many mistakes of beginners in 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.560
 the occurrence of which it can happen 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.060
 and then andré lotterer aspar this is it 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.570
 that's it that's what I wanted 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.090
 to talk to you 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.560
 andré lotterer that's really a beautiful 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.020
 fresh shot in f1 I find 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.120
 to have a guy who comes from mans who 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.740
 smoldering in very good seats 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.430
 performing in Japan because the super 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.680
 formula 1 in japan 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.380
 they go as fast as the ends of 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.820
 middle of grid and there we see a guy 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.160
 which is still very sharp even if 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.550
 the 33 34 years old and who is capable 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.550
 to arrive with zero preparation to spa 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.110
 in one in a f1 and it's good there 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.650
 gave a little cloak a slap to 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.500
 ericsson 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.110
 which justifies the fact that Russian was 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.120
 hyper hyper nice stone because in 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.650
 plus this human aspect of having a type 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.190
 who were at Formula 1 doors ago 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.169
 10 12 years old who did not succeed in 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.669
 to reach but in this and their dreams 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.910
 and who did a very very beautiful can and 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:35.210
 they are all one who wins and who has 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.890
 all the qualities for and who gets to 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.050
 realize his dream a little thanks to kolin 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.760
 stick what he always appreciated 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.760
 and then who arrives at spa francorchamps 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.750
 and who puts a second to ericsson without 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.570
 preparations 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.340
 it's great and it's for him it's 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.320
 beautiful it runs it was a little 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.460
 short unfortunately and I little shot 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.640
 hat inside too is that 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.550
 he had excuse me the expression the 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.720
 two say no to the monza race because 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.190
 we were going to put him some water 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.200
 of friday morning that frankly to 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.450
 monza in f1 you still need a 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.080
 minimum of rolling could he preferred 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.910
 say no thanks 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.500
 if it's to do it halfway I 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.780
 do not do abu dhabi yet we have him 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.640
 proposed and he did well i think of not 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.919
 not to not aggravate his case he had 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.500
 his little his little moment of glory to 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:21.600
 home spa and that was frankly 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.240
 it was not wrong here is ericsson 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.110
 so good finally it's the only one who 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.870
 will not leave alone but it is he who 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.580
 who are still promoted even at 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.630
 aubert in such a way is there one 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.990
 can still ask questions 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.440
 because its potential we know it 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.600
 is limited 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.700
 the charisma of maize when we talked about 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.490
 manu scenes frankly the ericsson 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.590
 it's pathetic and it does not need to 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.570
 it's a pity that this is it 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.010
 are the Swedish crowns that make the 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.510
 difference in this very specific case 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.520
 but if it's to save that aubert and 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.140
 well why not and then bet that 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.090
 ericsson will make progress and 

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.520
 hope because at the end of the season it's 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.810
 true they were already driving a little better 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.430
 hope they save faubert is who 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.450
 and which finds its place in formula 1 

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.390
 because his father is not yet 

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:07.010
 saved even if the banco do brasil 

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.010
 also occupies with felipe nasr
