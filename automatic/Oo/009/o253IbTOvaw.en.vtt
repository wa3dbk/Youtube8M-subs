00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.219 
that's really the concept that I'm
trying<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.489> work<00:01:52.640> out<00:01:52.849> here<00:01:53.090> is<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.300> you<00:01:54.110> know

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
trying to work out here is that you know

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.199 
trying to work out here is that you know
having<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.709> physical<00:01:54.920> object<00:01:55.429> or<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.910> physical

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
having a physical object or a physical

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.690 
having a physical object or a physical
item<00:01:56.479> can<00:01:56.840> actually<00:01:57.200> be<00:01:57.410> supportive<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.369> that

item can actually be supportive of that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.089 
item can actually be supportive of that
process<00:01:59.289> and<00:02:00.289> I<00:02:00.380> thought<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.679> would<00:02:00.739> just<00:02:00.800> show
