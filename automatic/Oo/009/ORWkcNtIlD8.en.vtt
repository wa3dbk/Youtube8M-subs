00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
completely you know said exactly what's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.330 
completely you know said exactly what's
on<00:01:22.110> my<00:01:22.200> mind<00:01:22.229> about<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.250> are

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
on my mind about this it they are

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
on my mind about this it they are
overloading<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.600> talent<00:01:25.290> as

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
overloading this thing with talent as

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130 
overloading this thing with talent as
opposed<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.490> star<00:01:26.850> power<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.869> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
opposed to star power and that is so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
opposed to star power and that is so
reminiscent<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.220> George<00:01:29.490> Lucas<00:01:29.880> did

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
reminiscent of what George Lucas did

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
reminiscent of what George Lucas did
with<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> original<00:01:30.659> Star<00:01:30.900> Wars<00:01:31.079> films<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.560> mean
