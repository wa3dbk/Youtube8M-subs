00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.740
 My name is Alexander in the world of May 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.180
 Medvedenko we are near the very 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.720
 kiev itself is small 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.210
 3 city say the village near Kiev name is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.330
 he is Sophia borschagovka and it is in this 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.970
 place i 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.130
 live and taking sports starve 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.520
 young pigeons are now about 2 months 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.960
 they are descendants 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.420
 almost all breeding pigeons 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.460
 the parents of these pigeons this then this 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.330
 Belgian pigeons bought but 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.710
 directly to belgium best 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.690
 breeder who shows the best 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.629
 the results of each of these pigeons 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.269
 there is a place in which he lives in 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.250
 which he has his nest in which 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.230
 he made his partner after 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.699
 competition at one time this one 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.580
 dove 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.989
 young flew injured 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.820
 with almost completely torn 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.210
 breast but i saved him for some reason i 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.500
 he believed it and the next year he did not 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.869
 showed a very good result 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.659
 calm good and so stayed behind him 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.229
 Klitschko precisely torn torn because 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.350
 that he was with a torn chest now I 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.659
 I think I can come another Klitschko but he 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.790
 I stuck it all so here I am 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.549
 I call if now it is exceptional 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.200
 sports like me like any 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.800
 pigeon breeder who takes sports 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.010
 pigeons 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.550
 i act as a trainer and these are mine 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.810
 pets are my athletes which i am 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.540
 principle everyone needs an individual 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.780
 approach is often especially the best pigeons 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.460
 then literally fifty sixty more 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.410
 years ago pigeons use even 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.190
 military purposes 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.350
 for example during the great patriotic 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.450
 wars the germans forbade keeping pigeons 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.930
 people who served pigeon breeders 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.520
 they were often shot ie their 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.350
 just destroyed as well as 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.840
 pigeons why Germans because 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.489
 perfectly understood that pigeons can 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.989
 used as a mail transfer 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.930
 required number of reports 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:19.209
 some when through the throne when to pass 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.430
 man is very difficult and therefore let's say 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.720
 so therefore pigeons would lick and be 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.640
 forbidden to keep but nonetheless 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.319
 a huge number of patriots kept them 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.319
 cellars of such attics and managed 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.319
 to help 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.930
 in hostilities along with that if you 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.290
 know that very large amount 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.409
 monuments among all animals and birds 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.650
 it is worth the pigeons why to what 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:51.400
 pigeons rescued people and the sea when 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.459
 produced in a clean sea pigeons and 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.189
 the ship that broke there was no 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.959
 he has walkie-talkies and so on and pigeons often 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.120
 saved pointing exactly the coordinates 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.690
 brought the coordinates on the foot tied 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.290
 secondly for example reliable 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.019
 the information is also in roar go to war 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.000
 pigeons bore a huge amount 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.470
 gospel reports and belgium mickey 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.220
 pigeon sports by the way 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.170
 and so on but even so no less 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.819
 eg 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.370
 Chinese armies even now have several 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.170
 pigeon I do not even really do not know 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.510
 I’m sure to know exactly what’s wrong 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.970
 one and not 3 and much more which 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.680
 fully funded with against 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.519
 Dovecotes sports pigeons who 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.099
 fully funded by the government 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.810
 that is, from the military budget they 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.739
 constantly train involved 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.099
 competitions only for the purpose of 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.840
 case of war god forbid they could 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.940
 carry the reports why because 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.620
 any means of communication can be blocked 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.379
 somehow in the methods 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.139
 and the pigeon is difficult to block 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.890
 to a distance of 500 600 kilometers and 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.590
 pigeons can successfully carry 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.440
 lift up the amount of information here 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.290
 me are the females up partners here 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.020
 these males here the most interesting thing 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.440
 females recover much faster 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.820
 for males, they scan so few 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.290
 hardy somewhat calmer 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.110
 stress resistant probably here 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.900
 sports passion is just the main thing that 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.360
 there is and for example if belgium then 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.280
 there are any official there 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.990
 financial rewards yes there is 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.030
 some budget for this then we have it 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.290
 sports exclusively excitement 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.400
 and for many people in our difficult times 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.310
 emotional and psychological difficult 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.800
 here doves is salvation salvation 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.660
 sharp with salvation from bad emotions 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.910
 let's say so when i climb 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.870
 dovecote or when we dove arrives 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:04.820
 there are among the best or 1 I just forget 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.760
 about everything bad that exists for 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.560
 You have chosen the most bright absolutely 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.650
 seriously that is for me it is unusual 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.680
 color this year yashchuk led one line 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.950
 pigeons their laziness and here they give u such 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.190
 here 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.430
 motley funny as you see already on 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.700
 pigeons on pigeons there are rings which 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.500
 Dresses around 8 days old here 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.400
 These here are blue in three weeks already 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.919
 will be in that dovecote and through 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.050
 two months two and a half months will be 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.790
 compete I bought for what 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.550
 large number of belgian pocket 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.550
 and using during the competition the most 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.260
 food of the highest quality i am not 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.090
 sure that I can do it 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.950
 further because now it is enough 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:54.410
 dear with us and how god will let me be 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:59.380
 I think it will not be the most important but we 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.380
 we will try to feed the best here
