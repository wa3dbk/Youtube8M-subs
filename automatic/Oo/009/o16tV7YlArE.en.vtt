00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.949
 Hello everyone as you may not see 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.950
 in the title I bring you the one of the 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.630
 perfect palette if you do not know I have 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.150
 a lot of palettes so for 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.700
 know them and know a little about them 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.490
 that they release the video that I start I have 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.210
 here the questions are 10 and well the 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.079
 first says the best paper and then between 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.019
 I choose the vice 2 for its elegance 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:30.019
 for its color because the initials 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.230
 as if it were a gem is one of my colors 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.480
 favorite is the purple one and give it a 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.740
 hue of many shades and shadows 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.040
 are these 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.030
 I think there are 20 and they are very varied for 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.520
 the night for the bright Tuesday and 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.520
 start double and a mirror crown 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.970
 of a question says the best 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.969
 pigmented can all the pallets are 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.899
 all but I'm going to choose I think it's 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:05.619
 sorry the one you're not the first to 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:09.850
 they took out has the general was he knows the 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:13.540
 golden tones we have of night of 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.090
 transition bates shining a mirror and 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.500
 the velvet the problem and the closure 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.500
 which is very good but good 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.720
 in the third the most versatile I think 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.520
 that the most versatile is the dose and after 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.280
 he stops here and it 's how bad they are 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:38.750
 dances is already stained deep 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.720
 the shadows are 15 and we have a joke t 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.990
 there is not the transition part of 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.509
 what you can do many looks and good 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.780
 the cool thing is that I finish watching her with interest 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:56.690
 it comes out very well priced 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.720
 fourth best to travel because I think that 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.880
 is very tiny is the network up to the 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.980
 moon 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:10.740
 and they come 6 I know they are at night 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.320
 but always when I travel always 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.070
 finding a shadow of blue cream for 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.860
 down in case you imagine the sea or the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.510
 beach then I resort that a danger 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.299
 I do not usually load a lot 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.329
 here is a palette that is before 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.849
 have bought it is your face 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.920
 my gods gave me blogs today 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.049

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.269
 it is very heavy very large is in the 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:42.549
 drawer bottom what good god well 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.549

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.840
 and has an illuminator of the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.780
 bronzers blushes makeup 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.430
 is a brush and lassad or my works of 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.650
 defense that I'm in bus mode or if 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.290

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.650
 then without a doubt nacho colette bar 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.960
 incredible smell of real chocolate and 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.060
 also their name are desserts 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.959
 chocolate chocolate milk with black 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.660
 buckler these are your tones what more 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.290
 it excites me is that it has shouting 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.270
 two large are basic shades of always 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.819
 browns for the day a mirror of what 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.819
 I thank you that inhabiting comes seventh 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.660
 palette less used as there is the dow face 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.640
 It is natural to and I do not use or OSCE 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.670
 two or three times at the beginning but the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.170
 who uses it is my sister and has all 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.780
 by day what she likes has the 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.120

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.319
 golden browns and little pieces of paper with 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.319

 they know that the 2 is a palette that does not 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.280
 I regret having bought it because 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.320

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.020
 I'm going with the son, this is for you 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.180
 this bates transition is that is 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.100
 vast is a palette of neutral but 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.130
 it's perfect 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.210
 ninth your most beloved palette as the 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.490

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.910
 each shadow costs with 25 and comes in 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.980

 security of your face a little is to explain 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.040
 but it has many things besides what 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.350

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.770
