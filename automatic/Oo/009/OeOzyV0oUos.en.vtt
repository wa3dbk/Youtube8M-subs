00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
out and then I can just work from the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.210 
out and then I can just work from the
cap<00:02:01.900> so<00:02:02.170> I'm<00:02:02.229> going<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.409> get<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.560> fair<00:02:02.799> amount<00:02:02.979> of

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
cap so I'm going to get a fair amount of

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.850 
cap so I'm going to get a fair amount of
that<00:02:03.430> on<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.030> angled<00:02:04.570> brush<00:02:04.750> making<00:02:05.590> sure

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
that on to the angled brush making sure

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.410 
that on to the angled brush making sure
that<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.159> brush<00:02:06.369> is<00:02:06.400> flat<00:02:07.180> as<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.799> can<00:02:09.009> get<00:02:09.220> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that the brush is flat as I can get it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.750 
that the brush is flat as I can get it
with<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.450> product<00:02:10.980> and<00:02:11.980> then<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:12.610> to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
with the product and then I like to

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.380 
with the product and then I like to
start<00:02:13.090> at<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.390> arch<00:02:13.659> of<00:02:13.750> my<00:02:13.900> eye<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.030> start

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
start at the arch of my eye so I start

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.910 
start at the arch of my eye so I start
right<00:02:16.569> about<00:02:16.659> here

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
right about here

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.910 
right about here
and<00:02:18.150> then<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.420> gentle<00:02:19.959> brush<00:02:20.230> strokes<00:02:20.590> down

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
and then just gentle brush strokes down

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.600 
and then just gentle brush strokes down
where<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.459> like<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.250> can<00:02:27.370> see

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
where it's just like that so you can see

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.390 
where it's just like that so you can see
you<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.910> something<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:30.310> I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
you have something like that and then I

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.930 
you have something like that and then I
just<00:02:30.459> go<00:02:31.120> from<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.480> top<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:35.940> essentially

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
just go from the top and essentially

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.670 
just go from the top and essentially
what<00:02:36.970> i'm<00:02:37.209> doing<00:02:37.569> is<00:02:37.780> just<00:02:37.840> filling<00:02:38.380> in<00:02:38.470> any

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
what i'm doing is just filling in any

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.420 
what i'm doing is just filling in any
gaps<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.400> making<00:02:40.330> sure<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.260> line<00:02:41.500> that

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
gaps and making sure that the line that

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.979 
gaps and making sure that the line that
my<00:02:42.610> brow<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> lot<00:02:43.390> smoother<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:43.959> more

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
my brow is a lot smoother and more

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.670 
my brow is a lot smoother and more
defined<00:02:44.380> it's<00:02:44.920> all<00:02:45.069> I'm<00:02:45.220> doing<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:46.290> also<00:02:47.290> don't

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
defined it's all I'm doing I also don't

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.040 
defined it's all I'm doing I also don't
want<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.920> make<00:02:48.099> my<00:02:48.310> brows<00:02:48.550> too<00:02:49.090> dark<00:02:49.450> because

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
want to make my brows too dark because

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.250 
want to make my brows too dark because
it<00:02:50.530> appears<00:02:51.000> really<00:02:52.000> unnatural<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.810> way<00:02:52.959> and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
it appears really unnatural that way and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.250 
it appears really unnatural that way and
I<00:02:53.709> think<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:54.220> natural<00:02:54.730> brow<00:02:55.049> always<00:02:56.049> looks

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
I think a natural brow always looks

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.590 
I think a natural brow always looks
really<00:02:56.530> good<00:02:56.709> especially<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.910> spring<00:02:58.330> and

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
really good especially in the spring and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.500 
really good especially in the spring and
the<00:02:58.900> summer<00:02:58.980> where<00:02:59.980> it's<00:03:00.130> more<00:03:00.310> carefree<00:03:00.880> so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the summer where it's more carefree so

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.640 
the summer where it's more carefree so
we're<00:03:01.660> going<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.989> spring<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.319> summer<00:03:02.470> you

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
we're going to the spring and summer you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.340 
we're going to the spring and summer you
want<00:03:02.799> to<00:03:02.860> light<00:03:03.040> things<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.549> little<00:03:03.730> bit<00:03:04.350> so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
want to light things up a little bit so

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.400 
want to light things up a little bit so
from<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:05.680> arch<00:03:06.040> point<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.780> don't<00:03:07.780> add<00:03:08.200> any

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
from that arch point I don't add any

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.490 
from that arch point I don't add any
more<00:03:08.440> products<00:03:09.069> and<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.250> just<00:03:09.519> work<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:09.850> way<00:03:10.500> to

is<00:03:41.290> fact<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.459> terrible<00:03:42.820> so<00:03:43.209> we're<00:03:44.079> just

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
is fact that is terrible so we're just

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
going to keep on filling in and then I

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.900 
going to keep on filling in and then I
like<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.750> sort<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.900> smooth<00:03:50.829> that<00:03:51.310> line<00:03:51.549> at<00:03:51.790> the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
like to sort of smooth that line at the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.520 
like to sort of smooth that line at the
bottom<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:54.130> that<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:58.170> it's<00:03:59.170> just<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.380> really

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
bottom like that and it's just a really

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.309 
bottom like that and it's just a really
naturally<00:04:00.190> defined<00:04:00.579> brow<00:04:00.760> simple<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:02.230> can

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
naturally defined brow simple so you can

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.250 
naturally defined brow simple so you can
see<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.530> difference<00:04:02.890> how<00:04:03.819> this<00:04:04.030> is<00:04:04.239> missing<00:04:05.200> a

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
see the difference how this is missing a

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.740 
see the difference how this is missing a
lot<00:04:05.350> of<00:04:05.500> hairs<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.130> then<00:04:06.640> here<00:04:06.880> it's<00:04:07.060> just<00:04:07.390> it

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
lot of hairs and then here it's just it

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.770 
lot of hairs and then here it's just it
really<00:04:08.079> frames<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.650> face<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.450> I'm<00:04:10.510> just<00:04:10.660> going

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
really frames the face so I'm just going

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.780 
really frames the face so I'm just going
to<00:04:10.840> go<00:04:10.900> back<00:04:11.109> in<00:04:11.319> grab<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.310> little<00:04:12.430> bit<00:04:12.640> more

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
to go back in grab a little bit more

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.550
