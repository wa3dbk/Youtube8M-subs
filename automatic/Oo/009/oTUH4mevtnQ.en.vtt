00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
I'm just driving back from Kimberly BC

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.070 
I'm just driving back from Kimberly BC
on<00:00:14.130> our<00:00:14.550> way<00:00:14.670> back<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.910> Calgary<00:00:15.300> here<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.960> I'm

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
on our way back to Calgary here so I'm

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.570 
on our way back to Calgary here so I'm
somewhere<00:00:16.320> between<00:00:16.410> Longview<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.190> Pinchot

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
somewhere between Longview and Pinchot

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.000 
somewhere between Longview and Pinchot
Creek<00:00:17.850> which<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.540> really<00:00:18.900> really<00:00:19.020> dry<00:00:19.619> arid

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
Creek which is a really really dry arid

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.820 
Creek which is a really really dry arid
area<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.640> Alberta<00:00:21.110> and<00:00:22.110> I<00:00:22.320> was<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.529> driving

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
area in Alberta and I was just driving

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.980 
area in Alberta and I was just driving
along<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.130> highway<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.670> saw<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.599> ditch

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
along the highway and I saw this ditch

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.179 
along the highway and I saw this ditch
here<00:00:25.260> which<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.710> see<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.010> actually

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
here which you can see is actually

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.890 
here which you can see is actually
flowing<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.360> water<00:00:27.570> moving

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
flowing you can see this water moving

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960 
flowing you can see this water moving
through<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.550> smart

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
through here and this really smart

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.299 
through here and this really smart
farmer<00:00:30.539> has<00:00:31.020> decided<00:00:31.440> to<00:00:31.590> put<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> wing<00:00:32.099> out

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
farmer has decided to put a wing out

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.119 
farmer has decided to put a wing out
into<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.760> ditch<00:00:32.970> and<00:00:33.650> harvest<00:00:34.650> all<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
into the ditch and harvest all of that

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.600 
into the ditch and harvest all of that
water<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.960> an<00:00:37.080> example<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.800> swale

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
water so this is an example of a swale

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.670 
water so this is an example of a swale
essentially<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.900> water<00:00:40.080> is<00:00:40.230> moving<00:00:40.260> on

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
essentially so this water is moving on

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.569 
essentially so this water is moving on
contour<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> follow<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> along<00:00:47.100> what

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
contour and if you follow it along what

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.400 
contour and if you follow it along what
you're<00:00:47.700> gonna<00:00:47.790> find<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> dam<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you're gonna find is a dam just on the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.500 
you're gonna find is a dam just on the
other<00:00:49.530> end<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.100> gonna<00:00:50.219> take<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.329> that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
other end and I'm gonna take you to that

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
other end and I'm gonna take you to that
dam<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.110> show<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.590> exactly<00:00:52.860> how<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.370> water

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
dam and show you exactly how that water

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.780 
dam and show you exactly how that water
is<00:00:53.820> working<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.989> above<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> Swale<00:00:56.160> now<00:00:56.399> just

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
is working so above the Swale now just

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.990 
is working so above the Swale now just
out<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.540> ditch<00:00:57.719> here<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.040> see<00:00:59.280> below

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
out the ditch here and you can see below

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.310 
out the ditch here and you can see below
the<00:01:00.300> ditch<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:02.250> all<00:01:02.430> dry<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.899> farmers

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the ditch it's all dry so this farmers

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.900 
the ditch it's all dry so this farmers
harvesting<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> water<00:01:05.190> that's<00:01:05.430> coming<00:01:05.700> off

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
harvesting the water that's coming off

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.380 
harvesting the water that's coming off
the<00:01:06.119> hardscape<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.899> road<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
the hardscape of the road and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.639 
the hardscape of the road and
intercepting<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.509> onto<00:01:09.869> its<00:01:10.020> feet<00:01:10.259> onto<00:01:10.440> his

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
intercepting it onto its feet onto his

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.370 
intercepting it onto its feet onto his
field<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:12.330> rehydrate<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.930> field<00:01:13.140> now<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
field to rehydrate the field now the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.020 
field to rehydrate the field now the
water<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.740> all<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.160> to<00:01:14.250> end<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.490> back<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.940> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
water is all going to end up back in the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.900 
water is all going to end up back in the
river<00:01:15.179> that<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.509> would<00:01:16.020> eventually<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
river that this would eventually go to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.859 
river that this would eventually go to
it<00:01:17.910> might<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.330> 40<00:01:18.780> years<00:01:18.959> to<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.229> there

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
it might just take 40 years to get there

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
it might just take 40 years to get there
so<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> farmer<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.410> actually<00:01:22.920> doing<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
so the farmer is actually doing a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.639 
so the farmer is actually doing a
service<00:01:26.360> by<00:01:27.360> slowing<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.020> flow<00:01:28.319> of<00:01:28.380> water

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
service by slowing the flow of water

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.059 
service by slowing the flow of water
down<00:01:29.390> its<00:01:30.390> interception<00:01:31.140> elements<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.800> this

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
down its interception elements like this

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.339 
down its interception elements like this
but<00:01:32.789> keep<00:01:33.030> our<00:01:33.240> streams<00:01:33.599> and<00:01:33.780> rivers<00:01:33.929> flowing

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:34.349 
but keep our streams and rivers flowing

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:37.100 
but keep our streams and rivers flowing
for<00:01:34.649> generations<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.429> generations<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> I'm

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
for generations and generations so I'm

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.900 
for generations and generations so I'm
standing<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.679> top<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.130> Swale<00:01:38.459> right<00:01:38.729> here

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
standing on top of this Swale right here

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.210 
standing on top of this Swale right here
you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.660> see<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.869> it's

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
you can see you can see that it's

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.059 
you can see you can see that it's
filling<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.369> from<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.670> ditch<00:01:45.030> behind<00:01:45.300> me<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
filling in from that ditch behind me and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.969 
filling in from that ditch behind me and
if<00:01:47.069> we<00:01:47.190> come<00:01:47.429> down<00:01:47.459> to<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.880> ground<00:01:48.060> right<00:01:48.420> here

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
if we come down to the ground right here

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.050 
if we come down to the ground right here
you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.190> see<00:01:50.539> how<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:51.599> soil<00:01:52.369> is<00:01:53.369> really

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you can see how the soil is really

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.600 
you can see how the soil is really
really<00:01:54.270> wet<00:01:57.229> extremely<00:01:58.229> wet<00:01:58.410> so<00:01:58.679> what

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
really wet extremely wet so what

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.840 
really wet extremely wet so what
actually<00:02:00.830> what's<00:02:01.830> actually<00:02:02.010> happening<00:02:02.550> here

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
actually what's actually happening here

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.580 
actually what's actually happening here
is<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.630> water<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.080> flowing<00:02:04.440> in<00:02:04.710> behind

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
is the water that's flowing in behind

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.660 
is the water that's flowing in behind
alongside<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:08.070> whale<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:09.110> actually

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
alongside this whale is actually

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.390 
alongside this whale is actually
rehydrating<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.870> soil<00:02:13.200> by<00:02:13.470> by<00:02:13.800> making<00:02:14.250> this

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
rehydrating the soil by by making this

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.420 
rehydrating the soil by by making this
whale<00:02:14.700> really<00:02:15.030> really<00:02:15.420> wet<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.160> see<00:02:17.340> how

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
whale really really wet you can see how

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.990 
whale really really wet you can see how
what<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:19.830> actually<00:02:20.220> move

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
what that is so we can actually move

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.630 
what that is so we can actually move
down<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.630> whale<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.280> can<00:02:29.310> really

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
down this whale and I and I can really

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.520 
down this whale and I and I can really
feel<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.090> moisture<00:02:30.600> that's<00:02:30.750> being<00:02:31.020> picked<00:02:31.290> up

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
feel a moisture that's being picked up

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.650 
feel a moisture that's being picked up
on<00:02:31.740> this<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:33.150> ditch<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.690> contour<00:02:34.200> here<00:02:35.660> so

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
on this this ditch on contour here so

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.390 
on this this ditch on contour here so
you<00:02:36.750> can<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.380> moves<00:02:37.650> right<00:02:38.070> around

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
you can see that it moves right around

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.130 
you can see that it moves right around
the<00:02:38.580> landscape<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.300> farmer<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.720> surveying

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
the landscape this farmer is surveying

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.949 
the landscape this farmer is surveying
it<00:02:40.260> out<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.560> contour<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:42.330> really<00:02:42.720> really

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
it out on contour it's really really

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.890 
it out on contour it's really really
great<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.230> see<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:44.270> someone<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.450> using<00:02:45.630> these

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
great to see that someone is using these

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.170 
great to see that someone is using these
ideas<00:02:46.380> here<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.650> Alberta<00:02:46.950> already<00:02:47.370> we<00:02:47.970> can

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
ideas here in Alberta already we can

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.360 
ideas here in Alberta already we can
tell<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.810> completely<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.800> contour

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
tell that this is completely on contour

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.070 
tell that this is completely on contour
because<00:02:50.760> there's<00:02:51.000> no<00:02:51.300> movement<00:02:51.690> whatsoever

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
because there's no movement whatsoever

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.360 
because there's no movement whatsoever
in<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> water<00:02:54.200> it's<00:02:55.280> extremely<00:02:56.959> slow<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.280> if

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
in the water it's extremely slow and if

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.790 
in the water it's extremely slow and if
we<00:02:59.520> wanted<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.910> we<00:03:00.540> could<00:03:00.570> use<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.170> swell<00:03:01.470> to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
we wanted to we could use this swell to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.789 
we wanted to we could use this swell to
establish<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.520> tree<00:03:02.850> belt<00:03:03.530> look<00:03:04.530> at<00:03:04.650> how<00:03:04.739> it

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
establish it a tree belt look at how it

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.539 
establish it a tree belt look at how it
follows<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.370> contour<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.970> land<00:03:07.489> here's<00:03:08.489> a

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
follows the contour of the land here's a

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.600 
follows the contour of the land here's a
really<00:03:08.820> great<00:03:09.120> shot<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.540> what<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.900> will

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
really great shot of what this will

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.640 
really great shot of what this will
looks<00:03:11.610> like<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.360> see<00:03:15.600> where<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
looks like you can see where the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.479 
looks like you can see where the
excavator<00:03:17.190> there<00:03:17.840> pulled<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.019> soil<00:03:19.260> down

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
excavator there pulled the soil down

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.860 
excavator there pulled the soil down
there's<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.580> literally<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> change<00:03:21.570> in

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
there's a literally a change in

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.280 
there's a literally a change in
vegetation<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:23.060> all<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.269> soil<00:03:24.810> became

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
vegetation and all of that soil became

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.840 
vegetation and all of that soil became
the<00:03:25.440> mound<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.739> I'm<00:03:25.920> currently<00:03:26.190> standing<00:03:26.519> on

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
the mound that I'm currently standing on

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:36.590 
the mound that I'm currently standing on
right<00:03:27.030> now<00:03:32.750> again<00:03:33.750> notice<00:03:34.080> how<00:03:35.360> still<00:03:36.360> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
right now again notice how still the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.080 
right now again notice how still the
water<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:37.019> it's<00:03:37.560> not<00:03:37.739> flowing<00:03:40.519> so<00:03:41.519> notice<00:03:41.940> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
water is it's not flowing so notice the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.460 
water is it's not flowing so notice the
profile<00:03:42.660> right<00:03:42.930> here<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:44.400> see<00:03:44.610> how<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.470> grass

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
profile right here you see how the grass

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.050 
profile right here you see how the grass
changes<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:48.030> above<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.310> cut<00:03:50.549> right<00:03:50.790> here

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
changes just above to the cut right here

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.910 
changes just above to the cut right here
we<00:03:51.480> had<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.630> really<00:03:51.840> gentle<00:03:52.200> three-to-one

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
we had a really gentle three-to-one

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.100 
we had a really gentle three-to-one
slope<00:03:53.340> that's<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:54.000> good<00:03:54.180> slope<00:03:54.450> for<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.690> swale<00:03:54.930> on

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
slope that's a good slope for a swale on

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.370 
slope that's a good slope for a swale on
the<00:03:55.170> back<00:03:55.320> side<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.820> earth<00:03:57.000> here<00:03:57.720> was

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
the back side and the earth here was

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.550 
the back side and the earth here was
being<00:03:58.620> used<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.360> create<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.480> mound<00:04:00.720> right

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
being used to create the mound right

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.190 
being used to create the mound right
down<00:04:01.799> here<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.989> this<00:04:03.989> water<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.440> slowly

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
down here and this water is slowly

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.140 
down here and this water is slowly
seeping<00:04:07.200> into<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.459> landscape<00:04:08.819> now

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
seeping into the landscape now

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.690 
seeping into the landscape now
recharging<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.110> groundwater<00:04:10.500> aquifer

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
recharging that groundwater aquifer

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.310 
recharging that groundwater aquifer
so<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:12.790> can<00:04:12.970> see<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.360> water<00:04:13.570> finally<00:04:13.900> flows

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
so you can see the water finally flows

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.810 
so you can see the water finally flows
into<00:04:14.500> my<00:04:14.650> dam<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.130> it<00:04:15.220> looks<00:04:15.400> like<00:04:15.580> there's<00:04:15.760> a

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
into my dam and it looks like there's a

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.930 
into my dam and it looks like there's a
swale<00:04:16.120> leaving<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.810> other<00:04:16.930> side<00:04:17.230> of<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.440> dam

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
swale leaving the other side of the dam

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.550 
swale leaving the other side of the dam
and<00:04:18.940> on<00:04:19.030> this<00:04:19.120> side<00:04:19.360> we've<00:04:19.540> got<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.870> little<00:04:20.440> bit

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
and on this side we've got a little bit

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.910 
and on this side we've got a little bit
of<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.680> diversion<00:04:20.980> drain<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.320> Swale<00:04:23.620> has

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
of a diversion drain so the Swale has

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.600 
of a diversion drain so the Swale has
moved<00:04:24.190> into<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:25.350> bit<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.530> ditch<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.430> all

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
moved into a bit of a ditch and all

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.360 
moved into a bit of a ditch and all
diversion<00:04:28.030> drain<00:04:28.240> means<00:04:28.480> is<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:29.100> swale<00:04:30.100> that's

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
diversion drain means is a swale that's

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.660 
diversion drain means is a swale that's
slightly<00:04:30.640> off<00:04:30.910> contour<00:04:32.220> now<00:04:33.220> if<00:04:33.280> we<00:04:33.370> come<00:04:33.550> to

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
slightly off contour now if we come to

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.570 
slightly off contour now if we come to
the<00:04:33.760> other<00:04:33.910> side<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.420> Swale<00:04:34.660> again<00:04:35.580> you'll

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the other side of the Swale again you'll

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.870 
the other side of the Swale again you'll
notice<00:04:36.970> that<00:04:37.420> this<00:04:37.630> long<00:04:37.960> edge<00:04:41.370> all<00:04:42.370> the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
notice that this long edge all the

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.950 
notice that this long edge all the
overland<00:04:43.270> flow<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:46.090> comes<00:04:46.360> off<00:04:46.570> this<00:04:46.750> hill

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
overland flow that comes off this hill

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.210 
overland flow that comes off this hill
and<00:04:49.960> whatever<00:04:50.110> doesn't<00:04:50.500> get<00:04:50.680> taken<00:04:50.950> in<00:04:51.130> the

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
and whatever doesn't get taken in the

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.730 
and whatever doesn't get taken in the
dam<00:04:51.990> will<00:04:52.990> be<00:04:53.110> infiltrated<00:04:53.740> in<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.920> Swale<00:04:55.740> so

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
dam will be infiltrated in the Swale so

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.180 
dam will be infiltrated in the Swale so
when<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:56.950> dam<00:04:57.130> gets<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.700> full<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:59.800> will<00:04:59.890> back

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
when the dam gets to full it will back

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.080 
when the dam gets to full it will back
flood<00:05:00.550> into<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.150> Swale<00:05:01.390> and<00:05:02.190> then<00:05:03.190> rehydrate
