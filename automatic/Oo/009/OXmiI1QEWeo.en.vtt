now as you can see from those three
clips<00:01:13.880> i<00:01:14.409> am<00:01:15.409> using<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.729> first<00:01:17.000> two<00:01:17.270> attacks

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
I'm not doing it that well but I think

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.380 
I'm not doing it that well but I think
in<00:01:24.920> some<00:01:24.950> parts<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.579> those<00:01:25.759> you<00:01:25.939> can<00:01:26.119> see

better<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.039> can<00:01:28.399> be<00:01:28.729> done<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:29.179> it<00:01:29.719> can<00:01:29.899> be

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
better that it can be done and it can be

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.429 
better that it can be done and it can be
done<00:01:30.170> quickly<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.490> an<00:01:31.549> extent<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.899> only<00:01:33.109> three

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
characters that I found that can do it
