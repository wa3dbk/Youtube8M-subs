this<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.070> same<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.399> either<00:01:59.579> side<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
this it's the same on either side and

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.389 
this it's the same on either side and
what<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:02.719> is<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:05.189> door

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
what we have here is a little door

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.570 
what we have here is a little door
between<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.689> wife<00:02:06.810> thought<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.580> just

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
between my wife thought of this and just

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.880 
between my wife thought of this and just
a<00:02:08.729> great<00:02:08.879> way<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.289> want<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> open<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.770> up

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
a great way to if we want to open it up

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.530 
a great way to if we want to open it up
to<00:02:11.009> give<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> bunny<00:02:11.400> more<00:02:11.670> room<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> rope

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to give a bunny more room we have a rope

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
to give a bunny more room we have a rope
here<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.020> see<00:02:13.170> my<00:02:13.290> hand<00:02:13.470> holding

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
here you can see my hand holding

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.290 
here you can see my hand holding
rope<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.280> haven't<00:02:14.520> completed<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.910> yet<00:02:15.090> just

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
rope I haven't completed it yet just

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
whole lot more room to move around if we

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.400 
whole lot more room to move around if we
only<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.330> one<00:02:24.569> or<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.930> want<00:02:25.110> them<00:02:25.290> to

wish
taking<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.720> around<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.990> inside<00:02:31.260> again<00:02:31.980> ahead

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
taking you around the inside again ahead

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.220 
taking you around the inside again ahead
and<00:02:32.250> put<00:02:32.340> our<00:02:32.430> back<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.850> yet<00:02:33.000> we<00:02:33.810> built<00:02:34.110> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and put our back on it yet we built a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.810 
and put our back on it yet we built a
little<00:02:34.350> divider<00:02:34.770> there<00:02:37.610> separating<00:02:38.610> his

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
little divider there separating his

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.880 
little divider there separating his
little<00:02:39.060> nest<00:02:39.270> from<00:02:39.540> from<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> outside<00:02:40.590> wall

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
little nest from from the outside wall

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.530 
little nest from from the outside wall
there<00:02:41.130> concerned<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.000> live<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.239> top<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
there concerned we live on top of the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.120 
there concerned we live on top of the
hill<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:42.720> concern<00:02:43.260> with<00:02:43.410> some<00:02:43.560> wind<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:43.950> snow

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
hill so concern with some wind and snow

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.770 
hill so concern with some wind and snow
that<00:02:44.400> might<00:02:44.520> be<00:02:44.670> blowing<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.090> rain<00:02:45.270> sometimes

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
that might be blowing and rain sometimes

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.510 
that might be blowing and rain sometimes
so<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.500> gives<00:02:46.680> them<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.830> little<00:02:46.920> area<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.370> have

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
so this gives them a little area to have

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.320 
so this gives them a little area to have
to<00:02:47.640> walk<00:02:47.820> around<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:49.770> allows<00:02:50.190> them<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:51.209> be<00:02:51.300> a

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
to walk around and allows them to be a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.460 
to walk around and allows them to be a
little<00:02:51.540> warmer<00:02:51.780> perhaps<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.260> wintertime

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
little warmer perhaps in the wintertime

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.860 
little warmer perhaps in the wintertime
and<00:02:52.680> away<00:02:52.890> from<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> elements<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.700> way<00:02:53.910> it's

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
and away from the elements that way it's

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.240 
and away from the elements that way it's
probably<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.290> necessary<00:02:55.769> but<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:56.040> thought<00:02:56.190> it

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
probably not necessary but we thought it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.680 
probably not necessary but we thought it
was<00:02:56.400> kind<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.730> cool<00:02:56.910> little<00:02:57.030> idea<00:02:57.239> and

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
was kind of a cool little idea and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.449 
was kind of a cool little idea and
there's<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> back<00:02:58.380> part<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.769> hutch<00:02:58.920> and

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
there's the back part of the hutch and

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.250 
there's the back part of the hutch and
there's<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.700> back<00:03:02.850> opened<00:03:03.269> up<00:03:03.390> I'm<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.630> in

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
there's the back opened up I'm just in

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.090 
there's the back opened up I'm just in
the<00:03:04.380> process<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.940> getting<00:03:06.709> getting<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.830> back

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the process of getting getting the back

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.970 
the process of getting getting the back
installed<00:03:08.550> on<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:08.850> hutch<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:10.500> stands<00:03:10.769> about
