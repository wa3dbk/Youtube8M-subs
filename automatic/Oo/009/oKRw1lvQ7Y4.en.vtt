 offside 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.460
 Wolf has options, Apple has 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.339
 amongst other things 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.519
 so thick the grill worked 88 millimeters 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.409

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.649
 Completely tip over 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.769
 Pauline and back 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.660
 under the hood but that now the a5 processor 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.980
 with twice the gigahertz 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.530
 while processor can 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.280
 I was since 2001 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.460
 several times there was unanimity 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.990
 an idea less leak 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.680
 at the Tre UNH 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.680
 Games and should be soon 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 Features of the new processor and especially order and graphics unit used 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.440
 become 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440
 to run faster 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.270
 Currently limited is accused 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.650
 David Guetta is 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.170
 this would have to be there too 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.820
 nice feature that stood for example barrel Rossi 60 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.690
 own recording studio overnight 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.720
 and various 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 Helpers 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.460

 To make music 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 you say fast 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.960
 automatically what has Kohl Hainer 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.950
 Preserve together 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.670
 funny awakened in any case 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.470
 otherwise 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.780
 there are still as 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.270
 new accessories that ruler 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.560
 currently housed in plus a default magnet 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.150
 Astra Sports Tourer go 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 aligns itself so automatically 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.720
 over the iPad because of four stands on this side keep it up too 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 to 21 automatically 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.880
 as is laid 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 but something else rejects 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.299
 I hold myself 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.590
 our first impression 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.569
 Cluster paid accessories partly 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.560
 it's good 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.689
 However, one should speak 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.359
 on the go 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.199
 get a real bag for a while because there is already a book about sausage 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.619
 against it 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.619
 while rising up 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.789
 loud applause / 2 4 50 CAD the 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.109
 the Bristol England 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.099
 the flexibility has improved 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.259
 Sheen and through solutions 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.889
 Pühringer is open if Apple 1 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.589
 However, I have already noticed that despite the season for the treatment 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.589
 minor scratches 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.949
 another innovation 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.969
 two cameras Alba dpa three megapixels 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.409
 Volkmar 7 megapixels 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.379
 not yet at the height of time 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.269
 the quality 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.999
 because he has cameras 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.979
 acceptable for FaceTime 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:12.959
 completely off 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.959
 dp2 Kita Steinmeier with 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.979
 either and it must be fine 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:22.669
 2 4 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.629
 Pairing that user with a smartphone 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:25.440
 then sit 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.210
 at all, Oxford fits that we'll be a little pale provost Mezger iPhone 4 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.639
 to be able to go online comfortably 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.709
 also as regards the memory equipment 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.709
 we say 61 meters 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.699
 that's enough, that's the new book with the wild game 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.109
 84 euros 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.439
 providers 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.559
 the pleasure of an iPad 2 comes 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.839
 who already have age »one now 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:56.039
 Oberdick have better world cup races 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:04:00.269
 the rest should maybe even the old trial slash iPad 2 has de Botton 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:03.579
 is expected that members of the clergy come in the market 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.449
 there is speculation on 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.069
 an appointment before Christmas 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.259
 but having game is important says Ropertz 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.769
 That's why a user should think it should come to pick it up 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.400
 in the economy instead of André f 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.259
 yesterday 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.639
 SLI lock big meets so a middle class starts easily 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.639
 understandable to Germany 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.009
 Position off 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.590
 I think business is still coming 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.900
 Porsche buys Ebert 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 everything else is 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:41.810
 the Austria with the new Need for Speed 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.240
 Shift 2 Andy is 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.700
 that's just what they want the day after tomorrow or they are the decisive one 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.180
 Finally, the benchmarks are the Bible's loss of power 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.979
 but went to Bergen in England 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.509
 in Brands Hatch in group b 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.789
 the city now 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.789
 one must 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.180
 through that now off 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.180
 Game over for the mindmap also aborted 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.689
 and also cancer 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.870
 the laughing tears are 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.199
 the graphically that he would ask us if they were human 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:22.939
 lots 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.939
 not much and colors are 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.270
 So the odds could be a bit more distance Advent Sunday 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.939
 Rapid wins 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:40.979
 Pieks are 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.309
 Michael stitch 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.309
 it needs a bit 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.419
 for world cup points for concord 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.909
 she heard she heard 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:09.459
 Fixed menu deep night out 590 and we do there the power consumption and 

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:11.319
 visited the card now percent 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.289
 Of course, to elicit full load as possible 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.360
 playing on the wall already done 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.850
 Second, it lacked 340 Watt Zettler 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.949
 from there you have to really fire 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.210
 we forget 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.419
 Marketing the Act Apparently there are Basel III there's something not just right 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.309
 the temperature of the trained rose high the other 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:44.830
 WinZip even easy 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.830
 Aschauer Str is funny 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.580
 and the ad actually shows up here 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.330
 the PEA became 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.050
 you gotta 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.629
 actually only one 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.629
 under full load 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:07.699
 Oppenheim second place 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.779
 such a feast does not tend to go well liked the test 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:21.110
 you look very nice 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.110
 from Frauke past the crater rises » 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.319
 then rises and rises and rises 

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.240
 I can tell you the wm-tag make most easily exchangeable 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.240
 the area is 87 degrees high at the GPU too 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.309
 and we see here 

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:41.309
 as well as the GPU is 

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:44.860
 have been well utilized 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.869
 87 98 percent 

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:50.219
 the maximum power consumption ever measured with Red 

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.270
 444 was 

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.270
 the rest will be in the booklet 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.270
 Online summarizes and optics sent 

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.970
 Where
