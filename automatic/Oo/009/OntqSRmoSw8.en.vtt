the<00:00:37.530> second<00:00:37.860> string<00:00:38.120> fourth<00:00:39.120> fret<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:40.079> our

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the second string fourth fret it's our

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.660 
the second string fourth fret it's our
the<00:00:40.440> video<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.800> probably<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.250> useless

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the video it's probably about useless

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.209 
the video it's probably about useless
kiss<00:00:42.260> it<00:00:43.260> makes<00:00:43.620> me<00:00:43.770> look<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:43.950> I'm

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
kiss it makes me look like I'm

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.860 
kiss it makes me look like I'm
left-handed<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> mirror

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
left-handed because it's like a mirror

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.459 
left-handed because it's like a mirror
image<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.719> audios<00:00:48.719> faster<00:00:49.320> than

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
image and then it's audios faster than

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.069 
image and then it's audios faster than
the<00:00:49.559> video<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.570> anyway<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.629> I'm<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.020> to
