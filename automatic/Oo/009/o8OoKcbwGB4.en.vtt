00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
here a while so what's it might be too

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.670 
here a while so what's it might be too
cold<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.250> make<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> gauge<00:01:56.579> work<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.680> we'll

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
cold to make the gauge work but we'll

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.179 
cold to make the gauge work but we'll
see<00:01:58.950> i<00:01:59.869> SPECT<00:02:00.869> its<00:02:01.079> temperature<00:02:01.469> operated

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
see i SPECT its temperature operated

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.649 
see i SPECT its temperature operated
nothing<00:02:02.520> expect<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> temperature<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.540> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
nothing expect the temperature of that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.940 
nothing expect the temperature of that
coffee<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.079> about<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> same<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
coffee is about the same as the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590 
coffee is about the same as the
temperature<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.700> room<00:02:06.000> so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
temperature of this room so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I guess I ain't hot enough to make it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.360 
I guess I ain't hot enough to make it
