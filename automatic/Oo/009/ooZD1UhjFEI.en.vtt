00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
is the markets probably got hung with a

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
lot of this inventory because it was

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.119 
lot of this inventory because it was
pretty<00:04:39.509> expensive<00:04:39.839> last<00:04:40.229> year<00:04:40.439> and<00:04:40.650> again

over the next year when they made this
product<00:04:47.669> they<00:04:48.800> probably<00:04:49.800> made<00:04:49.979> up<00:04:50.099> their<00:04:50.249> mind

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460

to<00:04:50.669> go<00:04:50.789> ahead<00:04:51.029> and<00:04:51.270> lower<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.319> number<00:04:52.499> of<00:04:52.680> hits

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
to go ahead and lower the number of hits

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.860 
to go ahead and lower the number of hits
and<00:04:53.069> lower<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:53.819> price<00:04:54.059> so<00:04:54.300> more<00:04:54.539> people<00:04:54.689> can

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870
