00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 all beaver dear friends while translating 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.430
 the song was noticed by a couple of Easter eggs about 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.799
 which I did not mention in my previous 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.870
 video by the way see the previous video 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.519
 You can click on the left picture 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 by clicking on the right picture you can 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.269
 see russian translation of this song 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.340
 so it was decided to make a video about 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.650
 Easter eggs in the clip in the next video we 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.810
 already discuss who sings in the song puppet 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 and easier after that I think we already 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.920
 let's finish the conversation I'm a song because well 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.080
 itâ€™s impossible not to talk so much and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.580
 so the first fact will put that connection 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 between 2 living tombstone 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.110
 and the cattle there has not yet been proven either 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.300
 like the fact that the group has some 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.670
 additional information about the plot i 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.950
 asked directly the patterns screw became new 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.690
 so far nothing answered yes and I think hardly 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.820
 whether it will answer additional 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 hype so don't treat everything 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.629
 this is so serious the following fact 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.210
 animatronics came to the purple 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.469
 one by one despite the shot where they are 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.570
 the whole crowd fit 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.460
 you can see it by the clock 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.070
 move accordingly to each 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.690
 suitable animatronics for example hijacking 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.500
 he came at two o'clock 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.360
 uhokeke three foxy in 5 we were not shown 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.280
 when came freydin time he was shown 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.200
 first we can conclude that he was killed 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.840
 in the first hour then comes interesting 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.560
 regularity all animatronics come 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.210
 in an hour except wolf b who comes 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.310
 after two I wonder whether this means 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290
 anything for example maybe in 4 was 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.970
 someone else was killed who was not shown in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.400
 golden freddie clip 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.439
 how do you think write in the comments 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.990
 the third fact is the cry of phantoms during 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.119
 chorus i think you all noticed that by this 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.560
 screaming scared us balun battlefield company in 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.560
 the third part let's explain 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.820
 in the same way they frightened us and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.640
 springtrap muse leaves the same cry 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.310
 means a cry of pain animatronic given 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.360
 that this soup appears exactly when 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.990
 animatronic screams when hitting it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.659
 an ax 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.729
 many have noticed the number 4 at this moment 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.890
 I wonder what the same four can 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.979
 see for springtrap in teaser 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.679
 and also on the site apparently that the house is stone 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.229
 they also think that this is not the end 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.450
 hat on site disappeared during release 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.480
 songs i don't think it means anything 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.580
 but the coincidence is interesting though if cattle 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.560
 and the fact that he is still connected then they could 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.560
 forget this trick exactly under the exit 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.209
 songs because it would help them both 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.849
 quite possible option given that 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.459
 they still communicate exactly when they hit 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.709
 animatronic ax with reduced pupils 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.200
 they additionally proves that in 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.000
 animatronics is the soul of children 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.370
 moreover, these children's souls, unlike 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.620
 animatronics in the game are afraid 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.599
 it also shows Freddie himself when on 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.099
 he gets a purple guy you 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.670
 just look at this scared 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.040
 face 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.410
 I feel so sorry for him the seventh fact at the end 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.750
 after approaching the purple shower guy 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.700
 children for a moment springtrap appears 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.830
 which means what after children 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.870
 got to the purple guy he 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.120
 turned into a servant of the king how 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.190
 it finally proves that all this 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.319
 the song shows a mini game that we 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.840
 can see throughout fnaf 3 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.390
 the truth was and the screw did not dare 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.090
 show exactly the process of chewing posa 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.739
 purple guy in springtrap costume 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.989
 there is a theory that during the reverse 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.970
 rewinding shows the creation process 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.950
 animatronics I personally do not this theory 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.209
 stick because then comes 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.760
 very strange thing 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.980
 I remind you to understand exactly what 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.750
 I will say further sorry for explaining 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.549
 such obvious things but worth 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.810
 be safe and do not explain 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.250
 obvious things and then me in 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.150
 comments offended by the fact that 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.819
 misunderstood 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.069
 if we have a record then rewinding and and 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.110
 we will see all the events in reverse to 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.080
 example at the beginning of Vasya bought ice cream 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.120
 then Vasya threw this ice cream at grandma 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.430
 rewind value we will first 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.799
 see ice cream in the face of grandmother val 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.920
 then this ice cream flies to hand 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.380
 kvass and then he takes it from the seller 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.329
 and also take the money to the seller 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.370
 here in reverse rewind Vasya gangster well 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.440
 and at the end of the rewind we will be in the very 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.810
 the beginning of the video recording when Vasya only 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.700
 wants to buy ice cream again sorry 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.620
 for having to explain it like this 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.930
 At the beginning of the rewind show like all 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.030
 breaks foxy then show how soul 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.600
 the child is above the broken suit 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.370
 foxy 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.410
 considering that everything goes in reverse 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.539
 rewinding then it turns out that at first it was 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.419
 word on i foxy with the spirit over it then 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.910
 foxy spirit went in after that everything repaired 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.160
 animatronic with an ax well nifiga 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.140
 imagine a twist similar to the rest 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.760
 animatronics if you follow the principle 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.039
 rewind at first were 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.410
 animatronics are broken and then in them 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.840
 souls planted in the end they were 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.020
 subjugated with an ax and subjugated them in h 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.419
 possible but seemingly strange to me 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.979
 theories are possible in fact about and all in 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.530
 hands no support as we previously thought 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.479
 hammer strangely like an ax 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.400
 although it is possible of course that the souls were 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.560
 first planted world animatronics 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.300
 then they are subject and then if 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.020
 understand everything literally then they were 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.160
 subordinate fvch 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.919
 what is the use of repairing animatronics 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.050
 who want to kill him or if everyone 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.060
 it is not at all literally understood that 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.759
 animatronics were subordinate to someone a 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.680
 then they were broken and in h but all 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.810
 Equally goes like this weird theory on 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.060
 my opinion is another interesting fact in 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.490
 late when the kids go purple guys 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.710
 it is clear that the rewind is over 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.259
 that the tape came to its beginning and 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.659
 she went forward again and the children go to 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.150
 the killer after this springtrap appears 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.530
 considering that this is the beginning and then comes 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.539
 break down and animatronics and walks 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.759
 an interesting twist of the plot first children 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.159
 overtook the purple guy and then 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.849
 It turned out springtrap and then he them 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.699
 broke 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.909
 I donâ€™t deny this theory with an ax 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.919
 my opinion is that it is not entirely correct because 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.580
 the facts that I called above though guys 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.560
 warn you 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.930
 this theory can also be pulled by the ears 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.789
 pepper this bit of fiction theory 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.530
 and get a normal theory but me 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.719
 personally she doesn't seem right 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.610
 9 fact is a theory that during llama her 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.280
 animatronics they have fly off parts like 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.650
 phantoms but it is not so for example clip 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.719
 ucheke flies hand and face during fnaf 3 u 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.849
 phantom checks all right with these 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.039
 at least that Freddieâ€™s leg flies off 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.650
 and like his legs just not present at 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:09.050
 foxy flies off a hook that 's not there 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.120
 fnaf 3 but with the hook the hand flies off 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.979
 which is in fnaf 3 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.050
 so this theory is given also the eyes 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.940
 checks and also leg in Freddie 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.219
 possibly but unlikely 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.259
 10 fact at the time of the murder of freddie hat 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.779
 falls exactly the same as on the site even 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.880
 light falls from the same angle 11 fact in 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.400
 the clip doesn't see purple freddy though 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.139
 mini game he was possible that traces 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.930
 who see would not belong exactly 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.979
 purple freddie however i believe that 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.259
 they are still left 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.810
 ordinary bears especially given that 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:41.029
 he walked along the same aisle and 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.520
 the last fact is still not clear who 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.740
 same song a puppet or 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.110
 purple guy i will talk about it already 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.180
 in the next video and now a little 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.610
 hint pay attention to the phrase i 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.039
 throw you out like my old tv and 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.229
 and ponder how you feel what brand 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.000
 TV was at the puppets and well, and it 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.520
 all dear friends hope you 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.199
 Good bye! Good luck! 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.199
 I'm leaving the sunset
