00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
developed by we r memory keepers and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.180 
developed by we r memory keepers and
you've<00:00:14.280> seen<00:00:14.520> me<00:00:14.699> use<00:00:15.740> something<00:00:16.740> similar<00:00:16.949> to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
you've seen me use something similar to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.910 
you've seen me use something similar to
this<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.060> past<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.440> regular

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
this in the past I have here the regular

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.189 
this in the past I have here the regular
handle<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.850> easy<00:00:21.119> family<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.690> have<00:00:21.960> went

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
handle of the so easy family I have went

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.360 
handle of the so easy family I have went
with<00:00:22.530> the<00:00:23.040> piercing<00:00:23.520> head<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:25.370> stamping

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
with the piercing head and the stamping

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.700 
with the piercing head and the stamping
head<00:00:26.610> which<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.540> see<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.260> double

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
head which you can see I have a double

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.670 
head which you can see I have a double
dash<00:00:29.100> line<00:00:29.370> design<00:00:29.789> here<00:00:30.260> basically<00:00:31.260> what

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
dash line design here basically what

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.779 
dash line design here basically what
that<00:00:31.710> would<00:00:32.039> allow<00:00:32.250> me<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.360> trace<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
that would allow me to do is to trace a

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.050 
that would allow me to do is to trace a
design<00:00:36.860> because<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.039> cartridge<00:00:38.460> already<00:00:38.850> has

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
design because the cartridge already has

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.020 
design because the cartridge already has
some<00:00:39.960> ink<00:00:40.380> in<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.550> difference<00:00:41.880> between

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
some ink in it so the difference between

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.260 
some ink in it so the difference between
these<00:00:42.750> handles<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.220> one<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.790> that<00:00:44.820> this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
these handles and this one is that this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
these handles and this one is that this
one<00:00:45.540> will<00:00:45.840> allow<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.470> create<00:00:46.620> circles

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
one will allow you to create circles

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.520 
one will allow you to create circles
from<00:00:47.730> three<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.480> eleven<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.020> half<00:00:49.050> inches

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
from three to eleven and a half inches

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.430 
from three to eleven and a half inches
and<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.520> attach<00:00:50.880> any<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> heads<00:00:51.840> that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and you can attach any of the heads that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.220 
and you can attach any of the heads that
fit<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> regular<00:00:53.250> handle<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.960> easy

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
fit on a regular handle to the so easy

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.900 
fit on a regular handle to the so easy
circles<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.250> let<00:00:56.399> me<00:00:56.460> show<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> how<00:00:56.790> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
circles so let me show you how that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.370 
circles so let me show you how that
works<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:59.510> tool<00:01:00.510> itself<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:01.200> is<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
works so on the tool itself there is a

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.590 
works so on the tool itself there is a
guide<00:01:01.829> there's<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.399> ruler<00:01:02.790> so<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.270> would

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
guide there's a ruler so you would

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.590 
guide there's a ruler so you would
adjust<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.280> width<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.969> the<00:01:06.180> circle

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
adjust it to the width of the circle

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.780 
adjust it to the width of the circle
that<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.259> to<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.250> install<00:01:08.579> the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.390 

you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.340 

next<00:01:58.400> we're<00:01:58.550> going<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.700> use<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:59.060> sewing<00:01:59.420> head<00:01:59.810> so

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
next we're going to use a sewing head so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.840 
next we're going to use a sewing head so
the<00:02:00.380> head<00:02:00.620> goes<00:02:00.860> down<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:01.130> my<00:02:01.220> mat<00:02:01.250> like<00:02:01.610> this

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
the head goes down on my mat like this

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.430 
the head goes down on my mat like this
and<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.750> just<00:02:03.650> basically<00:02:04.100> cradle<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.440> snap

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
and I just basically cradle it and snap

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.040 
and I just basically cradle it and snap
into<00:02:06.650> place<00:02:06.800> like<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:08.210> now<00:02:08.330> i<00:02:08.360> have<00:02:08.509> a

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
into place like this so now i have a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.370 
into place like this so now i have a
zig-zag<00:02:09.979> stitch<00:02:10.190> sewing<00:02:10.970> head<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:12.200> r<00:02:12.350> memory

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
two different stitches that I was

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.530 
two different stitches that I was
playing<00:03:48.560> with<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.549> there's<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.970> zigzag

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
playing with so there's that zigzag

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.120 
playing with so there's that zigzag
again<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:50.989> could<00:03:51.049> have<00:03:51.290> done<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.440> cross<00:03:51.799> stitch

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
again I could have done a cross stitch

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.060

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
but I chose to do a zigzag again this is

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.860 
but I chose to do a zigzag again this is
a<00:03:55.100> straight<00:03:55.549> stitch<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.390> is<00:03:56.600> another
