00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
for these muscles I think as far as the

chest<00:01:00.090> muscles<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.070> these<00:01:02.070> muscles<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
chest muscles and these muscles all I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.590 
chest muscles and these muscles all I
have<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.080> push-ups<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.030> started

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
exercising about six months ago I could

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
exercising about six months ago I could
only<00:01:10.170> squeeze<00:01:10.590> out<00:01:10.830> maybe<00:01:11.840> 15<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.049> 20<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
only squeeze out maybe 15 to 20 at a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.330 
only squeeze out maybe 15 to 20 at a
time<00:01:14.610> which<00:01:15.420> was<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> edge<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.590> being<00:01:16.920> kind

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
time which was on the edge of being kind

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.770 
time which was on the edge of being kind
of<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> cardio<00:01:17.880> workout<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.409> I'm<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.780> 35

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
of a cardio workout and now I'm up to 35

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.359 
of a cardio workout and now I'm up to 35
at<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.259> before<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:23.040> start<00:01:23.280> getting

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
at a time before I really start getting

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.249 
at a time before I really start getting
exhausted<00:01:24.030> which<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.049> probably

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
exhausted which I think it's probably

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.620 
exhausted which I think it's probably
still<00:01:25.500> good<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.040> me<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.420> much<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
still good for me but it's not so much a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050 
still good for me but it's not so much a
weight<00:01:27.930> training<00:01:28.229> exercise<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.490> had<00:01:29.790> this

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
weight training exercise and I had this

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
weight training exercise and I had this
idea<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.930> went<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.799> Lowe's<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.400> home

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
idea I went to Lowe's the home

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.980 
idea I went to Lowe's the home
improvement<00:01:33.150> store<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.689> they<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.790> sandbags

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
improvement store and they have sandbags

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.649 
improvement store and they have sandbags
now<00:01:36.990> these<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.470> shoring<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.659> floodwaters

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
now these are for shoring up floodwaters

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
now these are for shoring up floodwaters
but<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> thought<00:01:40.439> they<00:01:40.650> could<00:01:40.829> spare<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.400> for

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
but I thought they could spare one for

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.990 
but I thought they could spare one for
an<00:01:42.329> alternate<00:01:42.899> use<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:44.430> thing<00:01:44.759> weighs<00:01:44.970> about

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
an alternate use this thing weighs about

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.249 
an alternate use this thing weighs about
50<00:01:45.720> pounds<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:47.040> only<00:01:47.159> cost<00:01:47.549> $1<00:01:48.000> 88<00:01:48.600> regular

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.139 
50 pounds and it only cost $1 88 regular
price<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> dollar<00:01:50.340> ninety-nine<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.119> I

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
price was a dollar ninety-nine but I

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.200

used<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:51.600> extra<00:01:52.170> special<00:01:52.290> Lowe's<00:01:52.860> card<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.060> get

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
weight bench in a backpack but before I

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.400 
weight bench in a backpack but before I
get<00:03:16.190> started<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.880> want<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.210> get<00:03:17.540> an<00:03:17.630> idea<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:18.200> how

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
get started I want to get an idea of how

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.200 
get started I want to get an idea of how
much<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:19.010> will<00:03:19.490> be<00:03:19.700> actually<00:03:20.290> pressing<00:03:21.550> so<00:03:22.550> what

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
much I will be actually pressing so what

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.210 
much I will be actually pressing so what
I'm<00:03:23.300> going<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.600> do<00:03:23.870> is<00:03:24.080> put<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.710> backpack<00:03:24.920> on

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
I'm going to do is put the backpack on

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.500 
I'm going to do is put the backpack on
and<00:03:26.030> then<00:03:26.960> use<00:03:27.170> my<00:03:27.200> extra<00:03:27.830> accurate<00:03:28.700> bathroom

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
and then use my extra accurate bathroom

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.990 
and then use my extra accurate bathroom
scale<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.050> get<00:03:30.230> an<00:03:30.320> idea<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.680> how<00:03:31.490> much<00:03:31.670> weight

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
scale and get an idea of how much weight

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:49.630 
scale and get an idea of how much weight
is<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:33.110> me<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:47.709> want<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.770> tighten<00:03:49.100> these<00:03:49.160> straps

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
is on me I want to tighten these straps

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.320 
is on me I want to tighten these straps
up<00:03:50.890> because<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:52.190> think<00:03:52.489> it's<00:03:52.760> important<00:03:53.270> that

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
up because I think it's important that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.890 
up because I think it's important that
the<00:03:53.930> weight<00:03:54.170> beat<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:55.340> close<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:56.239> my<00:03:56.390> shoulders

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
the weight beat is close to my shoulders

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.890 
the weight beat is close to my shoulders
as<00:03:57.050> possible<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.590> don't<00:03:57.770> want<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:57.980> down<00:03:58.820> here<00:03:59.239> on

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
as possible I don't want it down here on

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:14.170 
as possible I don't want it down here on
my<00:04:00.110> back<00:04:00.350> I'm<00:04:00.620> not<00:04:00.770> a<00:04:00.800> horse<00:04:12.910> that's<00:04:13.910> heavy

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
my back I'm not a horse that's heavy

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.670 
my back I'm not a horse that's heavy
look<00:04:14.930> like<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.080> turtle

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
look like a turtle

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.830 
look like a turtle
yes<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:17.840> look<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.109> little<00:04:18.229> squished<00:04:19.510> okay<00:04:20.540> oh

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
yes you look a little squished okay oh

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.360 
yes you look a little squished okay oh
yeah<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:23.660> before<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.080> actually<00:04:24.260> tried<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.740> do<00:04:25.070> a

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
yeah and before I actually tried to do a

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.180 
yeah and before I actually tried to do a
push-up<00:04:26.380> I'll<00:04:27.380> just<00:04:27.560> put<00:04:27.800> my<00:04:27.830> hands<00:04:28.310> on<00:04:28.400> here

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
push-up I'll just put my hands on here

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.670 
push-up I'll just put my hands on here
and<00:04:31.190> get<00:04:31.490> into<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.820> position<00:04:32.500> so<00:04:33.500> that's

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
and get into the position so that's

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.240 
and get into the position so that's
about<00:04:34.180> 145<00:04:35.180> pounds<00:04:36.669> 147<00:04:37.669> pounds<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:40.130> why

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
about 145 pounds 147 pounds and why

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.500 
about 145 pounds 147 pounds and why
don't<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.430> get<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> full<00:04:40.790> shot<00:04:41.000> at<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.210> form

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
don't you get a full shot at the form

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.670 
don't you get a full shot at the form
that's<00:04:41.720> shown<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.140> I'm<00:04:42.290> not<00:04:42.440> cheating

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.060 

so<00:04:49.680> that's<00:04:49.860> about<00:04:50.090> 147<00:04:51.090> pounds<00:04:51.330> but<00:04:52.290> that's

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
so that's about 147 pounds but that's

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.760 
so that's about 147 pounds but that's
not<00:04:53.250> truly<00:04:53.700> accurate<00:04:54.150> because<00:04:54.210> my<00:04:54.480> arms<00:04:54.870> weigh

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
not truly accurate because my arms weigh

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.140 
not truly accurate because my arms weigh
something<00:04:56.600> so<00:04:57.600> just<00:04:57.870> for<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.140> sake<00:04:58.410> of

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
something so just for the sake of

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.600 
something so just for the sake of
accuracy<00:05:00.150> if<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:00.930> decide<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.440> do<00:05:01.620> this<00:05:01.800> it

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
accuracy if you decide to do this it

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.130 
accuracy if you decide to do this it
would<00:05:02.760> probably<00:05:03.000> be<00:05:03.420> who've<00:05:03.600> you<00:05:03.810> could<00:05:04.020> weigh

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
would probably be who've you could weigh

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.940 
would probably be who've you could weigh
your<00:05:04.350> arms<00:05:05.780> which<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:06.960> an<00:05:07.200> exact<00:05:07.590> science

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
your arms which is an exact science

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.160 
your arms which is an exact science
because<00:05:08.550> your<00:05:09.300> shoulder<00:05:09.660> is<00:05:09.750> always<00:05:09.990> going<00:05:10.140> to

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
because your shoulder is always going to

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.680 
because your shoulder is always going to
be<00:05:10.230> holding<00:05:10.560> up<00:05:10.680> some<00:05:10.980> of<00:05:11.100> them<00:05:11.250> so<00:05:11.690> for

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
be holding up some of them so for

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.130 
be holding up some of them so for
instance<00:05:12.960> if<00:05:13.050> I<00:05:13.170> put<00:05:13.440> my<00:05:13.590> arm<00:05:13.620> on<00:05:13.980> here<00:05:14.340> says

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
instance if I put my arm on here says

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.920 
instance if I put my arm on here says
it's<00:05:16.140> about<00:05:17.960> seven-and-a-half<00:05:18.960> pounds<00:05:20.930> so

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
it's about seven-and-a-half pounds so

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.600 
it's about seven-and-a-half pounds so
between<00:05:22.590> my<00:05:22.740> two<00:05:22.800> arms<00:05:23.600> I'm<00:05:24.600> probably<00:05:25.610> losing

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
between my two arms I'm probably losing

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.850 
between my two arms I'm probably losing
about<00:05:26.850> 15<00:05:27.480> pounds<00:05:27.900> so<00:05:27.960> whatever<00:05:28.260> that<00:05:28.500> says

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
about 15 pounds so whatever that says

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.670 
about 15 pounds so whatever that says
let's<00:05:29.820> call<00:05:30.060> it<00:05:30.180> 150<00:05:30.840> minus<00:05:31.650> 15<00:05:32.900> that's<00:05:33.900> 135

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
let's call it 150 minus 15 that's 135

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.850 
let's call it 150 minus 15 that's 135
pounds<00:05:35.100> off<00:05:35.220> I<00:05:35.460> would<00:05:35.640> be<00:05:37.310> pressing<00:05:38.810> so<00:05:39.860> that

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
pounds off I would be pressing so that

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.920 
pounds off I would be pressing so that
doesn't<00:05:41.100> sound<00:05:41.460> like<00:05:41.640> a<00:05:41.670> lot<00:05:41.910> but<00:05:41.970> I'm<00:05:42.870> not

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
doesn't sound like a lot but I'm not

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.450 
doesn't sound like a lot but I'm not
very<00:05:43.110> strong<00:05:43.350> either<00:05:45.590> so<00:05:46.590> let's<00:05:46.980> see<00:05:47.100> if<00:05:47.190> I<00:05:47.280> can

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
very strong either so let's see if I can

00:05:47.460 --> 00:06:00.750 
very strong either so let's see if I can
do<00:05:47.610> this<00:05:47.760> okay

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:11.360 

you

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.470 

okay<00:06:12.210> oh<00:06:13.490> you<00:06:14.490> don't<00:06:14.610> have<00:06:14.760> to<00:06:14.940> shoot<00:06:15.300> my<00:06:15.770> face

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
okay oh you don't have to shoot my face

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.780 
okay oh you don't have to shoot my face
so<00:06:18.480> yeah<00:06:18.990> that<00:06:19.230> adds<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.800> little<00:06:20.460> bit<00:06:20.610> of

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
so yeah that adds a little bit of

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.100 
so yeah that adds a little bit of
resistance<00:06:21.120> to<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:21.600> old<00:06:22.639> push-up<00:06:23.639> routine

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
resistance to the old push-up routine

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.850 
resistance to the old push-up routine
and<00:06:26.449> it<00:06:27.449> works<00:06:27.780> out<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.169> muscles<00:06:28.530> without

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
and it works out the muscles without

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.250 
and it works out the muscles without
just<00:06:29.639> turning<00:06:29.940> into<00:06:30.060> a<00:06:30.180> cardio<00:06:30.600> workout<00:06:30.690> which

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
just turning into a cardio workout which

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.770 
just turning into a cardio workout which
is<00:06:31.440> I<00:06:31.470> think<00:06:31.650> what<00:06:31.949> happens<00:06:32.310> if<00:06:32.430> you<00:06:32.520> do<00:06:32.669> 30<00:06:33.540> or

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
is I think what happens if you do 30 or

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.000 
is I think what happens if you do 30 or
40<00:06:34.020> push-ups<00:06:34.229> at<00:06:34.530> a<00:06:34.590> time<00:06:35.840> so<00:06:36.840> that's<00:06:36.960> all

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
40 push-ups at a time so that's all

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.890 
40 push-ups at a time so that's all
oh<00:06:38.040> the<00:06:38.699> demonstration<00:06:39.360> I'm<00:06:39.479> going<00:06:39.720> to<00:06:39.780> do

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
oh the demonstration I'm going to do

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.450 
oh the demonstration I'm going to do
today<00:06:41.210> but<00:06:42.210> I<00:06:42.540> didn't<00:06:43.350> feel<00:06:43.470> really<00:06:43.830> any<00:06:44.160> pain

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
today but I didn't feel really any pain

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.980 
today but I didn't feel really any pain
on<00:06:44.729> my<00:06:44.970> back<00:06:45.180> but<00:06:45.960> again<00:06:46.290> don't<00:06:46.979> um<00:06:47.720> don't<00:06:48.720> try

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
on my back but again don't um don't try

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.450 
on my back but again don't um don't try
this<00:06:49.050> at<00:06:49.350> home<00:06:50.450> because<00:06:51.450> I'm<00:06:52.020> a<00:06:52.050> cheapskate

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
this at home because I'm a cheapskate

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.870 
this at home because I'm a cheapskate
and<00:06:53.460> this<00:06:53.970> is<00:06:54.090> probably<00:06:54.470> sacrificing<00:06:55.880> my

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
and this is probably sacrificing my

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.760 
and this is probably sacrificing my
overall<00:06:57.950> back<00:06:58.950> health<00:06:59.370> to<00:07:00.180> save<00:07:00.450> the<00:07:01.380> money<00:07:01.620> on

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
overall back health to save the money on

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.550 
overall back health to save the money on
a<00:07:01.800> gym<00:07:01.860> membership<00:07:02.729> or<00:07:02.970> a<00:07:03.210> weight<00:07:03.510> bench<00:07:03.780> so

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
a gym membership or a weight bench so

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.409 
a gym membership or a weight bench so
that's<00:07:04.979> just<00:07:05.100> an<00:07:05.250> idea<00:07:05.370> that<00:07:05.639> I<00:07:05.789> had<00:07:06.000> I<00:07:06.030> thought

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:06.419 
that's just an idea that I had I thought

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.330 
that's just an idea that I had I thought
I'd<00:07:06.479> share<00:07:06.690> it<00:07:06.720> with<00:07:06.810> you<00:07:07.010> maybe<00:07:08.010> I'll<00:07:08.190> get

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
I'd share it with you maybe I'll get

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.920 
I'd share it with you maybe I'll get
some<00:07:08.639> positive<00:07:09.630> or<00:07:10.050> negative<00:07:10.440> reinforcement

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
some positive or negative reinforcement

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.690 
some positive or negative reinforcement
on<00:07:12.930> my<00:07:13.139> idea<00:07:14.270> thanks<00:07:15.270> for<00:07:15.389> watching
