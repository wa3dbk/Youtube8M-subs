00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.870
 hi to all and pony move for a 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.900
 tuto bar of obstacles so today 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.459
 I already recorded the video is there I 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.860
 start and comment with my microphone 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:15.339
 so first of all the material you will have 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.900
 need two bars like this so its 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.940
 pacifier stick firm so compare 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.480
 I have it is rather a chef it is 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.180
 rather the right brush size so 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.590
 a small and a big one for the details of 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.660
 the gouache blue and white or 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.070
 acrylic or not necessarily blue and 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.050
 white but it's my color that I have 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.059
 chosen for bars a palette of 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.940
 varnish sticks one be liquid like 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.370
 this one is spray matt 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.079
 preferably the spray much more 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.579
 difficult to use since it is necessary 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.239
 protect his work surfaces and 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.249
 do this outside 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.800
 so I do not recommend it too much 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.929
 I had rather used the varnish 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.460
 liquid glue me because it's more 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.050
 convenient 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.019
 so we will come to protect its surface from 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.819
 work with a dish towel 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.199
 before we start taking then we 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.359
 will take our stick and we will 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.589
 start painting an end not 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.969
 never start with the middle it's 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.920
 much easier to start with 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.470
 the ends so I did a little bit my 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.140
 stupid I did not take any action so I 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.310
 a little hesitant at the pifometer 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.520
 I do not advise you at all 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.470
 do not do it at all 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.540
 privileged there is to take some 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.780
 lengths and we'll do that both 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.780
 sides 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.720
 I want to apologize for the quality of 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.340
 the video since I recorded with 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.750
 my camera 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.280
 what I can not do a montage 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.530
 video with my camera I could not in 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.020
 after christmas my birthday 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.409
 when i will have a software david o I 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.210
 so hopefully here we will come to pose as 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.320
 this for that it 's dry 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.649
 to prevent it from affecting others 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.009
 items 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.220
 then we will come to take the measures 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.680
 so I made four centimeters 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.070
 on one side and closer we get closer to 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.300
 middle 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.060
 I went to 3 cm and in the middle so 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.920
 I had two centimeters left so we 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.260
 will come continue to paint as we go 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.670
 do the middle I was doing everything first 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.760
 in blue because my brush was with 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.530
 blue I was too lazy to go dancing 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.720
 So here we are going to do the blue so 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.550
 really left a little space between the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.170
 trace of paper craon that you're going that 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.600
 you left for measurements and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.340
 your painting like that if you do not 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.010
 if there is a glitch that you bards and 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.160
 you're overflowing or what and bah you can 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.160
 catch up 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.150
 then we will come impose like here 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.310
 so that the middle is then we 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.819
 tackles the second layer 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.920
 finally second layer if you have if 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.180
 you need 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.010
 here is a second layer on the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.120
 painting if we still see the wood in 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.709
 below me I ironed some 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.670
 titles is because we saw in that the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.810
 wood but really only if you have some 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.310
 well if you do not need you 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.120
 waste time so you're not 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.939
 obliged therefore we will come to do the outline 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.409
 for though that makes traits that that 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.269
 do not make waves that we see 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.450
 small strokes of the paint strokes a 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.250
 all over the place really that it does well 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.480
 well right as if it was not us who 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.970
 the planes not that it was really 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.530
 professionals as if it was a 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.180
 bar of obstacles so we will see his 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.299
 everything is only at both ends 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.659
 also in the middle for this app well 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.659
 clean 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.989
 yes that's good 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.849
 so we will continue to paint the 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.879
 extremes we really have to do very 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.879
 Warning 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.250
 so it's a job that requires 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.259
 a lot of patience because the 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.009
 ends of times it redone some 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.190
 waves etc 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.240
 so it's a bit complicated to do but 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.479
 we can do it frankly it's 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.479
 feasible 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:52.009
 so then once you've been 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:54.090
 brought that will come to dry paris 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.550
 then I will pass my color 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.310
 white so I'll get back to the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.530
 white between the two blue both 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.150
 traces of blue derivatives although your 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.800
 bar is well dry because if it is 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.590
 past that's going to make mixtures of 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.090
 colors and it will become ory first 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.449
 I need I will paint rather towards 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.310
 the middle leaving a little space 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.389
 between blue and white and once 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.039
 that I have not in the middle I will 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.750
 come make the outline directly from the 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.550
 White 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.470
 so you know just now I did 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.140
 well right for it to go well 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.140
 everything and ballan make love 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.160
 why does it really have to be good 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.590
 right because otherwise it would not come out 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:42.520
 the same effect as if you have 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:44.830
 sloppy and it's white as if the 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.320
 pretty clear colors so like others 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.530
 colors like yellow stuff like 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.360
 it 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.820
 do not hesitate to spend two layers 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.410
 on years it is rather the same 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.200
 recommended since it's my vote 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.580
 open again the color because below 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.100
 and not the new color so I 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.170
 have passed two layers personally 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.490
 after you do as you want by 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.660
 against was waiting for that painting 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.490
 is finished drying to get to 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.990
 second project because otherwise it's going 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.990
 give it back to try rice 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.030
 so after I'm going to show you the 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.199
 painting once I finish them and 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:37.669
 the ring that I made two sides in 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.900
 white here we are now we'll go to 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.460
 the design stage as he took me a 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.290
 brush your varnish sticks a lot I 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.320
 lead varnish liquid glue because 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.820
 it is more convenient 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.310
 then stupidity not to do and that I 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.960
 has the comb combed directly and 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.610
 especially not directly by doing the 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.620
 two colors same time makes color 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.240
 by color because otherwise the color 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.699
 the darker is going to rub off on the more 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.990
 clear and it's going to be a mix 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:02.210
 of colors and it will give something 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.440
 horrible I had to iron white because 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.830
 that the blues had rubbed off on the 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.210
 white so this color everywhere their 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.090
 start with the craziest color 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.100
 the clearer advance your brush 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.419
 then switch to the darkest color 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.470
 it's really a council because 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.470
 otherwise it makes it horrible 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.030
 so here is my video is almost 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.340
 finished I hope you will have pleased and 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.080
 we find ourselves in a future tutorial 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.770
 more do not hesitate to go to my blog 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.770
 bye
