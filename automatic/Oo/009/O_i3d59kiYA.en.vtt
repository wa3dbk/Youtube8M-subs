okay now if we discuss the interest

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.929 
okay now if we discuss the interest

they been affecting any of the precious

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.039 
they been affecting any of the precious
metals<00:01:26.400> much<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.880> far<00:01:27.119> or<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.659> it

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
metals much so far or do you think it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.539 
metals much so far or do you think it
will<00:01:28.140> start<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.560> give<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.369> an<00:01:29.460> impact

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
will start to give more of an impact

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.140 
will start to give more of an impact
when<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.990> hike<00:01:31.340> hike<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
when we do see a hike hike and a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.910 
when we do see a hike hike and a
realization<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> issue<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.710> much

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
realization is not the issue it's much

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.490 
realization is not the issue it's much
more<00:01:35.100> investors<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:36.049> expectations<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.170> play

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
more investors in expectations that play

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.580 
more investors in expectations that play
a<00:01:37.530> role<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> near<00:01:39.810> future<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
a role but in the in the near future the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
a role but in the in the near future the
market<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.400> focused<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> Fed<00:01:42.450> that's

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
market is so focused on the Fed that's

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.330 
market is so focused on the Fed that's
probably<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.140> will<00:01:43.290> not<00:01:43.500> play<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
probably it will not play that that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670 
probably it will not play that that
major<00:01:44.700> role<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.479> would<00:01:45.540> expect<00:01:45.780> one

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
major role that one would expect one

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.830 
major role that one would expect one
should<00:01:46.890> probably<00:01:47.340> look<00:01:47.520> rather<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:48.329> central

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
should probably look rather at central

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960 
should probably look rather at central
bank's<00:01:49.140> action<00:01:49.560> emerging<00:01:50.250> central<00:01:50.640> banks

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
bank's action emerging central banks

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.840 
bank's action emerging central banks
there<00:01:51.240> might<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.560> natural<00:01:52.560> buyers<00:01:52.799> willing<00:01:53.549> to

there might be natural buyers willing to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.810 
there might be natural buyers willing to
