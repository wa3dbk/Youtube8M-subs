00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
because this is really hot let's go up a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.240 
because this is really hot let's go up a
little<00:00:56.129> bit<00:00:56.280> that's<00:00:56.699> okay<00:00:57.920> now<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
little bit that's okay now I'm going to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.930

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.160 
seal it up when I usually shake it it's
a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.149> easier<00:01:03.270> than<00:01:03.570> storing<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.019> because

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
a little easier than storing it because

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410 
a little easier than storing it because
you<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.710> most<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> may<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.119> let
