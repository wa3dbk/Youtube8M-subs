00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
all it made me mad if you think about it

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.610 
all it made me mad if you think about it
but<00:03:08.540> folks<00:03:08.720> like<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.900> said<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.170> graphics<00:03:09.530> were

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
Jeff Hardy was I think it's one of the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.720 
Jeff Hardy was I think it's one of the
last<00:03:14.450> games<00:03:14.570> Jeff<00:03:14.840> Hardy<00:03:15.080> was<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.380> we<00:03:15.890> the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
last games Jeff Hardy was in we the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.010 
last games Jeff Hardy was in we the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.949 
the time I mean it looked good for even
now<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:19.730> don't<00:03:19.940> know<00:03:20.060> why<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.239> graph<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.600> went

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
now I don't know why the graph is went

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.380

now<00:03:39.830> one<00:03:40.010> thing<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.910> game<00:03:40.970> got<00:03:41.270> right<00:03:41.450> was

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
now one thing this game got right was

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.590 
now one thing this game got right was
the<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:42.320> ECW<00:03:42.920> thing<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.760> table<00:03:44.390> thing

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
the the ECW thing that the table thing

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.820 
the the ECW thing that the table thing
we<00:03:44.750> can<00:03:44.930> pick<00:03:45.080> new<00:03:45.170> weapons<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.560> then<00:03:45.709> that

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
we can pick new weapons and then that

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.140 
we can pick new weapons and then that
was<00:03:45.980> cool<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.310> can<00:03:46.400> stop<00:03:46.550> apples<00:03:46.820> on<00:03:46.910> fire

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
was cool you can stop apples on fire

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.880 
was cool you can stop apples on fire
that<00:03:47.810> was<00:03:47.930> cool<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.200> mean<00:03:48.440> even<00:03:48.709> though<00:03:48.830> you

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
that was cool I mean even though you

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.130 
that was cool I mean even though you
know<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.520> weapons<00:03:49.820> really<00:03:50.060> have<00:03:50.180> an<00:03:50.570> effector

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
know the weapons really have an effector

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.560 
know the weapons really have an effector
and<00:03:51.290> ever<00:03:51.410> they<00:03:51.560> just<00:03:51.739> kind<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.420> happened

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
and ever they just kind of happened

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.030 
and ever they just kind of happened
I<00:03:53.630> mean<00:03:53.810> if<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:53.930> think<00:03:54.050> about<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:54.650> for

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
I mean if you think about it like for

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.040 
I mean if you think about it like for
instance<00:03:55.480> he's<00:03:56.480> gonna<00:03:56.570> go<00:03:56.720> through<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.900> table
