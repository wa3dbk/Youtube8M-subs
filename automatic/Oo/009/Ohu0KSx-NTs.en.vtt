00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello my name is Michael 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.819
 did a review on the Chinese Oleg I have 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 already on preparing three sets of new 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.500
 years today we have a series of dinosaur park 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.700
 before the tow what name to call 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 the manufacturer is completely unknown to me 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.680
 and some doctor lac either this series so 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.580
 called here below is something written 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.100
 in Chinese 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.890
 for japanese i don't know them in korean 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.119
 and doctor lock plate building blocks in 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.790
 spring of use 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.149
 doctor varnish playing building blocks and create 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.700
 our future or what is in this spirit that I 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.100
 chose diplodocus there was a big series 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.430
 going on is depicted as we like this 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.660
 how is it obscene for ward abstract 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.740
 even pterodactyl which is similar to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.320
 the plane and this is ours 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.280
 I do not know apparently some kind of breed on 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:02.480
 stegosaurus 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:07.430
 and inside we have a package and accordingly 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.990
 instruction on one big sheet of package 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:19.010
 so I understand we have two packages, let's 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:21.110
 open judging by the clones of lego chima where 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.740
 a big bird was going to expect us 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.840
 disappointment because the bird was 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.240
 very realistic that you will not 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.800
 dinosaur me as most likely already the same 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.010
 the most because in the picture he's already 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.320
 will be somehow frivolous let's 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.770
 unpack the package i will tell what 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.960
 plastic feels so here these 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.790
 the details here in my got the forest military 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:50.780
 brik series everything is pretty soft and good 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.770
 yes softly dressed so but not so 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.770
 bad as I thought 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.030
 this in size will eventually 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.969
 dinosaur 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.369
 the essence of everything is not a big dinosaur 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.930
 consists of several blocks here 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.729
 shown as a result of all the blocks 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.720
 gather together here is the beginning 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.590
 going to block this is his body then 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.959
 block b is the head and neck and so on as 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.910
 I understand Dr. Varnish is not a name 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.160
 Of course manufacturer manufacturer 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.890
 called us 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.900
 shantou gepai plastics up arrow ltd 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.700
 as written on this piece of paper which 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.640
 outgrown everything was useful for all the time and not 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.160
 prevented the fact that stuck all 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.750
 surface but here are the series itself 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.310
 constructors from this produced rather 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.010
 total called doctor lacquer fight 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.180
 so I am voicing 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.519
 name of the constructor for the inscription in the left 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.160
 top corner as always 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.319
 time collecting the first block for a long time i 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.099
 remembered that I forgot to mention the amount 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.640
 details 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.250
 and 145 of them here because the block 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.900
 was going very long and just like 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.680
 a bunch of stuck together details I even 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.239
 once confused a little at the end a 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.260
 cost 180 m cost set from 180 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.019
 rubles 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.560
 and in the meantime I have already collected the neck and 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.459
 confused more precisely mixed up 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.500
 few details here that are at the junction 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.359
 cervical vertebrae it because even with 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.609
 childhood when i was picking a set i 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:28.690
 spent forward on instructions not 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.410
 inspect and and tried to get ahead of it so 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.350
 say and wrong all the time such things 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.680
 this is this dinosaur legs 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.519
 dinosaur although it looks like a robot's legs but 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.400
 for lego it will forgive this many here 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.370
 it is his tail yuschy head and it is 4 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.970
 spare parts now we will collect 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.359
 putting together the whole diplodok is similar to 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.670
 diplodocus a little more than a few 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.290
 However, he has good plastic quality. 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.970
 and I will be happy to sort it out later. 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.850
 details and on the shelf he basically 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.220
 will look it can be left in 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.000
 different poses because he bends 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.820
 feet and knees 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.699
 tail is vraschyaetsya head was 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.340
 takes different forms and think my 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:21.190
 the amount of 180 rubles he justifies a 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.740
 Thank you all for your attention.
