justice or even if you're just playing
the<00:00:35.160> game<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.360> go<00:00:36.540> into<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.780> slow-mo<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
the game it would go into a slow-mo and

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.889 
the game it would go into a slow-mo and
everything<00:00:39.149> would<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.510> slow<00:00:39.719> motion

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
everything would just be in slow motion

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.130 
everything would just be in slow motion
it<00:00:40.140> was<00:00:40.200> horrible<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.510> way<00:00:42.960> they

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
it was horrible and the the way they

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.709 
it was horrible and the the way they
patched<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.950> Steam<00:00:44.399> was<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.270> put<00:00:45.600> in

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
