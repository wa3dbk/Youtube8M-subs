just go to design articles and type two

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.639 
just go to design articles and type two
keywords<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.450> there<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.720> find<00:02:08.869> an<00:02:09.019> article<00:02:09.319> I

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
keywords in there and find an article I

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.199 
keywords in there and find an article I
would<00:02:09.860> just<00:02:10.129> find<00:02:10.310> something<00:02:10.729> that's<00:02:11.029> already

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
would just find something that's already

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.290 
would just find something that's already
been<00:02:11.629> written<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.230> you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
been written and you

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.590 
been written and you
rewrite<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:14.050> my<00:02:14.170> head<00:02:14.410> or<00:02:14.740> quickly<00:02:15.600> put

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
rewrite that in my head or quickly put

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.860 
rewrite that in my head or quickly put
something<00:02:16.960> together<00:02:18.090> not<00:02:19.090> everybody's<00:02:19.630> as

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
something together not everybody's as

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.270 
something together not everybody's as
quick<00:02:20.140> as<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.710> that<00:02:20.800> everybody's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
quick as that and that everybody's

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.770 
quick as that and that everybody's
thought<00:02:21.550> process<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.890> change<00:02:24.270> change<00:02:25.270> what

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
thought process can change change what

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.380 
thought process can change change what
they<00:02:25.930> see<00:02:25.990> on<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:27.190> computer<00:02:27.670> into<00:02:27.910> something

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
they see on the computer into something

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.420 
they see on the computer into something
in<00:02:28.510> their<00:02:28.660> own<00:02:28.780> head<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.050> type<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.620> out<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:30.160> I

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
in their own head and type it out so I

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.790 
in their own head and type it out so I
realized<00:02:31.150> that's<00:02:31.480> another<00:02:31.810> factor<00:02:32.110> you'll

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
realized that's another factor you'll

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.920 
realized that's another factor you'll
have<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.250> deal<00:02:33.460> with<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.940> how<00:02:34.090> fast<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.600> can<00:02:34.660> do

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
have to deal with is how fast you can do

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.040 
have to deal with is how fast you can do
that<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:37.120> basically<00:02:37.360> how<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.810> got

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
that but it's basically how I got

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.770 
that but it's basically how I got
started<00:02:38.430> nothing<00:02:39.430> special<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.210> didn't<00:02:40.450> use<00:02:40.630> any

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
started nothing special I didn't use any

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.130 
started nothing special I didn't use any
software<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.350> didn't<00:02:41.740> use<00:02:41.920> any<00:02:42.670> ppl<00:02:43.450> our<00:02:43.780> stuff

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
software I didn't use any ppl our stuff

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.280 
software I didn't use any ppl our stuff
no<00:02:44.770> I<00:02:45.070> just<00:02:45.580> looked<00:02:46.540> at<00:02:46.660> an<00:02:46.810> article<00:02:47.230> and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
no I just looked at an article and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.070 
no I just looked at an article and
rewrote<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:47.830> my<00:02:47.920> head<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:49.360> got<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.960> where

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
rewrote it in my head and I got to where

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.450 
rewrote it in my head and I got to where
I<00:02:50.110> was<00:02:50.200> putting<00:02:50.470> three<00:02:50.650> or<00:02:50.770> four<00:02:50.980> out<00:02:51.130> an<00:02:51.310> hour

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
I was putting three or four out an hour

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.810 
I was putting three or four out an hour
doing<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.720> mean<00:02:53.220> once<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.370> do<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.700> a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
doing that so I mean once you do it a

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.340 
doing that so I mean once you do it a
few<00:02:54.850> times<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.600> just<00:02:55.690> getting<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.020> routine

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
few times and you just getting a routine

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.020 
few times and you just getting a routine
you'll<00:02:56.590> just<00:02:56.740> get<00:02:56.890> quicker<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.370> quicker<00:02:57.760> and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
you'll just get quicker and quicker and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.820 
you'll just get quicker and quicker and
quicker<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.780> probably<00:02:59.020> start<00:02:59.440> off<00:02:59.620> like

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
quicker you you probably start off like

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.430 
quicker you you probably start off like
that<00:03:00.100> because<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:01.990> not<00:03:02.260> going<00:03:02.380> to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
that because it's just not going to

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.310 
that because it's just not going to
happen<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:03.330> takes<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.450> little<00:03:04.570> thought<00:03:04.810> process

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
happen it takes a little thought process

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.620 
happen it takes a little thought process
to<00:03:05.590> look<00:03:06.040> at<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.250> keywords<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.880> then<00:03:07.000> redo<00:03:07.510> in

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
to look at the keywords and then redo in

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.360 
to look at the keywords and then redo in
your<00:03:07.780> head<00:03:07.930> but<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.650> can<00:03:08.800> get<00:03:08.950> pretty<00:03:09.070> good<00:03:09.220> at

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
your head but you can get pretty good at

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.720 
your head but you can get pretty good at
it<00:03:09.550> you<00:03:10.270> can<00:03:10.300> submit<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.960> sites<00:03:11.380> these<00:03:12.190> days<00:03:12.490> I
