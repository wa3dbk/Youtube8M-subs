what<00:00:11.790> those<00:00:12.000> frequencies<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:18.890> we<00:00:19.890> don't

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
what those frequencies are so we don't

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.490 
what those frequencies are so we don't
know<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.640> altitude<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.750> corridor

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
know what altitude it's the corridor

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.179 
know what altitude it's the corridor
probably<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.180> thousand<00:00:24.180> feet<00:00:24.330> or<00:00:24.510> below<00:00:24.630> and

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
probably is a thousand feet or below and

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.620 
probably is a thousand feet or below and
obviously<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.400> example<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> helicopters<00:00:27.449> can

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
obviously for example a helicopters can

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.060 
obviously for example a helicopters can
go<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> way<00:00:28.170> down<00:00:28.320> right<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> water

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
go all the way down right to the water

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.950 
go all the way down right to the water
because<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.910> land<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> pier<00:00:30.750> so

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
because they have to land on the pier so

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.100 
because they have to land on the pier so
it's<00:00:31.650> there's<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.009> maximum<00:00:32.550> altitude

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
it's there's a maximum altitude

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.580 
it's there's a maximum altitude
restriction<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:35.300> minimums<00:00:36.300> tend<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:37.110> just

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
restriction and minimums tend to be just

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.799 
restriction and minimums tend to be just
staying<00:00:38.370> away<00:00:38.730> from<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.210> sides<00:00:39.480> from

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
staying away from the sides from

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.590 
staying away from the sides from
buildings<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.649> nobody<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.550> focuses<00:00:42.420> on

buildings but nobody really focuses on

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.970 
buildings but nobody really focuses on
that<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.930> reason<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> maximum<00:00:43.860> altitude

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that the reason for the maximum altitude

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.010 
that the reason for the maximum altitude
is<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.579> want<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> make<00:00:45.000> sure<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.809> these

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
is you want to make sure that these

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
is you want to make sure that these
airplanes<00:00:46.410> stay<00:00:46.860> away<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.390> commercial

airplanes stay away from commercial

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
airplanes stay away from commercial
aircraft<00:00:48.899> which<00:00:49.200> fly<00:00:49.559> higher<00:00:49.890> than<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.340> who

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
aircraft which fly higher than that who

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.920 
aircraft which fly higher than that who
would<00:00:50.700> never<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.090> cleared<00:00:51.390> lower<00:00:51.600> than<00:00:51.840> this

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
would never be cleared lower than this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.779 
would never be cleared lower than this
typically<00:00:52.739> an<00:00:52.860> airplane<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> commercial

the<00:00:55.680> river<00:00:55.829> would<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.489> cleared<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.149> at

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the river would be cleared to go at

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.860 
the river would be cleared to go at
5,000<00:00:58.230> feet<00:00:58.730> 1,000<00:00:59.730> feet<00:00:59.910> being<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> maximum

sure that each other is safe rather than

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.229 
would be from the Teterboro Airport area
where<00:04:17.889> we<00:04:18.040> do<00:04:18.190> know<00:04:18.370> that<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.760> plane<00:04:19.030> had

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
where we do know that this plane had

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.420 
where we do know that this plane had
taken<00:04:19.479> off<00:04:19.720> from<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.680> that's<00:04:20.950> consistent

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
taken off from and so that's consistent

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.879 
taken off from and so that's consistent
whether<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.419> plane<00:04:22.720> was<00:04:23.020> in<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:23.229> process<00:04:23.740> of

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
whether that plane was in the process of

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.890 
whether that plane was in the process of
banking<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.520> turning<00:04:24.910> south<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.510> go<00:04:25.660> down

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
banking and turning south to go down

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.150 
banking and turning south to go down
towards<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.380> Statue<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.770> Liberty

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
towards the Statue of Liberty

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.129 
towards the Statue of Liberty
we<00:04:27.610> just<00:04:27.910> don't<00:04:28.060> know<00:04:28.330> they<00:04:28.570> would<00:04:28.780> not<00:04:28.960> be

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
we just don't know they would not be

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.020 
we just don't know they would not be
allowed<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.830> probably<00:04:30.520> would<00:04:30.700> have<00:04:30.790> known

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
allowed and probably would have known

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.700 
allowed and probably would have known
from<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.389> maps<00:04:31.690> that<00:04:31.930> they<00:04:32.080> could<00:04:32.320> not<00:04:32.500> go

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
from the maps that they could not go

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.860 
from the maps that they could not go
over<00:04:33.190> Manhattan<00:04:33.790> but<00:04:34.000> there<00:04:34.180> is<00:04:34.360> this<00:04:34.570> car

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
over Manhattan but there is this car

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.010 
over Manhattan but there is this car
tore<00:04:35.139> down<00:04:35.320> over<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.889> river<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.820> yes

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.350 

the<00:04:42.590> helicopter<00:04:43.220> had<00:04:43.340> already<00:04:43.520> turned<00:04:43.940> goin

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
the helicopter had already turned goin

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.720 
the helicopter had already turned goin
south<00:04:44.660> when<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.440> plane<00:04:45.680> came<00:04:46.070> but<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.460> first

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
south when the plane came but it first

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.000 
south when the plane came but it first
came<00:04:46.970> out<00:04:47.180> then<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:47.600> turns<00:04:47.900> south<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.890> was

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
came out then it turns south and it was

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.490 
came out then it turns south and it was
climbing<00:04:49.340> and<00:04:49.760> probably<00:04:50.330> between<00:04:50.570> 500<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:51.470> a

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
climbing and probably between 500 and a

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.590 
climbing and probably between 500 and a
thousand<00:04:51.980> feet<00:04:52.160> they'll<00:04:52.700> try<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:52.970> establish

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
thousand feet they'll try to establish

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.760 
thousand feet they'll try to establish
that<00:04:53.630> later<00:04:54.050> on<00:04:54.140> we'll<00:04:54.350> take<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.590> last

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
that later on we'll take the last

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.790 
that later on we'll take the last
question<00:04:54.890> I<00:04:55.310> would<00:04:55.460> take<00:04:55.610> too
