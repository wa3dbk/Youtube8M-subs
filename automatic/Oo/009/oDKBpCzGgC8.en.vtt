 rocket luck a few people have said 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.170

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.420
 at disagreement I was tired but 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.960
 chaos where I was 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.520
 do you know that when you sit in front of the pc 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.510
 and the ball comes in your direction and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.300

00:00:48.510 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.049
 Bauschild I jumped but vitali 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.100

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.189

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.560
 fable 3 all not so easy when 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.390
 you 're screaming like that already 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.320
 actually relatively easy if 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.380
 it is so euphoric and africa 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:11.340

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.340

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:23.590
 He takes himself directly , I meant the 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.580

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.080

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.120
 in such a horny hugo look this time 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.070
 roll to the template with such a make 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.530

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:16.900

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:18.549
 control is so ok that was now 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.170
 Maybe not such a good idea though 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:28.410
 but at a fallback and now 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.410
 then bring in, I hope 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.800
 shame their ice had been 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.360
 with controller it is so much hornier 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.020

 hashtag fable 3 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.120

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.709
 that he has many chances against us though 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:25.110

 How about a zero to complete 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.010
 all ice have also made 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.320

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.850
 you also have to be off if your opponent 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:48.150

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.150
 Go ahead with you quietly 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.380
 He is still a good time I was 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.940
 not because I've just behind Buss 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.130
 collected because I help the sector 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.550
 I wish I could not do it 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.550

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:38.580

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.900
 the thermic blue 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.630

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.020

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.919
 and since we recorded that together 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.020
 was very nice but you can see 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.030
 super little in the play put on 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.070
