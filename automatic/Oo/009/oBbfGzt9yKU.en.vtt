00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.720
 and now youtube your pick szeged and 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.790
 Welcome to a quick guide to know 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.280
 what to buy before under 4 leaves 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.080
 the purpose is to look for a good price and a 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.700
 good performance goal two 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.119
 computers two different purposes 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.489
 the option is to run paul 4 on low 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.529
 low resolution quality but nevertheless 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.360
 that has a good playability of 50 to 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.829
 60 frames per second nothing of just 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.140
 run not have a good experience 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.360
 play and the option sees is to play it 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.800
 well at more than 60 frames per second 60 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.210
 or more frames per second on high 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.980
 quality and in high resolution is 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.870
 obviously but both computers are 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.360
 govern by the same principle that is the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.620
 to find as cheaply as possible and 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.360
 that we can find some 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.130
 more expensive computers and they're going to have 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.540
 much better performance or even things from 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.550
 new generation that just came out 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.710
 but here the important thing is to find a 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.390
 good relationship between price and performance 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.970
 between the chosen parts we leave out 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.070
 what would be keyboards monitors everything 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.320
 peripheral including disk trays 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.940
 or operating system including prices 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.560
 of reference and the list of feet is in 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.689
 the description everything is taken out of the 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.520
 amazon.com page and remember 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.990
 convert to your local currency and consider 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.520
 shipping costs since not all 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.570
 Products can be imported from 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.490
 amazon last 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.170
 can find content of value fil 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.180
 if they are interested and without more or more 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.620
 let's start with the two options do 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.780
 click on what you think 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.940
 relevant let's start with the computer 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.740
 to today we are going to put all the pieces in 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.369
 this time we chose the cooler version 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.869
 master hub 912 this tower media cabinet 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.479
 It is perfect for our construction 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.770
 what are we going to do with our computer 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.150
 then the processor will follow that rather 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.610
 on that we are going to base on what 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.200
 pieces choose from one side we have md and 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.180
 on the other side intel to choose the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.630
 what you like most about aemead we already have 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.390
 the fx 4.130 or intel we have the option 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.399
 of li3 3.220 you usually have the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.380
 idea that intel is more than performance and 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.570
 it costs more and the other side we have 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.369
 md it costs less price but it has 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.430
 higher performance in relation to that price 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.710
 in this case they are very similar really 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.380
 the difference of 20 dollars they have 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.670
 on screen is very limited previously 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.200
 all the games are going to respond the same 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.789
 since this level of processors 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.990
 basic really is not much the 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.000
 difference rather it's a matter of 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.500
 preferences and you choose md o 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.940
 intel later depending on what 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.220
 have written the processor we can with 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.230
 a mother card both micro cards to 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.970
 tx I chose them because of the fact 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.650
 so cheap although the problem with them 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.750
 is that they do not really have that many 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.459
 ram memory slots just like 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.590
 many expansion ports only 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.900
 really have in practical purposes 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.700
 a renewed useful expansion for what 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.620
 would be games for the case of ahmed 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.569
 we have it reached 78 lmt and s2 and for 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.950
 intel side we have the ms and h 61 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.170
 mig-31 in terms of ram memory though 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.450
 4 is worth as a minimum requirement 4 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.129
 gigabytes gb is not expensive for 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.349
 our computer we came up with the package 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.360
 of two memories of 4 gigabytes each 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.280
 of adapt if we go to what are the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.470
 video cards here again we have 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.329
 a dilemma between the cards 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.970
 nvidia video or video cards 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.720
 of aemead if they choose nvidia we have the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.849
 option of what would be the gtx 650 and of 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.720
 of gea or aemet we have the option of 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.030
 the asus h of 7,790 and which is better in what 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.940
 particular the 7,790 has better 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.250
 performance than the GTX 650 and in fact 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.049
 It is also cheaper and asus is in fact 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.579
 with this version because the version that 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.930
 makes his video cards 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.730
 lately they have 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.290
 very good heating ie it cools down 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.090
 very easily compared to other 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.180
 cards then because they could 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.900
 prefer what the gtx 650 would be about 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.180
 the 7,790 h despite this mask 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.469
 rather it is a question of tastes and uses 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.209
 because if you are looking for a 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.829
 card that has the possibility to have 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.349
 the cuda technology that has envy 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.790
 for certain applications the gtx is a 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.019
 very good option as soon as 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.719
 data storage 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.269
 we chose the seagate barracuda 500 gb 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:54.519
 7200 revolutions per minute there is no 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.349
 much to think here 7200 revolutions 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.780
 per minute of a good disc 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.549
 ability of a recognized brand is a 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.980
 good option finally the source of 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.079
 can be known 500 x 500 watts 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.939
 obviously it is an excellent source of 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.620
 power at a very good price for this 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.930
 team depending on the direction they have 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.019
 chosen this constant team 510 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.730
 dollars and 545 dollars at most and 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.979
 that here is the option to play under 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.049
 phil 4 the economical version and also not 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.669
 sacrifice the gameplay if they want to see 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.780
 the computer option b can leave 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.340
 run the video or if they are already 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.539
 satisfied can click on the 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.180
 annotation to go to the end of the video and 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.800
 the farewell to option b we have a 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.159
 very good cabinet starting to put in 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.539
 this x x tower phantom completes this 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.000
 in less than 100 dollars you have the option 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.740
 even to mount a liquid implement 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.240
 made by you is not totally good 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.400
 made by you but made to measure 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.680
 very good ventilation very good space 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.120
 good size and compatible with the card 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.740
 mother that we are going to use and with all 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.849
 the components in the case of 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.389
 processors can find two 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.570
 variants 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.580
 intel or amd here the difference between 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.919
 prices and the difference in performance is 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.020
 much greater tried manu the advantage in 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.090
 As for games, although md plays 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.310
 better in other tasks where they are required 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.099
 more intel cores intel has in the and 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.289
 5 3700 k that it is possible to make a 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.909
 overclock later if you like and 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.210
 on the md side we have a comparative 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:15.159
 more or less similar to the 8.350 fx that yes 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.860
 well it's not the same performance of what 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.020
 would i5 with md can save a 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.970
 little more money and maybe even more 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.759
 money if they decide to leave for an option 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.409
 cheaper as the 6,300 fx is more 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.419
 well a matter of tastes and especially of 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.340
 your budget as mother cards 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.610
 if you took the intel processor 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.919
 they have the eight hundred 77 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.090
 the x- axis is a very good option even in 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.889
 the ability to add a second 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.870
 video card if you need it 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.969
 It is a very easy card to install and 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.090
 very easy to use for md we have the 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.889
 gigabyte gea 990fx 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.840
 of 3 which is very similar the asus for 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.490
 Intel also has the ability to 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.830
 add a second video card 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.479
 sata3 and everything else regarding the 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.250
 ram memory there is not much difference in 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.629
 comparison to the team only the 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.789
 brand and the frequency in which they run 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:03.159
 the memories that is 1600 megahertz 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.689
 here we have the preserve jens of 8 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.009
 gigabytes that since that time it 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:08.080
 will perform as one of the best 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.610
 RAM computer games 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.219
 if we talk about video cards there are two 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.960
 options again more in between md and what 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:17.229
 that would be envy for the option of 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.090
 nvidia we have a asus gtx 670 very good 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.310
 performance in fact they are very quiet and 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.719
 very good refrigeration what they have and 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.199
 from aemead we already have the option 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:27.879
 of the 7,970 hd of three gigabytes fits 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.680
 emphasize that memory is not a factor 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:32.319
 recessive between both cards although 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.669
 value 4 I recommend 3 gigabytes although what 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.710
 more sure is that performance between both 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.289
 cards are very similar having a 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.210
 very little advantage when oxidizing the gtx 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.550
 670 about the hd 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.280
 1970 rather it is reduced between that 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.229
 md or more like envy and if you have your 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.530
 three gigabytes in the place of 2 gb 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:52.030
 of the gtx 670 for storage what 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.680
 recommended would be to have a unit 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.210
 solid state seemed operational and the 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.039
 games like the kingston could be 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.210
 120 gb ssd now of 300 and also have a 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.740
 option of a hard drive with higher 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.479
 capacity as follows and barracuda of 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.130
 500 gigabytes as we saw in the option 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.780
 if you can not get the unit 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.610
 solid state no problem equally 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.009
 with what would be a hard drive like the 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.870
 what I mentioned to you is more than enough and 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.780
 finally the source of power to know 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.880
 cx 750 watts more than enough to 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.919
 this computer thought this wattage 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.330
 more than anything in case you want to put 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.190
 a second video pack some 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.690
 liquid cooling or just looking 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.729
 a source of power that can last 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.259
 years more depending on what part they have 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:32.680
 chosen the computer must cost 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:34.120
 between 900 34 dollars and one thousand 70 dollars 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.250
 all this thought so that they have more than 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.370
 60 frames per second in ultra quality 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.919
 or even larger amounts of pictures 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.300
 per second 140 frames with seconds 120 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.370
 frames per second if you have the 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.300
 Necessary monitor in lower qualities 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.340
 as a medium 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.539
 use high so here are two 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.520
 very good computers in their 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:52.900
 corresponding categories obviously 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.970
 You can modify the parts according to 

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.590
 your needs cost or tastes since what 

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.210
 I present here is just an example 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.710
 I hope you liked it please 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.720
 share and rate the video if you 

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.400
 it was useful to go to the channel and its content to 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.720
 who get to subscribe or follow me on 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.979
 the social networks that are in the 

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.539
 description the next screen 

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:11.490
 contains some videos that can be 

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:11.490
 of your interest and see you in the next
