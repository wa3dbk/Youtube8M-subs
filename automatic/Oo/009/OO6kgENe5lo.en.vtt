00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.630
 welcome back to cooking easy.com today 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.300
 we show you a very recipe 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.480
 simple and very interesting that of 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.520
 liquid caramel for decorations such as 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.410
 you can see this caramel remembers 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.880
 very topping found for 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.129
 example at the supermarket that comes 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.809
 precisely used to decorate is one 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.210
 very simple recipe we can 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.190
 just prepare at home and keep it 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.080
 for a long time 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.660
 first of all we have to prepare 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.670
 simple caramel and the only ones 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.180
 the ingredients we need are 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.589
 water and granulated sugar 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.930
 so let's take some sugar 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.449
 caster and we put it inside 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.729
 a pan and always better in this 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.920
 case use a non-stick pan 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.780
 so that it is easier even from 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.340
 to clean 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.590
 then we pour our sugar 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.790
 inside the pan and add 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.610
 then the water obviously all the doses e 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.530
 you will find the ingredients in ours 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.330
 site with all the information on this 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.300
 recipe then turn on the heat a 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.180
 medium-high to medium flame and wait 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.640
 precisely that the sugar starts at 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.990
 melt 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.090
 thanks to the water 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.540
 bubbles start to appear in the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.190
 meanwhile let's light the fire and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.170
 place a small saucepan on top 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.780
 with some water and we have to wait 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.220
 that this starts to boil the dose 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.640
 of sugar and water of 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.970
 caramel and 3 to 1 then three parts of 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.320
 sugar and water once in a while 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.360
 move the pan a little and after a few 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.310
 seconds you will see begin to form 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 of bubbles 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.150
 we must be careful because the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.690
 caramel tends to become dark immediately 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.660
 and the more we wait, the bitter it becomes 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.150
 personally we prefer a caramel 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.890
 that has this color 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.880
 now the caramel is almost ready the water 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.910
 it is therefore boiling very gently 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.670
 and pouring it on one side of the pan 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.050
 add the boiling water 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.900
 let's try to be very delicate 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.320
 during this operation because how 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.239
 you can see it creates some smoke 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.790
 so if you were working on a flame 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.819
 medium high now lower the flame that 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.579
 it must be rather delicate 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.999
 after reaching the water we leave 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:58.230
 cook again for about a minute then 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.230
 we should put out the fire 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:07.060
 through this process the caramel 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:10.389
 once it is cold it will be 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.239
 very creamy and you can do just that 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:17.230
 use it to decorate your sweets 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.329
 and your dishes so it's passed a 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.669
 other minutino see the consistency of the 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.120
 caramel now turn off the heat e 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:30.060
 we expect that it will cool down in 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.949
 this phase is still our recipe 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.230
 not ready as you can see 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:37.650
 the caramel is very liquid 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.900
 as it cools sugar 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.459
 will reach a very consistency 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.069
 creamy like this 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.079
 now you can for example put the 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.780
 your liquid caramel for decorations 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.000
 in a bottle, or you do not know 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.250
 capocci to decorate so let's see the 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.019
 texture that has is perfect this 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:05.229
 caramel is preserved for many many 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:07.540
 months you will just need to read anyway 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:10.229
 the expiry date of the sugar on 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.229
 box 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.959
 now that you know how to prepare the 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.780
 caramel for decorations you can 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.340
