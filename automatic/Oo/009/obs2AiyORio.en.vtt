boy hinge ankles and this here is pretty

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.069 
boy hinge ankles and this here is pretty
much<00:03:46.099> how<00:03:46.340> far<00:03:46.639> I<00:03:46.670> can<00:03:46.940> spread<00:03:47.239> his<00:03:47.450> legs<00:03:47.629> apart

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
much how far I can spread his legs apart

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.089 
much how far I can spread his legs apart
I<00:03:49.450> guess<00:03:50.450> what<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.780> armor<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.440> does<00:03:51.680> kind<00:03:52.069> of

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
I guess what the armor it does kind of

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.509 
I guess what the armor it does kind of
restrict<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:53.209> articulation<00:03:53.930> but<00:03:54.290> overall<00:03:55.159> I

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
restrict the articulation but overall I

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.420 
restrict the articulation but overall I
am<00:03:55.879> happy<00:03:56.209> with<00:03:56.420> it<00:03:56.629> even<00:03:57.319> though<00:03:57.470> it's<00:03:57.919> only

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
am happy with it even though it's only

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.050 
am happy with it even though it's only
spread<00:03:58.910> is<00:03:59.090> likes<00:03:59.329> this<00:03:59.750> far<00:04:00.199> apart<00:04:00.290> but<00:04:01.220> yeah

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
spread is likes this far apart but yeah

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.390 
spread is likes this far apart but yeah
I'm<00:04:02.449> okay<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.790> here's<00:04:04.790> nice<00:04:05.120> pose<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.870> him

great<00:05:13.610> figure<00:05:13.939> definitely<00:05:14.749> worth<00:05:14.870> picking<00:05:14.930> up

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
great figure definitely worth picking up

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.279 
great figure definitely worth picking up
him<00:05:16.219> and<00:05:16.249> Master<00:05:17.029> Chief<00:05:17.270> those<00:05:17.990> two<00:05:18.259> are

him and Master Chief those two are
really<00:05:18.770> good<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.370> as<00:05:20.300> far<00:05:20.479> as<00:05:20.539> his<00:05:20.779> height<00:05:21.080> he

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:21.439 
really good and as far as his height he

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.339 
really good and as far as his height he
stands<00:05:22.270> pretty<00:05:23.270> close<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.629> 19<00:05:23.870> inches<00:05:23.900> tall

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.860 
stands pretty close to 19 inches tall
and<00:05:24.560> again<00:05:25.490> Master<00:05:25.819> Chief<00:05:26.029> is<00:05:26.150> just<00:05:26.479> a<00:05:26.569> tad<00:05:26.840> bit

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
and again Master Chief is just a tad bit

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.890 
and again Master Chief is just a tad bit
overnight<00:05:27.400> so<00:05:28.400> here<00:05:28.909> they<00:05:29.060> are<00:05:29.090> standing<00:05:29.629> next

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
overnight so here they are standing next

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.279 
overnight so here they are standing next
to<00:05:30.110> each<00:05:30.169> other<00:05:30.379> and<00:05:31.449> since<00:05:32.449> he<00:05:32.870> is<00:05:32.990> 9<00:05:33.259> inches

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
to each other and since he is 9 inches

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.959 
to each other and since he is 9 inches
tall<00:05:33.979> he<00:05:34.340> would<00:05:34.490> be<00:05:34.580> definitely<00:05:34.819> shorter<00:05:35.360> than

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
tall he would be definitely shorter than

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.029 
tall he would be definitely shorter than
snake<00:05:37.969> here<00:05:38.270> it'll<00:05:39.020> be<00:05:39.199> putting<00:05:39.500> snake<00:05:39.770> right

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
snake here it'll be putting snake right

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.929 
snake here it'll be putting snake right
next<00:05:40.460> to<00:05:41.229> Spartan<00:05:42.229> is<00:05:42.379> you<00:05:42.590> could<00:05:42.740> see<00:05:43.189> he<00:05:43.550> is

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:43.939 
next to Spartan is you could see he is

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:47.830 
next to Spartan is you could see he is
way<00:05:44.360> short<00:05:45.039> compared<00:05:46.039> to<00:05:46.159> master<00:05:46.460> chief<00:05:46.840> so

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
way short compared to master chief so

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.200 
way short compared to master chief so
which<00:05:48.080> is<00:05:48.110> a<00:05:48.289> bit<00:05:48.500> disappointing<00:05:49.129> but<00:05:49.370> you're

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
which is a bit disappointing but you're

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.929 
which is a bit disappointing but you're
putting<00:05:50.389> your<00:05:50.860> halo<00:05:51.860> figures<00:05:52.279> together<00:05:52.460> they

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:52.939 
putting your halo figures together they

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:55.600 
putting your halo figures together they
would<00:05:53.120> stand<00:05:53.419> perfectly<00:05:54.080> fine<00:05:54.529> to<00:05:54.860> another

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
would stand perfectly fine to another

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.719 
would stand perfectly fine to another
but<00:05:56.419> just<00:05:56.930> don't<00:05:57.169> see<00:05:57.379> them<00:05:57.500> next<00:05:57.650> to<00:05:58.009> Metal

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
but just don't see them next to Metal

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.089 
but just don't see them next to Metal
Gear<00:05:58.789> stuff<00:05:59.150> because<00:05:59.449> they<00:05:59.659> will<00:05:59.990> not<00:06:00.229> stand

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
Gear stuff because they will not stand

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.730 
Gear stuff because they will not stand

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.820 
these guys and proportion is really good
since<00:06:13.610> halo<00:06:14.120> 4<00:06:14.419> their<00:06:14.900> proportions<00:06:15.379> a<00:06:15.620> little

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
since halo 4 their proportions a little

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.429 
since halo 4 their proportions a little
bit<00:06:15.919> different<00:06:16.279> than<00:06:16.580> halo<00:06:17.300> reach<00:06:17.599> their

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:18.439 
bit different than halo reach their

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:23.820 
bit different than halo reach their
skinnier<00:06:19.250> so<00:06:20.240> I<00:06:20.629> say<00:06:21.349> they're<00:06:21.759> perfectly<00:06:22.759> fine
