00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.090
 hey i always say as a tip as you do 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.339
 Mayonnaise itself delicious I finished 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.019
 Unfortunately , one buys today too often 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.499
 finished though as simple as that itself 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.629
 do 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.750
 all you need is 3 1 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.740
 yellow at 3 yolks about 250 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.849
 milliliters of oil 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.320
 We take her album which oil 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.109
 Cholesterol free thereby easier 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.910
 salt pepper about three tablespoons 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.529
 mustard and I give a bit too 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.240
 what's our own from our café de paris 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.279
 To meter to save the club 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.990
 even if wants to have 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:39.140
 you start to pull the eggs with the eggs 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:46.860
 bowl is the whole directly with 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:49.940
 Salt pepper as I said already 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.020
 a bit more pepper with balllover 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.020
 as I said three tablespoons 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 in the third and as I said a little 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.790
 breeze from the café de paris quite beautiful 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.790
 taste 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:18.490
 so the whole thing struck so first 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.750
 for now, the can travel 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.820
 Kitchen appliance needs everyone 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.780
 fall four hands for that reason the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.030
 maybe you can always just 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.550
 Assist because the oil has to be slow 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.979
 stir in with beating now 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.490
 otherwise clumped and the manege becomes it 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.060
 nothing but it is slow is good with me 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 hear 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.630
 here you can already see the mayonnaise 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.670
 has become stiff stiff I hit 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.360
 work a bit more and of the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.799
 pure lemon 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.750
 the lemon makes it a little bit more 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.340
 fresh then gives me a slight 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.689
 Acid also with it if the mayonnaise 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.119
 then the stiff consistency is reached 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.799
 So, as you can see from the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.750
 city that's it already again 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.970
 you 're done and you can fish 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.700
 meat furniture to potatoes to everything 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.860
 Serve what you like so easy 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.959
 is making mayonnaise ourselves and we 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.100
 wish you a lot of fun while cooking 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.100

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.530
