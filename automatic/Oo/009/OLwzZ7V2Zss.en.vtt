00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
he said any writing the point is that

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.709 
he said any writing the point is that
this<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> young<00:00:40.890> student<00:00:41.579> who<00:00:41.790> had<00:00:42.450> never

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
this was a young student who had never

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.240 
this was a young student who had never
learned<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.530> write<00:00:44.010> cursive<00:00:44.550> penmanship<00:00:45.200> and

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
learned to write cursive penmanship and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
learned to write cursive penmanship and
therefore<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.460> unable<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.000> read<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.750> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
therefore is unable to read it and that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.850 
therefore is unable to read it and that
led<00:00:49.680> me<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.809> lot<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
led me to think that there is a lot of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.970 
led me to think that there is a lot of
change<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.699> education<00:00:54.590> but<00:00:55.590> here

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
change going on in education but here

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.209 
change going on in education but here
it's<00:00:56.129> more<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.030> loss<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.649> art<00:00:58.920> of

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it's more on the loss of the art of

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.299 
it's more on the loss of the art of
handwriting<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.440> students<00:01:01.440> today<00:01:01.590> are<00:01:01.949> not

being<00:01:02.760> taught<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.270> way<00:01:03.390> many<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> us<00:01:04.320> were

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
being taught the way many of us were

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.310 
being taught the way many of us were
years<00:01:04.830> ago<00:01:05.040> whether<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> Palmer<00:01:06.750> method

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
all know is a computer keyboard and let

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140 
all know is a computer keyboard and let
us<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.320> punch<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:20.369> how<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.820> their

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
us to punch that's how they do their

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600 
us to punch that's how they do their
alphabet<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.710> how<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:23.070> learn<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
alphabet and that's how they learn to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.140 
alphabet and that's how they learn to
read<00:01:23.820> also<00:01:24.330> reading<00:01:25.140> not<00:01:25.860> cursive<00:01:26.610> ly<00:01:26.820> but

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
read also reading not cursive ly but

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.749 
read also reading not cursive ly but
reading<00:01:27.450> letters<00:01:28.320> from<00:01:28.650> books<00:01:28.950> letters<00:01:29.579> on

reading letters from books letters on
the<00:01:29.909> computer<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> revolution

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
the computer and this is a revolution

the computer and this is a revolution
eventually<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.960> may<00:01:34.140> mean<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.490> end<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
eventually it may mean the end of the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.870 
eventually it may mean the end of the
pen<00:01:36.500> one<00:01:37.500> implication<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.549> would<00:01:38.850> be

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
pen one implication of this would be

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.660 
pen one implication of this would be
that<00:01:39.680> who<00:01:40.680> knows<00:01:40.890> how<00:01:41.070> long<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.579> to

that who knows how long it's going to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.109 
that who knows how long it's going to
take<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.930> will<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.320> unable<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> read<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
50 or 100 years ago and this is a loss

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.789 
50 or 100 years ago and this is a loss
I'm<00:01:57.060> sure<00:01:57.299> there<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.570> compensating<00:01:58.320> factors

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
I'm sure there are compensating factors

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.670 
I'm sure there are compensating factors
and<00:01:59.100> yet<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> think<00:02:00.149> we're<00:02:00.899> losing<00:02:01.079> something

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and yet I think we're losing something

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.340 
and yet I think we're losing something
in<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> process<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:03.360> also<00:02:03.600> affects<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> way

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
in the process it also affects the way

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.639 
in the process it also affects the way
we<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.430> way<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.820> write<00:02:06.079> because<00:02:07.079> to

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
we think and the way we write because to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.830 
we think and the way we write because to
punch<00:02:07.950> out<00:02:08.190> something<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> keyboard<00:02:09.179> is

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
punch out something on a keyboard is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.690 
punch out something on a keyboard is
quite<00:02:10.050> different<00:02:10.410> from<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:11.069> hand

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
