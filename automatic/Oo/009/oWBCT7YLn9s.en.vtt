this<00:00:04.589> efficient<00:00:05.100> way<00:00:05.250> we<00:00:05.759> used<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.060> play

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
this efficient way we used to play

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.310 
this efficient way we used to play
around<00:00:07.160> this<00:00:08.160> typical<00:00:09.120> piece<00:00:09.330> piper<00:00:09.929> wings

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
around this typical piece piper wings

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.259 
around this typical piece piper wings
which<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> pure<00:00:11.219> attack<00:00:11.519> off<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.759> Cherokee

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
which is a pure attack off the Cherokee

and<00:00:14.049> we<00:00:14.440> have<00:00:14.650> in<00:00:14.860> fact<00:00:14.889> worked<00:00:15.429> on<00:00:15.670> it<00:00:15.790> this

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
and we have in fact worked on it this

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.929 
and we have in fact worked on it this
thought<00:00:16.689> is<00:00:16.869> being<00:00:17.080> semi-finished<00:00:17.770> this<00:00:18.610> part

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
thought is being semi-finished this part

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.240 
thought is being semi-finished this part
is<00:00:19.090> untouched<00:00:19.599> and<00:00:19.900> is<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.740> way<00:00:20.920> you're<00:00:21.130> gonna

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
is untouched and is the way you're gonna

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.300 
is untouched and is the way you're gonna
find<00:00:21.340> it<00:00:21.700> on<00:00:21.849> your<00:00:22.029> aeroplane<00:00:22.360> I<00:00:22.890> run<00:00:23.890> my<00:00:24.070> gauge

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
find it on your aeroplane I run my gauge

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.730 
find it on your aeroplane I run my gauge
over<00:00:24.700> here<00:00:24.910> whoops<00:00:25.300> there<00:00:25.660> we<00:00:25.900> go<00:00:26.110> what<00:00:26.529> should

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
over here whoops there we go what should

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.339 
over here whoops there we go what should
go<00:00:26.950> you<00:00:27.669> see<00:00:27.910> those<00:00:28.090> big<00:00:28.300> bounces<00:00:28.900> they<00:00:29.289> are

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
go you see those big bounces they are

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.759 
go you see those big bounces they are
unacceptable<00:00:30.310> now<00:00:31.210> this<00:00:31.990> is<00:00:32.199> course<00:00:32.410> we<00:00:32.650> don't

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
unacceptable now this is course we don't

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.500 
unacceptable now this is course we don't
even<00:00:32.980> have<00:00:33.129> to<00:00:33.250> talk<00:00:33.460> about<00:00:33.610> that's<00:00:34.150> just<00:00:34.239> a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
even have to talk about that's just a

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.850 
even have to talk about that's just a
pro<00:00:34.720> ship<00:00:34.930> but<00:00:35.110> that's<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.379> way<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.650> wings

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
pro ship but that's the way the wings

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.049 
pro ship but that's the way the wings
are<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.989> is<00:00:38.350> something<00:00:39.010> approaching<00:00:39.730> a

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
are here is something approaching a

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.110 
are here is something approaching a
finished<00:00:40.449> surface<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:41.739> you<00:00:41.800> see<00:00:42.220> we<00:00:42.910> got<00:00:43.059> a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
finished surface now you see we got a

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.900 
finished surface now you see we got a
smooth<00:00:43.690> smooth<00:00:44.350> flow<00:00:45.040> across<00:00:45.400> the<00:00:45.640> dial

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
smooth smooth flow across the dial

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.729 
smooth smooth flow across the dial
that's<00:00:46.329> going<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.539> keep<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.899> air<00:00:47.020> smooth<00:00:47.440> and

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
that's going to keep the air smooth and

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.940 
that's going to keep the air smooth and
it's<00:00:48.160> going<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.370> fly<00:00:48.579> fast<00:00:49.000> then<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
it's going to fly fast then the

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.950 
it's going to fly fast then the
equivalent<00:00:51.430> of<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:51.730> rivet<00:00:52.120> row<00:00:52.300> has<00:00:52.930> been

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
equivalent of this rivet row has been

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.729 
equivalent of this rivet row has been
covered<00:00:53.559> over<00:00:53.680> and<00:00:54.489> look<00:00:54.789> at<00:00:54.940> us<00:00:55.120> now<00:00:55.680> now<00:00:56.680> we

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
covered over and look at us now now we

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.569 
covered over and look at us now now we
can<00:00:57.370> fly<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:59.170> tools<00:00:59.440> we<00:00:59.770> use<00:00:59.949> for<00:01:00.219> this<00:01:00.370> a

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
can fly the tools we use for this a

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.639 
can fly the tools we use for this a
pretty<00:01:00.910> simple<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.719> straightforward<00:01:02.020> and

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
pretty simple and straightforward and

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.979 
pretty simple and straightforward and
you<00:01:02.739> can<00:01:02.920> make<00:01:03.100> them<00:01:03.250> for<00:01:03.430> yourself<00:01:03.899> there<00:01:04.899> are

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
you can make them for yourself there are

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.029 
you can make them for yourself there are
only<00:01:05.080> three<00:01:05.410> tools<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.970> one<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.680> just<00:01:08.710> put

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
only three tools this one you just put

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.779 
only three tools this one you just put
some<00:01:09.220> bondo<00:01:09.670> here<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:11.470> slide<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.580> like

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
some bondo here and we slide it like

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.440 
some bondo here and we slide it like
this<00:01:13.090> just<00:01:13.420> over<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:13.990> top<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.470> rivets<00:01:14.830> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this just over the top of the rivets and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.380 
this just over the top of the rivets and
we<00:01:16.450> avoid<00:01:17.080> touching<00:01:17.799> any<00:01:18.220> rubra<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.820> then<00:01:19.119> as

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
we avoid touching any rubra and then as

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.679 
we avoid touching any rubra and then as
we<00:01:19.600> get<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.110> end<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:21.369> just<00:01:21.479> flatten<00:01:22.479> it

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
we get to the end we just flatten it

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.760 
we get to the end we just flatten it
down<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.159> guys<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:25.750> really<00:01:26.110> simple

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
down and you guys that's really simple

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.580 
down and you guys that's really simple
this<00:01:27.759> other<00:01:28.150> section<00:01:28.540> which<00:01:29.320> is<00:01:29.470> an

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
this other section which is an

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.550 
this other section which is an
indentation<00:01:30.100> caused<00:01:31.060> by<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.930> baffle<00:01:32.380> that's

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
indentation caused by the baffle that's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.460 
indentation caused by the baffle that's
underneath<00:01:32.860> here<00:01:33.479> we're<00:01:34.479> just<00:01:34.509> going<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.930> put

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
underneath here we're just going to put

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.219 
underneath here we're just going to put
some<00:01:35.500> bondo<00:01:36.070> on<00:01:36.250> here<00:01:36.640> with<00:01:37.479> this<00:01:37.659> tool<00:01:37.930> in<00:01:38.110> it

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
some bondo on here with this tool in it

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.399 
some bondo on here with this tool in it
bend<00:01:38.710> into<00:01:38.950> an

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
bend into an

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.710 
bend into an
even<00:01:39.799> flow<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.759> then<00:01:40.969> with

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
even flow and then with

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.179 
even flow and then with
right<00:01:42.020> now

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
right now

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.309 
right now
there's<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.179> love<00:01:45.390> bridge<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.929> you<00:01:45.990> might<00:01:46.170> have

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
there's a love bridge and you might have

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.050 
there's a love bridge and you might have
seen<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.249> bridge<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.969> be

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
seen it and that bridge is going to be

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
seen it and that bridge is going to be
filled<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:48.450> bond<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:52.130> you're<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.219> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
filled with bond that is you're going to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.429 
filled with bond that is you're going to
use<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.700> piece<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.000> sandpaper<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.929> a<00:01:54.990> shaped

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
use a piece of sandpaper on a shaped

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
use a piece of sandpaper on a shaped
block<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.310> very<00:01:56.640> important<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.420> use<00:01:57.569> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
block it's very important to use a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.929 
block it's very important to use a
shaped<00:01:57.990> block<00:01:58.289> because<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.520> you're

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
shaped block because if you don't you're

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
shaped block because if you don't you're
going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> get<00:02:00.270> long<00:02:00.539> sections<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.289> we<00:02:01.350> can't

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
going to get long sections and we can't

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.679 
going to get long sections and we can't
have<00:02:01.799> flat<00:02:02.069> sections<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> wing<00:02:02.969> they've

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
have flat sections on a wing they've

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.289 
have flat sections on a wing they've
gotta<00:02:03.929> have<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.200> constant<00:02:04.859> curvature

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
gotta have a constant curvature

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.199 
gotta have a constant curvature
otherwise<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.599> air<00:02:06.929> just<00:02:07.380> trips<00:02:07.709> and<00:02:08.209> will

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
otherwise the air just trips and will

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
on this section we got to let it dry

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.730 
on this section we got to let it dry
first

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740

ready<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.750> work<00:03:21.240> okay<00:03:22.240> now<00:03:23.140> we<00:03:23.200> get<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.440> little

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
ready to work okay now we get a little

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.890 
ready to work okay now we get a little
bomb<00:03:23.980> dough<00:03:24.190> mixed<00:03:24.580> to<00:03:25.090> do<00:03:25.240> this<00:03:25.420> line<00:03:25.720> of

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
bomb dough mixed to do this line of

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.620 
bomb dough mixed to do this line of
rivets<00:03:26.230> I've<00:03:27.190> put<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.580> straight<00:03:27.880> edge<00:03:28.090> down<00:03:28.420> the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
rivets I've put a straight edge down the

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.020 
rivets I've put a straight edge down the
edge<00:03:28.720> here<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:30.160> we<00:03:30.310> can<00:03:30.490> have<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.700> guide

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
edge here so that we can have a guide

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.390 
edge here so that we can have a guide
for<00:03:31.330> our<00:03:31.420> two<00:03:31.720> they<00:03:32.440> will<00:03:32.650> subtract<00:03:33.370> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
for our two they will subtract the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.130 
for our two they will subtract the
rivers<00:03:33.820> at<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.000> back<00:03:34.300> because<00:03:34.600> if<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.870> get

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
rivers at the back because if you get

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.070 
rivers at the back because if you get
Bhandar<00:03:35.860> on<00:03:36.010> them<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:36.490> hard<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.850> get<00:03:37.000> out<00:03:37.080> so

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
Bhandar on them it's hard to get out so

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.030 
Bhandar on them it's hard to get out so
here<00:03:38.440> we<00:03:38.620> go

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
here we go

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.850 
here we go
dalek<00:03:39.459> all<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.570> bondo<00:03:41.020> in<00:03:41.050> play

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.990 

oh<00:03:46.890> yeah<00:03:47.900> one<00:03:48.900> goes<00:03:49.170> down<00:03:49.880> now<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.500> move<00:03:52.500> this

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
oh yeah one goes down now I move this

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.510 
oh yeah one goes down now I move this

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
specially for him to with bladder first

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.790 
specially for him to with bladder first
and<00:03:56.850> then<00:03:57.030> half<00:03:57.360> we<00:03:57.750> come<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.320> give<00:03:58.470> us<00:03:58.620> the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
and then half we come to give us the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.690 
and then half we come to give us the
shape<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.310> want

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
shape we want

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.850 
shape we want
we're<00:04:00.510> trying<00:04:00.870> clear<00:04:01.320> verb<00:04:01.590> riveted

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.860 

bubbles<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.850> we

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
bubbles that we

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.290 
bubbles that we
I<00:04:11.260> didn't<00:04:11.860> go<00:04:11.980> over<00:04:12.010> with<00:04:12.280> once<00:04:12.550> resolved<00:04:13.060> on

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
I didn't go over with once resolved on

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.600 
I didn't go over with once resolved on
their<00:04:13.510> first<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:14.620> was<00:04:14.769> a<00:04:14.890> good<00:04:15.040> idea<00:04:15.190> to<00:04:15.430> do

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
their first it was a good idea to do

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.580 
their first it was a good idea to do
that<00:04:15.819> first<00:04:16.180> then<00:04:16.480> you<00:04:16.930> get<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.079> nice<00:04:17.290> surface

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
that first then you get a nice surface

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:27.540 
that first then you get a nice surface
to<00:04:17.829> work<00:04:18.100> on<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:18.549> here<00:04:19.389> we<00:04:19.510> go<00:04:19.690> again

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.029 

I'm<00:04:28.000> running<00:04:28.509> a<00:04:28.629> little<00:04:28.900> short<00:04:29.139> on<00:04:29.560> longer

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
I'm running a little short on longer

maybe<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.550> can<00:04:35.820> use<00:04:36.000> them<00:04:36.210> for

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
maybe I can use them for

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.780 
maybe I can use them for
