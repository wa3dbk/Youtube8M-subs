obviously chose to go that way I just
snuck<00:01:58.600> around<00:01:58.750> and<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:01.270> have<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.080> feel<00:02:02.350> of<00:02:02.380> like

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
they took this game from which was a

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.920 
they took this game from which was a
pretty<00:02:11.860> cool<00:02:12.129> idea<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.940> know<00:02:13.629> they<00:02:13.780> took

games<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.269> they<00:02:16.959> put<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.260> into<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.560> one<00:02:17.769> game

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920

go<00:02:36.430> through<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.700> doors<00:02:36.939> because<00:02:37.180> we<00:02:37.420> pretty

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
go through the doors because we pretty

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.660 
go through the doors because we pretty
much<00:02:37.810> gonna<00:02:38.079> have<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.519> sneak<00:02:39.519> through

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
that we need I don't know what kind of

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.080 
that we need I don't know what kind of
document<00:03:06.189> that<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:06.639> as<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:06.849> can<00:03:06.909> see

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
document that is but as you can see

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.039 
document that is but as you can see
pretty<00:03:07.209> soon<00:03:07.420> there's<00:03:07.569> gonna<00:03:07.629> be<00:03:07.779> a<00:03:07.840> code

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
pretty soon there's gonna be a code

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.509 
pretty soon there's gonna be a code
right<00:03:08.230> here<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.469> flashes<00:03:08.829> on<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:08.980> screen<00:03:09.069> I

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
right here that flashes on the screen I

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.179 
right here that flashes on the screen I
put<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.510> code<00:03:10.689> below<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.230> link<00:03:11.529> of<00:03:11.889> the

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
put the code below to the link of the

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.739 
put the code below to the link of the
video<00:03:12.310> why<00:03:12.639> not<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.849> link<00:03:13.029> below<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.659> video

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:13.749 
video why not the link below the video

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:17.069 
video why not the link below the video
and<00:03:14.189> I<00:03:15.189> tried<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.790> already<00:03:15.939> on<00:03:16.150> Steam<00:03:16.480> doesn't

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
and I tried it already on Steam doesn't

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.750 
and I tried it already on Steam doesn't
do<00:03:17.170> anything<00:03:17.439> for<00:03:17.499> me<00:03:17.680> but<00:03:18.010> I'm<00:03:18.099> thinking<00:03:18.519> if

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
do anything for me but I'm thinking if

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.420 
do anything for me but I'm thinking if
we<00:03:19.180> get<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.540> disorder<00:03:20.079> game<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.529> we<00:03:20.980> put<00:03:21.279> that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
we get the disorder game and we put that

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.429 
we get the disorder game and we put that
code<00:03:21.639> while<00:03:21.969> we<00:03:22.120> have<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.450> game<00:03:22.629> it<00:03:23.139> might<00:03:23.260> be

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 
code while we have the game it might be

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.780 
code while we have the game it might be
like<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.620> little<00:03:23.920> cool<00:03:24.069> add-on<00:03:24.400> or<00:03:24.430> something

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
like a little cool add-on or something

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.789 
like a little cool add-on or something
i'm<00:03:24.849> not<00:03:24.969> sure<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:26.170> really<00:03:26.439> randomly

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
i'm not sure that is really randomly

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.530 
i'm not sure that is really randomly
through<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.189> code<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.579> there<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.510> just

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
through that code in there and I just

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.360 
through that code in there and I just
happened<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:28.989> pick<00:03:29.139> it<00:03:29.290> up<00:03:29.379> so<00:03:29.920> as<00:03:30.069> we<00:03:30.189> can<00:03:30.310> see

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
happened to pick it up so as we can see

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.759 
happened to pick it up so as we can see
over<00:03:30.730> here<00:03:30.900> where<00:03:31.900> are<00:03:31.959> going<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.290> shoot<00:03:32.620> to

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
over here where are going to shoot to

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.519 
over here where are going to shoot to
the<00:03:32.799> lamp<00:03:33.299> go<00:03:34.299> around<00:03:34.629> lungs<00:03:35.079> where<00:03:35.379> else

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:35.529 
the lamp go around lungs where else

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.190 
the lamp go around lungs where else
right<00:03:35.769> here<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.779> we're<00:03:37.779> going<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.930> jump<00:03:38.109> on

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
right here and we're going to jump on

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:03.279 
I'm not too sure of but it's pretty

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.619 
I'm not too sure of but it's pretty
weird<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.760> interesting<00:04:03.849> to<00:04:04.239> watch<00:04:04.359> because

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
weird and interesting to watch because

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.080 
weird and interesting to watch because
they're<00:04:05.200> both<00:04:05.349> bad<00:04:05.559> guys<00:04:05.799> but<00:04:06.639> the<00:04:06.760> guy<00:04:06.879> in<00:04:06.939> the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
they're both bad guys but the guy in the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.390 
they're both bad guys but the guy in the
red<00:04:07.150> coat<00:04:07.540> actually<00:04:08.109> assassinates<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:09.219> guy

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
red coat actually assassinates the guy

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.140 
red coat actually assassinates the guy
that<00:04:10.299> he's<00:04:10.419> talking<00:04:10.689> to<00:04:10.779> right<00:04:10.930> now<00:04:12.150> they

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
that he's talking to right now they

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.030 
that he's talking to right now they
didn't<00:04:13.329> really<00:04:13.540> tell<00:04:13.719> us<00:04:13.870> why<00:04:14.109> but<00:04:14.859> I'm

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
didn't really tell us why but I'm

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.590 
didn't really tell us why but I'm
assuming<00:04:15.329> has<00:04:16.329> to<00:04:16.570> do<00:04:16.690> over<00:04:16.959> territory

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
assuming has to do over territory

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.729 
assuming has to do over territory
because<00:04:19.600> this<00:04:19.750> guy<00:04:19.930> pretty<00:04:20.200> much<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.590> guy<00:04:20.680> in

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
because this guy pretty much the guy in

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.379 
because this guy pretty much the guy in
the<00:04:20.829> red<00:04:20.980> suit<00:04:21.010> owns<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.489> place<00:04:21.880> we're<00:04:22.210> at

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
the red suit owns this place we're at

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.379 
the red suit owns this place we're at
right<00:04:22.600> now<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:23.050> those<00:04:23.200> are<00:04:23.230> all<00:04:23.410> his<00:04:23.620> guards

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
right now and those are all his guards

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.360 
right now and those are all his guards
so<00:04:25.389> I<00:04:25.419> choose<00:04:25.720> assassination<00:04:26.530> path<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:27.099> we're

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
so I choose assassination path and we're

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.870 
so I choose assassination path and we're
just<00:04:27.490> slowly<00:04:28.180> following<00:04:28.660> them

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880

pretty much it for my walkthrough and

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.060 
pretty much it for my walkthrough and
then<00:05:04.700> we<00:05:05.700> have<00:05:05.850> this<00:05:06.000> guy<00:05:06.500> talking<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.740> us<00:05:07.890> he
