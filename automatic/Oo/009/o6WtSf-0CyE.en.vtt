00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.350 

I<00:01:48.470> think<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.770> fans<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.520> off<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.820> bat<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
I think if the fans right off the bat I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.350 
I think if the fans right off the bat I
think<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.049> they<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.259> me<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:53.460> relaxed<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
think if they see me really relaxed and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.999 
think if they see me really relaxed and
loose<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.630> cutting<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.619> having<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.890> good

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.880 
loose and cutting up and having a good
time<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.520> think<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.570> they<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:58.290> there<00:01:58.530> quicker
