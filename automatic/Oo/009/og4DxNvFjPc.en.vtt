00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
pro I came up with is that Elise can

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.950 
pro I came up with is that Elise can
snowball<00:01:29.220> very<00:01:29.520> hard<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.570> are<00:01:30.630> getting<00:01:30.900> a

few<00:01:31.200> kills<00:01:31.470> she<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:31.890> become<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.400> strong

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
few kills she will become very strong

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
few kills she will become very strong
and<00:01:33.030> easy<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:33.570> kills<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.020> due<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and easy to get kills with due to the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.870 
and easy to get kills with due to the
nature<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.280> her<00:01:35.549> kit<00:01:37.250> now<00:01:38.250> moving<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> the
