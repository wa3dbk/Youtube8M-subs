ever<00:00:16.850> since<00:00:17.240> I've<00:00:17.449> been<00:00:17.630> driving<00:00:18.170> a<00:00:18.230> Honda

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
ever since I've been driving a Honda

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.250 
ever since I've been driving a Honda
engine<00:00:18.980> there's<00:00:19.880> really<00:00:20.180> been<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.480> very<00:00:20.930> very

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
engine there's really been a very very

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.250 
engine there's really been a very very
sharp<00:00:21.560> focus<00:00:22.189> on<00:00:22.720> drivability<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:23.900> how<00:00:24.199> the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
sharp focus on drivability and how the

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.919 
sharp focus on drivability and how the
engine<00:00:24.859> works<00:00:24.890> in<00:00:25.609> the<00:00:25.789> car<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:26.359> how<00:00:26.869> the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
driving this drivability what we call it

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.540 
driving this drivability what we call it
we<00:00:36.860> always<00:00:37.490> try<00:00:37.970> to<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:39.350> take<00:00:39.680> into<00:00:40.070> account<00:00:40.100> a

different scenario on the track there

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.920 
different scenario on the track there
are<00:00:43.220> a<00:00:43.280> lot<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.030> different<00:00:44.390> ways<00:00:44.480> actually<00:00:44.720> to

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
the drivability of the engine and the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.930 
the drivability of the engine and the
question<00:01:06.620> is<00:01:06.740> which<00:01:06.950> one<00:01:07.130> do<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:07.370> focus<00:01:07.670> on

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
question is which one do you focus on

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.100 
question is which one do you focus on
we're<00:01:08.630> always<00:01:08.780> searching<00:01:09.350> for<00:01:10.750> what<00:01:11.750> does<00:01:11.960> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
we're always searching for what does the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.440 
we're always searching for what does the
engine<00:01:12.320> really<00:01:12.980> need<00:01:13.190> to<00:01:13.340> do<00:01:13.490> you<00:01:14.000> know<00:01:14.150> does

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
engine really need to do you know does

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.380 
engine really need to do you know does
it<00:01:14.480> need<00:01:14.750> this<00:01:14.900> much<00:01:15.170> power<00:01:15.380> here<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.370> know<00:01:16.550> is

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
it need this much power here you know is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.990 
it need this much power here you know is
the<00:01:17.630> power<00:01:17.900> delivery<00:01:18.500> too<00:01:18.680> picky<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:19.850> know

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
the power delivery too picky you know

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.600 
the power delivery too picky you know
what<00:01:20.270> can<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:20.570> do<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.870> help<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.260> driver<00:01:21.610> we

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
what can we do to help the driver we

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.700 
what can we do to help the driver we
always<00:01:22.940> think<00:01:23.180> in<00:01:23.300> terms<00:01:23.510> of<00:01:23.660> off<00:01:23.870> power<00:01:24.320> but

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
always think in terms of off power but

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.660 
always think in terms of off power but
we<00:01:24.920> we<00:01:25.520> have<00:01:25.880> shifted<00:01:26.510> this<00:01:26.830> this<00:01:27.830> idea<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.400> AHS

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
we we have shifted this this idea of AHS

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.360 
we we have shifted this this idea of AHS
power<00:01:28.940> although<00:01:29.270> as<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.840> motorist<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.860> want<00:01:31.159> to

power although as a motorist you want to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.540 
power although as a motorist you want to
have<00:01:31.610> always<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:32.780> ingenious<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.680> power<00:01:34.070> item

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
have always this ingenious of power item

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.040 
have always this ingenious of power item
it<00:01:35.000> also<00:01:35.150> kind<00:01:35.360> of<00:01:35.390> depends<00:01:35.659> on<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.780> nature<00:01:35.960> of

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
it also kind of depends on the nature of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.930 
it also kind of depends on the nature of
the<00:01:36.170> racing<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.890> how<00:01:37.190> much<00:01:37.310> time<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.610> spend

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
the racing and how much time you spend

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.230 
the racing and how much time you spend
at<00:01:38.060> wide<00:01:38.210> open<00:01:38.450> throttle<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:40.460> know<00:01:40.550> peak

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
at wide open throttle but you know peak

at wide open throttle but you know peak
power<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:41.590> probably<00:01:42.590> our<00:01:42.740> number<00:01:42.860> one<00:01:43.130> focus

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
power is probably our number one focus

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.640 
power is probably our number one focus
but<00:01:43.790> drivability<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.570> close<00:01:44.840> second<00:01:45.200> we

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
but drivability is a close second we

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.050 
but drivability is a close second we
take<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.479> mathematical<00:01:48.550> principles<00:01:49.550> we<00:01:49.850> take

take the mathematical principles we take
the<00:01:50.180> physical<00:01:50.470> principles<00:01:51.470> we<00:01:51.740> put<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:51.979> lot<00:01:52.280> of

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.699 
circumstances there's a lot of work that
goes<00:03:27.230> on<00:03:27.800> with<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.970> team<00:03:29.390> engineers<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:30.560> with

goes on with the team engineers and with

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.210 
goes on with the team engineers and with
the<00:03:30.860> drivers<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.870> really<00:03:32.870> understand<00:03:33.470> what

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
the drivers to really understand what

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.940 
the drivers to really understand what
they<00:03:34.489> need<00:03:34.790> from<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.570> engine<00:03:36.050> if<00:03:36.470> we<00:03:36.680> took

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
they need from the engine if we took

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.790 
they need from the engine if we took
cool<00:03:37.160> twelve<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.450> Honda<00:03:38.750> drivers<00:03:39.200> or<00:03:39.350> just

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
cool twelve of the Honda drivers or just

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.770 
cool twelve of the Honda drivers or just
the<00:03:40.190> four<00:03:40.459> within<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.060> ready<00:03:41.269> team<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
the four within the and ready team and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.840 
the four within the and ready team and
we<00:03:42.320> overlaid<00:03:42.769> all<00:03:42.920> their<00:03:43.100> throttle<00:03:43.400> traces

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
we overlaid all their throttle traces

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.610 
we overlaid all their throttle traces
for<00:03:44.030> an<00:03:44.150> identical<00:03:44.720> lap<00:03:44.870> they<00:03:45.080> will<00:03:45.290> all<00:03:45.440> be

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
for an identical lap they will all be

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.710 
for an identical lap they will all be
different<00:03:45.800> so<00:03:46.610> every<00:03:47.120> driver<00:03:47.390> has<00:03:47.540> a

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
different so every driver has a

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.930 
different so every driver has a

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
different style of how they use the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.670 
different style of how they use the
throttle<00:03:50.180> some<00:03:50.570> of<00:03:50.690> them<00:03:50.810> are<00:03:50.989> very

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
bit more digital different driving

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.130 
bit more digital different driving
styles<00:03:57.890> right<00:03:58.180> everyone<00:03:59.180> has<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.480> different
