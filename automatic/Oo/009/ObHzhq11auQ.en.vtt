things today I recently learned with the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
from Israel here at the in Tokyo for a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.160 
from Israel here at the in Tokyo for a
titty<00:00:13.740> demonstration<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.630> he<00:00:15.630> showed<00:00:15.870> us<00:00:16.049> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
titty demonstration and he showed us a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.410 
titty demonstration and he showed us a
lot<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.800> really<00:00:16.949> cool<00:00:17.250> things<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.300> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
lot of really cool things and I like to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.029 
lot of really cool things and I like to
document<00:00:18.630> some<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.260> them<00:00:19.350> before<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.740> forget

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
document some of them before I forget

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.029 
document some of them before I forget
them<00:00:20.539> one<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> things<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.140> he<00:00:22.350> showed<00:00:22.920> us

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
them one of the things that he showed us

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.890 
them one of the things that he showed us
that<00:00:23.220> was<00:00:23.369> very<00:00:23.760> interesting<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.600> I've<00:00:24.750> seen

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that was very interesting and I've seen

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.480 
that was very interesting and I've seen
it<00:00:25.019> before<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.980> time<00:00:26.189> around<00:00:26.340> for

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
it before but this time around for

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.099 
it before but this time around for
whatever<00:00:26.730> reason<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.210> really<00:00:27.660> seemed<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.990> take

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
whatever reason I really seemed to take

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.919 
whatever reason I really seemed to take
notice<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:29.220> his<00:00:29.519> very<00:00:30.480> different<00:00:30.779> take

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
notice of it was his very different take

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.590 
notice of it was his very different take
on<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> skew<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:32.040> how<00:00:32.309> he<00:00:32.369> sharpens<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.210> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
on the skew on how he sharpens up and I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750 
on the skew on how he sharpens up and I
find<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.290> much<00:00:34.530> easier<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:34.950> me<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.250> use<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
find it's much easier for me to use it I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
find it's much easier for me to use it I
have<00:00:36.120> much<00:00:36.450> more<00:00:36.480> confidence<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.230> much<00:00:37.320> more

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
have much more confidence and much more

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.799 
have much more confidence and much more
controlling<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.120> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> show<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
controlling so we're going to show you

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.170 
controlling so we're going to show you
how<00:00:40.020> he<00:00:40.079> sharpens<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> honing<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
how he sharpens it and honing it and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.860 
how he sharpens it and honing it and
even<00:00:42.870> try<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> cut<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.329> some<00:00:45.329> beads<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.750> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
even try to cut some some beads with it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
even try to cut some some beads with it
and<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.350> some<00:00:46.530> planning<00:00:46.829> cuts<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.190> show<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and do some planning cuts to show you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
and do some planning cuts to show you
how<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.640> works<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> emphasize<00:00:49.200> that

easy to keep it flat if you dress
fairly<00:02:14.190> often<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.510> can<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.870> first<00:02:16.080> and

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
fairly often so I can do that first and

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.410 
fairly often so I can do that first and
remember<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:17.040> know<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.819> doing<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.150> kind<00:02:18.360> of

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
remember you know you doing this kind of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.940 
remember you know you doing this kind of
stuff<00:02:18.540> rocks<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.200> eye<00:02:19.260> hurts<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.800> gotta

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
stuff rocks in the eye hurts you gotta

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:43.090 
stuff rocks in the eye hurts you gotta
wear<00:02:20.069> your<00:02:20.130> safety<00:02:20.310> glasses

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.070 

that<00:02:44.030> actually<00:02:44.390> required<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.780> bit<00:02:44.870> more

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
that actually required a bit more

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.420 
that actually required a bit more
flattening<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.590> thought<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:45.980> would<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.130> was

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
flattening I thought it would I was

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.340 
flattening I thought it would I was
doing<00:02:47.300> some<00:02:47.480> other<00:02:47.570> work<00:02:47.690> them<00:02:47.990> they're<00:02:48.170> non

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
doing some other work them they're non

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.710 
doing some other work them they're non
non<00:02:48.950> lazy<00:02:49.310> at<00:02:49.820> work<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.210> that's<00:02:50.270> why<00:02:50.510> there's

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
non lazy at work and that's why there's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.600 
non lazy at work and that's why there's
a<00:02:50.780> bit<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.050> hollow<00:02:51.260> inside<00:02:51.530> anyways<00:02:52.160> the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
a bit of a hollow inside anyways the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.900 
a bit of a hollow inside anyways the
stone<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:53.000> flattening<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:55.190> important<00:02:55.670> part

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
stone is flattening the important part

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.000 
stone is flattening the important part
of<00:02:56.090> sharpening<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.200> tool<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.560> way<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.830> Amy

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
of sharpening the tool the way that Amy

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.530 
of sharpening the tool the way that Amy
shows<00:02:58.280> gonna<00:02:58.430> sharpen<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.060> couple<00:02:59.450> of

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
shows gonna sharpen it a couple of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.470 
shows gonna sharpen it a couple of
points<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.020> one<00:03:00.230> it's<00:03:00.410> 15<00:03:00.800> degrees<00:03:01.390> across<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
points is one it's 15 degrees across the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.260 
points is one it's 15 degrees across the
top<00:03:02.810> there<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:04.520> other<00:03:04.640> one<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.120> you

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
top there and the other one is that you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.640 
top there and the other one is that you
start<00:03:05.600> on<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.080> though

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
start on that on though

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.590 
start on that on though
call<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> heel<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:07.940> work<00:03:08.090> towards<00:03:08.480> a

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
call it the heel and you work towards a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.230 
call it the heel and you work towards a
tip<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:10.160> don't<00:03:10.190> really<00:03:10.550> need<00:03:10.730> this<00:03:10.910> stand

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
tip you don't really need this stand

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.820 
tip you don't really need this stand
here<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.690> just<00:03:11.900> kind<00:03:12.080> of<00:03:12.140> have<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.350> there's<00:03:12.530> a

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
here I just kind of have it there's a

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.350 
here I just kind of have it there's a
place<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.280> rest<00:03:13.430> my<00:03:13.550> hand<00:03:13.880> off

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
place to rest my hand off

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.190 
place to rest my hand off
so<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.920> important<00:03:16.460> points<00:03:17.300> here<00:03:17.480> are<00:03:17.960> that

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
so the important points here are that

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.330 
so the important points here are that
the<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:20.660> tool<00:03:20.870> doesn't<00:03:21.140> overheat<00:03:21.440> and<00:03:21.770> that

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
the the tool doesn't overheat and that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.340 
the the tool doesn't overheat and that
you<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:25.460> tool<00:03:25.640> doesn't<00:03:25.850> overheat<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.540> you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
you I the tool doesn't overheat and you

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.070 
you I the tool doesn't overheat and you
have<00:03:27.500> good<00:03:27.740> control<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:29.120> stone<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:29.540> flat<00:03:29.810> or

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
have good control the stone is flat or

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.540 
have good control the stone is flat or
you<00:03:30.230> know<00:03:30.350> fairly<00:03:30.710> flat<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.950> guess<00:03:31.220> it's<00:03:31.400> flat

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
you know fairly flat I guess it's flat

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.420 
you know fairly flat I guess it's flat
enough<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.750> want<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.080> just<00:03:34.040> wait<00:03:34.190> till<00:03:34.370> it

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
enough and you want to just wait till it

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.690 
enough and you want to just wait till it
stops<00:03:34.670> here<00:03:35.710> you<00:03:36.710> want<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.010> start<00:03:37.250> on<00:03:37.370> heel

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
stops here you want to start on heel

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.980

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
other thing it does is it let you know

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.750 
other thing it does is it let you know
the<00:03:45.170> tool<00:03:45.350> gets<00:03:45.530> too<00:03:45.710> hot<00:03:45.890> if<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.190> tool<00:03:46.370> gets<00:03:46.520> too

the tool gets too hot if a tool gets too

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.460 
the tool gets too hot if a tool gets too
hot<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.510> course<00:03:47.630> your<00:03:47.900> fingers<00:03:48.140> gonna<00:03:48.290> feel

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
hot of course your fingers gonna feel

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.840 
hot of course your fingers gonna feel
you<00:03:48.680> don't<00:03:48.770> want<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.040> overheat<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.340> tool<00:03:49.580> lots

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
you don't want to overheat the tool lots

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.280 
you don't want to overheat the tool lots
of<00:03:49.910> people<00:03:50.150> say<00:03:50.300> oh<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.630> doesn't<00:03:50.660> matter<00:03:50.990> it's

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
of people say oh it doesn't matter it's

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.680 
of people say oh it doesn't matter it's
high<00:03:51.440> speed<00:03:51.500> steel<00:03:51.950> blah<00:03:52.190> blah<00:03:52.400> blah<00:03:52.580> but<00:03:53.330> I

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
high speed steel blah blah blah but I

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.960 
high speed steel blah blah blah but I
think<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.680> if<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:54.980> overheat<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.460> tool<00:03:55.640> all

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
think that if you overheat the tool all

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.910 
think that if you overheat the tool all
the<00:03:56.000> time<00:03:56.330> it<00:03:56.720> can't<00:03:57.200> help<00:03:57.380> but<00:03:57.500> do<00:03:57.740> some

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
the time it can't help but do some

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.500 
the time it can't help but do some
damage<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.460> so<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.640> think<00:03:58.760> you're<00:03:59.030> better

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
damage to it so I think you're better

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.000 
damage to it so I think you're better
off<00:03:59.600> and<00:04:00.020> you're<00:04:00.170> also<00:04:00.260> gonna<00:04:00.500> be<00:04:00.650> wearing<00:04:00.890> off

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
off and you're also gonna be wearing off

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.440 
off and you're also gonna be wearing off
a<00:04:01.040> lot<00:04:01.250> of<00:04:01.370> Steel<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:01.820> know<00:04:01.910> cost<00:04:02.240> money

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
a lot of Steel and you know cost money

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.410 
a lot of Steel and you know cost money
so<00:04:02.690> for<00:04:03.470> me<00:04:03.620> it's<00:04:04.280> better<00:04:04.520> off<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.330> know

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
so for me it's better off to you know

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.130 
so for me it's better off to you know
gold<00:04:06.140> go<00:04:06.470> lightly<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:07.130> not<00:04:07.820> overdo<00:04:08.210> it<00:04:08.240> when

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
gold go lightly and not overdo it when

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.810 
gold go lightly and not overdo it when
you're<00:04:09.260> grinding<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:09.800> of<00:04:10.310> course<00:04:10.550> you<00:04:10.640> want

level here you want to go from the heel

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.970 
level here you want to go from the heel
to<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.210> tip<00:04:29.450> and<00:04:30.110> when<00:04:30.290> you<00:04:30.380> turn<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.710> over<00:04:30.800> and

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
look at it you'll be able to see that

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.050 
look at it you'll be able to see that
the<00:04:33.380> steel<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:33.920> you've<00:04:34.070> just<00:04:34.400> sharpened<00:04:34.910> is

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
the steel that you've just sharpened is

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.310 
the steel that you've just sharpened is
slightly<00:04:35.480> different<00:04:35.870> color<00:04:36.020> than<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.290> rest

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
slightly different color than the rest

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.840 
slightly different color than the rest
of<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.680> body<00:04:36.890> of<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.160> steel<00:04:37.370> here<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:37.730> that's

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
of the body of the steel here and that's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.310 
of the body of the steel here and that's
because<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.240> course<00:04:38.450> this<00:04:38.570> has<00:04:38.750> been<00:04:39.020> exposed

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
because of course this has been exposed

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.560 
because of course this has been exposed
to<00:04:39.500> air<00:04:39.620> for<00:04:39.650> quite<00:04:40.100> a<00:04:40.130> long<00:04:40.220> time<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.730> it

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
to air for quite a long time and it

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.260 
to air for quite a long time and it
oxidizes<00:04:42.260> slightly<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.000> where's<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.120> new

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
oxidizes slightly and where's the new

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.820 
oxidizes slightly and where's the new
steel<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.630> you<00:04:44.690> just<00:04:44.930> sharpened<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.710> know

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
steel that you just sharpened you know

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.560 
steel that you just sharpened you know
it<00:04:45.950> should<00:04:46.160> you<00:04:46.310> should<00:04:46.370> polish<00:04:46.880> up<00:04:47.060> fairly

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
it should you should polish up fairly

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.270 
it should you should polish up fairly
nicely<00:04:47.840> on<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.140> 120<00:04:48.620> grit<00:04:48.740> wheel<00:04:48.950> anyways

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
nicely on the 120 grit wheel anyways

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.119 
nicely on the 120 grit wheel anyways
I'll<00:04:49.400> just<00:04:49.580> quickly<00:04:49.820> show<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.120> how<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.360> do<00:04:50.510> this

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
also hold the tool high up on the handle

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.739 
also hold the tool high up on the handle
we<00:04:56.129> won't<00:04:56.279> go<00:04:56.520> down<00:04:56.699> on<00:04:56.879> the<00:04:56.969> handle<00:04:57.330> having

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749 
we won't go down on the handle having

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:58.590 
we won't go down on the handle having
much<00:04:57.899> control

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
much control

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.260

higher up on him
we<00:05:02.270> start

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.560 
but you know I have to spend very much
time<00:05:56.250> in<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:56.580> tip<00:05:56.760> wall<00:05:56.940> because<00:05:57.300> it's<00:05:57.450> very

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
time in the tip wall because it's very

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.900 
time in the tip wall because it's very
thin<00:05:57.810> and<00:05:58.200> it<00:05:58.380> will<00:05:58.530> grind<00:05:59.250> away<00:05:59.460> very<00:05:59.730> quickly

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
thin and it will grind away very quickly

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.810 
thin and it will grind away very quickly
and<00:06:00.300> will<00:06:00.630> sharpen<00:06:01.100> now<00:06:02.100> I<00:06:02.130> just<00:06:02.220> changed<00:06:02.790> my
