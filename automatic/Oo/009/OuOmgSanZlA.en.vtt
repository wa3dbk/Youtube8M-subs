00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Good day to you, Andrei Pavlov 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.629
 interior design happens today 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.290
 talk about orcs 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.910
 barks doorways yes only 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.049
 doors 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.030
 Leon's gifts are present now 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.719
 every house everyone thinks how they can 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.930
 to decorate 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.970
 what can you do with them here again 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 recall yes recall our main idea 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.550
 that we don't want to hire to hire 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.039
 no designer why do we need it 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 the walls need to do only the arch here 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 I had an idea I want a new arch I 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.260
 I want an arch that I only have 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.219
 differently that the simplest can 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.500
 do at the moment the internet finally can 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.719
 little information looked again yes a lot 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.570
 questions on the forums march little information 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.770
 how can you finish it well, probably the most 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.739
 simple we go lerua merlin we go to any 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.740
 construction market to the store where 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.990
 data available 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.390
 the function this product is this this 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.160
 arch kit yes can take them 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.710
 met but he is sold by 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.510
 sizes in this apartment can be there 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.390
 these people boldly buy 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:16.420
 but let me remind you not really like everyone here 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.840
 you can take the usual 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.390
 locksmith he will leave me a problem 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.550
 he looks from ordinary wood with 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.830
 pattern but somehow the old fashioned everything 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.890
 somehow all tired of the same street 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.080
 Something interesting here, especially as 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.070
 rule to the tree of the house well somehow shirts 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.960
 the wooden door to the bathhouse plan 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.810
 these are bulky openings 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.470
 from a tree well, as it is not particularly though 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.710
 taste and color 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.479
 you yourself know to here what can be done 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.430
 You can probably take some 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.340
 where to dress from the village who can 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.110
 well cut jigsaw teach him your 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.580
 draft dinner before 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.140
 people dress need something be 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.510
 pay because the work will not 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.730
 cheap then the whole thing needs to be 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.180
 try on substitute but it will be very 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.670
 look good I think if it's ora 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.979
 that says to harmonize very well with 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.270
 your orders which glass in 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.600
 hallway for example here are 2 types of cancer which 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.380
 before myself noticed it orcs who go 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.190
 on the doorway up to call in the doorway 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.430
 doorway will find up and up she 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.620
 tapering by the angle that is its upper part 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.220
 the ceiling part is not straight 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.820
 she goes to a corner of slander like a gable 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.820
 roofs of houses 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.400
 one more option where very few 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.860
 can meet but i think 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.290
 will go to the Muslim 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.010
 Muslim citizens further the third 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:54.000
 type is the most famous type the most 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.290
 common type the most powerful so 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.349
 say it 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.239
 stucco finish polyurethane finish 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.359
 why the product is also now 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.840
 the store but this stuff is not cheap so 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.640
 what to expect here what's interesting here 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.109
 it is interesting that from this material 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.359
 can do as trim can do 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.799
 as the inside is bright special 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.659
 systems, that is, you can inside 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:25.200
 I could do this mouse 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:28.330
 make a bubble on top you can make 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.330
 corners and columns and you can finish 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.990
 you can lower polyurethane 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.260
 arches to the side of the wall in general as 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.040
 can be painted in the color of the wall to 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.090
 it was bright so that polyurethane is not 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.840
 was striking 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.890
 to make it harmonious again 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.410
 remember that this style and here it is 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.630
 requires a certain taste and because 1 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.580
 the arch won't get off the moment here 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.170
 you need something else to 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.600
 visit attend your apartment 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.010
 so that even though there were ledges 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.530
 even those were eaves so they 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.560
 allocated to somewhere on the walls was 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.360
 something like that there were pictures to 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.310
 In the pictures, the edging was very 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.730
 similar will look very cool 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.890
 make the same color on the picture frames 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.300
 and our doorway 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:29.740
 oh the next type is one of the most 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.590
 simple and not willing to bother just 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.210
 stupidly take doing the frames do 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.569
 yochomi 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.780
 doorway usually doorway krasin her 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.699
 can paint take pintus like 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.419
 the inner part and so 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:49.100
 and the impulses themselves 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.230
 themselves platbands here 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.170
 will be nice you can also decorate 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:05:00.860
 a consequence another option is an option 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:03.830
 wide arches make the edges do for 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.600
 the edges of the arch at the top of the stand and 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.210
 the edges of the columns are very beautiful 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.450
 take a closer look but again this is from from 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.930
 option orc with stucco where taste is needed 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.910
 where where necessary opinion where necessary 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.690
 mastery 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:25.150
 that's the very last sixth option this 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:27.560
 finishing arch and nothing but what it means and what 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.350
 looks very good if just 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.820
 flat corners go at the arch very 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.030
 looks good if you will 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.120
 just look like a doorway if 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.860
 there will be no extra things 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.830
 if it's just ordinary 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:47.330
 rectangle or if it is usually 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.660
 semicircle align the wall 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.130
 make corners krasin wall light 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.920
 you look great will look 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.930
 It will look great not catchy 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.860
 in the eyes will not rush direct 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.290
 it will be very beautiful 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.250
 what you can know that you can use 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.600
