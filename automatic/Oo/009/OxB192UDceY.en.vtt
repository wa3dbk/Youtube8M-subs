00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.290
 hi saved only br galerinha 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 Welcome everyone. One more. 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.540
 vlog on the channel and today we will talk 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.760
 about brazilian dubbing 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.130
 good the following you possibly played 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.920
 a game of the lake and possibly you already 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.180
 saw a game of great quality and game 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.189
 poor quality 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.039
 good we have an example of a recent game 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.519
 with a poor quality bellfield radio 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.560
 online 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.710
 the number was green online we had there 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.309
 the renowned artist roger of outrage at 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.200
 rigor 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.780
 then dubbing one of the characters 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.550
 of the saga in single player mode 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.550
 that is in the campaign mode is neither the roger 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 simply put your intention 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.789
 He understood his dedication to the shield 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.030
 bosta time most recently still 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.850
 responded to funk and left a certain 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.980
 how would you say one right in doing 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 a certain thread I do not know in your 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.960
 twitter why the bicho or paulo roger 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.700
 addict on twitter it happens to him 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.070
 left the guy's timeline 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.250
 simply a question like spoiling 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.060
 a game in the dubbing and the roger answered 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.060
 this is for fan 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.300
 ie hinted that if the guy does not 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.760
 I knew English was shitting and walking. 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.020
 Talking we understand but finally looks 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.000
 just what I want to say to you 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.580
 next we my first game I 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.810
 I played river for sure not 360 was the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.180
 first game I played in the language 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.190
 with audio everything else and I'll tell you 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.170
 The next time I enjoyed it, I grabbed it. 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.630
 because in the first game kingdom was 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.610
 dubbed in Portuguese pt-br 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.980
 The dubbing was excellent the dubbing was 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.800
 super cool and i really believe 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.260
 dubbing makes the difference in the game and 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.060
 dubbing reason to play because if the 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.570
 guy has dubbing the guy will play 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.580
 five game now if the dubbing was 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.490
 goubel son of hard landing means 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.070
 dubbing garfield not from boxwood blog 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.780
 because the rest of the 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.890
 characters from the bar the son of 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.620
 top notch 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.110
 if you are to play a game board it's kind 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.990
 so if you cancel out of it and you see the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.270
 dubbing the other characters the case 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.430
 the other members of the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.280
 game you see a very remarkable difference 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.170
 kind of professionalism and not much 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.820
 professionalism then clear if you had 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.190
 dedicated a little bit more done in 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.380
 and possibly 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.390
 something better 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.100
 but coherent to this kind of thing that the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.840
 People have to tell him to understand 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.820
 next, I guess I'm so happy. 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.950
 that I have a raz that I can talk to 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.310
 you impressive now come on the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.640
 face will migrate a game to respond the fan 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.940
 that mother, we know that the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.470
 response was half-integrated mask has 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.850
 It was annoying, I 'm not going to take the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.370
 possibility is right when 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:10.290
 base got a little bad and the young mortal 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.540
 kombat x there with ap tim a pitty vai 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.850
 then dub the character of the mortal 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.760
 kombat x you have to leave so much if I 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.400
 to some platforms and comes 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.550
 another dub in a bit controversial 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.860
 but anyway you played there is your game 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.070
 on the side both the beauty platform 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.959
 can be pc 360 joins what is good that 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.340
 you played like the game leaves here 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.110
 below your 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.780
 We really made the difference. 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.489
 in your life or simply the game does not 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.200
 it was nothing of what you were 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.370
 imagining beauty and I 'm saying goodbye 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.750
 of another blog half a qat beauty but 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.709
