00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
the first wreck I've had which won't be

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.729 
the first wreck I've had which won't be
my<00:02:50.010> last<00:02:50.220> wreck<00:02:50.519> most<00:02:50.760> likely<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.329> camera<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
my last wreck most likely on camera the

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.470 
my last wreck most likely on camera the
idea<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.280> eliminate<00:02:53.370> these<00:02:53.730> people<00:02:54.120> I

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
idea is to eliminate these people I

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.330 
idea is to eliminate these people I
believe<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.169> under<00:02:55.379> pressure<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.919> to<00:02:56.159> stay

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
believe the under pressure is to stay

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.629 
believe the under pressure is to stay
alive<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:56.939> eliminate<00:02:57.389> people<00:02:58.519> they're<00:02:59.519> all

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
alive and eliminate people they're all

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:14.880 
alive and eliminate people they're all
driving<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> bunch<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.689> maniacs

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.970 

try<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.430> chase<00:03:15.670> this<00:03:15.820> guy<00:03:15.940> down

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.680 

so<00:03:22.580> just<00:03:22.760> keep<00:03:22.940> knocking<00:03:23.150> them<00:03:23.360> out<00:03:23.510> and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
so just keep knocking them out and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.000 
so just keep knocking them out and
eventually<00:03:24.230> they<00:03:24.380> all<00:03:24.530> go<00:03:24.709> away

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
eventually they all go away

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.309 
eventually they all go away
and<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.520> win<00:03:25.730> there<00:03:26.390> are<00:03:26.510> some<00:03:26.780> places<00:03:27.020> you'd

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
and you win there are some places you'd

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.500 
and you win there are some places you'd
go<00:03:27.470> off<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:28.190> road<00:03:28.400> like<00:03:28.700> here<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.330> get
