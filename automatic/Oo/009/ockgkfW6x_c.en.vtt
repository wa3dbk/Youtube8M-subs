00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that I think is something you standing

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.109 
that I think is something you standing
on<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> find<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.710> how<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.070> weigh<00:01:29.220> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.460 
on to find out how much you weigh so
there's<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> scale<00:01:30.869> involved<00:01:31.200> with

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
there's not a lot of scale involved with

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.999 
there's not a lot of scale involved with
what<00:01:31.649> I<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:32.159> lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> poking<00:01:33.479> hope<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.439> you

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
what I do a lot of poking hope so you

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.130 
what I do a lot of poking hope so you
think<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.310> terms<00:01:35.399> like<00:01:35.579> gear<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.149> run<00:01:36.539> not<00:01:36.899> so

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
think in terms like gear on a run not so

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.370 
think in terms like gear on a run not so
much<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.890> scale<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.460> scale<00:01:38.869> yeah<00:01:39.869> pretty<00:01:40.229> much

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
much you scale a scale yeah pretty much
