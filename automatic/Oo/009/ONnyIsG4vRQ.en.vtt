00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.580
 In this video tutorial, we will analyze systems with 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.070
 what amount can you start trading on 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.990
 exchange, that is, what is the minimum amount 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.689
 must be made when opening 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.910
 brokerage account actually every 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.950
 the broker sets some conditions 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.560
 by minimum deposit 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.689
 some for example don't want to deal with 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.300
 small shields and impose their 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.329
 food restrictions increase fees 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.550
 trading but average 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.390
 minimum requirements are 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.420
 the amount of 10 to 50 thousand rubles start 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.219
 like the forex market with 5 or 20 dollars 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.820
 here of course will not work but for 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.550
 learning even 10 and 50 thousand rubles will be 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.289
 quite enough of course not 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.749
 no restrictions on the amount of input 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.420
 you can put at least a few million 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.850
 just if you just plan your 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.339
 the career of a trader is always better 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.350
 start with minimal risk for example 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.780
 when trading futures it can be 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.700
 trade only one or two contracts 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.650
 when trading stocks this can be 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.080
 trading only a few stocks 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.450
 based on what you are about 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.250
 trade can calculate the minimum 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.440
 amount of required deposit 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.890
 I will explain on the example of index futures 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.230
 rts for example when buying or selling 1 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.150
 futures on the rts exchange index at the time 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.890
 opening a position reserves you on 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.830
 account guarantee 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.830
 which averages around 10,000 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.630
 sometimes less rubles sometimes more 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.310
 it turns out that this amount is required 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.320
 must be on your account otherwise you 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.590
 just not at all you can 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.960
 open a position this time the second moment is not 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.840
 it is worth forgetting about the reserve for stop loss 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.180
 if for example your stop loss is 500 ohms 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.090
 clause then when trading one contract 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.700
 and triggering a stop loss and you lose 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.680
 about 300 rubles but such 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.440
 reserve of 300 rubles will allow you to make a mistake 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.390
 only once that it was not 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.400
 optimally as trite before 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.770
 making a profitable deal can be 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.500
 a series of stop losses respectively need 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.650
 calculate the deposit based on the possible 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.870
 Drawdown I personally think that the most 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.629
 minimum deposit for trading 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.960
 RTS index futures is 15,000 rubles 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.210
 in the same time 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.580
 you shouldn't deposit more 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.350
 a hundred thousand rubles because your 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.180
 the main task is to train and 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.550
 trading skills 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.310
 yes and the same when trading the minimum 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.260
 amount of contracts more than a hundred 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.690
 thousand rubles will simply be ineffective 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.560
 lie down on your account that is 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.050
 plan on the basis of the range of 15 100000 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.210
 rubles now when we decided on 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.490
 our deposit is necessary 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.260
 talk about the most choice algorithm 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.260
 reliable brokerage company
