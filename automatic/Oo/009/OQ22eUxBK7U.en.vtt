00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
little hard to get to know each other

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.439 
little hard to get to know each other
and<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:59.649> along<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.610> first<00:01:00.850> half<00:01:01.030> we<00:01:01.329> were

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
and get along and the first half we were

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.939 
and get along and the first half we were
kind<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:01.840> struggling<00:01:02.079> but<00:01:02.440> then<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.620> second

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
kind of struggling but then the second

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.560 
kind of struggling but then the second
half<00:01:03.039> we<00:01:03.190> started<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.640> get<00:01:04.000> a<00:01:04.030> rhythm<00:01:04.210> and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
half we started to get a rhythm and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.330 
half we started to get a rhythm and
