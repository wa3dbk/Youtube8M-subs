we're<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.259> urbe<00:00:07.589> 400<00:00:08.280> AF<00:00:08.580> or<00:00:09.420> in<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> house

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
we're in urbe 400 AF or in the house

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.629 
we're in urbe 400 AF or in the house
right<00:00:10.170> near<00:00:10.380> choked<00:00:10.679> alina<00:00:11.040> where<00:00:11.400> mog

right near choked alina where mog

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.680 
right near choked alina where mog
believes<00:00:12.090> he's<00:00:13.019> found<00:00:13.070> something<00:00:14.070> oh<00:00:14.599> and<00:00:15.599> you

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
believes he's found something oh and you

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.320 
believes he's found something oh and you
look<00:00:15.809> at<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:15.960> more<00:00:16.379> time<00:00:16.680> paradox<00:00:17.220> time<00:00:18.150> for

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
look at that more time paradox time for

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.070 
look at that more time paradox time for
a<00:00:18.359> couple<00:00:18.660> crystal<00:00:19.170> bond<00:00:19.410> puzzles<00:00:20.960> all<00:00:21.960> right

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
a couple crystal bond puzzles all right

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.359 
a couple crystal bond puzzles all right
now<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.380> these<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.710> got<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.949> match<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
now with these you got to match the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.820 
now with these you got to match the
crystal<00:00:23.850> colors<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:25.410> they're<00:00:25.619> trying<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
crystal colors and they're trying to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.140 
crystal colors and they're trying to
make<00:00:25.920> them<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.189> little<00:00:26.340> harder<00:00:26.699> by<00:00:26.849> giving<00:00:27.060> you

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
make them a little harder by giving you

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.960 
make them a little harder by giving you
a<00:00:27.180> time<00:00:27.449> limit<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.980> by<00:00:28.980> kind<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.490> scattering

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
a time limit and by kind of scattering

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.820 
a time limit and by kind of scattering
them<00:00:30.179> all<00:00:30.300> around<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.289> best<00:00:31.470> thing<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.740> can

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
them all around the best thing you can

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.470 
them all around the best thing you can
do<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> really<00:00:32.460> take<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> look<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> puzzle

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
do is really take a look at the puzzle

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.600 
do is really take a look at the puzzle
before<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.079> starts<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
before it starts and see what the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.639 
before it starts and see what the
longest<00:00:36.420> connections<00:00:36.989> are<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> ones<00:00:37.530> that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
longest connections are the ones that

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.340 
longest connections are the ones that
are<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.120> hardest<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.420> put<00:00:39.660> together<00:00:39.840> which

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
are the hardest to put together which

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
are the hardest to put together which
you<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> force<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> run<00:00:41.910> around

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
you are going to force you to run around

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.810 
you are going to force you to run around
the<00:00:42.239> map<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.660> actually<00:00:42.960> connect<00:00:43.290> them<00:00:43.789> try<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the map to actually connect them try to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610 
the map to actually connect them try to
get<00:00:45.000> those<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> way<00:00:45.480> first<00:00:45.870> because

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
get those out of the way first because

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.990 
get those out of the way first because
all<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> short<00:00:47.070> connections<00:00:47.489> kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.820> pop<00:00:47.969> up

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
all the short connections kind of pop up

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.260 
all the short connections kind of pop up
right<00:00:48.329> next<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.750> each<00:00:48.809> other<00:00:49.610> but<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> lot

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
right next to each other but you a lot

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.100 
right next to each other but you a lot
of<00:00:51.360> these<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.600> give<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.809> have<00:00:51.899> more<00:00:52.020> than

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
of these they give you have more than

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.689 
of these they give you have more than
enough<00:00:52.170> time<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> try<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.280> figure<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> out

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
enough time to try and figure it out

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.880 
enough time to try and figure it out
just<00:00:53.940> keep<00:00:54.149> moving<00:00:54.539> keep<00:00:55.289> moving<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.649> camera

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
just keep moving keep moving the camera

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.799 
just keep moving keep moving the camera
around<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:57.149> figure<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.449> where<00:00:57.660> you're

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
around to really figure out where you're

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.610 
around to really figure out where you're
going<00:00:59.270> now<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.420> particular<00:01:00.600> set<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> crystal

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
going now this particular set of crystal

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
going now this particular set of crystal
bond<00:01:01.800> puzzles<00:01:02.309> there's<00:01:02.550> five<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.239> darn

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
bond puzzles there's five of the darn

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.530 
bond puzzles there's five of the darn
things<00:01:04.220> but<00:01:05.220> again<00:01:05.460> let<00:01:05.610> me<00:01:05.640> show<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
things but again let me show you the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.910 
things but again let me show you the
strategy<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.020> let's<00:01:07.409> take<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> look<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
strategy here let's take a look at the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.990 
strategy here let's take a look at the
puzzle<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:09.439> very<00:01:10.439> quickly<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.220> that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
puzzle and very quickly we see that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.899 
puzzle and very quickly we see that
there's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.510> bond<00:01:13.080> right<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.799> our<00:01:13.920> right<00:01:14.189> that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
there's a bond right to our right that

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.160 
there's a bond right to our right that
is<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> little<00:01:15.180> farther<00:01:15.509> away<00:01:15.720> we're<00:01:15.990> going<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
is a little farther away we're going to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.740 
is a little farther away we're going to
want<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.650> happen<00:01:16.710> pretty<00:01:17.280> quickly

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
want to make that happen pretty quickly

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.730 
want to make that happen pretty quickly
the<00:01:18.750> short<00:01:19.020> ones<00:01:19.200> you're<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.590> much

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the short ones you're not as much

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
the short ones you're not as much
worried<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.939> got<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> green

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
worried about so here we got the green

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.530 
worried about so here we got the green
one<00:01:21.740> anything<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:23.100> around<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.299> map

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
one anything that's going around the map

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.510 
one anything that's going around the map
to<00:01:24.869> try<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.200> connect

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
to try and connect

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.289 
to try and connect
and<00:01:27.329> if<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.020> grab<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.649> crystal<00:01:29.130> bond<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.700> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and if you grab a crystal bond and you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.529 
and if you grab a crystal bond and you
move<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.719> it<00:01:30.780> it'll<00:01:31.710> freeze<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.789> color<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
move with it it'll freeze the color of

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.020 
move with it it'll freeze the color of
the<00:01:33.750> crystals<00:01:34.170> it'll<00:01:34.380> stop<00:01:34.649> them<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the crystals it'll stop them from a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.510 
the crystals it'll stop them from a
change<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.600> color<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:36.929> actually<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
change in color so actually if you see a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580 
change in color so actually if you see a
crystal<00:01:38.969> bond<00:01:39.149> color<00:01:39.539> that<00:01:40.289> you<00:01:40.319> know<00:01:40.530> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
crystal bond color that you know you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.719 
crystal bond color that you know you
want<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> connect<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.250> you're<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.429> close

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
want to connect but you're not close

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.459 
want to connect but you're not close
enough<00:01:41.969> to<00:01:42.149> it<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.289> going<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
enough to it you think it's going to

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.340 
enough to it you think it's going to
change<00:01:43.530> color<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.549> grab<00:01:44.819> any<00:01:45.119> crystal<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
change color just grab any crystal and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.190 
change color just grab any crystal and
it<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.069> freeze<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.789> colors<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.659> map

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it will freeze all the colors on the map

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.749 
it will freeze all the colors on the map
and<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.549> proceed<00:01:50.939> through<00:01:55.640> here<00:01:56.640> we

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
and then you can proceed through here we

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.169 
and then you can proceed through here we
go<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> number<00:01:57.299> three<00:02:01.789> resolve<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.939> anomaly

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
go to number three resolve the anomaly

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.719 
go to number three resolve the anomaly
and<00:02:03.630> they're<00:02:03.810> getting<00:02:03.929> much<00:02:04.470> crazier<00:02:05.250> as<00:02:05.459> you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and they're getting much crazier as you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.259 
and they're getting much crazier as you
can<00:02:05.819> see<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.539> in<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:07.799> bottom<00:02:08.429> left<00:02:08.729> part

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
can see this one in the bottom left part

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.330 
can see this one in the bottom left part
of<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.509> we've<00:02:09.989> got<00:02:10.200> some<00:02:10.380> crystals<00:02:10.829> that<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
of it we've got some crystals that are a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.190 
of it we've got some crystals that are a
little<00:02:11.459> hard<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.760> connect<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.660> right<00:02:12.959> there

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
little hard to connect and right there

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720 
little hard to connect and right there
we<00:02:13.890> kind<00:02:14.099> of<00:02:14.160> knew<00:02:14.310> they<00:02:14.430> were<00:02:14.519> going<00:02:14.640> to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
we kind of knew they were going to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.039 
we kind of knew they were going to
change<00:02:14.760> color<00:02:15.150> before<00:02:15.329> we<00:02:15.540> go<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.870> them<00:02:15.959> we

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
change color before we go to them we

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.170 
change color before we go to them we
took<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> risk<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.860> again<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.849> got<00:02:17.970> enough

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
took a risk on it again we got enough

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.600 
took a risk on it again we got enough
time<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.569> should<00:02:18.630> be<00:02:18.930> able<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.140> get<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.260> done

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
time we should be able to get it done

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.550 
time we should be able to get it done
but<00:02:20.610> we're<00:02:20.730> really<00:02:20.849> keeping<00:02:21.269> an<00:02:21.390> eye<00:02:21.540> down<00:02:22.440> on

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
but we're really keeping an eye down on

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.520 
but we're really keeping an eye down on
the<00:02:22.680> left<00:02:22.860> part<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> map<00:02:23.579> of<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.989> grid<00:02:25.290> as

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the left part of the map of the grid as

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.699 
the left part of the map of the grid as
it<00:02:25.650> were<00:02:25.769> because<00:02:26.760> that's<00:02:27.030> where<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
it were because that's where the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.780 
it were because that's where the
trickiest<00:02:28.709> crystal<00:02:29.160> connections<00:02:29.579> are

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
trickiest crystal connections are

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.550 
trickiest crystal connections are
because<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.090> got<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.299> grab<00:02:30.480> them<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.750> then<00:02:31.109> go

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
because you got to grab them and then go

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.039 
because you got to grab them and then go
all<00:02:31.889> around<00:02:32.069> not<00:02:32.670> too<00:02:32.940> tricky<00:02:33.239> just<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.870> little

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
all around not too tricky just a little

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.790 
all around not too tricky just a little
bit<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.319> tricky

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:46.330 

let's<00:02:38.800> head<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.040> over<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.000> number<00:02:40.270> four

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.640 

alright

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
alright

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.800 
alright
and<00:02:48.769> just<00:02:49.730> memorize<00:02:50.120> where<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.450> crystals

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
and just memorize where the crystals

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.940 
and just memorize where the crystals
connects<00:02:51.140> you're<00:02:51.349> not<00:02:51.439> trying<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.680> connect

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
connects you're not trying to connect

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.110 
connects you're not trying to connect
once<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.250> don't<00:02:52.459> connect<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.790> one's<00:02:53.030> a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
once the don't connect this one's a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.149 
once the don't connect this one's a
little<00:02:53.239> nuts<00:02:53.599> because<00:02:54.470> we<00:02:54.680> got<00:02:54.829> that<00:02:54.980> one

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
little nuts because we got that one

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.280 
little nuts because we got that one
right<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.579> middle<00:02:55.989> where<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.110> red

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
right in the middle where the red

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.280 
right in the middle where the red
crystal<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.739> now<00:02:58.930> we're<00:02:59.930> gonna<00:03:00.079> want<00:03:00.170> to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
crystal is now we're gonna want to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.050 
crystal is now we're gonna want to
connect<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.799> pretty<00:03:01.760> soon<00:03:02.209> all<00:03:04.060> right

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
connect that pretty soon all right

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.819 
connect that pretty soon all right
taking<00:03:05.689> a<00:03:05.720> look<00:03:05.840> around<00:03:05.959> we<00:03:06.319> see<00:03:06.349> green<00:03:06.709> to

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
taking a look around we see green to

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.580 
taking a look around we see green to
green<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:08.420> keep<00:03:08.569> spinning<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.049> camera

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
green just keep spinning the camera

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.000 
green just keep spinning the camera
because<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.189> really<00:03:10.370> important<00:03:10.939> that<00:03:12.010> you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
because it's really important that you

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.550 
because it's really important that you
can<00:03:13.189> find<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:14.359> things<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.750> connect<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.260> then

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
can find the things to connect and then

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.710 
can find the things to connect and then
actually<00:03:15.709> connect<00:03:16.129> them<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:17.150> lid<00:03:17.299> yellow<00:03:17.599> is

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
actually connect them the lid yellow is

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.890 
actually connect them the lid yellow is
obvious<00:03:19.000> there<00:03:20.000> we<00:03:20.150> finally<00:03:20.359> get<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.659> do<00:03:20.780> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
obvious there we finally get to do the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.430 
obvious there we finally get to do the
big<00:03:21.079> red<00:03:21.319> Oh<00:03:24.099> get<00:03:25.099> a<00:03:25.129> little<00:03:25.370> turn<00:03:25.549> around<00:03:25.879> and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
big red Oh get a little turn around and

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:34.430 
big red Oh get a little turn around and
then<00:03:27.440> that<00:03:27.709> should<00:03:28.400> finish<00:03:28.970> it

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.710 

all<00:03:34.740> right<00:03:35.180> number<00:03:36.180> for<00:03:36.210> those<00:03:36.570> number<00:03:36.840> four

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
all right number for those number four

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.610 
all right number for those number four
here<00:03:39.720> we<00:03:39.870> go<00:03:40.110> number<00:03:40.350> five<00:03:42.380> some<00:03:43.380> sort<00:03:43.560> of

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
here we go number five some sort of

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.420 
here we go number five some sort of
crazy<00:03:43.800> alien<00:03:44.070> thing<00:03:44.520> all<00:03:45.950> right<00:03:46.950> first<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.310> see

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
crazy alien thing all right first to see

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.020 
crazy alien thing all right first to see
black<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.790> black<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:49.290> then<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.400> used<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.820> li

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
black to black and then I used to li

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.090 
black to black and then I used to li
immediately<00:03:51.690> grabbed<00:03:51.930> whatever<00:03:52.560> crystals

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
immediately grabbed whatever crystals

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.700 
immediately grabbed whatever crystals
right<00:03:53.250> next<00:03:53.550> to<00:03:53.610> me<00:03:53.700> because<00:03:53.880> there's<00:03:54.090> really

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
right next to me because there's really

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.440 
right next to me because there's really
no<00:03:55.710> reason<00:03:55.920> not<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:56.640> going<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.850> stop<00:03:57.300> the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
no reason not to it's going to stop the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.820 
no reason not to it's going to stop the
colors<00:03:57.720> from<00:03:57.840> change<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.380> give<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.650> more

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
colors from change and give you more

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.200 
colors from change and give you more
time<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:59.070> figure<00:03:59.430> out<00:03:59.610> which<00:03:59.760> colors<00:04:00.060> to

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
time to figure out which colors to

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.630 
time to figure out which colors to
connect<00:04:00.920> these<00:04:01.920> ones<00:04:02.160> are<00:04:02.280> getting<00:04:02.460> pretty

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
connect these ones are getting pretty

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.520 
connect these ones are getting pretty
easy<00:04:02.850> though<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.890> Reds<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.220> big<00:04:05.400> one<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:06.530> then

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
easy though the Reds a big one and then

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.440 
easy though the Reds a big one and then
orange<00:04:07.950> orange<00:04:08.370> going<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.610> finish<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:08.820> off<00:04:09.150> I

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
orange orange going to finish this off I

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.700 
orange orange going to finish this off I
