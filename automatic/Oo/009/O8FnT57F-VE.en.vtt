00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.070
 the history of the Atlantic Forest is a very old story 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.479
 is a story that begins with the African and South American continents 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.580
 were still assembled 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.600
 from about 150 million years ago these two continents 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.020
 began to separate 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.540
 building an environment that today is the Atlantic Forest 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.429
 This separation took time. 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.999
 about 150 million years to reach the present distance and it still 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.299
 not ceased 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.299
 so that the continents continue to separate 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.639
 station 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.730
 just the Atlantic Forest 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.049
 is one of the world's wetlands 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.159
 between these forests appear mainly among the tropics in 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.759
 regions where it rains above 1,000 and 800 mm per year 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.370
 more than half the area of ​​these forests is in Brazil 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.430
 between amazonia that the little that remains of the Atlantic Forest 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.980
 the main constraint 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.249
 of the existence of the Atlantic forest is the 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:04.439
 and the climate along the Brazilian coast is determined by the 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.169
 of the Atlantic coast and that will cause rains along the entire coast 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.049

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.569
 the story says 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.569
 ecological physiography was extraordinary

 of southeastern Brazil 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:03.239
 Brazil has the greatest strength of the two-time champion. 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.039
 of the world 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:10.069
 of the encounter with the sea the Atlantic forest repeats the history of the life 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.339
 of algae the first coastal vegetation

 we hope that the mangroves joão dos

 to the top of serasa 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.030
 in brazil what remains of the Atlantic Forest occupies 1 percent of the territory 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.749
 but it is home to the highest index of plant diversity on the planet 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.240
 these beasts 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 has a long biological history 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.719
 evidently many experiences 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.020
 already existed previously 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.529
 but the diversity 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.490
 she went 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.879
 it was at least every time and wrong 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.710
 for a series of 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.319
 love 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.319
 of climate change 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.680
 throughout its history 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.870
 the earth underwent several cooling known as glaciations 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.520
 were long-lasting cycles determining new conditions for the 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.939
 life on the planet 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.080
 during these periods the amount of ice in the poles increases 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.930
 the water of the seas' diminish 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.930
 and to the opinion that coastal areas 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.549
 the weather will then become drier and colder 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:55.619
 the glacial 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:58.009
 18 to 13 thousand years ago 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.330
 it was colder and drier than today 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.810
 then the large forested stores 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.460
 they were broken with ended up getting in the lagoon direction and technically the muricy 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.529
 when rafa lourença is divided into forest headline 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.639
 the animals and so I will not stay in the middle of the open formations caatinga and 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.490
 of the cerrado 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.270
 who are surrounding these multiple they stay within such an agenda 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.289
 policy that called the fund 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.409
 the form does not agree with it more is as if it were then 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.659
 this is a bid all because it is an area 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.569
 favorable surrounded by unfavorable areas for ever worse 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.849
 paulo rangel 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.860
 at the moment when tropicalization returned 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.909
 the refugee robes 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:56.039
 or at least reduce the smaller spaces 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:57.509
 to expand 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:58.770
 and with them 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.159
 if I did not pay 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.919
 speech of the bull that cal 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.389
 so has a long history 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:10.589
 d only the sesi flow species creations 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.439
 as a result of climate change that comes from today 27 

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.439
 even or we 

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:51.080
 there is still no Atlantic Forest goal 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.710
 agents soon realize 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.199
 the importance of this rainforest 

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.229
 and had the water is a constant presence 

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:03.629
 waterfalls is necessary to create titles everything is in the middle of 

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:04.289
 Woods 

00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:07.959
 the victim finds plenty of water where there is nothing 

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.479
 then the relationship in which water and forest 

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.879
 it is a very intimate relationship the initial bid
