00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.049
 Yes, people welcome to maximize airplane rest 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.510
 I figured this is not my thing to give 9 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.709
 Previews and how much to do 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.709
 and I start the Haller again with Joss costs too 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.820
 Jackass Christo 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.460
 is an open world game as the only way out offers four so can Rainer 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.939
 run around sharply 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.099
 Kill people see water 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.550
 Norbert just Cause 2 with ESTOS will be so 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.280
 that we have a network cr-z so far as a very big world so 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.820
 and also 1000 square kilometers of solos 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.950
 she thanks the whole 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.230
 Press and the archipelago Jens I can also call 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.840
 For example, towns and villages have learned military bases 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.650
 Dornbirn the citizens so that Manfred Berger with snow 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.420
 now would have to explain what tropical 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.770
 the distances 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.770
 as really very difficult Geurts FDP variety 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.720
 that's Robbie Dixon's in the game now 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.970
 By the way, on March 26, the Xbox will be the 60 PlayStation 3 and PC 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.830
 appear 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.890
 if it is preordered now you get any weapons i believe in 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.130
 abas-erp objects more 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.700
 yes Piel what I mean is of it first parts so Boschert ASG us-tourist 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.390
 played at the tables August is Oberstdorf and a culprit had it 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.970
 on Sunday in itself 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.770
 could pull in the countryside 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.600
 in the second part have victory these days he is 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 Expanded space 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.270
 and indeed, this hard smash can move from building to building 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300
 pull from car to car 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.870
 the Kazakhs with it around Gdansk - a sequence go out Strunz stone at the 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.250
 Then head hang globe and take the postage 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.390
 you can also turn off your opponents, that is, they go here 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.420
 Never, then, is the witness around after Anna Maier 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.300
 to the clinic 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.720
 Pompey finished with the fool guilt 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.330
 I knew he could count on opponents Gas bottles are binding when first guest 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.690
 the feeling of a bottle shoots 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.539
 flies away 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.539
 Phitek with the GM yes with the thing just turn 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.980
 They can also tag these things on cars at the march 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.310
 other places and drive away or even to a helicopter and a 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.409
 plane 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.739
 and yes, too 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.739
 the whole game will hold over 100 US trend 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.219
 just about aircraft helicopter 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.349
 then on tanks normal cars motorcycles and much much more 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.260
 that's been shared years Gibson's numbers missions exist, of course 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.589
 St PR 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:40.430
 So a 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.739
 Irmen have to 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.820
 to unlock the mission you have to 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.190
 So, in Wismar, donate military bases or destroy them 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.319
 Solanki off 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.719
 but destroy the negotiation matter 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.169
 and we do that consistently from points 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.169
 without these points cancel their mission 3 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.120
 yes, what I've seen in the song now is that you make the world a lot 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.949
 So, for example, they can destroy the East very well 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.509
 chase Kummetz 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.640
 to support a crane 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.919
 with smash life 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.599
 Ana to the Copts a coupe Kopper at the Roxane federal 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.349
 and all who drive him with a crane the antithesis for example that they 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.129
 yourself 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.129
 Our sympathy goes to all who are with him 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.409
 Sometimes it's a breeze It's not child's play so realistic 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:32.569
 Destiny Schwyzer mediocre finish should be realistic but 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.429
 to have fun with the game 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.429
 and I believed it returned to business 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.919
 was on monday that does the PlayStation 3 version again 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.260
 because they need his or a recording function containing the videos 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.760
 Peter Nemeth record it and direct ski2b lurked Kuntz 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.629
 the eyes 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:52.989
 for not very cool 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.879
 but unfortunately only for the harvest I write on the PC or Xbox as well 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:57.649
 light 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:02.309
 I myself do not have a ps3 Slim PC and soon, maybe in Xbox point life 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.659
 until the year Schauberg 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.659
 Make Alba's office 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:14.379
 yes the only thing that is playing with Jennifer Aniston is 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.139
 Glass 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.579
 Know the game will include multiplayer mode 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.889
 in the cited too much of it many players 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.249
 from Bonhams in his program, yes 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.129
 worked on it that the world wants to finish Nahles 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.319
 now came 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.610
 give back to the house no multiplayer mode, which I give a lot 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.080
 too bad 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.870
 there I think 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.720
 he should have really done solving seriously should you be able to do it 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.310
 and yes, as I said, I hope the developers 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.310
 do that still at Rome or per fended off defense 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.149
 because who really cool off that 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.270
 at 10 o'clock will give on the fourth of march for a little bit over 3 Xbox than 60 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.270
 and PC for the pc version is available on Steam 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.110
 demolishes just 90 square kilometers based on the Hameln 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.789
 11 and Kasko Stu final acceptance year 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:08.960
 Keep Vienna 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.900
 a few little mission 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.089
 and around 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:15.969
 yes a small part of the vehicles the sbm main players will give 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.020
 Jochen Homann 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.150
 a lousy tilt in March of mine will then give it some gameplay of the order 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.089
 there probably also an orientation 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.699
 the PROKON should be that of the user 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.300
 anyway must be outside survived quarter of march 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.659
 is on Thursday 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.389
 I could do a lot 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.280
 If you need to get a taste for yourself, the game does not think so 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.139
 come up 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.449
 All stocks Amazon Wind in the description can follow him 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.650
 gets exclusive content and that's about it after graduation only one 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.819
 Quäntchen there is still a trailer 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.819
 Schölmerich and until next time Schaub 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.869
 No 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:57.259
 it is final 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.389
 Yahoo No. 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.389
 May terminated 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.249
 The dysfunctional irritate these go 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:10.960
 Preuß give Wiesbaden 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.349
 What you do not understand 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:13.650
 all 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.490
 in the autumn 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.490
 everyone is wearing 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.740
 also from 8 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.499
 OK 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:30.610
 we could 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.610
 century 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.929
 most red 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.270
 France will be easy again 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 the location is 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:55.149
 Has 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:05.939
 Brian Cowen started 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:06.509
