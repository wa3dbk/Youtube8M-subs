 in the United States 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.850
 the game's own developer gave a 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.070
 help for what your loved one's doctor 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.020

 she finally accepted the request in April 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.130
 2012 they got married only this one 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.439
 marriage was very different from the 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.530
 conventional all decoration including 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.579
 the wedding dresses were 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.430
 characterized according to minecraft 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.230
 the site of the ceremony saw replicas of 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.270
 animals and game monsters 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.740
 scattered throughout the environment 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.020
 guests may also prepare 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.750
 with blocks by the place and arrangements in the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.460
 tables inspired by the vegetation of the game 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.070
 and to close with the golden key this 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.110
 literally fixe side of course 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.780
 as I said the two also did 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.390
 matter of carrying with them details 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.760
 minecraft inspired dress 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.770
 bride was beautiful long white nothing of 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.229
 very different but this neck she 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.240
 wore a turquoise jewel in the same format 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.610
 of the game diamonds 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.890
 already your now husband had his costume 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.200
 entirely inspired by the game 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.940
 Well I thought I had seen all kinds 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.190
 of addicted to this game with more that 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.970
 really succeeded in surprising a 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.450
 a little 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.310
 Mario fit and the cheesy wedding is that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.439
 unlike the wedding side the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.930
 minecraft addicts that I introduced 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:17.060
 first and was well organized to see 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.270
 invented in the game and if I found half 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.760
 What's the use of love? 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.070
 are the theme of the couple in question was Mario 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.170
 bros and of course the groom was the 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.280
 princess peach's bride and with already 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.710
 starting with them 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.560
 we have great differences between 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.130
 the couple and the characters of the game ours 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.220
 real life pitt was tattooed and much more 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.650
 full of games princess already 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.230
 our human being was more of a crime 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.370
 much higher than the Mario of the 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.110
 video games 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.600
 It's okay, it was just a wedding party. 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.330
 they were not required to be 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.730
 characters but I found it funny 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.760
 the decoration of the whole party based on 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.100
 game from the environment even cake 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.910
 friends of the couple will help decorate the place 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.240
 of the wedding cost in a small castle 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.830
 spreading turtle shell made with 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.560
 bicycle helmet 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.450
 It was a joyful party and beyond 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.600
 some guests who were also 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.800
 used character until a dock club gave 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.070
 the guys over there 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:27.020
 this wedding took place in 2011 in 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:30.080
 United States for being a fact breaking the 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.209
 head to get married because it's war they are 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.700
 there the united kingdom decided to run away from 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.890
 any pattern involving the request 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.080
 and bet on one of his 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.390
 favorite games to make the proposal 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.280
 Your girlfriend, Stephanie. 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.150
 he counted on the help of several people 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.310
 including professionals of the valve everything 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.760
 this to create a version of the plan I am 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.430
 wonderful that it is short or two were 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.440
 made three light ones that had as sole 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.150
 goal that is stefhany until a 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.610
 kind of chapel 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.190
 in the way a heart was formed by the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.500
 lakers and in the end the proposal was made 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.380
 in the remarkable voice of l 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.960
 clay dubbing the fantastic goalkeepers and 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.240
 she said that Stefany could say she did not 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.320
 She wants to know how to handle it a lot. 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.109
 well with it 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.260
 but thank God the answer was 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.320
 certain jobs or my answer will be 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.580
 that difficulty that the team encountered 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:32.500
 runs the game station and order 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.500
 applied in zhuhai 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:43.120
 what staged a side crash will 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.310
 obviously the fourth fact will be that 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.730
 marriage and reign combine 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.070

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.520
 united they met through the xbox 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.180
 live playing lion king two times later 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.160
 more precisely there in 2009 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.920
 the bride decided that she wanted to marry 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.980
 your boyfriend in a ceremony totally 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.600
 set in the same game as a couple 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.270
 the marriage had men 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.030
 characterized according to the game and 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.910
 even a small tournament instead of 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.090
 traditional dance among several others 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.250
 things based on the game reigned was so 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.400
 important to them that was present 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.260
 even on honeymoon and without pigeons 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.340
 they went to the place where every game 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.310
 was born and lived happily ever after 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.770

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.770
