00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
would stand up and he would set back

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.250 
would stand up and he would set back
down<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.149> then<00:00:54.270> he<00:00:54.329> would<00:00:54.449> stand<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.050> he

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.510 
down and then he would stand up and he
did<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> few<00:00:55.620> times<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.980> daily<00:00:56.129> lost<00:00:56.370> like

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
did that a few times a daily lost like

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.900 
did that a few times a daily lost like
50<00:00:57.120> pounds<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.660> no<00:00:58.199> time<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.800> course<00:00:59.039> he<00:00:59.219> he<00:00:59.789> had

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
50 pounds in no time of course he he had

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
50 pounds in no time of course he he had
all<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> weight<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.570> pick<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.620> stuff<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
all that weight to pick up and stuff to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.410 
all that weight to pick up and stuff to
exercise<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.520> that's<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.969> guess<00:01:03.120> that's<00:01:03.329> why

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
exercise with that's I guess that's why

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.450 
exercise with that's I guess that's why
they<00:01:03.570> say<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.650> last<00:01:04.860> 10<00:01:05.070> pounds<00:01:05.369> is

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
they say that you the last 10 pounds is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.070 
they say that you the last 10 pounds is
always<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> hardest<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.090> lose<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.540> guess<00:01:06.930> it's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
always the hardest to lose I guess it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.240 
always the hardest to lose I guess it's
because<00:01:07.170> you're<00:01:07.409> carrying<00:01:07.830> around<00:01:07.950> less

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
because you're carrying around less

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.230 
because you're carrying around less
weight<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> lose<00:01:09.119> less<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.810> don't<00:01:10.590> know

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
weight and so you lose less I don't know

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.100 
weight and so you lose less I don't know
even<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:12.450> gonna<00:01:12.570> post<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.960> video

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
even if I'm gonna post this video

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.859 
even if I'm gonna post this video
