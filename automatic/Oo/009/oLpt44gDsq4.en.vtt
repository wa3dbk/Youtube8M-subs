 agents of the bit trunk designed to be able to demonstrate what the steps are 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.770
 what 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.369
 who has to do 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.489
 if you have to have the go-ahead 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.029

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.199
 Step by Step

 to us do not ask us how it really is 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.480
 the armored vehicles 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.350
 that successful people have 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.500
 we have decided to invest this time to stop to be able to explain this 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.940
 because many people that have some 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.940
 so what he does is that you're never doing every day 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.870
 which is the reason 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.970
 venezuela was next to that so many people are growing so much 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.910
 but I do not have that much time per lap explained by phone 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.889
 I do not have enough time to decide 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.889
 do this video therefore it is that you 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.930
 Step by Step 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.700
 what we are going to teach you 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.480
 and if you keep going, it happened p 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.970
 this can have those results what require interventions followed step to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.790
 He passed 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.370
 one of the first things that I am going to tell you a porch group last month 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.600
 ap 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.910
 there have been experiences that can be lived 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.430
 and if we were already fined 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.590
 may be they can simply pay for the new packs 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.410
 first thing that yuri zhirkov starts 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.140
 who wants to make a list of equa that makes this business because 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.210
 what is the reason that the confectioners of the event study is 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.110
 to say the same 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.390
 they have to define exactly what it is that you want to play 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.650
 where else 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.920
 endured where you want to win 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.810
 ongil you want to win tickets now well you are going to sit and go if the bread where 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.179
 I want to be in a year 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.110
 the next twelve months that is exactly what I want to achieve 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.630
 where do I want to go 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.630
 to the next 12 months of end of work says exactly 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.889
 what position do you want to have 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.479
 how much do you want to be winning which team dean who is driving 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.409
 what home equipment that comes to those who are old 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.779
 I want to be doing with that money 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.069
 as servants of the 20 thousand dollars then you 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.920
 because I want to earn those 20 thousand dollars or lunch to retire from work 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.230
 to the death of a month from the start 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.490
 the goals for education and without light 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.210
 you have to have it clear to know exactly what you want to achieve 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.929
 what exactly I want is to win 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.459
 because most people do not know what I want more than 3 per 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.880
 hundred knows what he wants and you want to be part of 3% 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.319
 and have a lifestyle 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.069
 and that is hardly exactly what you want 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.129
 now when you choose exactly what they want when they want to win and everything 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.699
 that 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.399
 says that we turn it into what we think of most of the time 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.139
 we become what we think most of the time I do not know you 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.489
 you are thinking 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.590
 because they are tired with negative cases related to the stands and attract 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:14.529
 that the state of health 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.889
 to me and I do not remember at the mere thought I did not have money or that it contained 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.080
 the envelope contained on marquez pages arrive 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.799
 and there it will serve the governor who is going through 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.799
 interpreted deferred to compensate 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.489
 no more than what I want in what he wants 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.860
 ok, I'm going to be clear on this, it's clear that I can do a lot 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:36.949
 what to see 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.299
