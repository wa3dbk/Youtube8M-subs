00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.090
 already 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.000
 as soon as it gets rid of when we talk 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.229
 try to say 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.040
 to precede 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.600
 in meta 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.780
 however, the dynamics are different 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.750
 in any case it was a night in which it is 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.940
 was characterized precisely by these 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:51.260
 two dramatic events that 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.110
 marked the beginning of this 2014 in 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.350
 dramatic way we had already closed the 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.810
 2013 with 36 fatal accidents in the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.600
 city ​​of naples start the first one 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.990
 of the year with two fatal accidents with 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 two different situations 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.860
 it's really a bad sign 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:17.500
 we hope that the positive signal that 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:24.050
 instead it arrived from the New Year's barrels 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.610
 may also influence the 2014 figure 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.200
 regarding accidents 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.610
 mortals trying to reduce this 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.890
 number which is an exceptional number 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.100
 too big for a city like that 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.100
 of Naples
