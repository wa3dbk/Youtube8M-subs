the game of football we don't want the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
the game of football we don't want the
ball<00:00:32.250> carrier<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> become<00:00:32.969> even<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.570> us

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
ball carrier to become even with us

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.690 
ball carrier to become even with us
gives<00:00:34.410> them<00:00:34.590> an<00:00:34.680> opportunity<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.190> cut<00:00:35.430> back

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
gives them an opportunity to cut back

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.180 
gives them an opportunity to cut back
where<00:00:36.270> our<00:00:36.390> defense<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> not<00:00:37.290> okay<00:00:37.950> basically

what<00:00:38.579> we're<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.570> we're<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
what we're going to do is we're going to
have<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> ball<00:00:40.920> carrier<00:00:41.370> work<00:00:41.610> downhill

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
have the ball carrier work downhill

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.500 
have the ball carrier work downhill
towards<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> these<00:00:43.170> cones<00:00:43.469> each

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
towards one of these cones each

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.479 
towards one of these cones each
opportunity<00:00:45.510> within<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.379> cone<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.980> we're

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
opportunity within the cone is we're

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.880 
opportunity within the cone is we're
going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.640> call<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.090> gap<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.750> gap<00:00:48.989> C<00:00:49.379> gap<00:00:49.590> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
going to call it a gap be gap C gap and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
going to call it a gap be gap C gap and
we're<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.520> simulate<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.600> line

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
we're going to simulate that as the line

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
we're going to simulate that as the line
of<00:00:51.960> scrimmage<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.920> ball<00:00:53.160> carrier<00:00:53.550> has<00:00:53.699> an

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
four holes the tackler once the ball

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.170 
four holes the tackler once the ball
carrier<00:00:58.949> makes<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> decision<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> pick<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
whole will get themselves squared up in

whole will get themselves squared up in
the<00:01:02.460> hole<00:01:02.670> at<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> whole<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.840> at<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.260> line<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the hole at the whole or at the line of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.410 
the hole at the whole or at the line of
scrimmage<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.400> work<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.760> perfect<00:01:06.210> form

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
scrimmage and then work is perfect form

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.570 
scrimmage and then work is perfect form
tackle<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.439> youth<00:01:07.590> level<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.220> probably

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
tackle at the youth level it's probably

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.300 
tackle at the youth level it's probably
a<00:01:08.670> real<00:01:08.909> good<00:01:09.150> idea<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:10.140> let<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> ball<00:01:10.920> carrier

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
a real good idea to let the ball carrier

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.429 
a real good idea to let the ball carrier
you<00:01:11.610> actually<00:01:11.970> tell<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> ball<00:01:12.600> carrier<00:01:12.930> which

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you actually tell the ball carrier which

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
you actually tell the ball carrier which
holds<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.920> select<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.549> definitely<00:01:15.270> gives<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
holds you select it definitely gives you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.450 
holds you select it definitely gives you
more<00:01:15.720> control<00:01:15.840> over<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.530> drill<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.340> other

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
more control over the drill the other

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.550 
more control over the drill the other
situation<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> coach<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
situation is it's up to the coach to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469 
situation is it's up to the coach to
control<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.189> tempo<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.850> hitting<00:01:21.180> level

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
control the tempo and the hitting level

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
control the tempo and the hitting level
of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> drill<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> couple

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
of the drill you can do that in a couple

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.640 
of the drill you can do that in a couple
different<00:01:23.580> ways<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> ways<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.110> first

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
different ways one of the ways is first

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.960 
different ways one of the ways is first
of<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.700> players

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
of all you can just have the players

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
of all you can just have the players
walk<00:01:27.299> through<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> drill<00:01:28.020> secondly<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.250> can

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
walk through the drill secondly you can

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
walk through the drill secondly you can
control<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> distance<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> drill<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
control the distance of the drill as you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
control the distance of the drill as you
see<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:31.799> now<00:01:32.009> weird<00:01:32.460> about<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.060> guess<00:01:33.630> we're

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
see right now weird about I guess we're

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.910 
see right now weird about I guess we're
going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> start<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.229> five<00:01:34.439> yard<00:01:34.680> intervals

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
going to start at five yard intervals

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.890 
going to start at five yard intervals
walk<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> line<00:01:35.850> whatever<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> lima

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
walk up to the line whatever to lima

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.330 
walk up to the line whatever to lima
there<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.829> we're<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
there you go so we're going to do this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.859 
there you go so we're going to do this
at<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> five-year-old<00:01:39.030> interval<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.720> can

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
at a five-year-old interval you can

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.260 
at a five-year-old interval you can
certainly<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.560> tighter<00:01:40.860> quarters<00:01:41.270> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
certainly do it in tighter quarters to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.050 
certainly do it in tighter quarters to
to<00:01:42.990> control<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> tempo<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.130> also<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> contort

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
to control the tempo and also to contort

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
to control the tempo and also to contort
to<00:01:45.509> control<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> type<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> collision<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
to control the type of collision that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.260 
to control the type of collision that
you're<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.939> thing<00:01:48.149> you're

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you're going to have one thing you're

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910 
you're going to have one thing you're
going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> notice<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.990> we're<00:01:49.229> working<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.619> hash

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
going to notice is we're working on hash

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.249 
going to notice is we're working on hash
mark<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.520> you'll<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.229> have

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
mark right here you'll see that I have

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
mark right here you'll see that I have
the<00:01:52.560> defender<00:01:53.070> already<00:01:53.579> by<00:01:54.210> hot<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
outside of the hash mark and i'll start

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.609 
outside of the hash mark and i'll start
the<00:01:57.119> running<00:01:57.420> back<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> inside<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the running back on the inside of the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.760 
the running back on the inside of the
hash<00:01:58.799> mark<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.579> way<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.090> know<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.619> begin

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
hash mark that way we know that to begin

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.069 
hash mark that way we know that to begin
the<00:02:01.979> drill<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> ball<00:02:02.729> carrier<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.240> behind<00:02:03.750> the

the drill the ball carrier is behind the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.510 
the drill the ball carrier is behind the
football<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.860> basically<00:02:05.159> we're<00:02:05.340> going<00:02:05.460> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
football so basically we're going to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.089 
football so basically we're going to
work<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.880> drill<00:02:06.210> from<00:02:06.659> right<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.530> left<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
work this drill from right to left and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:08.570 
work this drill from right to left and
we

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
we

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.730 
we
working<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.119> we're<00:02:09.390> using<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.990> left<00:02:10.470> part

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
working this we're using the left part

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.590 
working this we're using the left part
of<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.890> field<00:02:11.070> as<00:02:11.280> we're<00:02:11.730> working<00:02:12.060> towards

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
of the field as we're working towards

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.750 
of the field as we're working towards
the<00:02:12.720> outside<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.470> football<00:02:13.830> field<00:02:14.010> okay

through the third hole one two three so
we<00:02:44.070> were<00:02:44.130> considered<00:02:44.580> at<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.730> C<00:02:45.060> gap<00:02:45.300> we're

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
we were considered at the C gap we're

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.540 
we were considered at the C gap we're
going<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.020> take<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.500> offensive<00:02:46.950> player<00:02:47.220> make

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
going to take the offensive player make

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.740 
going to take the offensive player make
sure<00:02:47.700> he<00:02:47.790> has<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.940> football<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.630> it's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
sure he has the football and it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.720 
sure he has the football and it's
outside<00:02:48.930> arm<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.860> also<00:02:50.370> simulates

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
outside arm that also simulates

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
outside arm that also simulates
typically<00:02:51.630> what<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> running<00:02:52.170> back<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.620> going

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
typically what a running back is going

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.560 
typically what a running back is going
to<00:02:53.040> do<00:02:53.190> he's<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.910> have<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.150> football

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
to do he's going to have the football

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.110 
to do he's going to have the football
away<00:02:54.840> from<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.980> defenders<00:02:56.459> as<00:02:56.640> they<00:02:56.820> approach

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
away from the defenders as they approach

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.940 
away from the defenders as they approach
so<00:02:57.840> might<00:02:58.020> get<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.260> ball<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.470> your<00:02:58.530> right<00:02:58.740> arm

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
so might get the ball in your right arm

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.580 
so might get the ball in your right arm
like<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.280> have<00:03:00.110> basically<00:03:01.110> all<00:03:01.350> we're<00:03:01.500> going

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
like you have basically all we're going

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.640 
like you have basically all we're going
to<00:03:01.650> do<00:03:01.860> here<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.510> we're<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.690> have<00:03:03.900> like

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
to do here is we're going to have like
