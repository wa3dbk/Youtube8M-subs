the<00:05:23.970> bikes<00:05:24.150> got<00:05:24.449> airborne<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.650> is<00:05:25.860> a

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
the bikes got airborne and that is a

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.120 
the bikes got airborne and that is a

terrible terrible sight feet the

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.070 
terrible terrible sight feet the
barriers<00:05:29.580> should<00:05:29.820> be<00:05:30.210> projected<00:05:30.690> into<00:05:30.840> my

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
barriers should be projected into my

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.840 
barriers should be projected into my
mind<00:05:31.350> that<00:05:31.470> should<00:05:31.620> be<00:05:31.800> a<00:05:31.979> much<00:05:32.370> longer

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
mind that should be a much longer

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.939 
mind that should be a much longer
distance<00:05:32.970> out<00:05:33.419> because<00:05:33.990> if<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.530> start<00:05:34.830> to

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
distance out because if you start to

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.460 
distance out because if you start to
head<00:05:35.220> towards<00:05:35.699> them<00:05:36.020> it<00:05:37.020> could<00:05:37.260> cause<00:05:37.440> some

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
head towards them it could cause some

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.650 
head towards them it could cause some
very<00:05:38.040> nasty<00:05:38.310> injuries<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.090> believe<00:05:39.449> that's

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
very nasty injuries and I believe that's

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.510 
very nasty injuries and I believe that's
what<00:05:39.870> we've<00:05:40.020> got<00:05:40.199> right<00:05:40.380> there<00:05:40.410> yeah<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.280> was
