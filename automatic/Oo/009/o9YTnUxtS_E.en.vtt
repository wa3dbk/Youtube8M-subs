00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.429
 the poems wines and the novels photos 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.429
 the net that it rains 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.009
 and that such a disc comes in handy be 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.500
 Welcome to Friday of questions and 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.329
 answers on Saturday number 2 the day of 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.500
 Today I'm going to explain many things 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.840
 fact I will not answer any 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.579
 ask rather I will explain things 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.380
 that have been going on with the channel is 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.269
 as an informative video so if you see 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.769
 my videos stay if you do not see them 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.660
 it makes sense because you're seeing this 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.199
 then you are a very rare person 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.769
 and someone raped you more greetings and nobody 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.260
 I violated you 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.059
 first of all apologize to all this 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.309
 week I did not upload almost videos upload 3 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.899
 videos I will not do this followed already 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.460
 I'm going to start again with the pace that 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.559
 I had a video before two videos 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.230
 newspapers I was just on exams 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.760
 I had projects I'm just like you 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.340
 Many people think that I am a robot 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.410
 no and that my voice is as programmed and that 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.210
 the videos do alone with the legs and 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.309
 well do not we do not alone do I have to 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.809
 do it myself then it's complicated because 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.059
 I also have to do other things 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.860
 First of all, the series is not going to 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.090
 do on Friday let's say the last 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.530
 Friday video of questions and 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.660
 answers was the last one that in fact already 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.700
 it was on Saturday the last last one in 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.820
 Friday was the number 15 if I did not 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.040
 I mistake the 16 I recorded it on Saturday and the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.270
 I do not have time to record because everything 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.430
 the day I'm outside my house arrived 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.020
 like until 10 or until 9 and that 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.060
 time I could not record what I'm going to 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.160
 to do is prepare videos and all that but 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.780
 on Friday I will not do the series of 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.670
 questions and answers better I'm going to 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.490
 change to Saturday besides I have already 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.680
 15 16 episodes doing it on Friday no 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.420
 it's bad to change it to Saturday Saturday is 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.430
 a beautiful day is when you wake up and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.080
 you say to egg I'm very happy I do not have 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.850
 classes I can do what I want but 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.650
 then already on Sunday is when you start 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.060
 cry so I'm never going to make a 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.950
 series on Sunday because on Sundays 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.930
 they smell like pure gay neon and they suck fucking 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.210
 Sunday is already the afternoon and the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.860
 Sunday returning the theme of the video not 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.960
 nothing has happened with the channel has not happened 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.789
 nothing with me, many have asked me 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.009
 that if I'm losing the motivation of 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.360
 my channel or something like that and honestly it's not 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.130
 that on the contrary I am more motivated 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.990
 games are coming out that I am playing 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.209
 I've found indie games a lot 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.679
 very good that I will then record by 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.750
 there are many things that I still want 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.310
 record from gta 5 there are many things that 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.350
 I still want to do I'm working 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.390
 with a friend in an animation I'm 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.280
 doing a lot of things but not all 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.590
 you are seeing them because many 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.450
 of things, I do them, I just do them 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.700
 by 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.379
 of the channel I do not like to be saying what 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.629
 what do I do because then if I do not do it today 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.879
 you said in that video that you were going to 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.410
 do this and you never did it if in 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.750
 summary what I want to do is follow 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.790
 with the channel to bring more games is a 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.349
 informational video I had never done this 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.000
 I think I had never recorded a video 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.250
 as explaining what I 'm trying 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.900
 to do or if I had done it I did 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.790
 a lot of time because I do not remember very 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.890
 well I think he made one in 2014 that is 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.780
 already a year ago everything remains the same from 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.910
 now the videos are going to start 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.769
 daily two videos a day sunk a day 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.330
 pretend that my routine was to arrive 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.010
 from school to do sleep projects 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.750
 get from school to do projects 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.640
 sleep in fact do not post anything in 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.349
 twitter nothing on facebook reaches 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.760
 record a video out there but I could not 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.290
 dedicate the time that I like 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.450
 dedicate to my channel and many of you 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.860
 they noticed it I was seeing messages from 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.170
 twitter and most were like that 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.540
 you're dead he was hit by a truck here 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.980
 is the news nothing was nobody put 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.810
 but they did ask me if I 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.060
 something had happened, nothing happened to me 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.010
 I commented had a busy week 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.510
 which is very strange because always 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.610
 I find the time to make videos 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.500
 but this week I could not and I'm not from 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.970
 those very organized people who record 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.040
 gameplays and they are planning and all that 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.780
 I am like very spontaneous then yes 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.580
 I suddenly feel like recording call of 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.170
 duty recorded it if I feel like recording 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.670
 of sting and I record it by the way I'm 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.410
 downloading the dl cd from sting and see if 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.210
 Now I record some game or something like that 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.100
 I do not plan much what I'm going to upload 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.780
 my channel rather like that suddenly it 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.490
 I want to play an indie game I start 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.920
 to look for it suddenly I feel like playing 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.380
 let's say a game more chingón and recorded it 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.880
 fast game gta what I record is not like 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.010
 that I am planning everything and have it 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.780
 a list of 6 so yes I will 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.030
 play this from six and a half to four 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.100
 wayne brannon I do not know what I said but not 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.200
 I plan nothing and I think that also 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.270
 that can not upload videos if it were more 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.040
 organized I could have done what I did 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.840
 all week and also upload videos 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.880
 but you know I'm roe I'm an egg 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.800
 so I do not like to organize myself 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.600
 I know because I feel like I left like a year 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.280
 in fact I'm talking as if I've never 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.650
 I would have made video a year ago and I'm 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.660
 talking about why I left like that I did not 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.550
 videos like in two days or three but as 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.290
 I'm already so used to recording almost 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.419
 daily newspaper recorded a video or 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.460
 two videos it was super weird to be 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.050
 four days without recording now imagine yourself 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.790
 all those youtubers that are dedicated 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.260
 to youtube and do not record one week is 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.300
 have to feel the good thing is that I'm 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.020
 doing other things not just me 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.340
 I was sitting there 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.259
 saying today I'm not going to record was 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.849
 basically as I tell you about things 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.349
 of my personal life 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.699
 today tell us when now I'm going to 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.349
 tell anything because it is not very interesting 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.940
 if it was interesting I would tell you but 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.039
 no it was not very interesting nothing happened 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.569
 interesting by the way killed a person 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.909
 Greetings to that grief your sister does not kill 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.009
 nobody that sounded very macabre imagine 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.349
 stop making videos to kill the 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.729
 the series of questions and answers as 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.530
 I tell you it's going to be Saturday now it's going to 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.750
 be a question and answer Saturday 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.030
 because I am very original and I can 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.889
 send your messages or your questions in 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.539
 twitter or on facebook whenever you do 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.009
 the publication the first episode them 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.870
 I say it's going to be on Saturday I think this 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.729
 week that I did not upload as many videos or that 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.860
 do not spend a lot of time doing things 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.500
 channel like that it helped me a lot to 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.479
 bring new ideas but like to return 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.729
 with more encouragement because suddenly when 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.530
 You do a lot and you do not stop 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.240
 do as you start to jump or such 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.460
 time as if it tires you as if you no longer 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.169
 you enjoy so much and now I'm very 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.969
 motivated to return with the channel 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.370
 well in fact always been motivated 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.259
 however this week or these 45 days 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.729
 that I was not so active that I was not 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.340
 checking so much facebook that I 'm not 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.409
 checking both the channel in general 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.939
 it served a lot I will record 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.119
 now more than ever happier than 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.679
 never more sex than ever more good I know 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:49.159
 what I am saying is that I am bad for 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:50.659
 talk 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.459
 thank you very much I'm going to the cock 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.779
 our brother I 'm not going to the cock of 

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:56.089
 the games that I have planned now 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:58.459
 play are going to be geometries that I have 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.019
 been asking a lot as if it were 

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.729
 the best game in history already 

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:04.369
 I was playing practice on the cell phone 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.139
 I'm pretty bad but then I'm going to 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:08.749
 record on pc for you to see how 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.339
 I get angry or like he disputed me I know that 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.809
 it's a game that many have played yet 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.759
 so I want to upload it because I think it's going to 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:15.709
 to be very funny that game I'm going to 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.279
 play sting and I'll play call of 

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.050
 duty 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.639
 logically gta nor do I have to say 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.259
 because jeta is always going to be in the 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.029
 channel if any game you want it 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.069
 recommend tell me in the comments you can 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:27.050
 being free indie can be a game 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:28.909
 what can it cost to be an xbox game
