was<00:02:44.720> definitely<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.380> decision<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.190> make

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
was definitely the decision to make

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.880 
was definitely the decision to make
especially<00:02:46.700> after<00:02:47.000> such<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.390> role<00:02:48.260> with<00:02:48.440> big

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
especially after such a role with big

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.460 
especially after such a role with big
catch<00:02:49.220> right<00:02:49.519> before<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.000> half<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:50.569> um<00:02:50.750> you

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
catch right before the half but um you

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.800 
catch right before the half but um you
know<00:02:51.590> my<00:02:51.769> before<00:02:52.160> halftime<00:02:52.459> collapses<00:02:53.420> are<00:02:53.599> I

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
know my before halftime collapses are I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.380 
know my before halftime collapses are I
guess<00:02:54.200> they're<00:02:54.410> continuing<00:02:55.209> hopefully<00:02:56.209> that

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
guess they're continuing hopefully that

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.050 
guess they're continuing hopefully that
