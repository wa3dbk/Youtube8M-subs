great<00:02:23.040> defenders<00:02:23.610> at<00:02:23.820> their<00:02:24.180> club<00:02:24.450> teams<00:02:25.070> when

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
great defenders at their club teams when

they are coming to the national team

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.360 
they are coming to the national team
they<00:02:27.960> like<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.290> support<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.770> lot<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> attack

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
they like to support a lot the attack

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.400 
they like to support a lot the attack
and<00:02:29.610> do<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> show<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.300> know<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> game<00:02:31.080> and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
and do a show you know in the game and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.130 
and do a show you know in the game and
they<00:02:31.890> remain<00:02:32.250> uncovered<00:02:32.790> at<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.270> defense<00:02:33.630> so

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
they remain uncovered at the defense so

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.380 
they remain uncovered at the defense so
I<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.350> it's<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.770> good<00:02:34.980> price<00:02:35.280> for<00:02:35.700> posting<00:02:36.270> to

I think it's a good price for posting to
score<00:02:36.660> 1.9<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.830> I'll<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.520> with<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> steak<00:02:39.270> on
