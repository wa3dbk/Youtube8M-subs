now<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:15.990> think<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.310> antioxidants<00:00:17.310> as

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
now I like to think of antioxidants as

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.310 
now I like to think of antioxidants as
the<00:00:17.670> biggest<00:00:18.180> x-factor<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.050> comes<00:00:19.199> to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
actually a group of compounds are gonna

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.910 
actually a group of compounds are gonna

you're just having protein yeah you guys

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.480 
you're just having protein yeah you guys
aren't<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.439> feeding<00:01:37.829> your<00:01:37.920> body<00:01:38.159> what's

aren't you know feeding your body what's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.310 
aren't you know feeding your body what's
gonna<00:01:38.700> stimulate<00:01:39.000> protein<00:01:39.360> synthesis<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
gonna stimulate protein synthesis and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.560 
gonna stimulate protein synthesis and
increase<00:01:41.040> muscle<00:01:41.280> mass<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.909> you're<00:01:42.479> not

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.910 
increase muscle mass but you're not
really<00:01:42.780> doing<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.380> immune<00:01:43.590> system

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920

and<00:01:48.000> when<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> train<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.570> immune<00:01:48.720> system<00:01:49.110> is

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and when you train your immune system is

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.780 
and when you train your immune system is
gonna<00:01:49.320> lower<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.009> you're<00:01:50.369> gonna<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.670> more

gonna lower and you're gonna have more

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.160 
gonna lower and you're gonna have more
free<00:01:51.030> radicals<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.509> gonna<00:01:51.630> build<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
free radicals are gonna build up and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.510 
free radicals are gonna build up and
you're<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.770> gonna<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:52.979> able<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.130> put<00:01:53.430> on

able to train and

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.050 
able to train and
we're<00:01:57.410> going<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.740> go<00:01:57.830> through<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.130> spiral<00:01:58.670> you

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
we're going to go through the spiral you
