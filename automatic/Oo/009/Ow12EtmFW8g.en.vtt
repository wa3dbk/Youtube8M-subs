 locating the best place to be transplanted 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.200
 they have to wait three or four years to get the first harvest 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.529

 which are put to ferment during 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.569

 achieved all raw materials start with the manual process of mixing them 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.739
