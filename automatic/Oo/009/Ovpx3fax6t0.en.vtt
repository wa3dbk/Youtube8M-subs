00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.760
 for the 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.920
 hello to all that we would be found 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.660
 for finally the diamond challenge you have it 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.740
 heard am here I put a little time 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.650
 to turn it because I was not bad 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.460
 busy is so today he's finally 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.720
 there so you can see me in the process of 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.500
 generate to the map 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.119
 and so it's gone the timer has launched 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.640
 and so well my goal is everything 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.689
 simply to have a diamond in 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.489
 hand as quickly as possible so 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.320
 it is a challenge proposed by Mr. el 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.230
 milia I was challenged by hassan is 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.230
 himself defy the same stone himself 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.430
 challenged by art 6 himself finally defying 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.980
 brief so on and so not net 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.090
 had made a record of 3 minutes 21 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.350
 we will try to beat him so 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.270
 I record against the way in 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.739
 delayed because since it is a it is 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.699
 still a certain concentration of 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.430
 to make this diamond challenge so 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:11.090
 so here is where we can see that I 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.970
 already a stone pickaxe at the end of the same 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.479
 long a minute or so I am not 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.610
 live on hand so I had to pretty much 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.909
 close minutes there I see that I had to 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.920
 make 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.590
 I was very lucky because I 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.860
 had a little glue I would have missed 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.479
 daube fuel otherwise so that's it 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.479
 so I'm doing this I'm heating up his very 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:39.590
 quickly I dig the maximum that I can 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:43.820
 until the end I make sticks in 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.420
 waiting and here we will wait until the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.670
 to make them a pretty boring moment 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.409
 Moreover, since nothing can be done 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.750
 do it nothing from December to go up 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.689
 in fact that my father too much time so 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.280
 it's useless no blow and ben 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.740
 I'm waiting for the third hop effect 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.729
 I make a small pick in iron and 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.439
 it's gone in december 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.090
 maya gravel that makes me a little bit 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.039
 shit you'll see that it's okay 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.849
 to be finished with the gravel 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.049
 so here we can see that I'm doing the 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.409
 layer 50 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.409
 we are at about two minutes 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:28.489
 yes it's still not in time 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.249
 for now I'm going down 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:37.879
 I go down layer 24 we start to 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:39.049
 projects of the near diamond layers in 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.909
 singing no lava so for now 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:47.480
 all is well I continue to descend 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:48.859
 this or that a sick person so I know we 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.239
 will immediately ask me the question 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.349
 how many times are you doing to them 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.510
 I do them twice I think yes 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.590
 that's it twice so I had forgiveness 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.159
 that I had already done tests but there 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.290
 by cons really registered I know 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.719
 it's the second time I've done it 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.510
 so of course the matches are 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.250
 different so here I was just 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.599
 trained a little bit for fun I 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.699
 did not think that I would be challenged 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.389
 I trained for the lulz 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:19.069
 and then and so here is where I am at 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:23.650
 the layer 5 which is to say at the layer 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.650
 of rock game mines 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:35.120
 we are still in the time we are at 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:39.170
 three minutes it'll be hot and big 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.550
 fail and hop out here I lai 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.440
 so I do not know how many 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.450
 time I did I hope that normally 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.940
 I did less than 15 net of what I 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.340
 calculated I did three minutes 19 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.140
 if I say no bullshit about three 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.780
 minutes 19 I do not know it's three 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.300
 minutes 23-19 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.730
 but in any case, so here listen to me 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.790
 Thank you for following this 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.750
 video is me for my part I'm going 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.400
 challenge under the stif their drunk stiller 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.970
 the pineapple challenges him to beat me or 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.980
 you do not have to beat me well 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.920

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.859
