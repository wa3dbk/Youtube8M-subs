just something small and since the paint
job<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:52.739> bit<00:00:52.829> more<00:00:52.949> generous<00:00:53.399> I

a<00:01:50.640> review<00:01:50.820> somewhere<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.570> said<00:01:51.950> his<00:01:52.950> flowing

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
a review somewhere that said his flowing

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
a review somewhere that said his flowing
hair<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> articulated<00:01:54.570> well<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.500> depends<00:01:55.799> on

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
hair is articulated well that depends on

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.859 
hair is articulated well that depends on
what<00:01:56.070> your<00:01:56.250> definition<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.850> articulation<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
what your definition of articulation is

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.440 
what your definition of articulation is
it<00:01:58.380> moves<00:01:58.590> left<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.369> moves<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.789> that's

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
it moves left and it moves right that's

there's only accessory as far as weapons
would<00:04:09.580> go<00:04:09.760> would<00:04:09.970> be<00:04:10.150> his<00:04:10.420> Z<00:04:10.720> Buster<00:04:11.110> with<00:04:11.470> the

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
would go would be his Z Buster with the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.790 
would go would be his Z Buster with the
additional<00:04:12.280> thing<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.120> put<00:04:13.300> on<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:14.350> hold<00:04:14.620> the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
additional thing to put on to hold the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.910 
additional thing to put on to hold the
charge<00:04:15.190> shot<00:04:15.610> which<00:04:16.030> is<00:04:16.150> here<00:04:16.710> this<00:04:17.710> one

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
charge shot which is here this one

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.560 
charge shot which is here this one
definitely<00:04:18.130> has<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.580> peak<00:04:18.820> job<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.239> can<00:04:19.390> tell

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
definitely has a peak job you can tell

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.750 
definitely has a peak job you can tell
it<00:04:19.720> was<00:04:19.840> done<00:04:20.020> in<00:04:20.140> a<00:04:20.260> kind<00:04:20.860> of<00:04:21.070> clear<00:04:21.520> blue

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
it was done in a kind of clear blue

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.940 
it was done in a kind of clear blue
plastic<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.450> suppose<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:22.960> then<00:04:23.350> there's<00:04:23.770> like

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
plastic I suppose and then there's like

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.970 
plastic I suppose and then there's like
airbrush<00:04:24.430> in<00:04:24.670> here<00:04:24.910> with<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.210> very<00:04:25.720> light<00:04:25.980> blue

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
airbrush in here with a very light blue

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.410 
airbrush in here with a very light blue
so<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.520> gives<00:04:27.700> it<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:27.850> little<00:04:27.940> bit<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.240> dimension

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
so it gives it a little bit of dimension

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.880 
so it gives it a little bit of dimension
and<00:04:28.810> stuff<00:04:28.990> I'm<00:04:29.080> not<00:04:29.200> going<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.380> attach<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.620> on

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
and stuff I'm not going to attach it on

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.710 
and stuff I'm not going to attach it on
there<00:04:30.070> but<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.370> does<00:04:30.520> look<00:04:30.790> very<00:04:31.000> reminiscent

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
there but it does look very reminiscent

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.530 
there but it does look very reminiscent
from<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.080> game<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:33.040> great<00:04:33.280> accessory<00:04:33.700> comes

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
from the game the great accessory comes

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.530 
from the game the great accessory comes
with<00:04:34.690> his<00:04:34.810> other<00:04:35.020> arm<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:36.100> he<00:04:36.850> does<00:04:37.030> have<00:04:37.240> this

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
with his other arm and he does have this

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.510 
with his other arm and he does have this
hand<00:04:37.780> right<00:04:38.020> here<00:04:38.080> which<00:04:38.530> is<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.980> guess<00:04:39.220> kind<00:04:39.460> of

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
hand right here which is I guess kind of

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.640 
hand right here which is I guess kind of
like<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.700> thumbs<00:04:39.940> up<00:04:40.150> but<00:04:40.660> clearly<00:04:41.140> it's<00:04:41.440> used

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
like a thumbs up but clearly it's used

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.129 
like a thumbs up but clearly it's used
to<00:04:41.800> hold<00:04:41.980> a<00:04:42.070> saber

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.049 

yeah<00:04:47.139> yeah<00:04:47.859> you<00:04:48.039> definitely<00:04:48.189> could<00:04:48.639> get<00:04:48.819> him

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:49.059 
yeah yeah you definitely could get him

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:50.789 
yeah yeah you definitely could get him
using<00:04:49.539> his<00:04:49.569> old<00:04:49.899> saber<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.319> course<00:04:50.469> it's<00:04:50.619> too

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:50.799 
using his old saber of course it's too

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:53.459 
using his old saber of course it's too
small<00:04:51.069> and<00:04:51.339> color<00:04:51.909> geared<00:04:52.299> but<00:04:52.569> I<00:04:52.839> guess<00:04:53.349> you

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469 
small and color geared but I guess you

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.369 
small and color geared but I guess you
could<00:04:53.589> definitely<00:04:53.739> do<00:04:54.039> that<00:04:54.809> which<00:04:55.809> could

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
could definitely do that which could

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.949 
could definitely do that which could
only<00:04:56.499> mean<00:04:56.859> that<00:04:56.969> zero<00:04:57.969> second<00:04:58.449> appearance<00:04:58.809> is

00:04:58.949 --> 00:04:58.959 
only mean that zero second appearance is

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:59.369 
only mean that zero second appearance is
on<00:04:59.079> its<00:04:59.199> way

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
on its way

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.159 
on its way
there's<00:05:00.069> hope<00:05:00.219> enough<00:05:00.629> he<00:05:01.629> has<00:05:01.719> the<00:05:01.809> singing

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
there's hope enough he has the singing

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.619 
there's hope enough he has the singing
additional<00:05:02.559> hands<00:05:02.979> as<00:05:03.129> X<00:05:03.459> does<00:05:03.699> open<00:05:04.419> hands

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:04.629 
additional hands as X does open hands

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.549 
additional hands as X does open hands
and<00:05:05.969> this<00:05:06.969> with<00:05:07.299> the<00:05:07.449> other<00:05:07.659> pen<00:05:08.139> so<00:05:08.289> he<00:05:08.319> has

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:08.559 
and this with the other pen so he has

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.439 
and this with the other pen so he has
two<00:05:08.829> different<00:05:09.129> types<00:05:09.309> of<00:05:09.429> hands<00:05:09.729> I<00:05:09.909> guess<00:05:10.269> you

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
two different types of hands I guess you

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.069 
two different types of hands I guess you
could<00:05:10.599> use<00:05:10.629> them<00:05:10.989> if<00:05:11.919> you<00:05:12.159> so<00:05:12.639> choose<00:05:13.059> to<00:05:13.119> but

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:14.079 
could use them if you so choose to but

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:16.799 
could use them if you so choose to but
my<00:05:14.709> overall<00:05:14.829> view<00:05:15.309> of<00:05:15.489> this<00:05:15.639> was<00:05:15.849> that<00:05:15.879> figures

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:16.809 
my overall view of this was that figures

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:18.419 
my overall view of this was that figures
a<00:05:16.839> little<00:05:17.139> disappointing<00:05:17.649> number<00:05:18.009> one<00:05:18.159> thing

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:18.429 
a little disappointing number one thing

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:21.029 
a little disappointing number one thing
being<00:05:18.639> the<00:05:18.759> hair<00:05:19.229> and<00:05:20.229> then<00:05:20.439> the<00:05:20.589> same<00:05:20.769> issue<00:05:21.009> I

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
being the hair and then the same issue I

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.069 
being the hair and then the same issue I
had<00:05:21.249> with<00:05:21.399> X<00:05:21.669> of<00:05:22.059> plagues<00:05:22.359> this<00:05:22.539> figure<00:05:22.869> which

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:23.079 
had with X of plagues this figure which

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.229 
had with X of plagues this figure which
is<00:05:23.259> the<00:05:23.699> articulation<00:05:24.699> of<00:05:24.759> in<00:05:24.909> the<00:05:24.999> upper

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:25.239 
is the articulation of in the upper

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:28.109 
is the articulation of in the upper
torso<00:05:25.419> here<00:05:25.869> is<00:05:26.199> a<00:05:26.259> little<00:05:26.859> hindered<00:05:27.309> I<00:05:27.579> also

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:28.119 
torso here is a little hindered I also

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.299 
torso here is a little hindered I also
kind<00:05:28.419> of<00:05:28.479> noticed<00:05:28.839> that<00:05:28.989> mat<00:05:29.469> arms<00:05:29.829> are<00:05:30.129> when

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:30.309 
kind of noticed that mat arms are when

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:31.619 
kind of noticed that mat arms are when
you<00:05:30.399> can<00:05:30.549> like<00:05:30.669> pick<00:05:30.849> these<00:05:30.969> off<00:05:31.179> to<00:05:31.359> replace

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:31.629 
you can like pick these off to replace

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.759 
you can like pick these off to replace
them<00:05:31.949> they<00:05:32.949> went<00:05:33.189> in<00:05:33.369> a<00:05:33.519> little<00:05:33.549> bit<00:05:34.379> tighter<00:05:35.379> I

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:35.769 
them they went in a little bit tighter I

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:39.389 
them they went in a little bit tighter I
guess<00:05:36.629> um<00:05:37.629> tighter<00:05:38.289> and<00:05:38.469> some<00:05:38.709> looser<00:05:39.309> and

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:39.399 
guess um tighter and some looser and

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:42.299 
guess um tighter and some looser and
others<00:05:39.639> so<00:05:40.479> it<00:05:40.989> could<00:05:41.289> be<00:05:41.439> a<00:05:41.709> good<00:05:41.919> thing<00:05:42.099> could

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:42.309 
others so it could be a good thing could

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.869 
others so it could be a good thing could
be<00:05:42.399> a<00:05:42.429> bad<00:05:42.609> thing

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:42.879 
be a bad thing

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.509 
be a bad thing
would<00:05:43.359> I<00:05:43.389> recommend<00:05:43.749> this<00:05:44.259> figure<00:05:44.589> it's<00:05:45.129> kind

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:45.519 
would I recommend this figure it's kind

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.949 
would I recommend this figure it's kind
of<00:05:45.579> hard<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:45.879> say<00:05:46.179> you<00:05:46.239> know<00:05:46.569> because<00:05:46.809> with

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:46.959 
of hard to say you know because with

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:50.039 
of hard to say you know because with
that<00:05:47.169> air<00:05:47.469> articulation<00:05:48.509> it<00:05:49.509> might<00:05:49.779> just<00:05:49.989> be

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:50.049 
that air articulation it might just be

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.569 
that air articulation it might just be
better<00:05:50.289> if<00:05:50.409> you<00:05:50.619> wait<00:05:50.799> until<00:05:51.009> the<00:05:51.219> second

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:51.579 
better if you wait until the second

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:52.799 
better if you wait until the second
version<00:05:51.699> of<00:05:51.909> 0<00:05:52.089> which<00:05:52.269> actually<00:05:52.599> haven't

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:52.809 
version of 0 which actually haven't

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:54.569 
version of 0 which actually haven't
either<00:05:52.899> been<00:05:53.110> announced<00:05:53.499> yet<00:05:53.559> I<00:05:53.860> would

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:54.579 
either been announced yet I would

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:57.089 
either been announced yet I would
recommend<00:05:55.179> him<00:05:55.469> only<00:05:56.469> because<00:05:56.799> he's<00:05:56.949> the
