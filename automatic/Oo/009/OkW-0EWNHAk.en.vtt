00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
 once to film the last time, yes 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.030
 not work 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 beautiful fat again today the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.800
 whole week was great weather right 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.800
 had luck 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.700
 you can also see how 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.870
 Of course , it is very much a long way off 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:46.140
 is not really a bridge distance 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.820
 the horses would actually be good because of it 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.440
 are quite a long time away I think 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.030
 this is about 100 meters but here 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.149
 We have two and the pieces for that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.800
 have distracted on 22 meters and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.390
 that's why i think there too 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
 order 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.140
 and as you can see the three Turks with 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.140
 the trunk quite good through the forest 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.900
 it is quiet no hectic just always the 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.200
 Storage on the way is usually always on 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.760
 a bit tight when you are with the two 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.729
 permanently halt the city before him with 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.790
 vegetables can not be so tight together 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.030
 the one constantly and also the style question 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.510
 I think I have to be in the area soon 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.510
 dine again 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.820
 but sometimes that's not too 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.890
 avoid it so if you are now 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.910
 then put a bit on the side 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.690
 we'll get the other pieces here 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.630
 maybe even had to go today 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.930
 I did not think so but she is one 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.470
 Woman at the moment who has the say this 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.470
 to curb 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.710
 yes and there we are now hung out 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.710
 and the next one
