pretty much the end of the husk brush

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.480 
pretty much the end of the husk brush
might<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> few<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.130> doesn't<00:01:44.429> look

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
like it so anyway that's it I know it's

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.960 
like it so anyway that's it I know it's
really<00:01:47.369> short<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.149> two-minute<00:01:48.659> video<00:01:49.970> but

have<00:03:22.139> been<00:03:22.319> able<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.590> beat<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.370> game<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.760> you

have been able to beat that game and you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.140 
have been able to beat that game and you
know<00:03:24.599> in<00:03:24.720> one<00:03:24.930> sitting<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.799> I'm<00:03:26.700> pretty<00:03:26.940> good

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
know in one sitting so I'm pretty good

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.759 
know in one sitting so I'm pretty good
at<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.630> think<00:03:27.930> it'd<00:03:28.019> be<00:03:28.049> a<00:03:28.139> lot<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.349> fun<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.680> do

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
at it I think it'd be a lot of fun to do

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.110 
at it I think it'd be a lot of fun to do
a<00:03:28.799> let's<00:03:29.010> play<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.549> it<00:03:29.730> might<00:03:30.000> become

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
a let's play of that it might become

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.089 
a let's play of that it might become
challenging<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.930> talk<00:03:31.170> at<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.410> same<00:03:31.440> time<00:03:31.799> but

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
challenging to talk at the same time but

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.420 
challenging to talk at the same time but
could<00:03:32.459> do<00:03:32.579> that<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.200> also<00:03:34.200> I've<00:03:34.950> been<00:03:35.190> getting

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
could do that and also I've been getting

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.969 
could do that and also I've been getting
a<00:03:35.609> lot<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:35.970> requests<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.530> know<00:03:37.590> asking

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
a lot of requests and you know asking

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.219 
a lot of requests and you know asking
what<00:03:38.250> class<00:03:38.549> I'm<00:03:38.790> going<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.120> next<00:03:39.329> not

in<00:03:41.640> other<00:03:42.060> classes<00:03:42.500> besides<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.620> engineer<00:03:44.070> in

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
in other classes besides the engineer in

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.560 
in other classes besides the engineer in
the<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.250> depth<00:03:44.520> I<00:03:44.700> think<00:03:45.180> I'm<00:03:45.270> going<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.420> be

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
the a depth I think I'm going to be

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.980 
the a depth I think I'm going to be
doing<00:03:45.750> more<00:03:46.730> not<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:47.910> much<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.090> direct<00:03:48.780> guide

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
doing more not so much a direct guide

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.780 
doing more not so much a direct guide
I'll<00:03:49.290> turn<00:03:49.680> them<00:03:49.860> all<00:03:50.040> into<00:03:50.070> direct<00:03:50.610> guides

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
I'll turn them all into direct guides

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.000 
I'll turn them all into direct guides
eventually<00:03:51.390> but<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.960> might<00:03:52.500> be<00:03:52.530> doing<00:03:52.740> more

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
eventually but I might be doing more

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.600 
eventually but I might be doing more
how-to<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.360> do<00:03:54.540> plan<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:54.990> making<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.770> how-to

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
how-to so I do plan on making a a how-to

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.720 
how-to so I do plan on making a a how-to
on<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.870> assault<00:03:58.140> Sentinel<00:03:58.740> how<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.010> use<00:03:59.370> a

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
on the assault Sentinel how to use a

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.950 
on the assault Sentinel how to use a
that<00:04:00.510> assault<00:04:00.900> are<00:04:01.050> more<00:04:01.230> effectively<00:04:01.820> I<00:04:02.960> just

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
that assault are more effectively I just

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.720 
that assault are more effectively I just
want<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.170> get<00:04:04.230> my<00:04:04.290> character<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> certain

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
want to get my character to a certain

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.910 
want to get my character to a certain
point<00:04:05.880> in<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.060> game<00:04:06.230> before<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.440> start<00:04:07.680> using

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
point in the game before I start using

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.540 
point in the game before I start using
that<00:04:08.070> because<00:04:08.690> Sentinel<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.720> really<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.550> late

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
that because Sentinel is really a late

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.750 
that because Sentinel is really a late
bloomer<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.450> class<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:14.190> don't<00:04:14.430> even<00:04:14.520> get

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
bloomer of a class you don't even get

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.580 
bloomer of a class you don't even get
your<00:04:14.910> assault<00:04:15.210> armor<00:04:15.540> until<00:04:15.960> your<00:04:16.140> level<00:04:16.380> 10

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
your assault armor until your level 10

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.289 
your assault armor until your level 10
usually<00:04:17.340> unless<00:04:17.610> you're<00:04:17.790> just<00:04:17.850> putting<00:04:18.090> all

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
usually unless you're just putting all

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.610 
usually unless you're just putting all
your<00:04:18.330> points<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:19.140> which<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.530> don't

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
your points of that which I don't

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.310 
your points of that which I don't
recommend<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:20.459> for<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.630> up<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:23.430> that's<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
recommend and for the up so that's the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.480 
recommend and for the up so that's the
results<00:04:25.320> that<00:04:25.350> knowledge<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:26.040> also<00:04:26.220> kind<00:04:26.460> of

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
results that knowledge you also kind of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.300 
results that knowledge you also kind of
want<00:04:26.550> your<00:04:26.880> passive<00:04:27.600> for<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.930> as<00:04:28.080> well<00:04:28.110> so<00:04:28.530> i

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
want your passive for that as well so i

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.100 
want your passive for that as well so i
will<00:04:29.730> be<00:04:29.850> doing<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:30.090> how-to<00:04:30.240> on<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.630> salt
