00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.450 
the computer and putting these long
hours<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.290> getting<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.920> positive

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
hours and you are getting a positive

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.359 
hours and you are getting a positive
response<00:01:53.670> from<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.450> that's<00:01:54.570> why<00:01:54.810> you've

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
response from it and that's why you've

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:17.039 
response from it and that's why you've
driven<00:01:56.369> yourself<00:01:57.150> so<00:01:57.600> hard<00:01:57.900> so<00:01:58.200> quickly

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.589 

but<00:02:18.049> I<00:02:18.079> think<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:19.400> all<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> part<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.209> one<00:02:20.569> big

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
but I think it's all a part of one big

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.229 
but I think it's all a part of one big
giant<00:02:21.439> thing<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.129> think<00:02:22.549> it's<00:02:22.730> very<00:02:22.909> hard<00:02:23.120> for

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
giant thing I think it's very hard for

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.479 
giant thing I think it's very hard for
us<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.540> see<00:02:23.750> because<00:02:24.290> we<00:02:24.439> have<00:02:24.620> egos<00:02:25.129> and<00:02:25.430> we

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
us to see because we have egos and we

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.979 
us to see because we have egos and we
have<00:02:25.670> all<00:02:25.909> these<00:02:26.030> natural<00:02:26.510> instincts<00:02:26.930> that

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
have all these natural instincts that

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.270 
have all these natural instincts that
are<00:02:27.079> in<00:02:27.200> place<00:02:27.379> to<00:02:27.560> make<00:02:27.709> sure<00:02:27.739> that<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.099> keep

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
are in place to make sure that we keep

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.220 
are in place to make sure that we keep
doing<00:02:28.459> what<00:02:28.610> we're<00:02:28.790> doing<00:02:28.870> but<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.900> think<00:02:29.959> all

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
doing what we're doing but I think all

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.050 
doing what we're doing but I think all
together<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:30.829> a<00:02:30.890> part<00:02:31.129> of<00:02:31.189> something<00:02:31.430> giant

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
together it's a part of something giant

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.989 
together it's a part of something giant
we<00:02:32.359> just<00:02:32.540> can't<00:02:32.750> see<00:02:32.959> it
