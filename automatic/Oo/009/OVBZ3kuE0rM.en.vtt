00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:19.230
 be driven left knee and sting 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.609
 felt deserved 1 0 front were the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.380
 better team may have one 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.810
 Chance did not play perfectly to the end 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.980
 but on the whole it was square 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.869
 individual guidance for us in order 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.220
 naturally at the level always came 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.740
 Getting back up is completely normal 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 and boston did not have any 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.219
 Team are really too 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.710
 superstars in it and that's why 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.730
 always with the point 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.750
 we have not lost since are 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.450
 Keep unbeaten if you can 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.789
 Brazil game now came up 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.829
 That's why we are not now 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.510
 really disappointed maybe one 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.059
 bit in Germany in the net with joke 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.140
 injury but I think from yesterday 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.300
 you can live with it quite well 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 I think the pressing there they have us 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.210
 ausgeguckt so therefore they really good 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.430
 playing football we know that the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.109
 Bosnian very good single player to the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.820
 but I can also combine well here 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.850
 think if we once had and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.080
 combine it's all good, we went 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.260
 of course have a taste in the deep 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.689
 of course then have to go again 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.729
 Warmly had all the actions that we had there 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:23.330
 maybe you can make more out of it 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.330
 the chances and 11 no one is not angry 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.310
 how to go very strong opponent 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.689
 played and we want very much 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.979
 it was very close in midfield 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.619
 difficult for us defender 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.299
 between silenic games or out with 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.920
 to lead the ball but I believe that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.360
 was very good reputation - and certainly also 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.610
 do in moscow and that's why you have to 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.409
 very good test lab brenzliche 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.329
 situations not heard of iv 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.960
 is wonderful emotions but there 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.490
 basically something for both 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.650
 Both gave out of the game a lot 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.060
 take 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.310
 It is also important that you are not lost 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.230
 So have that one also on the year 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.100
 have positive feelings because as I said 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.270
 that you have two different ones 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.740
 midterms 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.640
 so you can somehow like the game 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.230
 to be brief and that's why we see 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.660
 then analyze it in the next one 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.240
 course and then I hope that's good 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.850
 Prepared to sound the Russians are 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.990
 game looks the following 1 1 in order 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.200
 was very fierce game over 90 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.150
 minutes with few chances and two 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.600
 chances are two goals and in the plant that too 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.850
 right in front of the stadium have us already 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.670
 15,000 Bosnian fans were expecting it 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.620
 35,000 Austrian there and everyone 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.660
 Of course, his fans have and offer 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.190
 then the foreplay comes out for 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.270
 me personally, of course, that's great 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.530
 could play 45 minutes now 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.090
 11 I think is fair, it was not 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.700
 a lot of chances but already there 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.080
 and forth and that is all right belief 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.610
 I was important that you quali 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.070
 won and not lost today 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.010
 therefore, you had gained over us 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.480
 made but at the test on faith is 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.770
 there is in the foreground that one one 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.180
 said maybe even tried 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.920
 especially regarding the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.050
 qualifying games the difficult ones 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.160
 even abroad also a lot 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.030
 tried so here is very important 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.770
 Bosnians also have in most 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.910
 do not really fight back 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:18.090
 but played very hard 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.590
 partly and there of course must 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.700
 you also did not like it 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.820
 we also held a bit against it 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.450
 but I believe in everything then 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.820
 still quite fair game of the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.560
 Of course, there was always a backlash 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.530
 a bit uneasy but I believe that 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.060
 was already to be expected in advance 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.920
 who know so much and that's why 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:04:24.780
 you can be there as a player now 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:04:26.580
 not somehow, of course, I am always 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.780
 so win in austria grew up what 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.570
 when talking though im either 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.920
 grown up and yes for me very much 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.400
 important and very nice event 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.200
 and it was for me would be opposed 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.490
 Austria playing with Bosnia in Vienna 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.280
 they would be defended very well 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:53.729
 set it to be safe for 20 to 25 minutes 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:56.960
 difficult is indeed field superior find 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.960
 was fair then
