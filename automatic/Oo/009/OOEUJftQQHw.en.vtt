understanding the basics of this system

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.509 
understanding the basics of this system
can<00:00:13.320> help<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.530> better<00:00:13.620> understand<00:00:14.070> wine<00:00:14.309> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
can help you better understand wine and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.849 
can help you better understand wine and
what<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.759> eat<00:00:14.910> before<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.389> exercise<00:00:15.859> it's

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
what to eat before you exercise it's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.380 
what to eat before you exercise it's
extraordinarily<00:00:17.160> complicated<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.270> I'm

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
extraordinarily complicated so I'm

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.240 
extraordinarily complicated so I'm
actually<00:00:18.480> gonna<00:00:18.720> boil<00:00:18.930> down<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.350> its<00:00:19.560> basic

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
actually gonna boil down to its basic

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.130 
actually gonna boil down to its basic
elements<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.850> because<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140

parasympathetic changes or the rest and
digest<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> when

looking at sympathetic activity or the

fight-or-flight mechanism here you're

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.760 
fight-or-flight mechanism here you're
gonna<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.270> dilated<00:02:00.780> pupil<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.649> take

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
gonna see a dilated pupil so it can take

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
gonna see a dilated pupil so it can take
in<00:02:01.950> more<00:02:02.130> light<00:02:02.420> you're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.600> inhibit

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
in more light you're going to inhibit

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.130 
in more light you're going to inhibit
saliva<00:02:04.439> okay<00:02:04.979> heart<00:02:05.219> rates<00:02:05.399> gonna<00:02:05.549> go<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.909> your

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
saliva okay heart rates gonna go up your

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.119 
saliva okay heart rates gonna go up your
bronchi<00:02:07.140> are<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.469> dilate<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.890> your

bronchi are going to dilate and your

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.240 
bronchi are going to dilate and your
rest<00:02:08.310> rate<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.759> increase<00:02:09.259> your<00:02:10.259> stomach

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
rest rate will increase your stomach

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.500 
rest rate will increase your stomach
your<00:02:11.459> GI<00:02:11.610> tract<00:02:11.970> your<00:02:12.209> liver

your GI tract your liver

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.559 
your GI tract your liver
all<00:02:12.689> gonna<00:02:12.870> actually<00:02:13.200> slow<00:02:13.530> down<00:02:14.569> your

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
all gonna actually slow down your

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.699 
all gonna actually slow down your
adrenal<00:02:15.900> gland<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.439> secrete

bladder is actually going to be

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.819 
bladder is actually going to be
inhibited<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.930> there's<00:02:22.079> sort<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.319> opposites

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
inhibited so there's sort of opposites

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.819 
inhibited so there's sort of opposites
in<00:02:22.980> many<00:02:23.159> ways<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.959> an<00:02:25.049> example<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.680> when

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
in many ways so an example of when

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:26.960 
in many ways so an example of when
you're<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.069> sympathetic<00:02:26.489> state<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.819> when

you're in a sympathetic state is when

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.059 
you're in a sympathetic state is when
you<00:02:27.060> exercise<00:02:27.590> when<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.650> start<00:02:28.829> making

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
you exercise when you start making

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.890 
you exercise when you start making

your skeletal muscle whether that's the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.640 
your skeletal muscle whether that's the

ramp up and again this makes sense your

heart rate and respiratory rate go up

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.539 
heart rate and respiratory rate go up
your<00:02:39.930> body<00:02:40.140> slows<00:02:40.470> down<00:02:40.650> food<00:02:40.920> age<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.459> your

rest and digest your stomach your small
and<00:03:04.200> large<00:03:04.379> intestine<00:03:04.859> get<00:03:04.980> activated<00:03:05.750> and

and large intestine get activated and

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.940 
and large intestine get activated and
this<00:03:06.870> happens<00:03:07.139> because<00:03:07.200> there's<00:03:07.440> not<00:03:07.590> food<00:03:07.829> in

your stomach it stretches things out and

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.809 
your stomach it stretches things out and
your<00:03:10.319> gastrointestinal<00:03:10.739> tract<00:03:11.220> fires<00:03:11.489> up<00:03:11.700> to

your gastrointestinal tract fires up to

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.970 
your gastrointestinal tract fires up to
do<00:03:11.940> its<00:03:12.060> job<00:03:12.349> part<00:03:13.349> of<00:03:13.409> that<00:03:13.530> means<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.859> your

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
do its job part of that means that your

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.440 
do its job part of that means that your
body<00:03:14.099> begins<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.730> divert<00:03:14.940> blood<00:03:15.030> away<00:03:15.359> from
