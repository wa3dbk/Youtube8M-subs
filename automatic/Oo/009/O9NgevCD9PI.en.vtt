00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.859 
you can use forward is think of it as
like<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.320> runs<00:01:30.530> on<00:01:30.799> a<00:01:30.829> ladder<00:01:31.130> like<00:01:32.030> it's<00:01:32.630> not

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
like the runs on a ladder like it's not

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.240 
like the runs on a ladder like it's not

like a ladder where you can actually go

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.429

up<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:34.880> climb<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.869> actually<00:01:36.110> have

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
up to it and climb it you actually have

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.560 
up to it and climb it you actually have
to<00:01:36.619> use<00:01:36.649> that<00:01:37.009> free<00:01:37.369> dinners<00:01:37.579> button<00:01:37.880> to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
to use that free dinners button to

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.999 
to use that free dinners button to
actually<00:01:38.840> start<00:01:38.990> with<00:01:39.140> climate<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:39.619> if<00:01:39.770> I<00:01:39.860> just

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
actually start with climate so if I just

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.700 
actually start with climate so if I just
hold<00:01:40.600> control<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:41.630> hit<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.200> hit<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.470> four

hold control and hit and hit the four

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.260 
hold control and hit and hit the four
button<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.189> will<00:01:43.460> then<00:01:43.579> like<00:01:43.759> kind<00:01:43.939> like<00:01:44.030> latch

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
button I will then like kind like latch

over the scholars called the wooden bar

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.320 
over the scholars called the wooden bar
think<00:02:15.380> of<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.620> as<00:02:15.680> like<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.010> balance<00:02:16.490> beam<00:02:16.700> you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
think of this as like a balance beam you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.880 
think of this as like a balance beam you
can<00:02:17.390> walk<00:02:17.630> across<00:02:17.750> that's<00:02:18.230> pretty<00:02:18.440> cool<00:02:18.620> and
