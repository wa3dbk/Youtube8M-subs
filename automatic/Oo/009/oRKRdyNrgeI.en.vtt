00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.000
 good kids very good everyone here 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.429
 we are as you see code duel by teams 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.930
 starting started and you'll say good the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.809
 typical in which you get and you raise us that 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.019
 goes back here when with the carbine of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.000
 diamond now m 27 does not yet 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.320
 I'm going to raise it in gold but I do not know 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.130
 eat that the game of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.119
 yesterday and I wanted to raise you the because it's something 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.470
 amazing 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.260
 although the difference as you see 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.219
 Sensual standard is 12 lower than 13 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.079
 there is a difference in the end ended with 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.329
 a result that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.700
 it was enough to be able to overcome the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.720
 I think starting but still 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.880
 we could not win now you will see it but the 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.740
 gameplay I liked a lot was pretty 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.760
 good game is the universal chorizo 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.500
 that by the way I've seen enough paper and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.820
 nothing kids that that wanted to bring the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.630
 I'm sorry for not bringing you the m 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.620
 27 gold before diamond but 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.500
 I wanted this game if the will have 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 of gold soon do not worry and what else 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.210
 I'm telling you I'm preparing the time world 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.010
 x pr I'm already recording it 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.979
 worry all you wanted the time 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.180
 with already on the move I know that it tells me 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 I was preparing it I do not know what but 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.869
 now I'm recording what are the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.020
 simple parts I have a few like that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.530
 that soon you will have it in the channel that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.910
 tell you how you see in the diamond m 27 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.470
 I prefer to tell you about the weapon because I do not know 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.009
 how more like in the other video here the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.619
 uncle had mounted a piece of piece of 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.470
 camp that you flip with your guardian your 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.690
 tower is firing gets in there 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.220
 waiting to see if someone came out and here 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.619
 at this time I already had the dogs 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.110
 he had to be in the game already 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.640
 I was on track but my team did not 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.270
 I stopped dying even pulling the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840
 dogs 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.659
 in the being they were still dying and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.390
 Fucking what we're going we do not get 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.319
 tracing the game but now if I 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.880
 a pretty cool game comes out they should not 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.200
 entertaining move and what is it that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.149
 After all, they matter even if we lose 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.469
 Well, the truth is that I do not care 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.509
 whenever they are a few games where wall 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.679
 enough times but kill a few 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.539
 I got some pretty good streaks vice 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.599
 I always climb them up here, you see the 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.340
 game 52-53 I thought that what 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.440
 we had everything done and everything was almost 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.390
 comeback comes a time when 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.340
 we were even tied as 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.959
 you see before and this photo the put I put it 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.239
 last night on twitter and many of you gave us 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.890
 count my mother 39-2 watching the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.319
 result flipas not here we go for 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.900
 in front of goals we go ahead and I think 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.060
 that right now is when they fuck me what 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.680
 to be here good game here is 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.239
 where the game was fucked and we're going 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.819
 winning and I knew that this guy was here 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.590
 and that's why I went shooting, I do not know how many 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.060
 bullets I gave him and I kill myself by and I 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.319
 they shot from behind I also had to 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.239
 see me the death chamber because I do not 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.940
 he believed it after giving him four bullets 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.560
 with the m 27 that the one that I do 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.640
 got to kill another truth she was the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.860
 doom now I did follow 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.270
 giving more than a few but we do not 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.180
 gave to win the game did not give us 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.100
 signa kids what I said I'm preparing 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.810
 and after a while you'll have it soon 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.069
 the channel I have it good I'm recording 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.740
 more than preparing I'm recording and the 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.630
 rock world and I'm sorry what I said 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.960
 bring the diamond as soon as 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.350
 you will have 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.700
 of gold later but not as well as 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.070
 you are going to see there is no time to win the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.990
 departure is quite entertaining I hope 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.560
 I have dreamed of you, I like it 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.110
 You will soon have the favorite mini 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.280
 clip this that I usually go up always 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.530
 you know it's a goal kick from 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.270
 goal outing goal so nobody know 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.020
 I like favorites and see you the 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.020
 kids in the next lost game 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.020
 goodbye 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.440
 they have not reached the profile of the mission 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.440
 agents 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.900
 two
