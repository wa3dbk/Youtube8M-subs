00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.799
 they are not giants but windmills and 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.350
 what they look like arms are the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.409
 blades that pushed by the wind make 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.479
 walk the stone of the mill well it seems 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.990
 that you have no experience in this of the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.570

 of wind calla friend sancho I think 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.140
 that the magician who stole my 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.630
 books has turned these giants into 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.690
 mills to take away the glory of the 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.480

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.810
 his bad arts against the goodness of my 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.810
