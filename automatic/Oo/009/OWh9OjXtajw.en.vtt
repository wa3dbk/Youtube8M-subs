00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.060
 how to connect a pressure clock 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:07.620
 oil for a Corsican chevrolet 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.090
 the procedure is the same for 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.320
 any type of vehicle the only thing that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.530
 varies is the type of adapter that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.379
 we need 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.140
 in this case what is needed is good 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.789
 as already said the adapter a flexible 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.710
 that is connected to the adapter and in turn 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.920
 I connect to this plastic daisy that 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.770
 then connect 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.770
 to the pressure gauge to the clock 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.630
 Of course it depends on where you are going to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.940
 want to place they also need a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.940
 support would have about this one here 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.150
 the procedure is what needs to be done 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.170
 is to join the 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.420
 I come back from the vehicle's oil pressure 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.270
 in this case it is at the exit of the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.560
 oil pump 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.560
 under the car 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.280
 we have the tracking pulley 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.580
 the crankcase 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.330
 and this has to be what I'm 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.880
 lighting oil pressure calculation 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.410
 what continues in that piece 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.690
 bronze is the adapter that in this 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.910
 case is already placed because I already have 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.440
 placed the watch but before removing it 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.159
 there was and was directly the bulb 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.079
 I connected a little more in 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.749
 what you have to do is remove that other 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.999
 half that has the bulb to be able 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:31.009
 remove the card and we work as two and 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:34.039
 then start with the key I did not remember 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.220
 019 a little bigger to be able to take out 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.159
 the biggest zinc 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.350
 to take out he 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.420
 Freiburg of oil 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.960
 once it is removed some place the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.510
 adapter 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.720
 that has to have the same thread of the 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.720
 bulb and the flexible that exists that is 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.720
 here 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.820
 that the crown connected to the 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.460
 adapter and this hose that connects 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.280
 is the one that arrives inside is the clock 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.810
 the bulb connects behind the adapter 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.700
 The adapter has two outputs 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.280
 obviously one for the flexible and another 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.870
 for the vulgar once it connects n it 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.840
 connects on the tab back to the oil 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.970
 of some 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.709
 and connect the hose of the flexible 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.239
 look for a place to spend them in 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.450
 this case the basis behind the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.450
 drums 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.000
 and be careful when holding it where 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:33.190
 they hold it so that it is firm and not 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.190
 it is not the possibility of it breaking 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.469
 in my case 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.819
 towards the bottom 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.170
 and take right to the clock 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.000
 once we connect everything we can 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.200
 turn on the vehicle and stay 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.200
 connected to the pressure clock
