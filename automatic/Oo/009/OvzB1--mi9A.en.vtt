00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
to mind that's my video probably on the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.419 
to mind that's my video probably on the
sidebar<00:01:44.149> there<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.659> says<00:01:44.899> intro<00:01:45.709> and<00:01:46.340> then

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
sidebar there that says intro and then

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.980 
sidebar there that says intro and then
there's<00:01:46.610> also<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.420> part<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.840> teaches<00:01:49.990> the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
there's also the part that teaches the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.929 
there's also the part that teaches the
build-up<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.469> or<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.979> pre-chorus<00:01:52.369> I<00:01:52.520> guess<00:01:52.670> um

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
build-up to or the pre-chorus I guess um

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.449 
build-up to or the pre-chorus I guess um
so<00:01:53.719> look<00:01:53.899> at<00:01:53.990> those<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.469> then<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:55.159> will<00:01:55.340> be

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
so look at those and then this will be

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.429 
so look at those and then this will be
the<00:01:55.489> next<00:01:55.789> step<00:01:56.030> on<00:01:56.209> that<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:56.599> this<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.259> what

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
the next step on that so this is what

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.770 
the next step on that so this is what
I'm<00:01:57.649> playing<00:01:57.979> there<00:01:58.700> I'll<00:01:58.939> play<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.360> lead

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
okay so that right here in the left hand

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.760

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
not too difficult and then in the right

not too difficult and then in the right
hand<00:02:26.370> you're<00:02:26.520> doing<00:02:27.260> which<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.470> G<00:02:28.980> flat<00:02:29.190> and

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
then with a flat in the left hand you're

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.140 
then with a flat in the left hand you're
doing<00:02:37.500> an<00:02:37.590> a-flat<00:02:38.000> let's<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.840> an<00:02:39.959> e-flat

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.699 

and<00:02:43.390> then<00:02:43.569> you're<00:02:43.720> hitting<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.140> chord<00:02:44.470> which

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
and then you're hitting this chord which

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.059 
and then you're hitting this chord which
in<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.400> left<00:02:45.819> hand<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.360> said<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.750> D<00:02:46.989> flat<00:02:47.230> and

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
in the left hand I said is a D flat and

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.100 
in the left hand I said is a D flat and
then<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:48.549> an<00:02:48.670> a-flat<00:02:49.060> d-flat

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
then it's an a-flat d-flat

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.100 
then it's an a-flat d-flat
and<00:02:50.620> an<00:02:50.709> F

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:07.089 

and<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.860> rhythm<00:02:54.190> goes<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.460> this<00:02:54.610> it's<00:02:54.820> like

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.830 

okay<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.849> that's<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.150> second<00:03:08.540> one<00:03:08.629> there

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
okay and that's the second one there

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.150 
okay and that's the second one there
which<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:09.349> same<00:03:09.829> two<00:03:10.129> first<00:03:10.459> chords

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.150 

instead<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.120> C<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:16.440> C<00:03:16.620> sharp<00:03:16.860> or<00:03:16.980> D<00:03:17.130> flat

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
instead of the C the C sharp or D flat

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.630 
instead of the C the C sharp or D flat
chord<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:18.240> this

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
chord is this

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.390 
chord is this
mm-hmm<00:03:20.240> so<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:20.930> going<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.410> left<00:03:21.590> hand<00:03:21.800> G

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
mm-hmm so it's going in the left hand G

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.550 
mm-hmm so it's going in the left hand G
flat

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560

wrote down a roster and then in the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.030 
wrote down a roster and then in the
right<00:03:29.590> hand<00:03:29.800> it's<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.130> b-flat<00:03:30.569> d-flat<00:03:31.569> F<00:03:32.319> hit

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
right hand it's a b-flat d-flat F hit

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.020 
right hand it's a b-flat d-flat F hit

then same rhythm and then up to an F you

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.189 
then same rhythm and then up to an F you
can<00:04:35.069> find<00:04:35.249> octave<00:04:35.550> if<00:04:35.639> you<00:04:35.759> want<00:04:35.999> an<00:04:36.210> F<00:04:36.810> and

an<00:04:52.510> a<00:04:52.660> d-flat<00:04:53.380> there<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:55.570> b-flat<00:04:55.990> d-flat<00:04:56.200> would

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
an a d-flat there so b-flat d-flat would

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.390 
an a d-flat there so b-flat d-flat would
it<00:04:56.980> be<00:04:57.100> on<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.310> bottom

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:14.249 
and then you hit that chord which is a G
