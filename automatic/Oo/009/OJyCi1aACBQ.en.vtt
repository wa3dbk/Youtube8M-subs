00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.130
 hi to all and spartan thil who is 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.270
 welcome to this new culture halo 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.739
 we are going to talk about an alien race 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.760
 covenants very little emphasis in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.130
 the games in the books or whatever 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 the support I want of course 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.270
 talk about drones I will not pronounce 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.220
 their name because I do not know the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.870
 pronounce their real name there is 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.160
 displayed on the screen currently 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.410
 if you want to have fun at it 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.750
 spoken out loud it's your right 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.670
 I stopped so we will try 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 to know them better through four 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 points how they were discovered 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.000
 their anatomy their sociology and their 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.409
 combat strategies 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.059
 well, let's go let's go 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.210
 starting with the way they have 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.740
 been discovered by the Covenant Covenant 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.690
 looking for artifacts to do honor 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.920
 through the war if the covenante 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.830
 led by the prophets 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.750
 without falling on the drones they were 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.890
 beaten causing big damage until 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.600
 moment when the prophets found a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.250
 means of communicating with them and 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.850
 introduce within the covenant you for 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.570
 swell the ranks 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.229
 all this happened in 1112 these are 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.090
 insects 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.440
 then there is nothing more they make a meter 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.030
 ninety percent meters 7 kg 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.890
 there we immediately have the image of the big 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.180
 insects of the big mosquitoes what I have 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.200
 given as talent that's on average for 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 males there may be more 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.750
 little ones can be bigger but 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.280
 we are on a video game with the general 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.340
 no it's not that that will put us too much 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.630
 problem they are equipped with 4l 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.000
 if you want more details of 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.859
 opaque black color a little bit pretty 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.659
 with small veins they are 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:52.770
 able to lift a human being and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.000
 it can be scary to be raised born 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.320
 in the sky and then let go like that 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.880
 it is very difficult for them to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.619
 communicate with other breeds of 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.719
 Covenant Covenant because he does not speak 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.829
 with a conventional system but 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.359
 communicates with sounds and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.369
 pheromones which is their own 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.590
 otherwise it is sometimes mentioned 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.700
 that he does not feel emotions they 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.860
 follow the orders of their superiors 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.940
 without asking questions they 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.260
 belong to a lower class 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.430
 of a covenant alliance and we 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.710
 so do not communicate with others 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.360
 races despite all the drones has some 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.150
 messages and where their purpose is to explain 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.380
 the mission to theirs these messages and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.140
 understand the language of the covenante 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.850
 without speaking to him even in 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.860
 combat situation it does not mix very 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.660
 rarely to other species they are 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.190
 dropped from surprising ghosts 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.630
 the enemy from the sky 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.310
 they are equipped with such light weapons 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.810
 than plasma guns or denigers 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.380
 but their greatest strength and their 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.450
 agility 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.620
 that's it for this halo culture I hope that 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.710
 you know a little bit better 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.970
 the drones this species enough 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.070
 particular of the covenant alliance that 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.430
 when we see them in play we say we 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.610
 spoken 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.960
 we'll just meet again 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.310
 very soon for such a video 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.310
 that she is vival to salvation to all
