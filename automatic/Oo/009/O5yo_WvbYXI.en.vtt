00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.120
 why is the money from the transfer fee 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.760
 wilfried bony and marco van ginkel don't 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.220
 invested in the selection 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.260
 well vitesse has been the last three years 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.690
 invested a lot 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.570
 that has resulted in a beautiful 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.070
 top sport location like you here like us 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.280
 sit here 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.770
 it has resulted in a purchase 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.820
 of a number of players and and invests 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.860
 in stuff 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.500
 that has resulted in the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.290
 sporting investment we are out of place 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.910
 15 to 7th place 4 and 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.230
 who you spend that should be on it 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.700
 be earned back at the moment 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.650
 we are a club that cannot stay 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.260
 invest without yielding 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.869
 and this year it was also necessary 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.619
 to keep our financial housekeeping in order 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.450
 to bring 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.250
 and before that were the transfer fees 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.730
 wilfried bony and marco van ginkel and very 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.160
 required 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.260
 you are dealing with financial fair play 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.540
 what exactly does that have in the neva 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.060
 currently set rules for the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.420
 maximum investment as a club is allowed 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.160
 but a certain certain losses 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.710
 suffer every year 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.710
 and there is a limit to vitesse 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.190
 has reached the limit 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.270
 So it was there to get things done 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.530
 to get in order 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 as we said before, we did that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.110
 by transfer money from 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.260
 from boni and van ginkel and this year 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.540
 could we 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.010
 not during the transfer window 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.170
 invest in new players 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.480
 opted for transfer-free players already 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.420
 soon we had kelvin leerdam and marco 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.230
 via the beach and contracted 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.230
 and this year we also have to 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.550
 decide to hire more players if 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.110
 other years 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.240
 why did it take so long before 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.400
 the reinforcements and wares 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.040
 well, of course, we had reasonably fast 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.290
 two reinforcements within Kelvin Leerdam 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.350
 and markovic 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.220
 with the transfer-free we also already have 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.710
 quite fast 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.880
 patrick van aanholt and gaÃ«l kakuta 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.040
 committed to renting for a second year 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.020
 from chelsea 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.820
 and then we are finally in a phase 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.700
 ended up with a lot of clips 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.900
 have to do 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.350
 depending on what is sold 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.200
 to become 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.400
 you can comment on the transfer market it 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.090
 applies to us but it also applies to 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.830
 chelsea 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.420
 of course there is also one 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.360
 number of transfer saf 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.190
 and it is not right up to the last minute 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.380
 exactly clear who is for lease 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.980
 really qualify are resume rent 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.500
 players 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 that is very much this is your players one 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.819
 base place promised 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.670
 no these rented players serve 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.849
 just like any other player 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.310
 to perform in the first team 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.739
 no base place was promised 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.389
 peter bos as the ones that are every week 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.069
 selection 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.200
 of course it is how we know how 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.780
 the players that chances are that they are 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.950
 will play in the selection 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.950
 what about the new shirt sponsor 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.260
 we are related to a shirt sponsor 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.540
 with a large number of companies 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.650
 conversation behind the scenes gets busy 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.359
 she worked on searching for one 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.950
 new shirt sponsor 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.879
 those conversations do not deliver directly 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.310
 always wear a shirt sponsor 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.560
 very good contacts with companies 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.870
 we will continue with that and we 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.609
 will try this season in case 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.919
 a shirt sponsor 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.870
 but once there is something new too 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.459
 report then we will certainly be like that 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.989
 do quickly what is the sporting 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.790
 target for this season 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.769
 this year we have a whole vitesse 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.560
 ambitious objective 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.370
 we want to play attractive 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.169
 football 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.510
 linking it to achieving results 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.090
 we don't really have a place for it 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.939
 the rankings chosen this year we want 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.709
 attractive football also play Peter 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:06.699
 fetched the forest for this 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.379
 that will fall with and 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.329
 we realize that we also get up 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.409
 but it's a long-term vision 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.209
 period 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.870
 we expect a positive one 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.370
 signal 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.370
