00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 omaha - and welcome back to a new one 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.710
 video today wednesday again that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.610
 topic nutrition I asked what 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.929
 he would like to see or wants and 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.380
 income or even many 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.070
 news private went about it like that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.619
 because looks like lime from 18 clock 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.070
 from 20 o'clock in the evening it is 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.230
 damaging stock something in the fat off and on 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.040
 and maybe from my experience 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.239
 I have had my diet for almost three 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.980
 converted over the years 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.270
 low carb in the morning depending on the calories 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.809
 I want to eat 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.210
 I start with the caps from noon or 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.980
 afternoon just before the training 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.289
 get now after the training 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 For example, at the end of a competition 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.120
 I almost go 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.170
 carbohydrates on after training so 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.339
 in the evening that can 9 o'clock thus 21 o'clock 22 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.439
 be clock 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.040
 and some of you have seen I was pretty 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.610
 also moves so much already 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.640
 You see, I eat my cups mostly 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.430
 even in the off-season even when I join 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.759
 3500 calories are outweighed by that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.530
 training is simply harmful 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:33.119
 no it is worse no it does 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.570
 you also fat no, just my 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.640
 Opinion is crucial in front whether you 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.430
 increasing or decreasing is still 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.670
 this damn calorie deficit or 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.250
 the surplus since the surplus takes 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.630
 her train muscle mass as well as fat though 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.970
 her a huge surplus ever 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.219
 tends to be bold or, above all, 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.979
 greasy at all deficit burns her 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.799
 Body fat you are too cash deficit 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.280
 that may burn too 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.259
 muscle mass 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.080
 I go in the final competition 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.540
 I was up to just under 1000 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.840
 100 calories towards the end and still have 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.960
 a lot of training plus cardio 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.000
 and finally have two to 300 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.760
 lost muscle mass 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.640
 I think it's okay a few 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.210
 deep with the body fat of everything therefore 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.490
 is now so much to my color 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.960
 So you see I do that I eat cups 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.540
 have and indeed exclude now 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.260
 would say my shape is when you 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.260
 was that there was no intervention there 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.000
 even a study that I believe 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.230
 a two or three years old 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.580
 was in israel or something estonia 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.520
 no i believe israel with 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.570
 Overweight policemen as I said 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.470
 Of course you can be overweight 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.430
 not one on one on special 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.990
 normal-weight people transfer 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.650
 but the effect was determined 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.470
 from the group the predominantly the karts 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.360
 At the end of the day is exactly my effects 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.180
 i too i do not want to be here now 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.950
 to enter the hormone 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.060
 I'm just saying citigo and roma 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.709
 There is a feeling for each hormone and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.290
 that's exactly where I am when 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.670
 I spend my day in the morning with a lot of karps 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.830
 then I start to feel the day 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.160
 just more hungry and i feel 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.690
 Less busy 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.970
 conversely, if I prefer the caps against 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.550
 I feel the end of the day 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.470
 much much much much more saturated me much 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.900
 better just much better i have 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.110
 war is a high attack and therefore 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.430
 This works just fine with me 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:02.840
 and also at 98 a single customer 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.120
 that does not work then it is just like that 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.519
 I hear very crass and very instinctive 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.299
 my body on the signals of mine 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.380
 Body you see cups hurt in the evening 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.070

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.830
 So please if you have such a fitness 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.620

 magazine on the reading pages then stands 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.760
 fat burning step number one first 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.710
 no cups after too then takes 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.970
 This magazine is most garbage or 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.920
 demanded addition 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.630
 that's absolute shit believed him 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.120
 do not just try it 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.270
 because ultimately it is how you decide 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.900
 he ate a lot at the end of the day 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.170
 What in a roma cross water calories 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.750
 of course, the total timing and then with 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.740
 also a good brand breakdown could 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.930
 help a few more 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.160
