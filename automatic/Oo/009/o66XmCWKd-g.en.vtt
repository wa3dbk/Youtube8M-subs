00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.989
 to martÃ­n 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.350
 and good now I sing I hope they have 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.190
 also today I bring you a 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.920
 video that you have requested me 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.020
 lately a lot and is that they do 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.580
 she's crazy with lipsticks like you 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.590
 you know there are two things in makeup that 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.900
 I love the rumors and the 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.550
 lipsticks so obviously how to do it 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.550
 I'm going to start, I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 including everything but what we think 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.500
 lipsticks in total I have 143 and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.239
 honestly I swore they were less 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.829
 because the only thing I have is a 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.300
 large drawer that is not even full 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.329
 completely and with everything and this has 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.550
 111 labials apart in our head 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.680
 small I have 20 that are specifically 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.670
 they give and Beezus and those were the ones who 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.379
 they sent me the subscribers 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.210
 I am constantly testing them and therefore 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.589
 that's why I like to have them in another drawer 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.180
 even many of you 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.680
 they asked what was the lipstick that I 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.290
 I was wearing the previous video to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.309
 this one in a very striking pink or 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.309
 neon can you tell and the new 34 of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.679
 sight is beautiful and finally I have 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.119
 12 that are in the form of pencils my 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:11.119
 mobile acrylic organizer 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.250
 my first long list that you see here is 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.490
 completely matrix are called juaning 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.530
 the two is being a creampie with a 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.780
 pinch of pink but it's super 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.100
 extremely clear so much that already 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.140
 I can not use it because neither 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.430
 I do not even notice it so 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.630
 I recommend only this girl that 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.700
 be tanned because honestly 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.259
 it is brutal even this is the only 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.940
 color that I used when I lived in 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.710
 puerto rico why did I spend my mind 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.100
 the beach and it was constantly burned 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.100
 of the sun 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.270
 I decided to choose an armchair coast 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.010
 economic and economic in this remain 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.500
 here matte collection Cream 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.030
 mix called unlock and so that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.340
 you should not be a surprise because 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.410
 I always talk about this color is like 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.840
 if it was a magenta or a neon pink 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.980
 super extremely striking the other 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.270
 what I like is the consistency though 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.680
 they have a lot of people that's what 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.840
 who do not like this line but I 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.760
 I consider that the one that is soft to the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.400
 beginning and then this one that kills is a 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.870
 success a wonder so it's always going to 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.380
 be miracle favorite of all 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.880
 time 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.370
 the contrast that they give here of the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.080
 matte retro collection extremely matte 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.520
 of matt is called today fire 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.230
 and this one comes in a medium project 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.480
 orange that lifts any skin tone 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.160
 honestly I already used it so much and 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.709
 So much you have seen it so much in 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.110
 my instagram videos on facebook that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.520
 I do not know what else to say about this 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.410
 color, the only thing I can tell you is 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.420
 which is still my favorite lipstick 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.070
 all times in conjunction with the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.590
 addis ababa of bits although I know that 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.280
 question has nothing to do with that but 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.280
 I wanted to let you know 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.870
 my favorite brand of lipstick on these 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.209
 moments that you definitely have to 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.040
 be more and I realized recently 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.780
 because since the new connection came out 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.819
 retro matheiu has not stopped buying 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.439
 lipsticks not necessarily from the new 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.090
 connection I also bought a mate 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.189
 like the sexy thong that you know that 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.769
 I love him right now too 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.629
 I bought the ruby â€‹â€‹book buy the live glam 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.489
 I do not remember what number are coming 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.530
 I bought two colors that I also bought 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.180
 recently in summary accounts I'm 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.859
 obsessed with mac in question of the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.659
 economic brand my favorite glory 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.670
 specifically this collection that 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.620
 flame glory nymph debut are those that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.180
 they come in this silver container and they have 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.680
 ones that come in a golden container that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.540
 They are very good too but these are 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.950
 my favorites I love the consistency 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.299
 because when it is not being applied it 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.310
 It feels like I'm treating you 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.200
 lips but they spend several minutes and dry 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.150
 completely another thing is that the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.159
 lips are going to start feeling good 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.629
 sticky but I think that's 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.639
 what makes them last a lot of 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.650
 vienna time and be the purpose is not 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.650
 mathematical of a little bit of hair 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.900
 my favorite purpose is everything 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.120
 have to do with mate like for example 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.280
 the regular mate that lasts for a long time 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.319
 the retro mate more than lasts all day 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.700
 because it's super dry and I love it 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.470
 also the purposes that leave 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.000
 some lip stains because no 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.680
 matter you can eat the chicken 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.610
 largest fried in the world and how you want 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.610
 you have the intact 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.950
 the last thing you buy with lip dye 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.180
 of lime with the color pink wwe wwe you achieve 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.430
 received yet because it was this week 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.690
 but anyway I will place a 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.030
 picture over here just in case 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.830
 they want to know what the color is and what 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.930
 I want it to look a bit in plain sight 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.810
 of the ix although I do not think this is a 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.000
 exact color of the offender because in 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.430
 the photo looks pretty bright as if 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.960
 it was more neon than this one so of all 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.090
 ways when I receive it I think I make a 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.770
 new makeup video to buy 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.940
 lately for you to have 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.940
 units like lights 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.770
 now that you are designing all the 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.720
 lip products only that I carry 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.490
 in my makeup portfolio and first thing 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.319
 I have so that this balm dye 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.270
 Maybelline baby tips and in the tone 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.220
 baby I put you come in a violet 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.080
 correctly when you apply it 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.330
 it looks like violet like it's something windy 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.710
 and I think it hydrates pretty well 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.659
 the other thing that I have so that this lip 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.180
 matte cream in mix in color this 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:54.949
 with which he has been making a loan with a 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.020
 little bit of pink I love it 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.400
 beautiful also took this matte lipstick 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.379
 of the collection we made for the 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.539
 first in the number 107 that is being 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.969
 a beautiful brown half red me 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.469
 love I love it here I also have 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.569
 this nix eyeliner in color 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.009
 osbourne that I love I always what 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.360
 used in conjunction with the labial 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.120
 mascara that I showed you earlier 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.530
 because they beat well brutal and the last thing that 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.419
 I have for whom this eyeliner of the 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.610
 Jordan brand that is called Tony and I 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.050
 love it because it's super natural that's why 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.120
 I always carry it in my wallet because 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.120
 Can be combined with any lip 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.950
 you are supposed to take care of only one color 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.150
 red but I decided on 5 because the 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.250
 reality is that because of my skin tone it is 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.930
 the type of colors that I use the most and 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.490
 for the first one that you see here from Kate 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.070
 moss for the mascara is completely 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.230
 Tuesday and this is at number 107 and 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.540
 give yourself the time it's been a 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.010
 half brown red in other people who 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.320
 come here from the cream brand collection 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.840
 of mix in the color montecarlo and comes 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.880
 being a red brown he cited half wine 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.260
 We are also seeing the 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.090
 violence outside to help our collection 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.100
 complete because honestly during 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.960
 all day you do not have to touch up 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.180
 a ridiculous thing because the color looks 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.520
 super bright since you put it on 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.900
 until you're going to remove it so for 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.270
 that I love in addition they are super 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.010
 cheap and you can have the tone 0-3 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.350
 that is being a medium roll 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.480
 orange that is beautiful again 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.060
 blond others this is the retro connection 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.220
 mate and I love to last all day and 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.870
 color is super sexy a pretty steal 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.150
 striking unlike the russian see 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.830
 I have to crochet but this one continues 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.180
 being my favorites the last since 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.710
 this one had not shown before and 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.050

 this hero goes to any skin tone 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.400
 I consider it the perfect theft 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.560
 that if you are looking for a red 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.000
 that is economical that lasts all day and 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.500
 that is the quality of the road 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.500
 expensive this is excellent 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.279
