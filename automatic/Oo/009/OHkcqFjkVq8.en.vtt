Pennsylvania and is one of those parks
that<00:00:09.990> could<00:00:10.230> use<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> little<00:00:10.740> bit<00:00:11.099> more<00:00:11.160> tender

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969

loving care they have some great rides
would<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.849> even<00:00:15.240> better<00:00:15.269> if<00:00:15.630> they<00:00:15.809> could<00:00:15.870> add

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
would be even better if they could add

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.810 
would be even better if they could add
in<00:00:16.289> some<00:00:16.529> more<00:00:16.710> rides<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> next<00:00:17.670> five

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.029 
in some more rides in the next five
years<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.750> better<00:00:18.900> improve<00:00:19.140> Dorney<00:00:20.010> Park

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.859 
years I can better improve Dorney Park
that's<00:00:20.730> why<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.000> doing<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.420> video<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> am

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that's why I'm doing in this video I am

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.509 
that's why I'm doing in this video I am
making<00:00:22.260> predictions<00:00:22.650> about<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.310> they'll<00:00:23.490> be

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
making predictions about what they'll be

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.490 
making predictions about what they'll be
adding<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> next<00:00:24.240> five<00:00:24.390> years<00:00:24.420> not<00:00:25.199> just

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
adding in the next five years not just

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.589 
adding in the next five years not just
what<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.920> would<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.609> see<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> park<00:00:27.240> but

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
what I would like to see at the park but

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.750 
what I would like to see at the park but
what<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> think<00:00:28.019> will<00:00:28.710> actually<00:00:28.859> come<00:00:29.369> so

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
what I think will actually come so

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.220 
what I think will actually come so
before<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.119> start<00:00:30.330> looking<00:00:30.420> into<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.929> let's

before we start looking into this let's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.630 
before we start looking into this let's
look<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> last<00:00:31.769> five<00:00:32.009> years<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.489> what

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
area and a dinosaur walkthrough and 2013

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.100 
area and a dinosaur walkthrough and 2013
was<00:00:43.500> more<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> park<00:00:44.640> overall<00:00:45.210> upgrade<00:00:45.780> year

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
was more of a park overall upgrade year

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.830 
was more of a park overall upgrade year
but<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:46.530> didn't<00:00:46.739> actually<00:00:46.829> add<00:00:47.129> any<00:00:47.160> major

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
but they didn't actually add any major

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.660 
but they didn't actually add any major
attractions<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> bad<00:00:49.950> past<00:00:50.399> five

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
attractions that's not a bad past five

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.580 
attractions that's not a bad past five
years<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.449> would<00:00:51.570> certainly<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.930> nice<00:00:52.260> if

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
years but it would certainly be nice if

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.290 
years but it would certainly be nice if
their<00:00:52.770> next<00:00:53.039> five<00:00:53.219> years<00:00:53.489> were<00:00:53.699> even<00:00:54.059> better

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
their next five years were even better

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.290 
their next five years were even better
so<00:00:54.750> let's<00:00:54.930> first<00:00:55.110> look<00:00:55.230> at<00:00:55.469> 2016<00:00:55.949> twice<00:00:56.820> denied

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
so let's first look at 2016 twice denied

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.439 
so let's first look at 2016 twice denied
intact<00:00:58.289> anything<00:00:58.920> huge<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.969> might<00:01:00.120> look<00:01:00.300> at

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
intact anything huge you might look at

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.869 
intact anything huge you might look at
some<00:01:00.629> overall<00:01:01.109> park<00:01:01.469> upgrades<00:01:02.039> maybe<00:01:02.640> see

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
some overall park upgrades maybe see

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
some overall park upgrades maybe see
some<00:01:03.059> general<00:01:03.270> improvements<00:01:04.140> around<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
some general improvements around the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.910 
some general improvements around the
park

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
park

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.649 
park
that's<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.400> 2016<00:01:06.030> probably<00:01:06.360> won't<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that's because 2016 probably won't be a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.780 
that's because 2016 probably won't be a
big<00:01:06.960> budget<00:01:07.320> year<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:08.369> they're<00:01:08.549> gonna<00:01:08.640> be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
big budget year because they're gonna be

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.750 
big budget year because they're gonna be
saving<00:01:09.060> those<00:01:09.360> funds<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:10.020> 2017<00:01:10.979> however<00:01:11.549> if

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
saving those funds for 2017 however if

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.480 
saving those funds for 2017 however if
we<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> new<00:01:12.510> edition<00:01:13.020> 2016<00:01:13.439> I'd<00:01:13.920> imagine

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
we do see a new edition 2016 I'd imagine

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.120 
we do see a new edition 2016 I'd imagine
it<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.850> smaller<00:01:15.450> edition<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.890> could

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it to be a smaller edition so what could

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
it to be a smaller edition so what could
Dorney<00:01:17.580> Park<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.939> adding<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.330> 2017<00:01:19.020> I'm

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
Dorney Park be adding in 2017 I'm

received<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.040> new<00:01:44.490> original<00:01:45.090> roller<00:01:45.659> coaster

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
received a new original roller coaster

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.230 
received a new original roller coaster
for<00:01:46.680> several<00:01:47.009> years<00:01:47.280> stinger<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.909> came<00:01:48.090> in

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
for several years stinger and came in

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.050 
for several years stinger and came in
2012<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> used<00:01:50.189> roller<00:01:50.579> coaster

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
2012 and that was a used roller coaster

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.999 
2012 and that was a used roller coaster
so<00:01:51.390> something<00:01:51.780> new<00:01:52.049> would<00:01:52.290> absolutely<00:01:52.649> be

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
so something new would absolutely be

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.249 
so something new would absolutely be
great<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.549> also<00:01:53.880> by<00:01:54.149> 2017<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:55.140> you're

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
great and also by 2017 I think you're

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.749 
great and also by 2017 I think you're
going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> start<00:01:55.710> seeing<00:01:55.979> some<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.670> these

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
going to start seeing some of these

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.030 
going to start seeing some of these
dinosaur<00:01:57.360> live<00:01:57.659> attractions<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.530> many<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
dinosaur live attractions at many of the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.550 
dinosaur live attractions at many of the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
parks start to go away they've never

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.010 
parks start to go away they've never
been<00:02:01.829> hugely<00:02:02.310> popular<00:02:02.659> attractions<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.960> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
been hugely popular attractions and I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.480 
been hugely popular attractions and I
doubt<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.320> we'll<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.770> seeing<00:02:05.070> dinosaurs

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
doubt that we'll be seeing dinosaurs

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.520 
doubt that we'll be seeing dinosaurs
alive<00:02:05.610> around<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> next<00:02:06.840> five<00:02:07.020> years<00:02:07.049> at

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
all Cedar Fair parks I think they're

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.820 
all Cedar Fair parks I think they're
gonna<00:02:09.360> start<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.899> go<00:02:10.080> away<00:02:10.200> they're<00:02:10.530> simply

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
gonna start to go away they're simply

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.830 
gonna start to go away they're simply
not<00:02:11.009> making<00:02:11.459> any<00:02:11.640> money<00:02:11.879> no<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:12.450> wants<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.660> go

not making any money no one wants to go

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.670 
not making any money no one wants to go
to<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.989> park<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.319> see

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
to a park and see

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
to a park and see
giant<00:02:14.129> rubber<00:02:14.310> dinosaurs<00:02:14.939> that<00:02:15.120> don't<00:02:15.269> work

giant rubber dinosaurs that don't work

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.479

America was the last GC I that Seafarer

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.729 
America was the last GC I that Seafarer
added<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.459> was<00:02:29.579> absolutely<00:02:30.150> outstanding

something<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.159> in<00:02:32.310> Pennsylvania<00:02:32.549> at

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
something like that in Pennsylvania at

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.970 
something like that in Pennsylvania at
Dorney<00:02:33.629> Park<00:02:33.750> would<00:02:34.230> absolutely<00:02:34.590> be

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
Dorney Park would absolutely be

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.580 
Dorney Park would absolutely be
brilliant<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:36.120> would<00:02:36.299> be<00:02:36.389> great<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.290> they

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
brilliant it would be great because they

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.809 
brilliant it would be great because they
will<00:02:37.709> have<00:02:37.769> gotten<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.099> new<00:02:38.219> roller<00:02:38.459> coaster<00:02:38.760> in

will have gotten a new roller coaster in

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.539 
will have gotten a new roller coaster in
2017<00:02:39.389> I<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:39.750> 2018<00:02:40.650> will<00:02:41.069> be<00:02:41.189> another

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
2017 I think 2018 will be another

smaller year Dorney Park doesn't really

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.890 
smaller year Dorney Park doesn't really
add<00:02:44.040> these<00:02:44.370> huge<00:02:44.760> attractions<00:02:45.569> or<00:02:45.750> these

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
add these huge attractions or these

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.440 
add these huge attractions or these
humongous<00:02:46.709> expansions<00:02:47.609> but<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> think<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.359> we

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
humongous expansions but I think that we

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.659 
humongous expansions but I think that we
might<00:02:48.599> be<00:02:48.750> seeing<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.079> new<00:02:49.260> Zamperla<00:02:49.889> disco

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669

might be seeing a new Zamperla disco

Cedar Fair likes these rides and I can

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800 
Cedar Fair likes these rides and I can
totally<00:02:53.129> see<00:02:53.340> one<00:02:53.700> at<00:02:53.819> Dorney<00:02:54.030> Park<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.720> I

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
totally see one at Dorney Park and I

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.780 
totally see one at Dorney Park and I
have<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> spinning<00:02:55.560> roller<00:02:55.799> coaster<00:02:56.250> but<00:02:56.639> this

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
have a spinning roller coaster but this

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.059 
have a spinning roller coaster but this
kind<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.120> gives<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.569> close<00:02:57.959> enough<00:02:58.349> feel<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:59.040> a

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
kind of gives a close enough feel to a

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.979 
kind of gives a close enough feel to a
spinning<00:02:59.459> coaster<00:02:59.909> plus<00:03:00.419> they're<00:03:00.629> long<00:03:00.959> and

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
spinning coaster plus they're long and

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.349 
spinning coaster plus they're long and
skinny<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.159> they'll<00:03:02.370> take<00:03:02.579> up<00:03:02.760> too<00:03:03.030> much<00:03:03.060> space

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
skinny so they'll take up too much space

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.990 
skinny so they'll take up too much space
in<00:03:03.900> 2019<00:03:04.889> I<00:03:05.010> think<00:03:05.219> we'll<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.430> seeing<00:03:05.669> at<00:03:05.760> Rio

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
in 2019 I think we'll be seeing at Rio

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
in 2019 I think we'll be seeing at Rio
tech<00:03:06.299> dark<00:03:06.659> ride<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.230> if<00:03:07.379> 9<00:03:07.560> 2019<00:03:08.250> then

tech dark ride and if 9 2019 then

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.339 
tech dark ride and if 9 2019 then
probably<00:03:08.730> 2020<00:03:09.359> because<00:03:09.480> Cedar<00:03:09.900> Fair<00:03:10.169> has

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
probably 2020 because Cedar Fair has

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.679 
probably 2020 because Cedar Fair has
stated<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.889> they<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.760> these<00:03:12.030> trial<00:03:12.389> techs

stated that they like these trial techs

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.659 
stated that they like these trial techs
and<00:03:12.930> they<00:03:13.019> want<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.379> see<00:03:13.620> him<00:03:13.769> at<00:03:13.980> all<00:03:14.189> Cedar

Fair parks and they said that eventually

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.869 
Fair parks and they said that eventually

just gotta add it at Dorney Park and so
something<00:04:14.310> like<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.519> would<00:04:14.879> make<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.120> lot<00:04:15.329> of

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
something like that would make a lot of

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.759 
something like that would make a lot of
sense<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.750> course<00:04:15.989> if<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.259> ride<00:04:16.380> doesn't

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
sense of course if the ride doesn't

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.649 
sense of course if the ride doesn't
exist<00:04:17.099> that<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.310> can't<00:04:17.549> predict<00:04:18.000> what<00:04:18.359> ride

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
exist that I can't predict what ride

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.390 
exist that I can't predict what ride
they'll<00:04:18.900> be<00:04:19.019> adding<00:04:19.349> but<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.949> is<00:04:20.070> something

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
they'll be adding but that is something

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.250 
they'll be adding but that is something
that<00:04:20.459> could<00:04:20.759> certainly<00:04:20.970> see<00:04:21.329> happen<00:04:21.719> so<00:04:22.109> that

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
that could certainly see happen so that

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.870 
that could certainly see happen so that
is<00:04:22.380> my<00:04:22.500> five-year<00:04:22.979> plan<00:04:23.250> for<00:04:23.279> Dorney<00:04:23.849> Park

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.149 
is my five-year plan for Dorney Park

I<00:04:49.500> think<00:04:49.710> that<00:04:49.830> definitely<00:04:50.190> can<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.340> said<00:04:50.580> for

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
I think that definitely can be said for

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.700 
I think that definitely can be said for
Dorney<00:04:51.180> Park<00:04:51.210> if<00:04:51.630> you<00:04:52.020> add<00:04:52.230> some<00:04:52.530> of<00:04:52.560> those

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
Dorney Park if you add some of those

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.710 
Dorney Park if you add some of those
smaller<00:04:53.130> rides<00:04:53.430> along<00:04:53.910> with<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.120> big<00:04:54.510> new

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
smaller rides along with a big new

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.050 
smaller rides along with a big new
attraction<00:04:55.290> like<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.530> GCI<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.490> think<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:56.940> would

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
attraction like a GCI I think that would

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.880 
attraction like a GCI I think that would
overall<00:04:57.390> improve<00:04:57.840> Dorney<00:04:58.200> Park<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.590> make<00:04:58.740> it

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
overall improve Dorney Park and make it

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.980 
overall improve Dorney Park and make it
better<00:04:59.010> than<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.310> already<00:04:59.520> is

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.050
