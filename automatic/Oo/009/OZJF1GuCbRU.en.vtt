 bittering a regional crisis 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.259
 four defeats 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.259
 what mysteries reveal 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.829
 if you look closely 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.829
 as living beings you find 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.269
 plants plants the human species 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.439
 the fifth all these living things 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.770

 understand infeasible 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.820
 start here

 your signature to find out what is crime he arme 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.780
 all 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.780
 so do not bother me 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.010
 human curiosity 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.600
 always push the leftists to discover the mysteries of life 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.740
 first of all it is necessary to know the mysteries of nature 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.220
 for several centuries 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.500
 without the possibility of photography 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.760
 to collect species allows drawing saulo and the flora 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 like those of forró martírios because we were pics

 she 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.270
 borja technology is a key partner in the discoveries 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.590
 and scientific advances did you know that from 1990 to 2003 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.979
 hundreds of scientists from around the world 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.369
 were mobilized to work on the genome project 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 in an accentuated cartographic 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.200
 the scientists used machines created only for the DNA sequencing 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:15.039
 and computer programs to record and analyze the information obtained by 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.309
 they 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.309
 it was very important to automate the process 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.099
 because the sequence of dna molecules 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.309
 may have billions of letters 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.719
 in the delineation sequencing laboratories 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.239
 the monitors showed images in which each color represents one of the letters 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:42.469
 if all twin scorsese balance sheets of human genome dna molecules 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:48.759
 replace all the letters of all the numbers in the phone book of 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:49.699
 Paulo 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:55.109
 they would fill the 140 phone books you see understood from the 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.819

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.529
 all these relationships are possible 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:23.869
 why we want sunset and francisco milk identified in 1953 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:28.389
 the four chemical dams unraveling the structure of the molecule of 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.150
 dna 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.069
 and its shape in space 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.069
 the famous double lc 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.519
 tobi for this 21st century 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.519
 different perspectives without cause for concern are already there to act in the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.119
 Marketplace 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.119
 as a new territory in the world of knowledge 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.400
 for life sciences researchers 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.090
 with the sequencing of dna at first expectations both for the study of 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.870
 issues related to our health as well as to determine the authorship of 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.690
 crimes 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.600
 or perhaps for the rescue of endangered species is what is in the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.660
 the core of anonymity and even cloning projects. 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.130
 the birth of the dolly sheep on June 5, 1996 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.650
 reveals the technique of cloning 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.639
 the desire to recreate the world and himself 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.639
 mark the existence of the human species 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.650
 What do you see in the exhibition? 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.389
 witness to human activity and commitment in an attempt to control the 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.569
 own heredity 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.279
 and there I will go of charity of the living beings with whom you share the planet 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.139
 when creating agriculture 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.800
 men also created an embryo of knowledge 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.550
 which allowed the genetic improvement 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.809
 which continues with the new studies and researches 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.610

 in several places in the world where the first of our kind lived 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.499
 in those springs of the past 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:26.779
 men for the first time intervened in the reproduction of the species with whom 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.469
 I used to live 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:33.019
 domesticated plants and animals by selecting between plants and 

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:37.499
 animals that best serve their purposes 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.180
 not 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180
