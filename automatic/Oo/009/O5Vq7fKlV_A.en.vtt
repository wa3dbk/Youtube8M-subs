00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.000
 how about friends I'm Jim and in this 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.340
 occasion I wanted to show you these figures 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.560
 together if you are not familiar with 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.910
 These figures tell you that they are 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.700
 figures made by doctor 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.570
 they launched them around the year of 2008 and 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.820
 2009 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.470
 and I wanted to make this video so they can 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.660
 see better what are the proportions 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:40.180
 what is between the four figures 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.210
 and some details that are better appreciated 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.880
 when they are together the figures that 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.580
 I'll show a little bit later they can 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.030
 see there that peak stands out for its by its 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.030
 height 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 can see that they catch this is smaller 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.070
 that the rest of the figures in 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.590
 this moment is in top of 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.650
 the box in which the figure comes but 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.990
 if we put it at the level of the rest of the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.630
 figures may notice that it does not even reach 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.240
 half the body of the boku figure 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.009
 only reaches the middle of the thigh of the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.009
 piccolo figure 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.970
 the truth is that the proportions 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.790
 is well taken care of sometimes doctor gives me 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.060
 the impression that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.340
 that he fails what is the scale 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.920
 all figures take them out equally 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.350
 keep a scale a scale 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.600
 proportionate as other 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 companies like hot toys enter bay 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.830
 good 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.680
 You can also see 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.230
 here when the figures of 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.060
 Goku can see the differences there 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.689
 between the suits 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.180
 in fact you can see that itself in general 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.090
 goku figure in his gym person 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.850
 look more pale than the figure of the vee 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.039
 Goku not transformed the color of the skin 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.470
 the color of the suit is paler 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.819
 paler orange the blue is appreciated 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.910
 slightly paler I think that that 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:23.530
 it's an effect that he wanted to give him a doctor 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.330
 this to capture or to denote that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.360
 goku transform his person and in this 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.700
 surrounded by that here 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.300
 yellow and luminous that characterizes that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.600
 transformation 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.360
 and I think that I'm staying with them 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.910
 well that effect and that's why the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.100
 figure looks slightly paler 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.740
 we can also see differences in the 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.060
 costume regarding the kanji symbol that 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.080
 It has the figure of Goku not transformed 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.990
 while the figure of goku his 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.570
 precedent does not have that 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:00.520
 that symbol if we see them also by 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:02.800
 back we can see that the figure of goku 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.569
 it's about being jiaying does not have that 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.519
 symbol while the figure of goku 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.519
 without transformation if you have it 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.790
 and we can also see the difference and in 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.090
 the 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.300
 in the waist that one has another 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:25.180
 difference in terms of the bands 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.180
 or the tapes sorry when you do not feel 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.430
 the truth is that 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.300
 these figures you are as a doctor 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.590
 I already mentioned it are 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.590
 they are excellent 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.880
 they had a great success they made a 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.360
 good job in modeling in the 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.360
 painting 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.660
 and I'm quite happy with these 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.660
 figures 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.430
 If you are interested in seeing us in a 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.930
 individual each figure plus one 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.989
 more detailed way you can visit this 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.989
 the review of each figure I leave 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.480
 down there in the description there 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.840
 the links with the revisions will appear 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.479
 individual of each figure on my part 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.919
 it's all I hope you liked a 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.919
 greeting and until next time
