 news that has come out in the last

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.949

 respect but we have fresh news 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.489
 in this episode in this play king news 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.899
 I want to give you the news that they have 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.730
 said that supposedly this June in the 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.920
 wwdc that every year celebrates apple that is 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.469
 a conference for developers 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.079
 They are going to present an iPhone 6 that 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.399
 would have 4.7 inch screen the 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.770
 truth is that this is a little weird but 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.379
 has not confirmed a Chinese analyst who 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.820
 it's called song jang suk that supposedly 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.259
 is on the list and has been successful enough 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.090
 things in the world of technology 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.490
 fact he guessed enough details 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.860
 Regarding the mobile this cool 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.900
 motor or motorbike 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.180
 x well then as I say in the next 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.760
 world wide developers conference de 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.490
 apple this June 2014 we could see 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.670
 an iphone 6 which would be pretty cool 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.960
 with 47-inch screen I do not know what 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.280
 a screen will look like 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.770
 quite big compared to what 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.229
 we currently have not but the news 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.990
 fat is that this would not be the only 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.450
 iphone that they would present us this year in 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.070
 2014 but they could present us with a 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.680
 little bit later on for September 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.200
 October another iphone that supposedly 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.290
 would have 5.7 inch screen so 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.140
 so much this year 2014 we would see two iphones 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.240
 one 4.7 - inch screen and other 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.160
 with 5.7 inch screen having 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.900
 described is quite interesting and nothing 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.880
 what to think because in 2013 we 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.759
 They also presented two new iphones 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.470
 a 5 s and a 50 that could be a 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.060
 first contact in the market 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.070
 to take out two devices and see a 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.869
 little bit what is its operation and that 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.239
 it is the exit that they have to take two 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.830
 iphones at the end top of range not this 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.050
 way it seems that tree has caught the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.920
 impulses and 100 tests to be able to 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.340
 to say that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.700
 this July we will see an iphone 6 with 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.860
 almost certainly in the wwdc and 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.360
 also at the end of the year we would see another 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.099
 iphone that we will see to see how it 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.500
 called iphone max I do not know what name 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.450
 could you put that will have 5.7 screen 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.190
 good guys this is the news I do not know 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.510
 will appear to you I do not know what 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.950
 you will think about putting it in 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.830
 comments to see if you think they are 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.360
 excessively large screens maybe 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.620
 you are used to the screen that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.480
 has the area currently maybe 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.610
 you need a little more but maybe 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.050
 this is a bit exaggerated we'll see 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.940
 see what happens in the end are rumors not 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.980
 they have to be true but it seems 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.480
 that the source is quite reliable good 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.400
 guys here I say goodbye to you 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.400
 to all and until a next video chao
