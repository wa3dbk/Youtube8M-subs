of children no matter where they are in
the<00:00:46.670> world<00:00:46.789> that's<00:00:47.210> what<00:00:47.359> drives<00:00:47.719> us<00:00:48.159> at<00:00:49.159> the

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
the world that's what drives us at the

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.610 
the world that's what drives us at the
beginning<00:00:49.670> I<00:00:49.879> was<00:00:50.059> thrown<00:00:50.690> into<00:00:50.870> this<00:00:51.170> medical

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
beginning I was thrown into this medical

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.880 
beginning I was thrown into this medical
world<00:00:51.800> where<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:53.059> was<00:00:53.300> very<00:00:53.690> unfamiliar<00:00:54.170> with

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
world where I was very unfamiliar with

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.009 
world where I was very unfamiliar with
terminology<00:00:55.670> just<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:56.329> structure<00:00:56.690> of<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:56.899> all

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
terminology just the structure of it all

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.399 
terminology just the structure of it all
and<00:00:57.370> although<00:00:58.370> there's<00:00:59.030> so<00:00:59.300> much<00:00:59.420> fear<00:01:00.079> and

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
and although there's so much fear and

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.180 
and although there's so much fear and
anxiety

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
anxiety

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.639 
anxiety
I<00:01:01.519> think<00:01:01.999> the<00:01:02.059> invitation<00:01:02.600> at<00:01:03.019> children<00:01:03.559> is

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
I think the invitation at children is

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.890 
I think the invitation at children is
extraordinary<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.550> come<00:01:05.540> into<00:01:05.870> a

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
extraordinary to come into a

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.630 
extraordinary to come into a
relationship<00:01:06.440> where<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.950> do<00:01:07.130> feel<00:01:07.340> like<00:01:07.490> you

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
relationship where you do feel like you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.780 
relationship where you do feel like you
are<00:01:07.790> partnering<00:01:08.240> along<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.140> way<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:10.520> be<00:01:10.670> able

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
are partnering along the way to be able

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.450 
are partnering along the way to be able
to<00:01:10.969> influence<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.229> lives<00:01:12.439> of<00:01:12.829> patients<00:01:13.040> and

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
to influence the lives of patients and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.060 
to influence the lives of patients and
families<00:01:13.880> while<00:01:14.390> they're<00:01:14.630> in<00:01:14.780> crisis<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.530> to
