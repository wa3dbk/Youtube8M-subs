00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.490
 hello my friends from the web how are they 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.889
 Welcome to this painting space 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.770
 decorative that are going to see today a good 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.020
 spectacular flower made with petals 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.380
 two strokes they will see what they 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.380
 It seems 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.070
 and of course as always I will show you 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.640
 what materials are we going to use to 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.149
 make this spectacular flower we are going to 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.680
 use white and violet acrylics or 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.280
 it could be any other color to 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.620
 choice a brush eta medium water and 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.890
 absorbent paper and for those who do not 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.019
 they want to make big as a giant the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.720
 flower can use this type of brush 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.329
 and I assure you it is amazing 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.479
 but we will see the technique in a 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.830
 more intermediate size like this one and as 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:09.170
 always with the flat brush and hair 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.930
 let's take paint to make the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.470
 half load that so many times I've already 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:20.150
 counted we do in this way 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.220
 so we always recharge I look like 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.090
 repetitive but it is very important 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.610
 remember these tips to do the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.040
 half load or the double load in this 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.430
 case 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.130
 notice first of all we use the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.200
 white color out 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.820
 we do it this way 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:48.159
 we end in tip again take 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:53.280
 load always that's half petal 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:57.450
 we can go back up 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.350
 and we close our petal if you like 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.700
 As I say, you can always go over and 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.850
 we can do it in one brushstroke 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.569
 for this to be easier we can go 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.129
 turning our leaf a little bit because 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.280
 we all find it easier to accommodate 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.890
 the drawing that will accommodate the hand in this 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.530
 case in decorative painting accommodates the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.560
 drawing we do the same again on 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.570
 outward color 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.570
 we do it this way 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.780
 we go back and we finish in the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.870
 center in the same way or in the same 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.110
 place that we started to make it more 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.030
 Of course I'm going to repeat 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.100
 we do it so 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.100
 until all the petals are made 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.820
 you will think 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.630
 what is a simple flower a very flower 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.630
 common so far if one more petal 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.689
 in this way 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.230
 we conclude our first 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.230
 part 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.650
 now let's start from the 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.280
 principle and we do the second part of 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.280
 our flower 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.290
 we start from the side 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.640
 and there we finished it 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.110
 and in this way 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.720
 we conclude in the center as 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.860
 we can always do 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.380
 some figure and then we can 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.700
 complete with some detail as in the 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.700
 finished model 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.259
 and friends who have found this 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.569
 liked it good and if you want to know a lot 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.060
 much more can they acquire the courses of 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.190
 decorative painting through the web 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.190
 they send them to order arrives to them by mail 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.960
 they pay it against reimbursement and they learn in 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.090
 house as if they had the teacher at 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.190
 They liked the side they liked 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.220
 I hope that if we meet again 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.460
 in a next tv color video for the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.460
 Web
