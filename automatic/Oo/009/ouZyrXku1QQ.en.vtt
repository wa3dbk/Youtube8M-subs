00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.390
 be at the right time on the site 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.310
 fair but for me luck is a factor 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.770
 human I met with people who 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.110
 or not 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.020
 and I tell an anecdote of the affirmation 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.800
 there is a moment for example that I am 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.800
 with your mouth covered 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.030
