00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.779
 the real madrid cf 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.060
 at their return 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.060
 so 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.479
 and it's cédric hello to all and welcome to the official granting of seaside 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:30.409
 within the afssaps 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.800
 you could see the huge wait is behind me it's obviously because 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.560
 we just saw 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.940
 what they emit allied at 4:35 pm on the stand is detestable 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.980
 a tour to the united states have made believe i do not have to do it on 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.290
 will see it's very very similar in in the continuity of precipices 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.609
 previous who are millions 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:45.520
 our wrinkles 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.650
 that is to say a big open world% and in the world that is a little bit 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.880
 everywhere all the all the open-minded aspects of the western rpg regular 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.239
 bash forget let us know especially about 360 the demo was 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.760
 by the way on 360 and not on the pc version it allows a little bit of us 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.120
 report on the visual quality of the title 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.790
 choi voi nice little disappointed or skincare not even what hollywood 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 character animation including where monsters in combat or even 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.479
 sets and some things 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.210
 it's still pretty% is close to what was done before it's 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.229
 much more advanced visually and graphically but yat ago 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.810
 still even smaller element of animation and so on that make it 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.660
 it's still a bit stiff 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.850
 all interfaces was handed over entirely with a system of 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.630
 panels 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.300
 to select a little bit the skills and weapons against 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.220
 use since he carries off having one in this episode in the right hand and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.230
 from the left 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.990
 for example twice the same spells procap do something 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.390
 more powerful concentration that would help the left hand and sword 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.659
 in the water at the end of the day 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.230
 truly is a lot more fluidity in combat 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.399
 in e2 with six tries this new method 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.520
 to manage powers and skills and weapons 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.890
 there is in the impossibility one can take two thick a love which is born 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.880
 pedophile even goes out finally brief 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.159
 it is up to everyone to make a little bit of their sauce% for the convoy and 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.859
 then for the rest a lot of things still changed behind 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:59.689
 the formula 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.749
 we're really at nothing for example how the quest system that 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.610
 allow percent and boost according to 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.610
 de de scor made the choice of skiers to visit or not the quests 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.049
 example in euro ncap to be located in only one of the 150 hello 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.909
 if you have not visited before another player can do it 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.559
 in another I'm taking care of 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.979
 you would have visited and not him for example and many more elements 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.889
 like that at the quest level are going to be able to be 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.620
 personalized about your experience at the level of the system eu it stays 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.640
 similar to what we had seen before, that is to say, 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.750
 skills and increases according to their use each skill 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.620
 that increases 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.920
 allows to build a little debate until the moment when passes 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.980
 one level and each level passed allows you to unlock a little bit 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.629
 as in the fola above and in others the pj is a nonsense 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.690
 special abilities in addition and then above all that there is breaking everything 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.209
 the dragons that are in shape in the game we could see especially two with 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.879
 guitars fight pretty awesome e in a big space like that with the 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.870
 balloon that passes over 6 pm also other other ground monsters for 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.500
 take them swinging in the air aya mammoths this new single no 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.399
 to forget the big ones in the axé then the giants 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:01.569
 % and brew a lot 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.829
 we could not see it before in the game of the series 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.649
 and that energizes a guy who makes in 128 little more epic 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.789
 so a little disappointed in the realization of two of the animations and 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.629
 this achievement is a little bit in the tradition of what it was before 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.769
 but in any case certainly a game that will be solid in terms of gameplay 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:15.529
 fabric 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.659
 with a lot of content 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.930
 a lot to see a way for the normans from djeddah to 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.359
 discover with so much more puzzle in the dungeons e particular by 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.089
 example with that things where you really have to observe the objects in 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:28.159
 3d can decorate clues to solve a puzzle open doors 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.279
 indoor and dungeons 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:30.499
 so 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:34.629
 at the cern without the 15 kv space does the elders scrolls 5 skyrim adapter 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.260
 will be 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.949
 one of the western rpg to watch for the 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.469
 next year 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.649
 I give you an appointment soon Yemen could do for others 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.359
 pressure on others 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.359
