00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
it's not too bad and then we've done

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.560 
it's not too bad and then we've done
we've<00:02:36.160> added<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.730> third<00:02:36.940> kit<00:02:37.300> because<00:02:37.480> they

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
we've added the third kit because they

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.330 
we've added the third kit because they
didn't<00:02:37.870> previously<00:02:38.050> have<00:02:38.380> one<00:02:38.710> in<00:02:38.860> game<00:02:39.070> so

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
didn't previously have one in game so

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.310 
didn't previously have one in game so
we've<00:02:39.490> added<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.880> using<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.600> square<00:02:40.810> button

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
we've added it using the square button

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.950 
we've added it using the square button
again<00:02:42.160> not<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.670> hundred<00:02:42.940> percent<00:02:43.360> accurate<00:02:43.540> but

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
again not a hundred percent accurate but

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.510 
again not a hundred percent accurate but
I'm<00:02:44.050> pretty<00:02:44.290> pleased<00:02:44.710> that<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.040> one's<00:02:45.310> come

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
I'm pretty pleased that this one's come

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.990 
I'm pretty pleased that this one's come
up<00:02:45.640> not<00:02:45.820> too<00:02:46.090> bad<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.800> does<00:02:48.190> go<00:02:48.400> darker

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
up not too bad there it does go darker

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.030 
up not too bad there it does go darker
down<00:02:49.210> through<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.780> kit<00:02:50.080> on<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.470> actual<00:02:50.800> kit

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
down through the kit on the actual kit

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.310 
down through the kit on the actual kit
so<00:02:51.250> we've<00:02:51.370> had<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.790> make<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.390> decision<00:02:52.840> not<00:02:53.260> to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
so we've had to make a decision not to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.140 
so we've had to make a decision not to
put<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.830> in<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.280> there<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.640> little<00:02:54.850> bit<00:02:55.030> of

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
put that in and there it a little bit of

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.240 
put that in and there it a little bit of

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
fine detail on the collar that's missing

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.140 
fine detail on the collar that's missing

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that we can't do

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.220

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
that detail with the two lines from the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
neck color under the arms and that looks

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.920 
neck color under the arms and that looks
pretty<00:03:51.340> similar<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.820> what<00:03:51.940> you've<00:03:52.269> got<00:03:52.570> on<00:03:52.780> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
pretty similar to what you've got on the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.020 
pretty similar to what you've got on the
actual<00:03:53.290> kit<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:53.739> that's<00:03:53.920> come<00:03:54.100> up<00:03:54.130> quite<00:03:54.489> nice

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
actual kit so that's come up quite nice

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.800 
actual kit so that's come up quite nice
and<00:03:55.900> then<00:03:55.989> you've<00:03:56.140> got<00:03:56.190> 31<00:03:57.190> in<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.209> same<00:03:58.450> color

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
and then you've got 31 in the same color

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.440 
and then you've got 31 in the same color
red<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.470> red<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.730> obviously<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.269> one

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
red and the red is obviously the one

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.199 
red and the red is obviously the one
free<00:04:01.930> down<00:04:02.170> there<00:04:02.500> for<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.280> sleeve<00:04:03.550> do<00:04:03.850> and

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
free down there for the sleeve do and

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.840 
free down there for the sleeve do and
then<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.450> must<00:04:04.720> do<00:04:05.050> 69<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:08.340> gray<00:04:09.340> again

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
then you must do 69 in the gray again

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.320 
then you must do 69 in the gray again
otherwise<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.019> lines<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.650> you've<00:04:11.830> got<00:04:12.330> on

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
otherwise the lines that you've got on

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.930 
otherwise the lines that you've got on
the<00:04:14.110> front<00:04:14.350> are<00:04:14.620> also<00:04:14.830> replicated<00:04:15.730> on<00:04:15.820> the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
the front are also replicated on the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.310 
the front are also replicated on the
back<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.419> don't<00:04:16.630> want<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.140> is

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
back and you don't want that it is

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.229 
back and you don't want that it is
actually<00:04:17.680> a<00:04:17.709> blank<00:04:18.040> back<00:04:18.340> on<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:18.700> kit<00:04:19.000> so

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
actually a blank back on this kit so

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.909 
actually a blank back on this kit so
that<00:04:19.840> basically<00:04:20.109> wraps<00:04:20.769> up<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:22.000> kit<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.830> I

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
that basically wraps up that kit and I

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.280 
that basically wraps up that kit and I
think<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.340> looks<00:04:24.490> pretty<00:04:24.669> good<00:04:24.850> on<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.840> Jersey

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
think it looks pretty good on the Jersey

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.900 
think it looks pretty good on the Jersey

as we used on the tops of free dang

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.610 
as we used on the tops of free dang
don't<00:04:47.170> forget<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:48.300> then<00:04:49.300> 20<00:04:49.900> in<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.350> same

don't forget and then 20 in the same
color<00:04:51.010> grade<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.640> you<00:04:51.730> use<00:04:51.940> for<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.330> main

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
body of the shirt just cuts that line

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.030 
body of the shirt just cuts that line
off<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:55.480> it<00:04:55.570> doesn't<00:04:55.930> go<00:04:56.050> quite<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.500> way<00:04:56.740> out

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
off so it doesn't go quite the way out

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.330 
off so it doesn't go quite the way out
but<00:04:57.340> again<00:04:57.640> it's<00:04:58.510> pretty<00:04:58.840> good<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.770> socks<00:05:00.130> we

but again it's pretty good the socks we
can't<00:05:00.580> get<00:05:00.820> right<00:05:01.000> because<00:05:01.180> it<00:05:01.390> should<00:05:01.570> be<00:05:01.720> a

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
can't get right because it should be a

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.180
