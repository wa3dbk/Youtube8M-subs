00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.880 
same reel but in a high speed gear ratio
in<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> burnt<00:00:48.450> orange<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.620> advising

in with the burnt orange and in advising

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.459 
in with the burnt orange and in advising
that's<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.760> differentiates<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:52.050> two

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
that's what differentiates the two

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.650 
that's what differentiates the two
different<00:00:52.770> models<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> trio<00:00:54.360> one

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
different models but with the trio one

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.720 
different models but with the trio one
of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> major<00:00:54.960> advantages<00:00:55.649> you'll<00:00:56.309> first

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
of the major advantages you'll first

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.889 
of the major advantages you'll first
thing<00:00:56.879> you'll<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.420> different<00:00:57.660> than

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
thing you'll see is it's different than

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
thing you'll see is it's different than
any<00:00:58.020> other<00:00:58.109> wheel<00:00:58.770> you'll<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.309> case

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
any other wheel you'll see in the case

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.250 
any other wheel you'll see in the case
it's<00:01:00.120> how<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.420> call<00:01:00.600> crossover

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it's how what we call crossover

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.840 
it's how what we call crossover
construction<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.160> got<00:01:02.309> stamped

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
construction so it's got stamped

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.820 
construction so it's got stamped
aluminum<00:01:03.030> real<00:01:03.329> stem<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:04.140> got<00:01:04.290> aluminum

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
aluminum real stem it's got aluminum

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.740 
aluminum real stem it's got aluminum
real<00:01:05.159> foot<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.299> does<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.720> gives

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
real foot and what that does it gives

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.469 
real foot and what that does it gives
very<00:01:06.990> good<00:01:07.409> rigidity<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.430> alignment<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
very good rigidity in alignment for the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.580 
very good rigidity in alignment for the
school<00:01:09.810> shaft<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.260> that's<00:01:10.409> where

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
school shaft so that's where

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
school shaft so that's where
everything's<00:01:11.159> being<00:01:11.400> aligned<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:12.270> you're

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
everything's being aligned if you're

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.850 
everything's being aligned if you're
fishing<00:01:12.750> braided<00:01:13.080> line<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
fishing braided line you want that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
fishing braided line you want that
strength<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.580> power<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.270> area

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
strength and power right in this area

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840 
strength and power right in this area
and<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:16.350> doing<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> we're<00:01:17.070> able<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.430> build

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and by doing that we're able to build

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.940 
and by doing that we're able to build
two<00:01:18.270> side<00:01:18.570> plates<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.229> graphite<00:01:19.650> because

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
two side plates out of graphite because

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
two side plates out of graphite because
there's<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.030> stress<00:01:21.420> pushed<00:01:21.780> put

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there's very little stress pushed put

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.050 
there's very little stress pushed put
into<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.409> area<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.400> graphite<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.909> going

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
into this area and so graphite is going

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760 
into this area and so graphite is going
to<00:01:24.119> help<00:01:24.270> reduce<00:01:24.479> weight<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.409> we're<00:01:25.590> putting

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to help reduce weight what we're putting

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.380 
to help reduce weight what we're putting
in<00:01:25.920> aluminum<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> areas<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.240> need

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
in aluminum in the areas that need

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.460 
in aluminum in the areas that need
extreme<00:01:28.380> strength<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.350> puts<00:01:31.350> in

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
extreme strength so this really puts in

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289 
extreme strength so this really puts in
a<00:01:31.500> lotta<00:01:32.070> would<00:01:32.280> abate<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> standard<00:01:33.119> size

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
a lotta would abate to a standard size

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.840 
a lotta would abate to a standard size
reel<00:01:33.509> made<00:01:33.720> completely<00:01:34.110> out<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.350> aluminium

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
reel made completely out of aluminium

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.160 
reel made completely out of aluminium
well<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> depends<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.450> which<00:01:36.630> size<00:01:36.930> you're

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
well it depends on which size you're

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
well it depends on which size you're
looking<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.860> usually<00:01:38.310> you're<00:01:38.430> looking<00:01:38.700> at

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
looking at but usually you're looking at

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.249 
looking at but usually you're looking at
anywhere<00:01:39.000> from<00:01:39.240> twenty<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.930> thirty<00:01:40.200> percent

weight reduction of it it does decrease
quite<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> bit<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.850> carry<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> same

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
quite a bit but we carry that same

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.780 
quite a bit but we carry that same

crossover construction into the rotor as
you'll<00:01:47.970> see<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:48.509> where<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:48.960> side

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you'll see right here where the one side

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.350 
you'll see right here where the one side
is<00:01:49.350> also<00:01:49.579> graphite<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.909> other<00:01:51.090> sides

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
is also graphite and other sides

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
is also graphite and other sides
aluminum<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.110> there's<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> big<00:01:53.189> churn<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.520> guys

fish<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.090> braided<00:01:54.390> line<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.320> braided

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
fish and braided line so it's braided

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.160 
fish and braided line so it's braided
line<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> big<00:01:56.250> problems<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.390> a

and<00:02:08.560> then<00:02:08.680> on<00:02:08.770> top<00:02:08.980> of<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.700> school<00:02:09.910> is

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
and then on top of that the school is

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.510 
and then on top of that the school is
also<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.630> hybrid<00:02:11.020> crossover<00:02:11.740> construction

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
also a hybrid crossover construction

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.430 
also a hybrid crossover construction
this<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.330> my<00:02:13.420> favorite<00:02:13.840> part<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.200> design

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
this is my favorite part of the design

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.420 
this is my favorite part of the design
the<00:02:15.250> school<00:02:15.550> itself<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.390> housing<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.430> carbon

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the school itself the housing is carbon

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.280 
the school itself the housing is carbon
fiber<00:02:18.640> yep<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.480> nice<00:02:19.660> thing<00:02:19.690> there<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.170> it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
fiber yep so the nice thing there is it

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.440 
fiber yep so the nice thing there is it
helps<00:02:20.530> reduce<00:02:20.710> weight<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.880> area<00:02:22.210> is<00:02:22.300> only

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
helps reduce weight in this area is only

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.390 
helps reduce weight in this area is only
holding<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.290> line<00:02:23.470> it's<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.740> housing<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
holding a line it's the housing for the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.310 
holding a line it's the housing for the
line<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.360> areas<00:02:25.690> where<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.050> need<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
line but the areas where you need the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.740 
line but the areas where you need the
strength<00:02:26.560> we<00:02:27.250> utilized<00:02:27.580> aluminum<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.630> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
strength we utilized aluminum so the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.180 
strength we utilized aluminum so the

school lip where you want that smooth
surface<00:02:30.610> for<00:02:30.640> casting<00:02:31.210> it's<00:02:31.690> anodized

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
surface for casting it's anodized

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.400 
surface for casting it's anodized
aluminum<00:02:32.650> if<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.340> unscrew<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.930> top<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.320> the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
aluminum if I unscrew the the top of the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.040 
aluminum if I unscrew the the top of the
school<00:02:35.710> here<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.160> pull<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.730> off<00:02:37.020> one<00:02:38.020> thing

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
school here and pull this off one thing

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.750 
school here and pull this off one thing
that<00:02:38.380> you'll<00:02:38.560> see<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.040> whole<00:02:39.250> top<00:02:39.550> is

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
that you'll see is the whole top is

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.850 
that you'll see is the whole top is
aluminum<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.630> aluminum<00:02:41.080> goes<00:02:41.440> all<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.740> way

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
aluminum that aluminum goes all the way

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.340 
aluminum that aluminum goes all the way
down<00:02:42.100> into<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.430> arbor<00:02:42.760> reel<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.690> your<00:02:43.960> drags

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
down into the arbor reel so your drags

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.500 
down into the arbor reel so your drags
are<00:02:44.560> housed<00:02:44.830> in<00:02:45.100> aluminum<00:02:45.580> not<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.210> carbon

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
are housed in aluminum not on the carbon

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.510 
are housed in aluminum not on the carbon
fiber<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.380> it's<00:02:47.500> got<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> smooth<00:02:47.980> surface<00:02:48.250> to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
fiber so it's got a smooth surface to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.820 
fiber so it's got a smooth surface to
run<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.060> more<00:02:49.480> importantly<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.500> spool

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
run on and more importantly the spool

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.130 
run on and more importantly the spool
shaft<00:02:51.160> runs<00:02:51.850> through<00:02:52.240> aluminum<00:02:52.750> not<00:02:52.870> through

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
shaft runs through aluminum not through

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.510 
shaft runs through aluminum not through
the<00:02:53.230> graphite<00:02:53.590> if<00:02:53.710> it<00:02:53.800> ran<00:02:53.950> through<00:02:53.980> graphite

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
the graphite if it ran through graphite

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.910 
the graphite if it ran through graphite
you<00:02:54.730> have<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.970> potential<00:02:55.300> for<00:02:55.600> flex<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.680> got

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
you have a potential for flex so you got

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.070 
you have a potential for flex so you got
aluminum<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.640> all<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.910> key<00:02:58.150> critical<00:02:58.540> points
