00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.000
 yo baby dolls of this a torso and today we 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.320
 let's talk and the thirtieth results of the portal 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.030
 please look carefully at that 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.900
 the power that I have at the very beginning 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.829
 on those 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.360
 and the rivers that I use in principle 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.940
 this character is exactly your strength with 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.340
 these great with all this I passed without 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.610
 answers naturally not without luck but 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.580
 after all, let's start the fight from the very beginning 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.879
 I take + 3 + 2 for that time reduction 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.809
 that creed iii fly out more often compare 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:40.289
 more often my task is to kill as quickly as possible 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.949
 first plate because i'm using 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.960
 threshold and i will not be a sphere myself and therefore 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.050
 in the second stage when will distinguish 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.420
 all these first stage obtained 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.829
 damage 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.320
 it just takes me a lot of time 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.329
 If my marks fig damage the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.649
 the beginning so I try as much as possible 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.929
 faster without fear of using rage and in 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.409
 general fall faster kill the first part 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.590
 the boss of the second stage for the benefit of back and forth 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.229
 different energy saving and in principle 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.789
 in principle, you can go to drink tea 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.340
 can take a nap look your favorite 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.730
 Silence looks like a dog, but if anyone 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.850
 will be for you 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.820
 there crawl away in general a bunch 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.080
 free time while you are different 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.080
 from damage received 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.619
 This is pretty tedious. 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.520
 therefore, the video is somewhat 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.740
 accelerated 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.420
 the whole seal is that if it doesn't pass with 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.860
 1 time can be such a force 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.970
 you constantly have to set 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.770
 penetrated everything repeats but given 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.830
 tactics we use only for the one 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.010
 simple reason that is too weak 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.820
 character for the third stage boss then 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.530
 have a boss 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.010
 does very significant damage therefore the shield 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.800
 on lessons 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.710
 which is used just a couple of times for 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.430
 the battle is very, very necessary to 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.810
 do not get such a very strong damage 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.950
 which will carry me and not give 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430
 take advantage of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.260
 miraculous recovery by the way for those 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.120
 who says constantly that the boss is under me 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.040
 makes me marvelous there 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.630
 Easter eggs recovery 5 pieces worth 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.770
 from the sauna anyway take with one attack 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.540
 guys you just think wrong 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.310
 look at how much 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.230
 so that the boss takes off how many caps do you have 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.790
 remains if he shoots big and 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.910
 why you have the truth salvage not 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.770
 work be careful and so here 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.090
 i use more account tactics before 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.250
 before stage 3 so i use 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.660
 first cocoon which gives protection for two 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.500
 the entrance and then all the other shields 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.870
 nakida on itself and begins the most 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.080
 fun whether gory comes 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.200
 and make me small for you instead 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.500
 big because I prepared and 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.410
 here as you can see, I would fight 1 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.170
 verse here to each his own who is 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.290
 passes with three 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.160
 on ice bad with two Beers all 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.310
 depends on the village 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.560
 but very 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.660
 character figures that is, the more powerful 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.650
 your character order is easier for us to pass 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.080
 you two Persians 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.800
 or streamer ices but I will tear out on such 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.020
 tactics and as you can see at this go 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.120
 quite productions crit 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.319
 yes lest you speak creed and very 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.959
 important you can can write anything 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.620
 Date type did not pass only pure language 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.470
 Rita 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.170
 you there and how rita was how lucky i am 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.190
 Of course, the ride took him guys with 30 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.489
 40 Ie yes yes, I suffered badly 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.290
 turned out but I passed and and systems 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.019
 due to colitis in survivors 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.280
 besides you see you get out and life 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:14.410
 remember fine but still leave 55 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.310
 percent boss I have nothing more 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.180
 that is, did not stay in the back circle kill and 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.900
 only here 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.200
 luck does not jump out without things and script 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.530
 very straight links and running ahead 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.400
 I will say that yes he will jump out and I can give you 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.740
 recommendations 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.510
 if you have me and you can 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.270
 use even a little bit to spend 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.090
 use energy because the law 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.280
 meanness he is 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.830
 did not use the mountains and you flew without 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.490
 did perform a little lesson here is how 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.600
 now I missed and could 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.870
 principle , I do not use you then 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 wrapped gone nowhere I was lucky 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.919
 the burs hit the point for some howling damage and 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.510
 and now there will be a victory and one more 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.840
 one moment is always better 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.030
 count as you can see i crawl on one 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.389
 point to file the boss straight from under 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.360
 him 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.830
 then many spend a lot of energy 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.220
 crawl from one point to another and 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:21.360
 so the fight is delayed playing 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:24.470
 easier in general, try to train 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.120
 try you succeed 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.610
