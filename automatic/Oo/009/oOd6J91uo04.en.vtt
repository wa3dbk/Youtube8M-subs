00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.670
 bra 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.349
 Stoner's simplest knot is not 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.839
 Son Mola, I'll show you now 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.729
 we do not need much 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.729
 4-fold cord for this conciliatory style of Mon Decor 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.339
 occupy 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.150
 I have Boehner now 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.770
 in order for the a1 abundant also in the elections in autumn the peak Schaaf 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.009
 Messern lighter more Brauckmann not to 4 4 b 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.140
 conditioned by always with that 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.440
 a stink-normal knot makes exactly smeared already prepared 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 with the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.740
 in he greeted 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.680
 in the thighs 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.100
 all the pinched 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.210
 properly tightened and already can make from 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.010
 with developments 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.410
 at the vip-logen 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.410
 one says eight times 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 that is one more or less it is with blows 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.760
 important though 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.820
 what you should pay attention to are wrapped up nicely 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.770
 I give today also just wrap a few windings 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.310
 you do not have to 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.540
 along with the way towards Semlits in the city percent through 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.750
 SC takes 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.750
 and we have succeeded ours 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.690
 we then pull the hacking from behind 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 on the string 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.140
 Yes of course 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 so what's the thigh 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.940
 pointing forward shows direction 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.370
 then you have to estimate 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.370
 how big is my kÃ¶del layer 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.900
 bundling my worm Cooper wounds are usually used a bit smaller 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.530
 Hook and trailer when lures I want the whole accordingly 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.789
 customized 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.789
 both Mainz layers happened in principle exactly the same 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.399
 the windings 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.999
 Again, I go back again and again the investigation 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.299
 and then here too 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.299
 same game 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.779
 with the way in the direction 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.029
 she goes direction so that Waltz 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.029
 I can not go down through it on a sample basis 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.899
 I had to do so 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.899
 So you mean 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.349
 I have my 4 4 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.299
 at the are 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.299
 at the hose 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.449
 several ways to tie the distinctive savings 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.769
 it just fits that way 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.129
 because so good grades 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.489
 is then always tightened through 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.619
 what do I do personally but not synonymous 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.109
 I do 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.969
 Railway breaks 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.569
 too many complicated knots burst 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.309
 but I'll show you that the next time
