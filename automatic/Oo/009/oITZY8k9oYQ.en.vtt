00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 he 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.449
 hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.609
 Yuri Stepanenko and in our today's 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.590
 review we talk to you about the motorcycle 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.590
 yamaha ybr 125 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.100
 I would like to talk a little bit about 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.930
 technical 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.930
 raisins of the vehicle 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.350
 for a cycle extremely simple extremely 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.960
 simple extremely easy and 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.730
 uncomplicated technically 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.989
 the simplest four-stroke engine 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.820
 125 cubic centimeters power it 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.820
 only ten horsepower 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:09.119
 at six thousand revolutions per minute 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.960
 maximum power allows you 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.450
 to lead 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 down the hill with a fair wind well somewhere in 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.439
 area a hundred kilometers an hour than you 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.530
 the harder, respectively, the maximum 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.080
 motorcycle speed will be less 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.450
 what else is the disc brake on the front axle 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.450
 let's go go to the front axle will look 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.510
 for those speeds with which it moves 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.550
 the motorcycle is basically missing him 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.310
 if the motor is more powerful 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.310
 naturally given brake 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.440
 cope will not be on the rear axle 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.440
 normal drum brake 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.900
 if we look at the right side 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.460
 engine we will see such a thing about 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.680
 which many have already forgotten 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.910
 kickstarter lever to 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.560
 run this bike we can bring back 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.700
 this thing and the motorcycle wound up 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.970
 perhaps on any modern 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.360
 a motorcycle from japan we will no longer see 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.550
 kickstarter put out the bike means 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.180
 what else is the simplest rear suspension with 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.880
 two shock absorbers on principle 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.740
 meets its characteristics that is 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.160
 if not to exceed the allowed speed 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.810
 if you do not overload this motorcycle and 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.550
 front suspension rear suspension will 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.280
 quite enough if you will 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.660
 use this bike like 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.390
 sports like racing don't be surprised 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.850
 to the fact that he will leave all the time 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.300
 out 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.830
 I would like to say a few words of his 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.780
 motorcycle itself technical 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.420
 component of the motor, we have already talked 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.000
 yes motor is very simple motor 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.090
 very reliable and perhaps the only 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.060
 weak point of this engine when 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.980
 rather heavy exploitation especially 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.830
 we must remember that this bike is 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.440
 bestseller for mother 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.080
 under severe light conditions 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.110
 so easily worn knot 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.650
 is the grip for that is 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.880
 month for 1 2 months with severe 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.550
 operating this node will have to change 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.280
 also oil change in crankcase total liter 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.190
 oils it is not much they so much 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.570
 beats afford and even lack 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.990
 full exactly oil filter ie 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:36.270
 just a mesh that can be removed 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.270
 clean then put back again 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.140
 took this bike on review dashing 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.780
 movement means having arrived I stopped 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.810
 did like this and realized that hooked 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.080
 air side stand no i looked 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.610
 here and see that she just broke off 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.550
 friends and what to do with it 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.350
 to this from the floor 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.600
 lately I can not hertz to 25 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.940
 collected in china yes of course it's good 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.080
 yes of course it's great but there is one 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.480
 nuance friends workmanship and 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.710
 assembly maybe even a motorcycle she 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.290
 of course suffered 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.780
 that is, basically what gripe 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.800
 complaints electrics complaints 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:26.660
 yamaha power system ybr125 is not so 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.660
 willing to start the cold he 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.199
 uneven keeps pace here and 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.590
 variable modes it is more dumb 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.990
 old carburetors motorcycles that are in 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.900
 generally gathered and remember of course were 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.520
 much more reliable means by suspension 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.949
 rear suspension 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.050
 it is almost eternal I must admit 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.900
 the date with her is not some heavy guys 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.150
 no rural roads are able and 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.070
 in this very suspension ditch by 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.900
 front suspension of course yes let in 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.840
 especially in the cold season if 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.650
 some kind of pits jumps jumps some 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.180
 use this bike like the first 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.729
 some there i don't know my dogs with there 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.669
 trading pierce the glands forks and 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.650
 squirrels and a fork emerges 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.250
 it means the suspended fluid gets on 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.510
 brake mechanism and yet passing and 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.510
 reducing braking performance 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.280
 how at one time joked about the Japanese 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.560
 scooter said you can fill a liter 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.340
 fuel goes a week well, about the same 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.430
 situations, that is to say, eat 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.040
 gasoline and this thing is very little again 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.110
 This fact is very much appreciated by people who 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:48.930
 These motorcycles use as 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:50.970
 educational friends we all know the most 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.480
 old and the fairy tale about the red hat 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.920
 who at the request of his mother pearls 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.160
 your favorite grandmothers patties 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.930
 thanks yamaha ybr125 her chrome 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.660
 the trunk I have this opportunity 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.840
 so I take this huge bag with 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.060
 pies and put on this trunk 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.860
 let it be small but enough 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.270
 capacious sports bikers are stone 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.270
 envy your garden friends 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.800
 wondering if we can handle lifting 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.800
 check it out now 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.510
 Moscow all times 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.940
 the city that makes a motorcycle 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.280
 difficult enough serious hello 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.590
 as practice shows motor power 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.670
 yamaha fazer 125 is not enough for 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.380
 comfortable 3 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.020
 they are on public roads in 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:06.320
 Moscow city if suddenly behind you and 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.210
 passenger is the dynamics of acceleration almost 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.650
 does not exceed the dynamics of acceleration of the very 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.780
 pillow with a trolley to 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.780
 which comes from the market with groceries home 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.430

 Many thanks to all those who did 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.610
 possible test of this motorcycle to those who 

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.190
 Invented this bike for those who released 

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.170
 the Chinese thank you so much 

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.330
 because this bike worked in 

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.670
 motorcycle school you pour the tail and into the mane 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.640
 drove back to china i will save at least 

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:11.720
 one copy 

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.720
