get two of these one on each side and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.830 
get two of these one on each side and
I'll<00:01:15.320> probably<00:01:15.590> Pat<00:01:16.010> it<00:01:16.160> with<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.340> blanket<00:01:16.840> so

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
I'll probably Pat it with a blanket so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.650 
I'll probably Pat it with a blanket so
that<00:01:17.960> way<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.950> doesn't<00:01:19.220> bounce<00:01:20.150> around<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
that way it doesn't bounce around the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.610 
that way it doesn't bounce around the
hitter<00:01:20.870> legs<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:22.430> hard<00:01:22.670> water<00:01:22.850> bottle<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
hitter legs the hard water bottle so the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.760 
hitter legs the hard water bottle so the
more<00:01:25.010> it's<00:01:25.790> stuffed<00:01:26.270> with<00:01:26.450> things<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.530> better

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
more it's stuffed with things the better

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.200 
more it's stuffed with things the better

because<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.530> really<00:02:37.920> haven't<00:02:38.070> tested<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.580> too

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
because I really haven't tested it too

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.050 
because I really haven't tested it too
much<00:02:39.350> with<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.380> full<00:02:40.650> load<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.640> see<00:02:41.850> if<00:02:41.940> she

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
much with a full load just to see if she

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.020 
much with a full load just to see if she
would<00:02:42.150> even<00:02:42.240> wear<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.540> before<00:02:43.020> once<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:44.030> she

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
would even wear it before once and she

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.490 
would even wear it before once and she
did<00:02:45.180> good<00:02:45.330> with<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.630> but<00:02:45.960> now<00:02:46.080> we<00:02:46.110> have<00:02:46.350> some

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
did good with that but now we have some

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.730 
did good with that but now we have some
weight<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:49.320> would<00:02:49.410> be<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> good

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
weight in it so this would be a good

00:02:49.740 --> 00:03:05.229 
weight in it so this would be a good

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
it's definitely wearing her out a little

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.449 
it's definitely wearing her out a little
