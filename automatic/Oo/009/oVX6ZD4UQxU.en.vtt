00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Hello everyone today decided to make a video 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.960
 scad on the Black Sea to know 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.369
 called tyrant this load load here 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.690
 This type is called harmful 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.480
 inserted load and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.820
 5 6 hooks of various sizes white 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.060
 colors brilliantly for example this one hook 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.619
 yes, but itâ€™s already big 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.850
 smaller hooks they are so short dad 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.850
 daughter saltpeter in my dream 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.490
 here is ivan or 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.490
 at iphone 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.260
 Click 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.720
 we are going to catch scad 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:49.530
 Alexander caught her fish and trained 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:52.380
 give me a bucket and take it off so Alexander 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.009
 per kilo the second time someone caught again 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.009
 but there is 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.640
 1 is normal than 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.870
 just not in the breakdown mark salty 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.239
 water you like his little salt and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.160
 are healthy 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.790
 good fishing and a little sex is not on 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.790
 keep a blog about 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:28.599
 shoot shoot the same half catch 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.660
 I caught a bit of fish 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:41.630
 on the echo sounder 12 the depth of the fish is almost no 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.849
 it means you need to change the place of fishing because 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.489
 that fish does not stand in the place of slaves 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.560
 moves if holod is silent means 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.980
 it is practically useless to melt 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.620
 understand as if by chance the fish we want 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.590
 catch no little fish much therefore us 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.959
 need to look i got off ferrino picks up 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.769
 just see what I say there 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.480
 few now we see silver 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.480
 pick it up already the surgeon is taking off 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.400
 need 2 things 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.400
 normal size in principle 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.920
 Here is such a fishing on the black sea 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.319
 shores of Abkhazia 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.709
 Here Alexander caught two more fish from 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.709
 even it was 3 1 broke let's take it off 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.800
 all the people on the tune hold my 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:45.580
 funds removed 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:50.140
 set to sick normal puts to 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.140
 so 2 to 3 rubles a surprise is already quite good 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.890
 depth of 15 meters half of which is 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.040
 present 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.590
 all the top all the top 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.900
 fish is another cast with your ego 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.810
 him and quietly straight ahead 1 2 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:20.989
 break is necessary early this is all necessary 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:25.550
 boat prone to fall on vacation for half an hour 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.590
 fishing now me and the place itself it is 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.640
 we caught known fisher of these thorn 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:36.340
 or follow me scatter tip yes she doesn't 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.340
 pricked was wearing what I survived 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:47.969
 and Sasha goes up again 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:51.599
 much now we will see there 1 for 2 or 3 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:54.050
 there big everything under water seems 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:58.309
 big really never big 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:03.919
 fish salad rio 2 broke it fell 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:07.830
 2 little fish left shows 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:12.319
 a wave has risen a little already soon 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.319
 let's go home he is just uncomfortable 

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:19.349
 shows so you can shorter sense 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.709
 fishing in the next record to throw 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:26.240
 fishing rod if you don't know where the fish can be 

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:26.240
 to the bottom and quietly raise 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.350
 just wants support probe fish 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.120
 if you feel fish , too, a lot of fish already 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.920
 You can safely lift completely if 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.110
 while there 1 2 understand this little by little and 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.010
 fish can eat on steel hooks then 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.620
 eat basically you can catch fish 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.100
 as many hooks as there are 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.100
 tip 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.720
 all all all all all what you see me 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.720
 probably include 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.590
 naturally navigate to the echo sounder 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.940
 so that soon we will show how to 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.940
 probability of catching very small
