00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.610
 we complete drawing 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.240
 air the centennial of publication very different work of a guy 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.399
 called bordeaux 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:16.139
 divided in the parks as a woman a little more beautiful and more 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:21.100
 than the phenomena seen since 200 years ago. 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.050
 he divided small ports into small territories 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.930
 forest of every function was in a place here we are in a moment 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.220
 good 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.270
 almost on the edge 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.060
 one hundred years later 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.670
 and demonstrates that it speaks the function in the brain 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.030
 it is not determined geographically 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.130
 it is determined according to the demands of the task 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.940
 partnership 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.280
 so if a person loses sight 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.360
 and she has to navigate the world without the visual system she says tanya 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.060
 hahaha the patio attribute 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.480
 all the body including and until the sunset what we have to show 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.549
 the necessity 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.810
 activision the casting distribution 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.630
 the function of 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.230
 There are a lot of people but it's not 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.990
 she is probabilistic 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.200
 and she is well 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.230
 evidently that there are cases of specialization 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.930
 why some of these functions are multidimensional have several dimensions 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.110
 for you define the function of a brain area 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.130
 the moment the world changes as the brain has to adapt the world 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.760
 to understand and make up 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.240
 the statistics of reality that the reality of each of us 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.770
 these pieces these odds world 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 quickly 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.219
 Brazil has aroused great interest. 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.400
 - I wear off European and American who so wanting to come 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.350
 establish partnerships with Brazilian laboratories 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.100
 because of course Brazil has 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.040
 mass has a human talent 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.039
 indisputable but he has 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.540
 after that the nowadays that so 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.350
 in the center of argentina without hesitating the brazil the date is forming a 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.850
 great source of food in the world 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.670
 she will be 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 doubtless some of the projections have recently been 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.240
 will only become your upward curve 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.939
 squid 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.379
 in brazilian 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.829
 of the world has the world's largest biodiversity reserve 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.770
 I have the potential to become the first country in the world 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.439
 to get rid of the rent 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.419
 big woman 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.789
 to transform a source of income and an alternative 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.920
 I think we have a potential here 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.420
 transform our society into one of the great powers the title 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.119
 that 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.349
 it's needed 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.689
 pay the price it requires 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.269
 a political prisoner the title 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.589
 culture 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.029
 thought nothing more wrong 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.179
 than a small electric wave of mine 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:49.429
 miley points 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:51.569
 spreading through the brain 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.519
 on a time scale of milliseconds 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.889
 is a thought nothing more than a complete pact that the magnetic field 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.579
 nut entrance 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.509
 it is very difficult to measure why it was so difficult in day with the tottenham 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.219
 What we did was 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.629
 to discover 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.370
 is it possible to law the collection of electric signal poles 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:16.819
 is not there is that electric signals control of the motors 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.549
 here are able to reproduce 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.059
 on the arm a robotic leg 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.499
 the apparent intention of the author of that brain that is producing that 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:28.049
 actor thinking 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.459
 we simply 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.129
 we pull out 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.109
 we seek to become law 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.219
 they in digital language all this very fast at the same speed 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.489
 I want to win with an electric command to get out of the saints. 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.230
 reproducing a mechanical computational artifact 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.909
 the intention of the author in that sector 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.669
 while now winning our recently 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.149
 we developed this signal directly with the celebrated 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:58.049
 one more interesting thing said that the body passed has no relevance whatsoever 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.589
 because the pain center directly 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:02.779
 then this mechanical artifact 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:06.059
 ansa the veteran in the case a robotic leg 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.769
 in a single device not only send a message to advertise the way 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.619
 that he wants 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:15.039
 you do not understand how you piloted it 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.150
 Many kids 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
 what it calls a brain-machine interface 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.620
 God is a need for retrofitting if we have to explain where we 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.590
 apparently there is an intrinsic need of our 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.540
 his brain 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.770
 tell a story 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.050
 he has a theory about his former team the brain is a great simulator to be 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.139
 covert 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.490
 the complete reality 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.689
 the rest of us and the personal dengue accident do not listen to a simulation 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.189
 clearly we have evidence 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.159
 but she brings a lot of evidence to that. 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.270
 but they simulate reality 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.280
 the whole reality that we build everything our defense history is 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.650
 trying this 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.770
 she has to have a logical explanation of one of us see 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.809
 I think it is in this field that 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.809
 the god's mansion of religion 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.020
 no one believed 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.020
 Parkinson's disease was a disease of 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.129
 temporary leaves 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.739
 which we have discovered from this work which may be one of the 

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:21.109
 The most important basic conditions is that it is detected in 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.220
 pathological neural activity appear in this structure 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.129
 the intention of votes of the basilica 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.629
 beyond the collapse in the sector for burnt and did not return 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.940
 and when we start to look 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.539
 the records of these stationary animals can not be very violent and very fast 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.419
 we begin to see that it looks like a 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.620
 everything led to believe 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.710
 that brain activity looks like an epileptic seizure 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.569
 but if the seal with something that these ten years ago of xingu and crisis patterns 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.020
 epilepsy for a long time looking pro the electrical records event to 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.880
 climate crisis and develop and when I looked at this I and the Romulus 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.150
 which is the first tournament 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.760
 we arrived and it is part of what was practiced treated as if it were a 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.779
 epilepsy crisis 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:06.219
 So, if that's what we're getting at 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:09.729
 is that the advantage of stimulating that behind the spinal cord after five 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.599
 years on the first bike, but I still 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.990
 much easier 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.020
 I'm being a lot cheaper 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.810
 know anything if it can change quickly but the great advantage 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:24.110
 according to the theoretical view that changes the way of looking at the sky 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.229
 and see if you try to treat a little place what is what the previous theory 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:31.889
 I thought there was a little place in the Senate that 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.189
 loss of the role of dopamine 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:39.450
 while stimulating the same spinal cord you are treating the whole circuit 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.219
 then in this case besides peace signed in September 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:43.669
 temporal 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.130
 It happens with this guy with a type of epilepsy 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.390
 she becomes a systemic disease of the circuit returned with everything 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:52.569
 after that is that others are change 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.819
 radikal of how you look percent and nothing happens in the brain brazil surf pro
