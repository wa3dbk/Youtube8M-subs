are well taken care of it's not like
they're<00:01:30.460> came<00:01:31.460> or<00:01:31.820> you're<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.060> an<00:01:32.210> area<00:01:32.660> where

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
they're came or you're in an area where

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.290 
they're came or you're in an area where
this<00:01:33.140> that's<00:01:33.710> not<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:33.920> case<00:01:34.040> at<00:01:34.310> all<00:01:34.430> these

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
this that's not the case at all these

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.910 
this that's not the case at all these
animals<00:01:35.540> are<00:01:35.810> just<00:01:35.990> Wow's<00:01:36.200> once<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.770> while

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
animals are just Wow's once in a while

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.270 
animals are just Wow's once in a while
the<00:01:37.820> difference<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:39.110> offense<00:01:39.440> allows

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the difference is is that offense allows

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.160 
the difference is is that offense allows
them<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.610> not<00:01:40.970> get<00:01:41.180> shot<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.690> allows<00:01:41.900> them<00:01:42.110> to

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
them to not get shot it allows them to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.790 
them to not get shot it allows them to
mature<00:01:42.530> into<00:01:42.830> an<00:01:43.340> older<00:01:43.550> age<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
mature into an older age and the the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.370 
mature into an older age and the the
fair<00:01:46.070> chase<00:01:46.280> issue<00:01:46.580> i<00:01:46.790> think<00:01:47.210> that's<00:01:47.450> someone

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
fair chase issue i think that's someone
