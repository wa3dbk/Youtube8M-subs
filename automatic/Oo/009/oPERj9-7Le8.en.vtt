 hello girls and boys today we are going to see the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.069
 truth about the autism of Leon Messi 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.950
 t 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.820
 You have probably seen some 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.369
 post what you have heard 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.500
 comment that the football player lionel 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.500
 mesi suffers a type of autism 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.770
 the rumors that the player suffers a 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.629
 type of mild autism or the so-called 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.079
 Asperger has caused a great sensation 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.600
 in society for some people 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.420
 this has been hopeful news 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.089
 for example mothers who have children with 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.909
 the condition of autism find a 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.070
 example to follow and a hope that 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.010
 your child can become a person 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.800
 talented and successful as is the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.100
 mesic player however for others it has 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.129
 been an insult a blow to your ego the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.320
 hear that your favorite player suffers 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.200
 of autism for people who have 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.619
 taken this news as an insult 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.429
 comes from your own ideas of what 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.570
 what does it mean the condition of autism 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.600
 unfortunately there is a lot 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.390
 misinformation about this subject something 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.179
 very important is to know all beings 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.369
 humans are different in the same way 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.010
 condition of asperger people 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.070
 can share certain characteristics 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.800
 but they can differ in others what 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.770
 I try to say is that every person with 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.380
 the condition of asperger is unique there 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.870
 have to be clear that the asperger is a 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.390
 condition within autism and is 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.060
 also known as mild autism 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.000
 some basic differences are by 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.820
 example that in autism the coefficient 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.640
 intellectual is below normal 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.280
 There may be a delay in the appearance of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.170
 language in general do not have any 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.840
 obsessive interest with some 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.540
 behavior and in some of the cases 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.210
 they are people who will depend on the 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.670
 care of another human being for all his 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.130
 life instead in the condition of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.250
 mild autism or the asperger the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.360
 IQ is above 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.670
 of normal 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.160
 the language appears in its normal time 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.820
 and the person has an interest 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.200
 obsessive high level with some 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.350
 behavior and they can become 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.120
 completely independent people in 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.580
 general the causes of autism is 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.280
 still under investigation but some of 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.409
 these are the genetic alterations that 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.020
 affect more men than 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.110
 women 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.840
 or the lack of oxygen at birth and what 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.260
 everyone wants to know is where does the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.540
 controversy of the supposed autism of month and 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.420
 everything starts when a journalist 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.680
 begins to look at the 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.380
 behaviors of this player by 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.350
 example that avoids talking in front of 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.380
 cameras is affected by the 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.230
 lights of the photographs and in several 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.260
 interviews avoids eye contact 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.650
 besides, sometimes he has been seen with 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.620
 the lost look to this is added his 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.470
 great interest and obsession he employs in the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.960
 court at the time of playing messi is 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.570
 considered one of the most players 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.380
 world football highlights 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:36.530
 when the ball is concentrated on 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.420
 she and her only mission is to play for 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.910
 win all this that we just 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.340
 mentioning are precisely some 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.740
 characteristics of the yards 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.560
 people with this condition have 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.510
 difficulty for social contact and not 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.870
 they can recognize them 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.390
 they only detect literal things without 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.780
 However, they have a great capacity to 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.780
 get involved in obsessive routines until 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.810
 become geniuses and experts in the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.049
 area of â€‹â€‹interest also present a 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.150
 unusual sensitivity to stimuli 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.909
 sensory for example can you 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.860
 disturb the light the loud sounds the 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.530
 textures these were the 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.959
 characteristics that were considered 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.479
 to declare that messi has the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.240
 Asperger condition however 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.729
 there are other characteristics such as 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.419
 example the difficulty of the skill 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.210
 fine motor and gross the inability to 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.180
 work as a team in the case of messi 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.650
 does not share the latter 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.169
 characteristics it is clear that it has 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.900
 excellent motor skills and that in 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.570
 effect belongs to a team where it is 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.210
 need to have the ability to play 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.550
 thinking of others this rumor has 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.210
 sustained for several years and people 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.360
 they have taken it as a truthful news 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.120
 news was highly credible because 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.180
 the condition of 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.580
 the berger with great minds and people 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.130
 who have become geniuses in their area 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.530
 of interest we have the example of one of 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.380
 the best bobby chess players 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.870
 fischer even isaac newton the 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.509
 scientist who proposed the theory of 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.300
 gravity these and other great geniuses 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:26.270
 have been linked to the condition of 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.849
 so see the discipline the talent the 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.970
 Introverted personality and shyness 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.639
 of the player messi has been linked with 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.370
 mild autism or the asberg but the 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.070
 truth is that this does not confirm that this 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.770
 player in effect have this condition 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.800
 in the case of lionel messi until the 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.530
 moment their asperger status have 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.720
 been just mere speculations since 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.539
 this player has never received a 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.300
 official diagnosis on the other hand is 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:59.470
 important to know that in many cases of 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.789
 asperger or mild autism that have passed 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.360
 unnoticed by their ability to 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.669
 adjustment 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.189
 that is society and have a life 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.039
 completely normal which never 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:12.680
 they have been formally diagnosed 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:15.259
 tell me what you think can be month and one 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.479
 of these unnoticed cases or 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.229
 he is simply a person with a great 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:23.360
 talent and an introverted personality
