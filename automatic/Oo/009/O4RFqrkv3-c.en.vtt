00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.870
 florist 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.400
 welcome your breed to a new one 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.510
 my complete you of course on call or 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.559
 duty ghost 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.279
 actually I was going to make more 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.540
 to play pictures of fire but I have 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.099
 I still have that inside I have it 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.920
 sent to sony and sony are for 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.750
 yeah win oh shit 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.039
 wajo he stood in himself and culture 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.330
 me another side within a week 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.130
 get him back marrum I still have him 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.560
 still not so I can still be you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.780
 no pedophile, of course 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.949
 Rosary can be uploaded as a mess 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.839
 but what I can do is tasty 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.010
 more preferably, is a mess with the vector vector 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:40.379
 use the journal on the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.879
 medium green button and the shrinkage 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.940
 and catchment 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.829
 and of course it turned out to be the bullets 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.450
 become stronger at least so that the bullet 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.399
 stay stronger if you have some longer 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.930
 ship distances so you didn't chose 10 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.180
 shooting long distances and beyond 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.949
 I have set up a script so that the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.230
 vector very little week becomes the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.750
 Vector anyway has little but rico 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 sometimes on this weapon once in the air 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.780
 sometimes all at once which rico real 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.580
 just nothing to a pigeon against what 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 the fuck but that is against drama 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.390
 in between I deliberately have a squeeze 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.490
 put it in so that the whines each 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.810
 maybe what is not always is that 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.880
 it seemed unusually removed by the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.770
 shrink attachment sm if is where you own 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.390
 of course still a bit with it 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.950
 tinkering but don't feel like it 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.450
 You can shop straight ahead 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.550
 so set it up so of course 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 but just what you want and I wanted there 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.250
 the frames enough my neighbor 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.970
 says perfect jump again for call or 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.170
 duty but o shit yes yes yes but I think 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.550
 a vector is also a very chill I had 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.899
 of course you are on the camel 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.349
 have bought for two whole euros 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.520
 floow2 euros become the camel and you 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.840
 effects can also be used again 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.970
 in comparative colors the jacket that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.380
 naturally plays the app store and 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.270
 effector are the most used weapons 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.959
 in comparative call of duty both 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.780
 whole chilling weapons only close 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.060
 just 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.070
 thank you so much he dust you off course 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.659
 find the vector chiller or women 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.070
 if did not see coming but that guy or 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.659
 find your effector chiller on the emt oh 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.820
 So then you have to take care of yourself 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.750
 check moment but I think it effect 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.460
 very nice job 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.440
 but now I know this game for a while 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.540
 beautiful in a beautiful way 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.920
 are going to win guys so come on try 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.670
 as soon as is possible of course to 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.110
 to grab 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.690
 it usually does not go very quickly 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.400
 mug of tea because the moral is great for it 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.290
 in a 4 especially pot in 10 m it is you 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.910
 has actually been built large and 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.959
 moss formation ground for 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.570
 But of course that would just be the folders 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.310
 from call of duty ghost i want effe 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.630
 look where everyone shit guys because 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.800
 I just get a lot of kills on one 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.390
 side 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.530
 but now i'm already sitting there seriously 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.470
 can ewout 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.700
 I thought I was on the other side 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.739
 I can no longer pick up any cue 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.300
 boys but there running training 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.959
 thank you i don't know where they all are 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.980
 sit it down that can be a shiny the race it 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.959
 kempen 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.120
 can two sign in i dodge everyone 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.470
 because I just walk out so I think 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.390
 rather that second who thinks that the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.190
 core is that above the pan shop 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.660
 but just search man and visit and 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.709
 fit where everyone is 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.049
 we can get them once you thought 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.709
 nice size to shrink here 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.970
 ohh nice spot just nothing like 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.010
 I was now mobile that 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.150
 probably just won't die there 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.769
 that he caught him another kill 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.910
 but i saw him walking they can we 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.500
 of course also beautiful children who walk 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.340
 to cut the ribbons above 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.280
 do you come down yes no what what what 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.290
 the fuck i already saw coming in shots 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.510
 before he was there and he what on me 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.239
 little um that guy and 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.370
 boys are in my back now too bad 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.370
 size so the one on top 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.200
 yes if you wow deep what a beast 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.510
 That makes provider Mr. Sponk come 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.060
 then do n't come so handy from you either 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.950
 the good move young whining can funfair 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.019
 is there really a let's go sit really 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.519
 hard just too kemp look they are your hand 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.920
 core of it is the quiet corner where they are 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.140
 hand cam from when i hear something then jump 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.609
 I go down and that's going to be annoying 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.709
 man but luckily i hear you of course 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.989
 so it is now a matter of who 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.160
 has the best headset and I hope so 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.470
 that is 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.070
 because there is another one 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.290

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.110

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.329

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.310
 for his sake that you sit there also what 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.480
 from another I check all the sun 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.640
 not no nice for a nice look 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.590
 kitchen man look hood who think of it 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.640
 i think i can curl pretty on it 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.990
 say nice throat 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.090
 we just keep the port a beautiful one 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.380
 span young gay 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.670
 and now we have to pay attention man at 9 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.790
 kills i don't want to bed too much together 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.930
 of course but sometimes house that's and 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.150
 thinks of a blue what was that for 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.290
 that and that was a nice kill 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.840
 we must now continue to become 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.310
 they nice temple where we are now 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.780
 will be able to keep pace when it comes to sticking 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.210
 7 kills and a game of good 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.620
 got on people in bridge 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.470
 yes guys i have my better etchings from 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.900
 you because I hear your card running 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.550
 that's lucky you for me because of that 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.860
 I could of course hear the cam show 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.419
 don't walk that they walk but like the 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.820
 duckling movement was my weapon switch 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.580
 how and as a looper your paul 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.440
 paul and hear is all young and that is 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.910
 as important in call of duty ghosts as 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.770
 in call or duty ghost 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.630
 the footsteps were not as good as they were 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.650
 are so you have m could not hear 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.940
 walk 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.200
 of course if it ate numbers 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.090
 how is it anyway but most 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.440
 people do n't use that in this game 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.930
 so if footsteps were not that good 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.760
 as a design well it is never anyway 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.950
 really good scores 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.510
 what always there is worst kemp you are and 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.919
 by those footsteps and because of you 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.229
 maybe a good it will stop you 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.550
 competent european three tons and astro 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.919
 but no one butt as long as you 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.180
 just a little sound did you hear 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.130
 that just in the can you so that 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.870
 you can 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.140
 then just turn so 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:47.210
 and the game is really just really bad 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.710
 many percent what revolves around sound and if 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.350
 from is not as good as it was 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.700
 this game was very big twenty times 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.850
 been harder and there is another one 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.990
 ams 100 3 kills make man 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.080
 because now perish watch out because I want 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.390
 actually not dying anymore but good 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.820
 paying attention means that you have to go every corner 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.000
 check if someone is sitting still 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.770
 in here 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.960
 pity guys like that ferme they soon the 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.210
 battery 12 camp often played but I 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.440
 I also killed a park 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.990
 now it is just searching but watching is possible 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.050
 in a my knife and what I have learned is 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.170
 if an aimes state then there can be an mri 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.970
 sit around what 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.200
 holy shit i knew you the dixon big 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.330
 range on man

 shoot that nut through the door oh he 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.540
 shoot 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.930
 It also becomes a nice span call of duty saw 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.490
 there won't be a killcam that kms fuck oh thanks 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.350
 you did that msi shot up 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.080

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.370
 wall on the other side i walked to the 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.020
 other side and I wanted myself 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.250
