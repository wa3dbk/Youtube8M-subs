00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.290 
are actually just behind the eyes within
the<00:00:33.680> feathers<00:00:34.070> which<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.220> really<00:00:34.700> hard<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:35.000> see

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
the feathers which is really hard to see

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.440 
the feathers which is really hard to see
and<00:00:35.620> when<00:00:36.620> it's<00:00:36.770> hunting<00:00:37.220> it<00:00:37.880> can<00:00:38.120> actually

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
and when it's hunting it can actually

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.510 
and when it's hunting it can actually
hear<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.020> sounds<00:00:39.500> of<00:00:39.590> small<00:00:39.950> mammals<00:00:40.160> on<00:00:40.489> the

hear the sounds of small mammals on the
ground<00:00:40.820> below<00:00:41.090> which<00:00:41.270> is<00:00:41.420> incredible<00:00:42.050> its

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
ground below which is incredible its

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.520 
ground below which is incredible its
flight<00:00:43.130> is<00:00:43.399> very<00:00:43.940> very<00:00:44.300> quiet<00:00:44.719> partly<00:00:45.379> because

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
flight is very very quiet partly because

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.919 
flight is very very quiet partly because
the<00:00:45.800> feathers<00:00:46.219> are<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:46.550> soft<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.179> the<00:00:47.510> body<00:00:47.719> is

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
the feathers are so soft and the body is

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.020 
the feathers are so soft and the body is
so<00:00:48.170> light<00:00:48.469> it<00:00:48.769> passes<00:00:49.519> through<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.879> air

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
so light it passes through the air

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.540 
so light it passes through the air
really<00:00:50.300> really<00:00:50.690> gently<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.649> legs<00:00:51.949> are<00:00:52.190> really

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
really really gently the legs are really

really really gently the legs are really
really<00:00:52.850> long<00:00:53.030> which<00:00:53.390> is<00:00:53.420> an<00:00:53.690> adaptation<00:00:53.870> for

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
really long which is an adaptation for

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.009 
really long which is an adaptation for
diving<00:00:54.890> into<00:00:55.489> long<00:00:55.910> grass<00:00:56.179> and<00:00:56.510> catching<00:00:56.899> the

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
small mammals which they feed on the

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.479 
small mammals which they feed on the
eyesight<00:00:59.870> is<00:01:00.079> amazing<00:01:00.589> as<00:01:00.710> well<00:01:00.890> barn<00:01:01.280> owls

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
eyesight is amazing as well barn owls

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.910 
eyesight is amazing as well barn owls
are<00:01:01.670> able<00:01:02.120> to<00:01:02.149> detect<00:01:02.690> movement<00:01:02.960> when<00:01:03.739> there's

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
are able to detect movement when there's

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.730 
are able to detect movement when there's
hardly<00:01:04.250> any<00:01:04.550> light<00:01:04.930> it's<00:01:05.930> just<00:01:06.320> such<00:01:06.530> an

hardly any light it's just such an
incredible<00:01:07.280> bird<00:01:07.520> but<00:01:08.330> unfortunately<00:01:09.320> there

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
incredible bird but unfortunately there

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.110 
incredible bird but unfortunately there
are<00:01:09.740> some<00:01:09.920> problems<00:01:10.400> with<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.760> barn<00:01:10.970> owl

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
are some problems with the barn owl

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.080 
are some problems with the barn owl
because<00:01:11.300> of<00:01:11.690> these<00:01:11.840> specializations<00:01:13.090> adapted

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
because of these specializations adapted

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.340 
because of these specializations adapted
for<00:01:14.180> hunting<00:01:14.270> from<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.720> air<00:01:14.870> it<00:01:15.020> has<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.260> be

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
for hunting from the air it has to be

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.380 
for hunting from the air it has to be
very<00:01:15.560> light<00:01:15.890> barn<00:01:16.400> owls<00:01:16.520> can't<00:01:16.880> but<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.180> lot

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
very light barn owls can't but on a lot

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.610 
very light barn owls can't but on a lot
of<00:01:17.510> fat<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.900> help<00:01:18.050> them<00:01:18.170> get<00:01:18.320> through<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
of fat to help them get through the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.580 
of fat to help them get through the
winter<00:01:18.800> and<00:01:19.430> also<00:01:20.030> its<00:01:20.720> feathers<00:01:21.260> which<00:01:21.410> are

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
winter and also its feathers which are

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.620 
winter and also its feathers which are
so<00:01:21.770> soft<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.310> not<00:01:22.550> particularly<00:01:22.910> waterproof

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
so soft and not particularly waterproof

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.450 
so soft and not particularly waterproof
so<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.870> barn<00:01:24.140> owl<00:01:24.290> can't<00:01:24.590> hunt<00:01:24.830> during<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.280> rain

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
so a barn owl can't hunt during the rain

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.300 
so a barn owl can't hunt during the rain
and<00:01:25.760> so<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.930> weather<00:01:27.230> has<00:01:27.500> an<00:01:27.620> effect<00:01:27.980> food

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
and so the weather has an effect food

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.010 
and so the weather has an effect food
shortage<00:01:28.700> has<00:01:28.850> an<00:01:28.970> effect<00:01:29.330> in<00:01:29.510> numbers<00:01:29.900> of

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
shortage has an effect in numbers of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.050 
shortage has an effect in numbers of
barn<00:01:30.230> owls<00:01:30.440> go<00:01:30.500> up<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:30.950> down<00:01:31.130> tremendously<00:01:31.850> in

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
barn owls go up and down tremendously in

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.350 
barn owls go up and down tremendously in
response<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.630> these<00:01:32.780> environmental<00:01:33.140> changes

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
response to these environmental changes

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.000 
response to these environmental changes
it's<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.570> sad<00:01:35.780> fact<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:36.440> barn<00:01:36.680> owls<00:01:36.890> have

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
it's a sad fact that barn owls have

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.250 
it's a sad fact that barn owls have
declined<00:01:37.550> tremendously<00:01:38.240> particularly<00:01:39.020> since

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
declined tremendously particularly since

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.770 
declined tremendously particularly since
world<00:01:39.530> war<00:01:39.740> ii<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.490> landscape<00:01:41.120> upon<00:01:41.420> which<00:01:41.600> we

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
world war ii the landscape upon which we

world war ii the landscape upon which we
all<00:01:41.900> depend<00:01:42.260> has<00:01:42.500> changed<00:01:42.920> tremendously<00:01:43.100> and

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
all depend has changed tremendously and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.820 
all depend has changed tremendously and
barn<00:01:44.510> owls<00:01:44.690> have<00:01:44.810> declined<00:01:45.260> because<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.680> a

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
barn owls have declined because of a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.560 
barn owls have declined because of a
reduction<00:01:46.160> in<00:01:46.460> food<00:01:46.730> supply<00:01:47.120> because<00:01:47.450> of

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
reduction in food supply because of

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.990 
reduction in food supply because of
intensive<00:01:48.080> agriculture<00:01:48.830> loss<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.490> hedgerows
