00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
research she came upon spirit attachment

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.420 
research she came upon spirit attachment
and<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.600> not<00:00:18.779> called<00:00:19.109> spirit<00:00:19.560> attachment<00:00:20.250> in

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
and it's not called spirit attachment in

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.130 
and it's not called spirit attachment in
the<00:00:20.880> clinical<00:00:21.420> sense<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:21.869> called

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the clinical sense it's called

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.160 
the clinical sense it's called
possession<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
possession so I think that it's a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.150 
possession so I think that it's a
liberal<00:00:25.710> use<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.849> word<00:00:27.000> possession

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
liberal use of the word possession

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
liberal use of the word possession
typically<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> possession<00:00:29.730> would<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.300> where

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
typically a possession would be where

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.610 
typically a possession would be where
someone<00:00:31.289> has<00:00:31.439> an<00:00:31.560> alcoholic<00:00:32.160> blackout<00:00:32.340> or

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
someone has an alcoholic blackout or

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.650 
someone has an alcoholic blackout or
multiple<00:00:34.620> personality<00:00:35.399> disorder<00:00:35.579> however<00:00:36.239> if

multiple personality disorder however if

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.479 
multiple personality disorder however if
we<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.960> get<00:00:37.170> past<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.829> liberal<00:00:38.219> use<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
we can get past the liberal use of

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.049
