all<00:00:02.900> right<00:00:03.110> this<00:00:03.350> is<00:00:03.590> the<00:00:04.130> first<00:00:04.760> electric<00:00:05.360> to

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
all right this is the first electric to

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.110 
all right this is the first electric to
go<00:00:05.540> hurt<00:00:05.810> that<00:00:06.109> I<00:00:06.350> built

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
go hurt that I built

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.870 
go hurt that I built
the<00:00:09.120> card<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.630> here<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.170> go<00:00:10.290> 40<00:00:11.220> miles<00:00:11.490> per<00:00:11.670> hour

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the card is here to go 40 miles per hour

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.539 
the card is here to go 40 miles per hour
and<00:00:12.299> it<00:00:13.139> gets<00:00:13.350> there<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.799> little<00:00:14.040> over<00:00:14.250> three

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
and it gets there in a little over three

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.320 
and it gets there in a little over three
seconds<00:00:15.890> before<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.190> go<00:00:17.340> demonstrate<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
seconds before you go demonstrate the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.670 
seconds before you go demonstrate the
card<00:00:18.539> I'm<00:00:18.690> just<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> talk<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> little<00:00:19.500> bit

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
card I'm just going to talk a little bit

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.060 
card I'm just going to talk a little bit
about<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:20.160> components<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:22.230> heat

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
about the components so we have heat

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.060 
about the components so we have heat
sealed<00:00:23.789> lead-acid<00:00:24.029> batteries<00:00:24.839> they're<00:00:25.619> 12

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
sealed lead-acid batteries they're 12

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.320 
sealed lead-acid batteries they're 12
volts<00:00:26.429> and<00:00:26.640> 20<00:00:27.119> amp<00:00:27.300> hours<00:00:27.599> each<00:00:28.970> now<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.150> have

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
volts and 20 amp hours each now we have

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.260 
volts and 20 amp hours each now we have
four<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:31.740> originally<00:00:32.220> we<00:00:32.640> had<00:00:32.669> six<00:00:33.150> in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
four and back originally we had six in

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.140 
four and back originally we had six in
the<00:00:33.390> back<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> had<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.230> move<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.560> up<00:00:34.770> front

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
the back but we had to move to up front

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.030 
the back but we had to move to up front
because<00:00:36.150> of<00:00:36.450> weight<00:00:36.750> distribution<00:00:36.900> so<00:00:37.829> now<00:00:37.980> we

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
because of weight distribution so now we

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.610 
because of weight distribution so now we
have<00:00:38.220> a<00:00:38.250> four<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> back<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.350> more<00:00:40.559> on

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
have a four in the back and for more on

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.569 
have a four in the back and for more on
the<00:00:40.710> front

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the front

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.450 
the front
the<00:00:41.910> batteries<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.420> wired<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the batteries are wired so that the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.720 
the batteries are wired so that the
system<00:00:44.940> voltage<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.750> 48<00:00:46.469> volts<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.460> have

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
system voltage is 48 volts so we have

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.660 
system voltage is 48 volts so we have
two<00:00:48.690> sets<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.260> four<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.890> series<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.550> then

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
two sets of four in series and then

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.020 
two sets of four in series and then
those<00:00:50.850> two<00:00:50.879> sets<00:00:51.390> are<00:00:51.629> wired<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.230> parallel

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
those two sets are wired in parallel

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.759 
those two sets are wired in parallel

to<00:01:02.789> 20<00:01:03.090> horsepower<00:01:03.390> peak<00:01:04.700> the<00:01:05.700> controller

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to 20 horsepower peak the controller

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.140 
to 20 horsepower peak the controller
that<00:01:06.480> we<00:01:06.630> used<00:01:06.870> is<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.230> just<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.980> standard<00:01:08.430> golf

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
that we used is a just a standard golf

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.580 
that we used is a just a standard golf
cart<00:01:09.480> controller<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.080> an<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.290> tracks

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
cart controller it's an all tracks

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.290 
cart controller it's an all tracks
controller<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
controller this is one of the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.150 
controller this is one of the
high-performance<00:01:13.200> versions<00:01:13.680> though<00:01:13.920> it's

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
high-performance versions though it's

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.510 
high-performance versions though it's
programmable<00:01:15.620> and<00:01:16.620> it's<00:01:17.010> 48<00:01:17.850> volts<00:01:18.270> 400<00:01:18.930> amps

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
programmable and it's 48 volts 400 amps

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.370 
programmable and it's 48 volts 400 amps
so<00:01:20.520> when<00:01:20.730> we<00:01:20.880> first<00:01:21.150> we're<00:01:21.990> doing<00:01:22.170> some

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
so when we first we're doing some

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.230 
so when we first we're doing some
testing<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.950> cart<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.430> cart<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:23.730> very<00:01:23.940> fast

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
testing the cart the cart was very fast

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.540 
testing the cart the cart was very fast
with<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.630> controller<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.410> we<00:01:26.160> realized

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
with that controller but we realized

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.100 
with that controller but we realized
that<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.910> controller<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.750> limiting

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that the controller was the limiting

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
that the controller was the limiting
factors<00:01:28.620> so<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.010> added<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.820> feature<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
factors so we added this feature of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.110 
factors so we added this feature of
goose<00:01:30.660> which<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.260> it<00:01:31.410> what<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.370> is<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.940> an

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
goose which to it what that is is an

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.180 
goose which to it what that is is an
inert<00:01:33.690> amp<00:01:34.140> solenoid<00:01:34.650> which<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.160> right

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
inert amp solenoid which you see right

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.150 
inert amp solenoid which you see right
here<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.760> this<00:01:36.270> solenoid<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:37.620> you<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
here and this solenoid when you when you

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.550 
here and this solenoid when you when you
hit<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.730> button<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.480> opens<00:01:39.660> up<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.080> solenoid

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
hit this button it opens up the solenoid

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.790 
hit this button it opens up the solenoid
and<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.100> bypasses<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> speed<00:01:43.140> controller<00:01:43.620> and

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
and it bypasses the speed controller and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.770 
and it bypasses the speed controller and
basically<00:01:44.160> wires<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.850> batteries<00:01:45.270> directly

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
basically wires the batteries directly

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.980 
basically wires the batteries directly
to<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> motor<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:48.330> car<00:01:48.510> goes<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.840> lot

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to the motor and the car goes a lot

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.170 
to the motor and the car goes a lot
faster<00:01:49.230> so<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> lot<00:01:50.430> faster<00:01:50.640> with<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
faster so it's a lot faster with the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.250 
faster so it's a lot faster with the
boosts<00:01:51.540> which<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:52.500> demonstrate<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.160> later

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
boosts which will demonstrate that later

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.970 
boosts which will demonstrate that later
the<00:01:55.260> controller<00:01:55.800> has<00:01:56.370> a<00:01:56.820> 0<00:01:57.330> at<00:01:57.510> 5k<00:01:58.200> ohm<00:01:58.470> input

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
the controller has a 0 at 5k ohm input

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.770 
the controller has a 0 at 5k ohm input
and<00:01:59.870> to<00:02:00.980> regulate<00:02:01.980> the<00:02:02.340> speed<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.600> did

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and to regulate the speed what we did

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.070 
and to regulate the speed what we did
with<00:02:03.930> -<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:05.130> get<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.490> 0<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.030> 5<00:02:06.240> K<00:02:06.480> ohms<00:02:06.660> as<00:02:06.930> we

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
with - to get that 0 to 5 K ohms as we

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.160 
with - to get that 0 to 5 K ohms as we
hooked<00:02:07.830> up<00:02:07.980> a<00:02:08.160> potentiometer<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.539> our<00:02:09.899> gas

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
hooked up a potentiometer to our gas

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.010 
hooked up a potentiometer to our gas
pedal<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.790> we<00:02:11.790> linked<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.150> up<00:02:12.300> here<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
pedal just we linked it up here this is

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.850 
pedal just we linked it up here this is
a<00:02:13.140> 10

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
a 10

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.270 
a 10
you<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.340> get<00:02:14.460> those<00:02:14.610> at<00:02:14.670> RadioShack<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
you can get those at RadioShack and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:31.760 
you can get those at RadioShack and
that's<00:02:17.730> pretty<00:02:18.060> much<00:02:18.120> it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.030 

you

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.670 

all<00:02:34.760> right<00:02:34.879> so<00:02:35.180> I'm<00:02:35.599> going<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.319> demonstrate

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
all right so I'm going to demonstrate

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:59.309 
all right so I'm going to demonstrate
the<00:02:37.129> carts<00:02:37.370> acceleration<00:02:38.000> without

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.320 

now<00:03:00.099> I'm<00:03:00.250> going<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.430> show<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.849> carts

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
now I'm going to show the carts

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.960 
now I'm going to show the carts
acceleration<00:03:02.170> with<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.680> Bruce<00:03:03.040> button<00:03:03.400> now

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
acceleration with the Bruce button now

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.399 
acceleration with the Bruce button now
I'm<00:03:04.060> going<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.299> do<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:04.720> from<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.200> rolling

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
I'm going to do it for from a rolling

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.119 
I'm going to do it for from a rolling
start<00:03:05.769> because<00:03:06.129> it's<00:03:06.400> bad<00:03:06.549> for<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:07.180> carts

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
start because it's bad for the carts

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.429 
start because it's bad for the carts
components<00:03:09.129> like<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.430> motor<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:10.150> year<00:03:10.659> this

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
components like the motor the year this

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.080 
components like the motor the year this
rocket<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:11.950> chain<00:03:12.189> and<00:03:12.220> all<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.640> for<00:03:12.909> me<00:03:13.000> to

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
rocket and chain and all that for me to

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.019 
rocket and chain and all that for me to
do<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.329> for<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.540> standstill
