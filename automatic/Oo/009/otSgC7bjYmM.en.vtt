00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:08.680
 and hello everyone with you again and today I am 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.809
 tell you the rules that should 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.809
 arrange every schoolboy which is very 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.380
 rule first learned only what you 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.990
 need of course no need to take it 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.820
 specifically that is to say that the story 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.380
 I need to learn and not at all 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.570
 hide too the sooner you do it 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.850
 serious the better will be and you should 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.949
 decide where you will do that 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.010
 Asked, let's say Russian math 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.860
 English and social science 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.649
 very deeply of such packages about dealing with 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.370
 homework teach paragraphs are not 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.670
 be lazy 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.219
 and all sorts of biology with geography we are so 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.649
 well opened we read familiarize and 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.960
 Fours you these subjects enough 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.180
 For example, I decided that I will take 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.010
 fifth grade rule second try 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.020
 don't miss kati's lessons only in those 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.969
 cases when it is completely wrong because 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.370
 which is basically what I ask and those who don’t 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.199
 it was just very big cool 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.640
 meet the man almost and so us in 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.679
 Mostly ask those who not 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.420
 when you miss your father 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:09.880
 ask u second harder to catch up 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.590
 material and in general it's all turning 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.170
 know it like he that first you don't 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.060
 tantu came write hard and then 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.490
 stew is control over you really hard 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.139
 and then it didn't come at all to school 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.599
 protect because the color is beyond control 

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:25.869
 it will rain it did not come and it 

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:28.810
 so here everything is rolling just better 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.819
 start i know it trust me you 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.369
 wait for your classmates that's why 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.859
 you do it you just spend on it 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.899
 their nerves need not converge characters and 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.539
 go in different directions 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.849
 you will be much better off with a leader 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.889
 time with your friends next advice is not 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:46.899
 argue with teachers I know what it is 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:49.149
 hard at changing or difficult 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.939
 even if you know what's in there full 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.619
 nonsense scan so tells you not warm and 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.599
 cold is better keep quiet and you will be better 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.939
 relate how to learn because else 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.039
 including very vindictive and we have 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.890
 such teachers I believe better not with him 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.170
 they will argue you later 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.060
 murderers almost a temple in the fifth council 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.160
 do homework then when no one 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.170
 will not do that is let's say you 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.440
 asked to do some very long 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.000
 the work that you and just is not something 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.400
 it's not hard for you to do, do n't you understand 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.290
 how to do it you just too lazy to do 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.390
 let's write a lot to type a lot 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.190
 look for the path of information when you are against 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.959
 class and you will not be the only 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.090
 man when did homework 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.130
 the teachers you will then be another whole class 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.020
 example set checked sixth tip 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.670
 when you have some new 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.650
 a teacher who doesn't know you yet 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.410
 start to study in his subject 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.510
 very hard then with time you already 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.910
 can reduce their momentum that is how 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.650
 would learn la la la la fist but he's still 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.600
 would still be a good grade so 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.269
 say by inertia what will zabu say 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.769
 homework then I will not tell you that you 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.260
 it did not say that and tomorrow 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.660
 bring the seventh council 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.550
 participate in olympiads that's easy 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.310
 Generally wonderful while in our 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.380
 school and thomas have first olympiad 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.610
 this is a plus to your portfolio which 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.620
 will provide when to be 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.989
 go to college secondly you 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.510
 miss the lesson i think everyone is happy about it 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.299
 third teacher loves you because you 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.130
 so wonderful pretty 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.959
 participate imagine the school and in 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.410
 Fourth if you do this 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.239
 Olympiad 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.040
 first of all you will be a tremendous love 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.170
 teachers repeat respect 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.910
 classmates 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.440
 it seems to me troy I personally participate bar 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.180
 from all the olympiads that are so 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.610
 passes except for those items 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.790
 which I generally dunduk 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.459
 let's say there is a french chemistry story in 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.769
 them and the eighth council is not involved this 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.959
 personally my opinion about forgive me personally so 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.060
 more convenient for schools are not allowed without a shift 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.190
 I am very lazy to carry a shift every time 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.860
 because I throw school for almost half an hour 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.200
 and clear the longing with a minus when 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.000
 frost you have a hand in the cold left school 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.310
 steals nothing because i know 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.410
 how easy is that of which steals steals 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.109
 then you can safely leave your shift 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.650
 hanging in the locker room for those who are so 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:07.470
 does class 6 7 and think that i'm quite 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.840
 idiot why did i say this in the video 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.120
 represent in our class many 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.930
 or still doing a beta 3 shift 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.989
 we are even textbooks in the locker room leave 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.030
 finally they say that thinking up 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.070
 advice they are very simple I am not very 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.840
 just perform but maybe you 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.820
 get try to get interested 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.130
 some items that is to me like 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.780
 like English and I can contribute to 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.690

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.729
 span 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.979
 I know that at least here I have 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.070
 many classmates and I also had 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.260
 such bouts of study when I wanted 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.419

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.090
