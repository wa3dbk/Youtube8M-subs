00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
the game I actually have one more this

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.730 
the game I actually have one more this
will<00:04:10.500> see<00:04:10.770> if<00:04:11.010> malleus<00:04:11.520> actually<00:04:12.120> pulls<00:04:12.450> his

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
will see if malleus actually pulls his

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.200 
will see if malleus actually pulls his
finger<00:04:13.740> out<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.220> actually<00:04:14.700> does<00:04:15.030> something

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
finger out and actually does something

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.849
