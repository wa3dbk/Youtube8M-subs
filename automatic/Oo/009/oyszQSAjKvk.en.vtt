you<00:00:14.670> might<00:00:14.790> end<00:00:14.849> up<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.299> 4th<00:00:15.509> century

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:30.900 

Wow

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.810 

now<00:00:31.539> here<00:00:31.750> we<00:00:31.840> have<00:00:31.869> TARDIS<00:00:32.590> time<00:00:33.489> and

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
now here we have TARDIS time and

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.750 
now here we have TARDIS time and
relative<00:00:34.000> dimension<00:00:34.329> in<00:00:34.960> space<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.309> TARDIS

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
relative dimension in space the TARDIS

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.299 
relative dimension in space the TARDIS
is<00:00:40.059> dimensionally<00:00:40.809> transcendental<00:00:44.309> also

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
is dimensionally transcendental also

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.320 
is dimensionally transcendental also
it's<00:00:45.489> a<00:00:45.550> very<00:00:45.760> impressive<00:00:46.500> console<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:48.330> lot

everyone else does the TARDIS is

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:44.040 
everyone else does the TARDIS is
dimensionally<00:02:16.980> transcendental

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:03:00.059
