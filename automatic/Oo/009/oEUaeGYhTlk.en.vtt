it'll go down the tube and it will pass

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.310 
it'll go down the tube and it will pass
the<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.579> sensor<00:01:02.789> part<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.750> hit<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the little sensor part and then hit this

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.060 
the little sensor part and then hit this
plastic<00:01:04.979> nub<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:06.409> now<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.470> nub<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:07.890> just

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
plastic nub here now the nub will just

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.399 
plastic nub here now the nub will just
hold<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.119> try<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.299> pull<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
hold it in but when you try to pull the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.429 
hold it in but when you try to pull the
s-pen<00:01:10.890> back<00:01:11.189> out<00:01:11.990> it's<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
s-pen back out it's actually going to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.609 
s-pen back out it's actually going to
catch<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.010> sensor<00:01:14.400> right<00:01:15.330> below<00:01:15.900> right

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
catch on that sensor right below right

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
catch on that sensor right below right
here<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.479> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
here you can see that little kind of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
here you can see that little kind of
glare<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:18.960> hard<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
glare it's hard to see you can see that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.399 
glare it's hard to see you can see that
it's<00:01:20.610> pulling<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.780> nub<00:01:22.110> there

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
it's pulling on that little nub there

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.499 
it's pulling on that little nub there
and<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> break<00:01:24.000> off<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and that's going to break off if you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.230 
and that's going to break off if you
pull<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> too<00:01:24.960> hard<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.820> don't<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
pull it too hard so we don't want to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.700 
pull it too hard so we don't want to
pull<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> past<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.020> point<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.560> you're

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
pull it past that point or if you're

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
pull it past that point or if you're
going<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.040> break<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> device<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.810> let<00:01:30.960> me

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
going to break the device now let me

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.840 
going to break the device now let me
give<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> possibly<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.549> bit<00:01:32.670> better

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.660 
give you possibly a little bit better
idea<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.740> how<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> work<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.579> we're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
idea here of how this is work so we're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.130 
idea here of how this is work so we're
inserting<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> pin<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:36.869> there's<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
inserting the pin you can see there's a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
inserting the pin you can see there's a
cutouts<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.009> pin<00:01:38.220> where<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> little

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
cutouts on the pin where the little

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.730 
cutouts on the pin where the little
plastic<00:01:39.450> Grohmann<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> tops<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
plastic Grohmann here the tops going to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.539 
plastic Grohmann here the tops going to
hold<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.159> place<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:42.290> like<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:44.399> once

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
hold it in place just like so now once

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.520 
hold it in place just like so now once
you<00:01:44.640> pull<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> out<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.479> sensor<00:01:45.990> opens<00:01:46.320> now<00:01:46.439> you

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you pull it out the sensor opens now you

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.649 
you pull it out the sensor opens now you
insert<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.829> backwards<00:01:47.220> again<00:01:47.420> gets<00:01:48.420> caught

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
insert it backwards again gets caught

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.889 
insert it backwards again gets caught
right<00:01:48.899> here<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.460> sensor<00:01:53.899> so

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
right here on this little sensor so

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.450 
right here on this little sensor so
basically<00:01:55.380> when<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.560> insert<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.040> backwards

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
basically when you insert it backwards

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.740 
basically when you insert it backwards
there's<00:01:56.640> two<00:01:56.790> points<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> first<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.600> here

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
there's two points the first one here

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.209 
there's two points the first one here
that<00:01:57.869> holds<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.710> second<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.159> you

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that holds it in in a second when you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.740 
that holds it in in a second when you
can<00:01:59.340> see<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.729> at<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> bottom<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
can see that at the bottom here it's

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.230 
can see that at the bottom here it's
almost<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.890> click<00:02:02.250> sensor<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.090> pen

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
almost to the click sensor on the pen

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.600 
almost to the click sensor on the pen
itself<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.869> comes<00:02:04.049> out<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> phone

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
itself when it comes out of the phone

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.830 
itself when it comes out of the phone
now<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> fixer<00:02:06.030> that's<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.630> channel

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
now I'm a fixer that's what this channel

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.630 
now I'm a fixer that's what this channel
is<00:02:07.049> all<00:02:07.200> about<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.190> thought<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.520> myself

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
is all about and I thought to myself

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.369 
is all about and I thought to myself
when<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.090> smell<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.720> tried<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> couple

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
when I smell this I tried a couple

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.110 
when I smell this I tried a couple
pieces<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.679> plastic<00:02:11.099> bottle<00:02:11.520> something<00:02:11.879> thin

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
pieces of plastic bottle something thin

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.460 
pieces of plastic bottle something thin
to<00:02:12.239> slide<00:02:12.420> down<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.569> s-pen<00:02:13.020> hole

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to slide down the s-pen hole

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.830 
to slide down the s-pen hole
you<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.910> kept<00:02:15.060> saying<00:02:15.240> man<00:02:15.690> this

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
thing is just like it's thin as a sheet

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.250 
thing is just like it's thin as a sheet
of<00:02:17.460> paper<00:02:17.670> then<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.450> thought<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.780> myself<00:02:18.870> hey

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
going to slide it down the S pinhole

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.080 
going to slide it down the S pinhole
here<00:02:30.960> now<00:02:31.740> will<00:02:32.040> get<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.220> little<00:02:32.430> bit<00:02:32.640> stuck<00:02:32.940> on

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
here now will get a little bit stuck on

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.880 
here now will get a little bit stuck on
occasion<00:02:33.630> there's<00:02:34.200> an<00:02:34.320> easy<00:02:34.470> way<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.680> get<00:02:34.800> it

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
occasion there's an easy way to get it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.190 
occasion there's an easy way to get it
to<00:02:34.980> go<00:02:35.100> down<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:36.120> I'm<00:02:36.210> making<00:02:36.630> sure<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.080> it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
to go down so I'm making sure that it

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.050 
to go down so I'm making sure that it
goes<00:02:37.290> towards<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.710> inside<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.280> fold<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> S<00:02:38.850> Pen

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
goes towards the inside I fold the S Pen

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.540 
goes towards the inside I fold the S Pen
out<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.750> pass<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.230> sensor<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> break<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.010> but

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
out not pass the sensor to break it but

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.100 
out not pass the sensor to break it but
now<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:41.880> stuck<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.360> I'm<00:02:42.420> going<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.600> push<00:02:42.960> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
now it's stuck so I'm going to push the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.150 
now it's stuck so I'm going to push the
s-pen<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:45.050> pull<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.140> s-pen<00:02:46.470> back<00:02:46.709> out<00:02:46.950> and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
s-pen in pull the s-pen back out and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.890 
s-pen in pull the s-pen back out and
then<00:02:47.400> keep<00:02:47.640> pushing<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> paper<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.570> sliding

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
then keep pushing the paper and sliding

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.270 
then keep pushing the paper and sliding
it<00:02:48.990> down<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.290> hole<00:02:49.640> until<00:02:51.410> one<00:02:52.410> point<00:02:52.709> it's

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
it down the hole until one point it's

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.340 
it down the hole until one point it's
going<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.550> get<00:02:53.670> far<00:02:54.090> enough<00:02:54.240> down<00:02:54.600> where<00:02:55.020> it's

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
going to get far enough down where it's

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.890 
going to get far enough down where it's
going<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.830> push<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.280> censor<00:02:56.730> gate<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.810> I

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
going to push that censor gate up and I

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.590 
going to push that censor gate up and I
can<00:02:58.080> pull<00:02:58.470> my<00:02:59.220> s<00:02:59.430> pin<00:02:59.820> out<00:03:00.030> now<00:03:00.360> I'm<00:03:00.450> not

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
can pull my s pin out now I'm not

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.030 
can pull my s pin out now I'm not
tugging<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.320> thing<00:03:01.470> very<00:03:01.500> hard<00:03:01.860> at<00:03:01.950> all
