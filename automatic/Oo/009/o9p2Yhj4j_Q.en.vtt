00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 mehdi flies mohamed merah a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.830
 childhood structures and that leads to 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.500
 petty crime 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.360
 a prison radicalization and finally the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.610
 crime the weapons in hand in the name of 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.529
 jihad in the course this type of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.160
 criminals 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:22.439
 we usually have a series of breaks 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.800
 family breakup school break very 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.199
 often breaking with the law with 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.199
 acts of delinquency under ordinary law and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.669
 finally a break with society 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.010
 who can drive 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.460
 all the excesses I think these are 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.159
 black sheep his father without landmarks and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.129
 without ideology they eat hatred at the 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.649
 teaspoon they want to have a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.989
 patent of respectability 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.670
 he practices the crime he must 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.180
 qualified as criminals and not 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.350
 offenders 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.589
 they try to exploit negatively 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.629
 Islam because Islam is not for 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.070
 nothing in this hope like mohamed merah 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.350
 medina and fly wanted to immortalize 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.569
 his massacre but his camera did not 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.520
 worked both men killed with 

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:08.789
 firearms including weapons of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.069
 war 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.750
 so these armies come from several 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.759
 places different from the combat zones 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.740
 but also from all those eastern countries that 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.259
 with an armament that was very 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.569
 important and that has diminished and so with 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.920
 mafias to organized networks that 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.750
 circulate these weapons because there are 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.580
 big financial stakes 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.009
 mohamed merah had gone to pakistan and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.679
 in Afghanistan but dinner fly is him 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.560
 went to syria there are also other countries 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:37.200
 in Mali in Niger we find his actors 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.759
 and his battle lands so we can 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.820
 to have people who also come from 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.859
 these from this terrain but Syria by 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.960
 its proximity to turkey where we take 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.270
 a plane does not Toulouse and we find ourselves 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.859
 in turkey easily allows these 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.600
 youth from making war on 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.969
 Celine is only an alibi 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.869
 if there is no doral series always 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.600
 something else 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.600
 so I do not think so but I think 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.090
 that they can not under any circumstances 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.100
 to venture me I think they are 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.659
 helped if the jihadist threat is 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.519
 established is now the question 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.769
 networks of recruiters and 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.150
 fighters there are networks we 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.680
 have to fight this network is not there 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.790
 cobwebs since you see 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.769
 although in these countries there is also 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.359
 many groups who are fighters 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.069
 but who are fighting each other so he 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.690
 there is strong competition in these 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.790
 groups sealed disparate group in 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.069
 function of religious obediences that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.799
 are different obedience functions 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.930
 policies that are competing 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.389
 meyrannes and fly both born in 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.040
 France is of French nationality 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.109
 the legal system and a state of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.430
 right would it represent the limit of the 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.440
 fight against terrorism 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.150
 not because someone experienced the service 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.099
 police officer or someone known to the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.880
 justice that you can exercise all your life 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.280
 supervisors on these people thanks 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.530
 if she we have this place and it's 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.720
 the parliament of our country that sets the 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.030
 rules so rules can evolve 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.060
 but it's up to national sovereignty 2 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.120
 so say the standard of law is required to 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.130
 all of us it's a necessity it's a 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.780
 great advantage that we have she is 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.370
 evolutionary difficult to discern 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.410
 the key moment or a delinquent 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.160
 multiresididist switches into the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.990
 terrorism 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.030
 that's why each of the actors 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.300
 stress the importance of 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.300
 prevention
