 You know, there are some Kiwi reviews that I do 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.980
 With special pleasure and this video review 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.800

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.990
 me on video review 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.179
 perhaps the most technologically screwed 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.359
 and the column that I surveyed for 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.880
 last two and a half years she has 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.939
 so cool electronic stuffing that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.710
 it has weighing mince which only 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.439
 can you imagine that he was in 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480
 portable speakers in addition burrow 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399
 think that the player's chip at the bottom and it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.399
 actually friends are mounted on the steering wheel 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.380
 bike or scooter i.e. it 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.899

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.010
 still mounted on the handlebars and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.969
 scooters can make you happy with music 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.170
 i have well firstly it reproduces 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.050
 while she plays 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.660
 music it shows the name of the files on 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.260
 Russian language that is, if you 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.420
 Russian music is recorded then she 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.960
 It shows the name of a hitting on 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.780
 Russian, it shows the name of the folders on 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.659
 Russian, it shows the file name 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.820
 in Russian, it has a built-in 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.810
 radio 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.229
 it has a built-in alarm clock 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.049
 she can rewind 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.650
 inside the track while doing it 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.470
 turned off and turned on again then she will 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.610
 play right from the same place from which 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.409
 you turned off 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.780
 that is, there is no need to wait there when 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.930
 there will begin first the track that is all 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.930
 these unique pieces are just not in 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.439
 other portable speakers just 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.270
 places with a pretty good sound she 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.430
 gives you an hour 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.780
 any track 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.560
 see see yes everything is in Russian 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.210
 showing list of flash drives now 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.810
 I'll give you something better 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.810

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.780
 well, the former plays guys believe me 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:39.060
 very cool very bassist cool on 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.730
 in fact it is like an older brother 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.160
 how would the older brother popular little speakers 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.810
 Neil angel can credit on which 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.720
 right in the middle of this video you are now 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.610
 you can see just not with packs and 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.040
 send packages to see what and 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.950
 I say this is just more advanced 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.740
 a model that has two speakers 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.020
 have this stereo very comfortable experience 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.110
 management here on top of all the necessary 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.120
 functions and as well as spoke chip 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.780
 this is a bike mount and 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.630
 scooter 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.130
 along with this still bundled out yet 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.410
 one strap to his 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.110
 fasten for example on my hands he 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.700
 different in that it is attached and it 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.040
 so that's rubberized that is it 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.370
 great stretches on hand 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.690
 use this column while running a 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.280
 also look here there is another 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.450
 option other colors here still have 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.250
 such a special mount for 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.190
 to wear a column on a belt 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.100
 that is, so fixed for the belt 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.470
 plugged column go up on you 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.030
 watching the display can switch 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.010
 The tracks are very, very convenient from such 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.200
 here are technological chips in it 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.470
 Headphone connection provided 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.630
 You can include for example this here and 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.060
 can connect external devices 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.820
 For example mobile phone use column 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.620
 how to strengthen them to listen to music from mobile phones 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.560
 there is an input for usb flash drives micro sd 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.560
 cards are charging like this 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.630
 wires coming from your port 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.250
 laptop or computer and of course 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.790
 there are wires to connect your 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.890
 mobile phones 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.250
 to use this spoke column 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.400
 as the amplifier is also the same right dock 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.960
 listening to the antenna for f fm radio 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.680
 built into this column 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.990
 Here is such an awesome column today 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.030
 here's how we would review that is this something 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.759
 long-awaited model for summer for 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.180
 bike she's really unique 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:41.280
