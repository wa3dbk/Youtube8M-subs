openings that you see in other video
games<00:00:11.580> then<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.660> might<00:00:12.990> be<00:00:13.349> what<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.830> needed

for<00:00:14.940> your<00:00:15.120> adventure<00:00:15.750> maps<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.650> without

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
for your adventure maps so without

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.700 
for your adventure maps so without
getting<00:00:18.029> too<00:00:18.300> far<00:00:18.570> into<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> explanation

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
getting too far into the explanation

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.200 
getting too far into the explanation
quite<00:00:20.010> yet<00:00:20.220> I'll<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.609> press<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.000> button

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
quite yet I'll just press this button

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.900 
quite yet I'll just press this button
and<00:00:21.539> I'll<00:00:21.930> let<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.380> watch<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.010> cinematic<00:00:23.730> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and I'll let you watch the cinematic to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.120 
and I'll let you watch the cinematic to
my<00:00:24.119> not<00:00:24.330> actually<00:00:24.900> existing<00:00:25.529> adventure<00:00:25.980> map

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
my not actually existing adventure map

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:45.939 
my not actually existing adventure map
the<00:00:26.519> village

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.319 

so<00:00:46.949> as<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.370> could<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.550> there<00:00:47.969> that's<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so as you could see there that's the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.479 
so as you could see there that's the
honey<00:00:48.930> give<00:00:49.500> her<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.949> as<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.339> could<00:00:56.460> see

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
honey give her this so as you could see

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.389 
honey give her this so as you could see
that<00:00:56.850> was<00:00:57.210> an<00:00:57.390> actual<00:00:57.570> sort<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.620> cinematic

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that was an actual sort of cinematic

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.660 
that was an actual sort of cinematic
looking<00:01:00.030> opening<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.829> adventure<00:01:02.159> map<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
looking opening to the adventure map the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.950 
looking opening to the adventure map the
village<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> also<00:01:03.390> came<00:01:03.540> up<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.839> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
village it also came up with the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.570 
village it also came up with the
objective<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:06.119> quick<00:01:06.330> explanation<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
objective and the quick explanation is

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.230 
objective and the quick explanation is
really<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:09.180> simple<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:11.009> this<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
really really simple so this here is a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240 
really really simple so this here is a
fill<00:01:12.659> clock<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.500> actually<00:01:13.979> running

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
fill clock it's not actually running

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.980 
fill clock it's not actually running
right<00:01:14.580> now<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:17.149> wait<00:01:18.149> around<00:01:18.390> game<00:01:18.810> mode

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
right now so if I wait around game mode

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.999 
right now so if I wait around game mode
so<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.800> I<00:01:19.920> break<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.090> won't<00:01:22.020> automatically

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so if I break this I won't automatically

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
so if I break this I won't automatically
fill<00:01:23.340> back<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.149> clock<00:01:24.330> were

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
fill back in but if this clock were

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.320 
fill back in but if this clock were
running<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.530> were<00:01:25.679> to<00:01:25.740> break<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
running and I were to break that

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.469 
running and I were to break that
wouldn't<00:01:27.330> go<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.690> well<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:29.149> these<00:01:30.149> three

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
wouldn't go so well so these three

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.859 
wouldn't go so well so these three
command<00:01:30.869> blocks<00:01:31.490> during<00:01:32.490> each<00:01:32.789> segment<00:01:33.179> will

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
command blocks during each segment will

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.469 
command blocks during each segment will
be<00:01:33.899> cloned<00:01:34.380> into<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.890> space<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:36.000> now<00:01:36.179> it's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
be cloned into the space right now it's

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.690 
be cloned into the space right now it's
just<00:01:36.750> made<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.259> keep<00:01:37.470> your<00:01:37.710> view<00:01:38.159> locked<00:01:38.460> on

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
just made to keep your view locked on

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.540 
just made to keep your view locked on
the<00:01:38.909> safe<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.780> safe<00:01:40.020> room<00:01:40.470> sign<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.310> all

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
the safe the safe room sign that's all

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.330 
the safe the safe room sign that's all
the<00:01:41.819> way<00:01:41.940> down<00:01:42.360> there<00:01:43.640> but<00:01:45.649> this<00:01:46.649> one<00:01:46.679> makes

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the way down there but this one makes

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.639 
the way down there but this one makes
you<00:01:47.729> because<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.720> relative<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.560> your

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you because it's relative to your

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.440 
you because it's relative to your
position<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.460> brings<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.759> back<00:01:50.969> point

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
position so it brings you back point

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.120 
position so it brings you back point
five<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.290> meter<00:01:52.950> every<00:01:54.200> game<00:01:55.200> tick<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.829> think

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
five a meter every game tick I think

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.880 
five a meter every game tick I think
that's<00:01:56.340> how<00:01:56.490> fastest<00:01:56.909> clone<00:01:57.210> raw<00:01:57.420> clock<00:01:58.110> runs

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that's how fastest clone raw clock runs

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.179 
that's how fastest clone raw clock runs
its<00:01:59.250> twenty<00:01:59.759> times<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.149> second<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.899> recall<00:02:01.189> so

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
its twenty times a second if I recall so

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.749 
its twenty times a second if I recall so
it's<00:02:03.000> relatively<00:02:03.930> smooth<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.950> could<00:02:05.310> make<00:02:05.549> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
it's relatively smooth you could make it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
it's relatively smooth you could make it
a<00:02:05.850> bit<00:02:06.000> slower<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:06.810> look<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.140> lot

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
a bit slower and it would look a lot

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
a bit slower and it would look a lot
smoother<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.759> course<00:02:09.000> it'd<00:02:09.209> be

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
smoother but then of course it'd be

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.789 
smoother but then of course it'd be
going<00:02:09.630> slower<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.200> don't<00:02:10.380> really<00:02:10.530> want

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
going slower and you don't really want

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.400 
going slower and you don't really want
to<00:02:10.890> waste<00:02:11.070> too<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.519> of<00:02:11.820> people's<00:02:12.390> times<00:02:12.690> with

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
to waste too much of people's times with

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.840 
to waste too much of people's times with
cinematics<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:15.420> one<00:02:15.720> make<00:02:16.440> which<00:02:17.370> one<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:17.700> it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
cinematics this one make which one is it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.160 
cinematics this one make which one is it
this<00:02:18.060> one<00:02:19.049> so<00:02:19.769> this<00:02:20.640> part<00:02:21.090> over<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.019> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
this one so this part over your on the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.410 
this one so this part over your on the
end<00:02:23.150> with<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.299> tilde<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:26.430> makes<00:02:26.940> your<00:02:27.150> view

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
end with the tilde that makes your view

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.740 
end with the tilde that makes your view
look<00:02:27.959> downward<00:02:28.680> on<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.340> Steve<00:02:30.030> statue<00:02:30.359> and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
look downward on the Steve statue and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.670 
look downward on the Steve statue and
then<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.530> one<00:02:31.820> kind<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.970> tricky<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.420> explain

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
then this one kind of tricky to explain

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.400 
then this one kind of tricky to explain
but<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:35.090> basically<00:02:36.090> set<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:36.900> such<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> way

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
but it's basically set in such a way

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.310 
but it's basically set in such a way
that<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.739> has<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.310> nice<00:02:38.549> sort<00:02:39.329> of<00:02:39.510> smooth

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
that it has that nice sort of smooth

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.250 
that it has that nice sort of smooth
transition<00:02:41.220> into<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.700> Steve<00:02:42.450> statue<00:02:42.810> over

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
transition into the Steve statue over

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.810 
transition into the Steve statue over
here<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:46.799> know<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:46.980> take<00:02:47.220> up<00:02:47.459> his<00:02:47.609> head

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
here and you know you take up his head

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.599 
here and you know you take up his head
space<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:48.480> he<00:02:48.720> gets<00:02:49.049> d<00:02:49.470> cloned<00:02:49.829> but<00:02:50.489> at

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
space and then he gets d cloned but at

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:51.710 
space and then he gets d cloned but at
the<00:02:50.730> beginning<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> cinematic<00:02:51.600> he's

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the beginning of the cinematic he's

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.720 
the beginning of the cinematic he's
cloned<00:02:52.049> into<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.650> position<00:02:52.890> there<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.640> then

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
cloned into that position there and then

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.860 
cloned into that position there and then
d<00:02:53.970> cloned<00:02:54.360> at<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:55.260> end<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:56.250> that's<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:57.269> basic

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
d cloned at the end so that's the basic

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.600 
d cloned at the end so that's the basic
explanation<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:59.370> it

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
explanation of it

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.310 
explanation of it
there<00:02:59.730> really<00:02:59.910> isn't<00:03:00.240> much<00:03:00.450> more<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.200> I

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
there really isn't much more to it I

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.510 
there really isn't much more to it I
mean<00:03:01.500> there's<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:01.800> these<00:03:01.920> other<00:03:02.130> command

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
mean there's all these other command

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.400 
mean there's all these other command
blocks<00:03:02.790> but<00:03:02.970> most<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.300> them<00:03:03.360> are<00:03:03.540> fancy<00:03:04.020> things

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
blocks but most of them are fancy things

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.720 
blocks but most of them are fancy things
like<00:03:06.170> pudding<00:03:07.170> let's<00:03:07.710> see<00:03:07.890> yeah<00:03:08.340> putting<00:03:08.640> all

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
like pudding let's see yeah putting all

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.090 
like pudding let's see yeah putting all
the<00:03:08.790> plays<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.000> spectator<00:03:09.750> mode<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:10.830> are

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
the plays in spectator mode so you are

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.280 
the plays in spectator mode so you are
actually<00:03:11.310> in<00:03:11.700> spectator<00:03:12.150> mode<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.690> think<00:03:13.170> you

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
actually in spectator mode I think you

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.110 
actually in spectator mode I think you
can<00:03:13.470> see<00:03:13.770> your<00:03:14.070> head<00:03:14.280> if<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.580> go<00:03:14.820> into<00:03:15.000> third

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
can see your head if you go into third

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.730 
can see your head if you go into third
person<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.560> kind<00:03:16.740> of<00:03:16.770> trend<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.410> if<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.560> go

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
person so just kind of trend so if I go

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.720 
person so just kind of trend so if I go
in<00:03:19.920> third<00:03:20.280> person<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:21.890> yeah<00:03:22.890> yeah<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.550> can

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
in third person here yeah yeah you can

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.930 
in third person here yeah yeah you can
see<00:03:24.270> your<00:03:24.480> head<00:03:24.690> kind<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.380> invisible<00:03:26.310> and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
see your head kind of invisible and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.370 
see your head kind of invisible and
floating<00:03:27.510> they're<00:03:28.610> very<00:03:29.610> strange-looking<00:03:30.390> I

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
floating they're very strange-looking I

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.340 
floating they're very strange-looking I
gotta<00:03:31.560> say<00:03:32.209> all<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.360> parts<00:03:33.630> gonna<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.870> freaky

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
gotta say all this parts gonna be freaky

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.960 
gotta say all this parts gonna be freaky
yeah<00:03:36.320> it's<00:03:37.320> kind<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.650> startling<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.730> see<00:03:38.760> a

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
yeah it's kind of startling to see a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.360 
yeah it's kind of startling to see a
floating<00:03:39.209> head<00:03:39.510> do<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:40.430> but<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.780> can<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.050> it

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
floating head do that but you can do it

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.930 
floating head do that but you can do it
let's<00:03:44.370> get<00:03:44.610> rid<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.820> this<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.310> that's<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:50.880> is

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
let's get rid of this so that's that is

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.270 
let's get rid of this so that's that is
the<00:03:51.540> basic<00:03:51.959> explanation<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.860> know<00:03:52.980> again

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
the basic explanation you know again

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.520 
the basic explanation you know again
there's<00:03:53.520> all<00:03:53.640> this<00:03:53.760> other<00:03:53.910> stuff<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.570> think<00:03:55.380> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
there's all this other stuff I think the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.740 
there's all this other stuff I think the
important<00:03:56.280> concept<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.239> transition

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
important concept is the transition

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.840 
important concept is the transition
where<00:03:58.050> your<00:03:58.170> screen<00:03:58.500> goes<00:03:58.860> completely<00:03:59.190> black

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
where your screen goes completely black

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.120 
where your screen goes completely black
if<00:04:00.180> well<00:04:01.050> if<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.320> were<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.500> recreate<00:04:01.680> this

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
if well if you were to recreate this

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.979 
if well if you were to recreate this
that<00:04:02.489> might<00:04:02.670> be<00:04:02.700> something<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.750> couldn't

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
that might be something you couldn't

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.350 
that might be something you couldn't
figure<00:04:04.170> out<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.530> your<00:04:04.560> own<00:04:05.030> basically<00:04:06.030> if<00:04:06.209> you

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
figure out on your own basically if you

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.890 
figure out on your own basically if you
give<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.930> player<00:04:07.470> blindness<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.720> night<00:04:09.720> vision

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
give a player blindness and night vision

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.900 
give a player blindness and night vision
at<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.380> same<00:04:10.590> time<00:04:10.860> then<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.580> screen<00:04:11.790> goes

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
at the same time then the screen goes

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.729 
at the same time then the screen goes
completely<00:04:12.360> black<00:04:12.900> although<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.260> can<00:04:13.470> still

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
completely black although you can still

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.979 
completely black although you can still
see<00:04:13.950> like<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.280> stars<00:04:14.610> for<00:04:15.390> some<00:04:15.600> reason<00:04:15.900> so

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
see like the stars for some reason so

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.539 
see like the stars for some reason so
you're<00:04:16.169> also<00:04:16.260> teleport<00:04:16.859> inside<00:04:17.040> this<00:04:17.340> little

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
you're also teleport inside this little

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.199 
you're also teleport inside this little
black<00:04:17.850> box<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.870> can't<00:04:19.400> look<00:04:20.400> around<00:04:20.790> then

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
black box so you can't look around then

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.330 
black box so you can't look around then
realize<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.930> oh<00:04:22.049> wait<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.290> second<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:23.190> can

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
realize that oh wait a second you can

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.530 
realize that oh wait a second you can
actually<00:04:23.520> see<00:04:23.790> things<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:26.060> then<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.090> know

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
actually see things and then you know

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.840 
actually see things and then you know
it's<00:04:27.750> all<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.020> same<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:29.130> command<00:04:29.550> block

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
it's all the same this command block

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.780 
it's all the same this command block
puts<00:04:30.330> redstone<00:04:31.020> block<00:04:31.410> here<00:04:31.890> and<00:04:32.100> then<00:04:32.700> the

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
puts redstone block here and then the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.850 
puts redstone block here and then the
one<00:04:32.940> down<00:04:33.120> here<00:04:33.150> just<00:04:33.630> removes<00:04:34.290> it<00:04:34.440> instantly

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
one down here just removes it instantly

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.830 
one down here just removes it instantly
and<00:04:35.250> then<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.610> these<00:04:35.910> are<00:04:36.090> all<00:04:36.240> just<00:04:36.270> the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
and then that these are all just the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.050 
and then that these are all just the
times<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.440> delays<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:37.740> think<00:04:38.160> yeah<00:04:38.820> these<00:04:39.000> are

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
times and delays I think yeah these are

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.850 
times and delays I think yeah these are
for<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:40.190> titles<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.280> show<00:04:41.640> up<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:42.060> village

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
for the titles that show up the village

for the titles that show up the village
this<00:04:43.860> one<00:04:44.100> begins<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.669> clock<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.210> then<00:04:45.479> the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
this one begins the clock and then the

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.290 
this one begins the clock and then the
rest<00:04:45.870> of<00:04:46.050> these<00:04:46.250> well<00:04:47.250> this<00:04:47.400> one<00:04:47.580> puts<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
rest of these well this one puts the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.719 
rest of these well this one puts the
Steve<00:04:49.020> clone<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.740> then<00:04:50.130> this<00:04:50.250> one<00:04:50.310> clones

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
Steve clone and then this one clones

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.030 
Steve clone and then this one clones
this<00:04:50.970> block<00:04:51.240> into<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:51.990> Philip<00:04:52.260> Locke<00:04:52.500> and

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
this block into the Philip Locke and

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.400 
this block into the Philip Locke and
then<00:04:53.160> down<00:04:53.370> here<00:04:53.600> these<00:04:54.600> two<00:04:54.660> do<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.200> same

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
then down here these two do the same

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.290 
then down here these two do the same
thing<00:04:55.680> where<00:04:55.860> they<00:04:55.979> grab<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.640> other<00:04:56.910> block

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
thing where they grab the other block

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.320 
thing where they grab the other block
the<00:04:58.229> other<00:04:58.380> command<00:04:58.830> block<00:04:59.040> for<00:04:59.490> teleporting

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
the other command block for teleporting

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.990 
the other command block for teleporting
into<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.080> Philip<00:05:01.410> Locke<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:01.860> then<00:05:02.520> these<00:05:02.760> on

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
into the Philip Locke and then these on

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
into the Philip Locke and then these on
the<00:05:03.150> end<00:05:03.680> pretty<00:05:04.680> much<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:05.160> same<00:05:05.340> thing<00:05:05.400> this

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
the end pretty much the same thing this

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.440 
the end pretty much the same thing this
1d<00:05:07.020> clones<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.560> clock<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.849> stops<00:05:09.150> it

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
1d clones the clock so it stops it

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.300 
1d clones the clock so it stops it
completely<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:10.349> was<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.650> fastest<00:05:11.099> way<00:05:11.190> I

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
completely that was the fastest way I

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.830 
completely that was the fastest way I
could<00:05:11.550> think<00:05:11.580> of<00:05:11.849> to<00:05:11.910> get<00:05:12.090> rid<00:05:12.240> of<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.390> who<00:05:12.599> used

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
could think of to get rid of it who used

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.399 
could think of to get rid of it who used
to<00:05:12.990> fill

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
to fill

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.049 
to fill
man<00:05:13.559> but<00:05:13.769> instead<00:05:14.009> I<00:05:14.069> use<00:05:14.129> the<00:05:14.399> clone<00:05:14.610> command

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:15.059 
man but instead I use the clone command

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.719 
man but instead I use the clone command
because<00:05:15.239> I'm<00:05:15.419> not<00:05:15.569> that<00:05:15.749> smart<00:05:16.159> this<00:05:17.159> one<00:05:17.369> gets

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
because I'm not that smart this one gets

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.969 
because I'm not that smart this one gets
rid<00:05:17.879> of<00:05:17.909> the<00:05:17.969> Steve<00:05:18.209> statue<00:05:18.479> this<00:05:18.989> one<00:05:19.229> clones

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
rid of the Steve statue this one clones

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.829 
rid of the Steve statue this one clones
in<00:05:20.189> a<00:05:20.279> new<00:05:20.399> clock<00:05:20.669> this<00:05:21.239> one<00:05:21.389> puts<00:05:21.599> you<00:05:21.689> and

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:21.839 
in a new clock this one puts you and

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.629 
in a new clock this one puts you and
venture<00:05:22.499> mode<00:05:22.649> and<00:05:22.830> then<00:05:22.889> this<00:05:23.039> one<00:05:23.099> and<00:05:23.519> these

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
venture mode and then this one and these

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.889 
venture mode and then this one and these
are<00:05:23.789> these<00:05:24.239> three<00:05:24.539> do<00:05:24.959> the<00:05:25.080> objective<00:05:25.789> so

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:26.899 
are these three do the objective so

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:29.570 
are these three do the objective so
that's<00:05:27.899> a<00:05:28.019> quick<00:05:28.139> explanation<00:05:28.559> hopefully<00:05:29.489> it

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
that's a quick explanation hopefully it

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.279 
that's a quick explanation hopefully it
helped<00:05:29.849> if<00:05:30.149> you<00:05:30.330> make<00:05:30.509> your<00:05:30.689> own<00:05:30.719> adventure

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
helped if you make your own adventure

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.320 
helped if you make your own adventure
map<00:05:31.439> I<00:05:31.649> suggest<00:05:32.279> you<00:05:32.339> do<00:05:32.580> this<00:05:32.759> i<00:05:33.029> know<00:05:33.089> i'm

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
map I suggest you do this i know i'm

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.549 
map I suggest you do this i know i'm
going<00:05:33.539> to<00:05:33.599> do<00:05:33.719> this<00:05:33.869> if<00:05:34.050> i<00:05:34.110> ever<00:05:34.199> make<00:05:34.439> an

going to do this if i ever make an

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:36.350 
going to do this if i ever make an
adventure<00:05:34.949> map<00:05:34.979> which<00:05:35.610> will<00:05:35.639> probably<00:05:36.059> be

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
adventure map which will probably be

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.729 
adventure map which will probably be
never<00:05:36.929> but<00:05:37.769> still<00:05:38.249> I<00:05:38.639> find<00:05:39.330> this<00:05:39.509> cool<00:05:39.839> I<00:05:40.139> hope
