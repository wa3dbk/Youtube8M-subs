00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.400
 a big greeting to all and good today I'm going to 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.400
 teach them an android launcher 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.869
 are obligations that we have what 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:22.860
 modify everything in this case let's see 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:28.140
 an extension galaxy s 4 and I think that 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.780
 much more 46 applications 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.570
 and the s4 appears 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.570
 Well, I'll leave it in the description 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:46.340
 first with the description of this 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:49.250
 although this one and for the functions that 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.030
 download 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.469
 the ghoul although it is this 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.469
 because he is a genius 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.860
 it's something that I have to be function 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.860
 because yes no 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's wait for them to look for it 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.030
 although of x 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.869
 also the day left the description that 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.869
 you have to install 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.270
 and now you have installed 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.630
 after this new 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.850
 we are talking about ls 4 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.850
 after this we are going to see each other 4 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.360
 the first one that seems to me if we look for the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.930
 samsung galaxy s 4 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.450
 still remains after they are installers 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.159
 bone launcher 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.340
 and we settled this 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.569
 we open it and it appears 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:59.260
 pressing the ok button to raise 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:01.370
 and Colombia we are going to ok 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.020
 Y 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.020
 we get this automatically 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.500
 in which if you have pride in three of the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.930
 axis 4 but 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.579
 like 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.579
 and good forget 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.650
 ejected the screen 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.129
 and this menu appears 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.590
 first the water 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:35.860
 the widget and the goal application are the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.460
 widgets but I do not like them 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.110
 and there are many 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.880
 we go to bed 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.390
 remedy very well of applications of your 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.310
 phone 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.150
 here these appear 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.140
 good is not that you can put the phone 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.740
 the wallpaper background 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.570
 screen 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.930
 and you think all this to sell 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.829
 converse on screen 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.370
 more knowledge to the subject to say this 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.370
 I have no idea 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.910
 In effect, it 's when your mobile is everything 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.850
 that I now have as a sphere 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.290
 I have is this example is I take a 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.980
 cap that moves like this 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.100
 it entered like this and there are very many also like 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.610
 I personally like it is expected 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.610
 Y 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.910
 Well, it's not much 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.550
 this video is short 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.280
 you can see more beautiful andrÃ© but 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.319
 also but it was strange tsja 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.500
 and not long ago on a 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.620
 video 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.340
 so that road applications 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.760
 the recent ones are the ones that the wall of 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.140
 Recently 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.090
 in the execution the ones that you are using 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.090
 and good 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.200
 in the price of everything 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.200
 but the video will look good and I met him
