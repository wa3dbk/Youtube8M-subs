00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.030
 1 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.980
 hi to all and low in case I hope 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.490
 that you're fine in any case me that 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.230
 go nickel 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.540
 today I find for a new 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.099
 information video on gta 5 online 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.439
 since just now I actually 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.840
 spoken with karl coddhd you know he 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.340
 is a modder on ps3 is actually it has 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.590
 found 2d edge code lines that 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.599
 are really very interesting about ps3 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.220
 with the names of the vehicles that had 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.380
 exclusively on ps4 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.350
 so a priori it would announce a future 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.600
 dlc or actually on ps3 he might have 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.610
 all all the vehicles to the fact that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.370
 has on ps4 so watch I put you the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.660
 screen on screen so here you can 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.390
 see that he found in the tails of 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.800
 sources actually the ps3 the rac trucks 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.290
 so the new vehicle that was 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.880
 added for christmas on ps3 and on ps 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.690
 gift for the mans this vehicle and on 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.090
 both platforms 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.400
 then here we can see the sam 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.380
 van which was also added to christmas on 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.420
 the two consoles and if we can see there 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.829
 dinka jester and the massacre would scar 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.650
 so new vehicles that you 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.899
 are added on ps4 and ps3 mode 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.189
 online for the christmas dlc and then 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.229
 later he found another 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.810
 vehicles so look here we can see 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.700
 there burger classes hot stallion there 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.670
 also found bravado in the clothes 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.400
 buffalo then we have to lavapies since 3h 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.409
 domineering and we end up bravado of 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.790
 redwood gauntlet so if these four 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.270
 vehicles are below others 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.860
 vehicles 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.510
 it might make us think 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.120
 that these four vehicles that were on 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.890
 will say unique on ps4 and on xbox one 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.979
 could also be put so suddenly 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.659
 in a dlc on ps3 otherwise why he 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.290
 would be just below the vehicles 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.820
 we had at christmas 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.740
 I hope you see what I mean 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.770
 so that would announce new 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.930
 vehicles on ps3 after by cons in 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.250
 cursed in story mode a like on ps4 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.409
 these vehicles are only available 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.780
 in story mode so here we would talk 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.070
 more than one dlc in story mode which I 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.210
 again prefer to call back these 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.850
 information that comes from 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.530
 modders are not official but not 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.260
 badly of them have already been revealed 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.549
 true so we can trust it 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.689
 I also made the most of it for you 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.590
 invite to join us on 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.480
