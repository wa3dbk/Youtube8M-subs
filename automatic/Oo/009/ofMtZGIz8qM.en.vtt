hi folks say we're not going to talk
about<00:00:07.090> bonsai<00:00:07.839> trees<00:00:08.520> instead<00:00:09.520> we're<00:00:10.150> going

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
about bonsai trees instead we're going

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.140 
about bonsai trees instead we're going
to<00:00:10.450> talk<00:00:10.780> about<00:00:10.990> moss<00:00:13.469> you'll<00:00:14.469> notice<00:00:14.860> we<00:00:15.070> have

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
to talk about moss you'll notice we have

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.939 
to talk about moss you'll notice we have
several<00:00:16.150> trees<00:00:16.480> here<00:00:16.930> that<00:00:17.110> all<00:00:17.500> of<00:00:17.590> them<00:00:17.710> have

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
several trees here that all of them have

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.850 
several trees here that all of them have
really<00:00:18.310> nice<00:00:18.789> growths<00:00:19.180> of<00:00:19.390> moss<00:00:19.690> the<00:00:20.110> purpose

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
really nice growths of moss the purpose

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.820 
really nice growths of moss the purpose
of<00:00:21.040> the<00:00:21.160> moss<00:00:21.370> is<00:00:21.400> to<00:00:22.230> enhance<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.470> appearance

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
of the moss is to enhance the appearance

of the moss is to enhance the appearance
of<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.280> tree<00:00:24.610> make<00:00:25.480> it<00:00:25.630> look<00:00:25.810> like<00:00:25.990> it's<00:00:26.260> been

here<00:00:49.930> is<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.200> tree<00:00:50.800> that<00:00:51.309> we<00:00:51.910> showed<00:00:52.239> one<00:00:52.630> week

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
here is a tree that we showed one week

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.190 
here is a tree that we showed one week
ago<00:00:53.200> and<00:00:53.500> it<00:00:53.920> was<00:00:54.100> prepped<00:00:54.430> for<00:00:54.579> a<00:00:54.760> show<00:00:55.120> now<00:00:56.020> in

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
ago and it was prepped for a show now in

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.590 
ago and it was prepped for a show now in
this<00:00:56.320> case<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:57.070> moss<00:00:57.329> doesn't<00:00:58.329> grow

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
this case the moss doesn't grow

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.930 
this case the moss doesn't grow
naturally<00:00:59.140> or<00:00:59.710> natively<00:01:00.130> on<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.640> tree

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
garden but it's a situation where we

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.199 
garden but it's a situation where we
basically<00:01:07.509> through<00:01:08.289> the<00:01:08.469> loss<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:09.729> another

basically through the loss in another
place<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:11.020> then<00:01:11.799> placed<00:01:12.310> it<00:01:12.639> on<00:01:12.819> the<00:01:13.149> soil

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479

when<00:01:13.959> we<00:01:14.109> prep<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.439> tree<00:01:14.859> for<00:01:15.159> a<00:01:15.189> show<00:01:15.520> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
when we prep the tree for a show and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.539 
when we prep the tree for a show and
there<00:01:16.990> are<00:01:17.079> some<00:01:17.229> good<00:01:17.439> reasons<00:01:17.469> why<00:01:18.100> we<00:01:18.310> do

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
there are some good reasons why we do

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.379 
there are some good reasons why we do

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:22.389 
this the growing conditions for the moss

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:24.749 
this the growing conditions for the moss
tend<00:01:22.959> to<00:01:23.049> be<00:01:23.170> different<00:01:23.469> from<00:01:24.039> optimal

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759

recognize this from previous videos has

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:35.819 
recognize this from previous videos has
a<00:01:33.130> good<00:01:33.999> growth<00:01:34.299> of<00:01:34.539> moss<00:01:34.749> over<00:01:35.439> almost<00:01:35.590> the

a good growth of moss over almost the

a good growth of moss over almost the
entire<00:01:36.279> pot<00:01:36.700> although<00:01:37.209> it<00:01:37.329> looks<00:01:37.599> green<00:01:38.020> and

entire pot although it looks green and
verdant<00:01:38.829> beautiful<00:01:39.700> this<00:01:40.389> isn't<00:01:40.840> really<00:01:40.990> good

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
verdant beautiful this isn't really good

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.010 
verdant beautiful this isn't really good
for<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.740> tree<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:42.399> reason<00:01:42.849> is<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.329> moss<00:01:43.569> can

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
for the tree the reason is the moss can

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.830 
for the tree the reason is the moss can
both<00:01:44.289> trap<00:01:44.799> moisture<00:01:45.429> in<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.849> soil<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.569> leave

both trap moisture in the soil and leave
a<00:01:46.869> water<00:01:47.289> log<00:01:47.590> or<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.579> can<00:01:48.789> prevent<00:01:49.179> moisture

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479

from<00:01:50.139> going

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
from going

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.360 
from going
down<00:01:50.850> into<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> soil<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:53.070> end<00:01:53.220> up

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
down into the soil and it can end up

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.730

Azalea here is another piece that we

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.270 
Azalea here is another piece that we
prepared<00:02:03.300> for<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> show<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.170> use<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.590> an<00:02:04.710> accent

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280

prepared for a show to use as an accent
and<00:02:05.720> again<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.960> moss<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.440> grown<00:02:07.800> at<00:02:08.190> another

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and again the moss was grown at another

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.540 
and again the moss was grown at another
place<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.480> placed<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.619> when<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.340> was

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.790 
grow moss and get talk a little bit
about<00:02:17.130> where<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.460> get<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.940> from<00:02:18.380> if<00:02:19.380> you're<00:02:19.590> not

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
about where to get it from if you're not

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.680 
about where to get it from if you're not
going<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.280> try<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.550> keep<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.210> tree<00:02:21.510> all

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
going to try to keep it on the tree all

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.710 
going to try to keep it on the tree all
the<00:02:21.900> time<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.710> I'm<00:02:22.890> not<00:02:23.130> saying<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:24.420> can't

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the time now I'm not saying you can't

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.750 
the time now I'm not saying you can't
keep<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> tree<00:02:25.740> all<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.920> time<00:02:26.310> you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
keep it on the tree all the time you

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.270 
keep it on the tree all the time you
certainly<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:28.050> if<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.470> only<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
certainly can and if you only have one a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.140 
certainly can and if you only have one a
few<00:02:29.820> trees<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.630> there<00:02:31.440> trees<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:32.130> are<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.060> a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
few trees and there trees that are in a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.350 
few trees and there trees that are in a
shady<00:02:33.480> location<00:02:34.250> then<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.460> can<00:02:35.640> certainly<00:02:35.910> do

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
shady location then you can certainly do

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.230 
shady location then you can certainly do
that<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.620> what<00:02:37.740> we've<00:02:37.890> done<00:02:38.130> here<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:39.030> we've

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
that and what we've done here is we've

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.530 
that and what we've done here is we've
taken<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.780> very<00:02:39.810> wide<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.890> shallow<00:02:41.160> pot<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.450> I

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
taken a very wide and shallow pot and I

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.380 
taken a very wide and shallow pot and I
bought<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.020> pot<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.740> put<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.490> tree<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.000> because

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
bought this pot to put a tree in because

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.630 
bought this pot to put a tree in because
I<00:02:45.420> really<00:02:45.870> love<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.320> pot<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:47.070> never<00:02:47.400> quite

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
I really love this pot but never quite

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.600 
I really love this pot but never quite
found<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.180> right<00:02:48.420> tree<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.610> it

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
found the right tree for it and it

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.580 
found the right tree for it and it
occurred<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.150> me<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.840> use<00:02:52.050> this<00:02:52.260> pot

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
occurred to me that we can use this pot

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.780 
occurred to me that we can use this pot
to<00:02:52.860> grow<00:02:53.040> moss<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.840> we're<00:02:55.800> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.980> use<00:02:56.250> soil

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
to grow moss so we're going to use soil

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.090 
to grow moss so we're going to use soil
here<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:58.020> this<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.350> different<00:02:58.770> from<00:02:58.920> my

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
here and this is different from my

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.430 
here and this is different from my
normal<00:02:59.370> mixture<00:03:00.060> there<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.780> no<00:03:00.990> decomposed

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
normal mixture there is no decomposed

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.160 
normal mixture there is no decomposed
granite<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.550> soil<00:03:02.850> there's<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.750> lot<00:03:03.959> more

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
granite in this soil there's a lot more

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.550 
granite in this soil there's a lot more
sand<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.940> reason<00:03:05.970> for<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:07.140> we

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
sand in it and the reason for that is we

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.470 
sand in it and the reason for that is we
actually<00:03:07.590> want<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.310> trap<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> fairly<00:03:09.270> high

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
actually want to trap a fairly high

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.560 
actually want to trap a fairly high
level<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:10.020> moisture<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.680> here<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.970> order<00:03:12.239> to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
level of moisture in here in order to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.160 
level of moisture in here in order to
keep<00:03:13.320> them<00:03:13.560> lost<00:03:13.800> growing<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.489> happy<00:03:15.170> now

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
keep them lost growing and happy now

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.930 
keep them lost growing and happy now
we're<00:03:16.320> going<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.590> keep<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.070> top<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.580> soil

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
we're going to keep the top of the soil

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.090 
we're going to keep the top of the soil
a<00:03:18.239> bit<00:03:18.270> below<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.050> lip<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.500> pot<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
a bit below the lip of the pot and the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.979 
a bit below the lip of the pot and the
reason<00:03:20.459> for<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:21.000> once<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.390> moss<00:03:21.690> gets

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
reason for that is once the moss gets

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.760 
reason for that is once the moss gets
going<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:23.220> can<00:03:23.459> actually<00:03:24.110> gain<00:03:25.110> quite<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.560> bit

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
going it can actually gain quite a bit

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.080 
going it can actually gain quite a bit
of<00:03:25.890> thickness<00:03:27.680> these<00:03:28.680> pieces<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.459> moss<00:03:29.670> here

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
of thickness these pieces of moss here

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.760 
of thickness these pieces of moss here
were<00:03:30.270> actually<00:03:30.450> harvested<00:03:31.290> from<00:03:31.440> another

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
were actually harvested from another

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.550 
were actually harvested from another
bone<00:03:32.040> site<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.870> they<00:03:33.870> were<00:03:33.930> getting<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
bone site and they were getting to the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.040 
bone site and they were getting to the
point<00:03:34.950> where<00:03:36.650> they<00:03:37.650> were<00:03:38.690> taking<00:03:39.690> over<00:03:39.959> the

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
point where they were taking over the

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.020 
point where they were taking over the
soil<00:03:40.350> what<00:03:40.680> we<00:03:40.860> did<00:03:41.040> was<00:03:41.250> we<00:03:41.400> pulled<00:03:41.700> them<00:03:41.850> off

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
soil what we did was we pulled them off

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.840 
soil what we did was we pulled them off
the<00:03:42.209> top<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.720> soil<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.770> we<00:03:44.370> got<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.580> little

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
the top of the soil and we got a little

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.540 
the top of the soil and we got a little
bit<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.180> soil<00:03:45.480> on<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.780> underside<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.890> then

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
bit of soil on the underside and then

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.610 
bit of soil on the underside and then
what<00:03:47.820> we'll<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.150> is<00:03:48.450> we'll<00:03:48.750> just<00:03:48.989> place<00:03:49.290> them

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
what we'll do is we'll just place them

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.190 
what we'll do is we'll just place them
here<00:03:49.650> in<00:03:50.209> this<00:03:51.209> pot<00:03:51.570> on<00:03:52.050> top<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.739> soil<00:03:54.200> and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
here in this pot on top of the soil and

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.740 
here in this pot on top of the soil and
now<00:03:55.470> we'll<00:03:55.650> talk<00:03:55.890> about<00:03:55.950> how<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.000> harvest<00:03:57.360> it

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
now we'll talk about how to harvest it

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.020 
now we'll talk about how to harvest it
now<00:03:57.900> if<00:03:58.020> you<00:03:58.080> don't<00:03:58.410> have<00:03:58.680> an<00:03:59.010> existing<00:03:59.579> bone

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
now if you don't have an existing bone

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.050 
now if you don't have an existing bone
side<00:04:00.329> with<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.720> good

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
side with a good

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.320 
side with a good
growth<00:04:01.209> of<00:04:01.480> moss<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:02.860> can<00:04:03.010> go<00:04:03.190> find<00:04:03.550> moss<00:04:03.910> in

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
growth of moss you can go find moss in

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.589 
growth of moss you can go find moss in
shady<00:04:04.900> locations<00:04:05.800> where<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.370> soil<00:04:06.730> is<00:04:07.120> a

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
shady locations where the soil is a

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.229 
shady locations where the soil is a
little<00:04:08.410> bit<00:04:08.590> muddy<00:04:08.860> or<00:04:09.099> silty<00:04:09.700> because<00:04:10.090> you

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
little bit muddy or silty because you

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.360 
little bit muddy or silty because you
need<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.450> situation<00:04:10.780> where<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.560> soil<00:04:11.860> retains

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
need a situation where the soil retains

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.449 
need a situation where the soil retains
a<00:04:12.550> good<00:04:12.730> bit<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:12.970> moisture<00:04:14.099> now<00:04:15.099> we'll<00:04:15.280> go<00:04:15.430> back

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
a good bit of moisture now we'll go back

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.360 
a good bit of moisture now we'll go back
to<00:04:15.910> our<00:04:15.940> change<00:04:16.389> down<00:04:16.840> here<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.829> when<00:04:18.190> the

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
to our change down here and when the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.449 
to our change down here and when the
moss<00:04:18.760> gets<00:04:19.150> like<00:04:19.450> this<00:04:19.750> that's<00:04:20.250> not<00:04:21.250> the

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
moss gets like this that's not the

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.960 
moss gets like this that's not the
healthiest<00:04:22.000> situation<00:04:22.720> for<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.050> trees<00:04:23.440> so

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
healthiest situation for the trees so

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.690 
healthiest situation for the trees so
what<00:04:24.970> we'll<00:04:25.150> do<00:04:25.360> is<00:04:25.600> we'll<00:04:25.810> just<00:04:26.430> peel<00:04:27.430> with

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
what we'll do is we'll just peel with

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:37.570 
what we'll do is we'll just peel with
something<00:04:28.060> like<00:04:28.210> this

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.119 

one<00:04:38.000> other<00:04:38.150> thing<00:04:38.629> when<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.050> get<00:04:39.229> moss<00:04:39.560> going

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
one other thing when you get moss going

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.990 
one other thing when you get moss going
up<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.430> sides<00:04:40.789> of<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.090> tree<00:04:41.419> trunk<00:04:42.580> on<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.639> pine

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
up the sides of the tree trunk on a pine

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.480 
up the sides of the tree trunk on a pine
or<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.240> Juniper<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.199> can<00:04:45.530> actually<00:04:45.770> rot<00:04:46.250> the

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
or a Juniper it can actually rot the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.270 
or a Juniper it can actually rot the
wood<00:04:46.699> at<00:04:46.909> the<00:04:47.030> base<00:04:47.240> of<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.599> tree<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.889> that's

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
wood at the base of the tree so that's

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.480 
wood at the base of the tree so that's
really<00:04:49.719> undesirable<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:51.800> we'll<00:04:52.069> just<00:04:52.250> take

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
really undesirable so we'll just take

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.600 
really undesirable so we'll just take
our<00:04:52.639> moss<00:04:52.879> out<00:04:53.210> of<00:04:53.389> here<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.919> we're<00:04:55.159> not<00:04:55.250> going

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
our moss out of here and we're not going

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.089 
our moss out of here and we're not going
to<00:04:55.699> take<00:04:55.969> all<00:04:56.240> of<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.750> off<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.530> elm<00:04:57.740> we're

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
to take all of it off the elm we're

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.300 
to take all of it off the elm we're
actually<00:04:58.310> going<00:04:58.699> to<00:04:58.939> leave<00:04:59.180> some<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:01.069> can

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
actually going to leave some so that can

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.679 
actually going to leave some so that can
kind<00:05:01.819> of<00:05:01.969> regenerate<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.770> that<00:05:04.699> gives<00:05:05.449> us

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:05.689 
kind of regenerate it and that gives us

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.420 
kind of regenerate it and that gives us
a<00:05:06.280> source<00:05:07.659> as<00:05:08.659> well<00:05:09.050> as<00:05:09.289> keep<00:05:09.889> some<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.370> the

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
a source as well as keep some of the

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.520 
a source as well as keep some of the
beauty<00:05:10.819> of<00:05:10.849> the<00:05:11.090> moss<00:05:11.360> without<00:05:11.900> imperiling

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
beauty of the moss without imperiling

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.830 
beauty of the moss without imperiling
the<00:05:12.650> health<00:05:12.889> of<00:05:13.069> the<00:05:13.190> trade<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:17.180> just<00:05:17.629> take

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
the health of the trade so just take

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.779 
the health of the trade so just take
these<00:05:18.020> pieces<00:05:18.409> of<00:05:18.740> moss<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.009> put<00:05:19.460> them<00:05:19.610> nail

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
these pieces of moss and put them nail

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.659 
these pieces of moss and put them nail
like<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.210> soil<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.500> it's<00:05:21.740> okay<00:05:22.129> to<00:05:22.159> use<00:05:22.430> this

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
like the soil and it's okay to use this

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.080 
like the soil and it's okay to use this
fine<00:05:23.090> stuff<00:05:23.590> on<00:05:24.590> top<00:05:25.069> of<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.400> tree<00:05:25.669> just<00:05:25.699> to

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
fine stuff on top of the tree just to

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.200 
fine stuff on top of the tree just to
kind<00:05:26.389> of<00:05:26.479> fill<00:05:26.779> in<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:28.520> that's<00:05:28.669> just<00:05:28.909> what

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
kind of fill in so that's just what

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.170 
kind of fill in so that's just what
we'll<00:05:29.360> do<00:05:29.569> here<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:31.490> that<00:05:31.819> will<00:05:31.940> actually

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
we'll do here and that will actually

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.279 
we'll do here and that will actually
encourage<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:33.080> moss<00:05:33.319> to<00:05:33.349> come<00:05:33.830> back<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:36.110> will

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
encourage the moss to come back it will

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.379 
encourage the moss to come back it will
just<00:05:36.500> kind<00:05:36.710> of<00:05:36.889> fill<00:05:37.159> that<00:05:37.370> in<00:05:38.169> like<00:05:39.169> that<00:05:40.389> now

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
just kind of fill that in like that now

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.089 
just kind of fill that in like that now
I<00:05:41.419> don't<00:05:41.659> know<00:05:41.900> that<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.139> would<00:05:42.379> do<00:05:42.560> this<00:05:42.740> with<00:05:43.069> a

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
I don't know that I would do this with a

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.029 
I don't know that I would do this with a
pine<00:05:43.930> because<00:05:44.930> they<00:05:45.110> really<00:05:45.440> like<00:05:45.650> free

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
pine because they really like free

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.709 
pine because they really like free
draining<00:05:46.550> soil<00:05:47.080> The<00:05:48.080> Elms<00:05:48.349> are<00:05:48.680> tolerant<00:05:49.279> of

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
draining soil The Elms are tolerant of

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.540 
draining soil The Elms are tolerant of
soil<00:05:50.719> that<00:05:50.930> holds<00:05:51.349> a<00:05:51.409> little<00:05:51.620> water<00:05:51.919> in<00:05:52.219> some

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
soil that holds a little water in some

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.600 
soil that holds a little water in some
cases<00:05:52.819> they<00:05:53.210> even<00:05:53.240> need<00:05:53.719> it<00:05:53.979> so<00:05:54.979> we'll<00:05:55.219> just<00:05:55.400> do

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
cases they even need it so we'll just do

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.110 
cases they even need it so we'll just do
like<00:05:55.789> that<00:05:56.860> now<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:57.919> last<00:05:58.190> thing<00:05:58.520> we'll<00:05:58.699> do<00:05:58.879> is

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
like that now the last thing we'll do is

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:10.409 
like that now the last thing we'll do is
we'll<00:05:59.779> do<00:06:00.169> a<00:06:00.199> little<00:06:00.529> watery

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.110 

what<00:06:11.020> I'm<00:06:11.110> going<00:06:11.349> to<00:06:11.409> do<00:06:11.650> here<00:06:12.069> is<00:06:12.250> I'm<00:06:12.909> going

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
what I'm going to do here is I'm going

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.119 
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to<00:06:13.240> set<00:06:13.569> the<00:06:13.689> nozzle<00:06:14.229> over<00:06:14.789> the<00:06:15.789> mist<00:06:16.150> on<00:06:17.129> the

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
to set the nozzle over the mist on the

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.909 
to set the nozzle over the mist on the
Elm<00:06:18.370> because<00:06:19.300> the<00:06:19.810> elms<00:06:20.110> already<00:06:20.439> been<00:06:20.650> water

Elm because the elms already been water

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.850 
Elm because the elms already been water
there's<00:06:21.340> plenty<00:06:21.669> of<00:06:21.759> water<00:06:22.000> in<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.300> soil<00:06:22.860> and

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
there's plenty of water in the soil and

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.860 
there's plenty of water in the soil and
we<00:06:24.069> just<00:06:24.310> need<00:06:24.520> moisture<00:06:25.120> to<00:06:25.270> get<00:06:25.419> the<00:06:25.569> fill

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
we just need moisture to get the fill

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:33.589 
we just need moisture to get the fill
and<00:06:25.900> soil<00:06:26.439> up<00:06:26.680> hole<00:06:30.360> so<00:06:31.360> that's<00:06:32.110> our<00:06:32.409> Elm<00:06:32.710> and

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
and soil up hole so that's our Elm and

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:40.740 
and soil up hole so that's our Elm and
we'll<00:06:34.599> return<00:06:34.750> that<00:06:35.259> to<00:06:35.289> the<00:06:35.530> garden<00:06:38.280> and<00:06:39.750> then

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
we'll return that to the garden and then

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.850 
we'll return that to the garden and then
we'll<00:06:41.020> actually<00:06:42.210> go<00:06:43.210> to<00:06:43.270> full<00:06:44.080> shower<00:06:44.439> mode

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
we'll actually go to full shower mode

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.679 
we'll actually go to full shower mode
for<00:06:45.250> our<00:06:45.370> flat<00:06:45.759> of<00:06:45.939> moss<00:06:46.210> here<00:06:51.120> and<00:06:52.120> get<00:06:52.449> plenty

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:52.689

for our flat of moss here and get plenty
of<00:06:52.900> water<00:06:53.169> in<00:06:53.409> the<00:06:53.529> soil<00:06:57.150> now<00:06:58.150> the<00:06:58.210> beauty<00:06:58.599> part

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
of water in the soil now the beauty part

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.990 
of water in the soil now the beauty part
of<00:06:58.960> growing<00:06:59.349> lost<00:06:59.650> separately<00:07:00.250> like<00:07:00.490> this<00:07:00.759> is

of growing lost separately like this is
you<00:07:01.180> can<00:07:01.360> give<00:07:01.629> as<00:07:01.840> much<00:07:02.050> shade<00:07:02.409> or<00:07:02.620> water<00:07:02.889> as
