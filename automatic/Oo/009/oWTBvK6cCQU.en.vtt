00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.970
 I met him very young. 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.220
 I was 16 years old and he was 14 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.230
 we next tava the Race Track 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.900
 racetrack and kart track 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.360
 so sometimes I would go there well 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.570
 AÃ­rton it was already very cool to see him 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.329
 guiding I was very famous in the kart track 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.140
 what was determined to be guided by them 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.940
 takes care of it were sensational everyone 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.129
 wanted to get the batteries he 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.850
 I participated in the passing of time. 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.329
 started to paint for him so he had already 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.949
 one more friendship and he ayrton had a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.129
 Eliana is a half-fan of my father and my 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.010
 Dad shouted for the expensive whemerson 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.490
 then a bump and other famous faces 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.710
 I really admired airton in Brazil. 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.369
 respect he always maintained for my 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.010
 dad 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.170
 He treated my father very fondly. 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.580
 and in the last 20 years 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.100
 I always wondered what it would be like 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.470
 airton painting today i think he 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.280
 it was not going to change very common is appearing 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.509
 here but we relax a little 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.090
 his painting and that's what I wanted 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.240
 produce here and from there I put some 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:46.869
 details are what these silences would be 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 thin here then those 21 are black and 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.610
 would be a tribute to his passing through the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.420
 lotus phenom was black 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.789
 this more cyclical red would be the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.530
 titles he won by mclaren 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:06.470
 there were three that blue would pass by 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.340
 williams and then he would go to the ferrari and 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.340
 I made this red ticket here. 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.560
 his passing by the Ferrari I think 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.980
 also that at least one title or two 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.049
 he would conquer I did mine 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.170
 dream and I believe everyone's dream 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.170
 the Brazilians
