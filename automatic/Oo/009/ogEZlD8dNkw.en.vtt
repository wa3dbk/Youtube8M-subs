00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.660
 Y 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.080
 is 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.830
 it depends on everyone 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.860
 some scissors part of fluids to be able 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:00.390
 cut the fabric 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 and the black 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.549
 a large needle to make it easier 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.549
 with the denim 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.060
 click it is a small one 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.119
 fins 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.220
 ah 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.549
 State textile paintings depend on 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.549
 colour 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.979
 the video 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.760
 glue with glitters that is very 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.600
 important to use the paint of the 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.600
 athletic 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 ah 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:05.920
 first we mark the edge of a place 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.869
 leaves each person as I wish I had 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.940
 of this mast that is only to emphasize what 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.670
 she is not very difficult that will be 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.440
 pretty simple and it's actually 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.150
 quite simple and that they are 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.360
 doing what you like 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.360
 the shape and design is quite something 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.900
 then already market we take the scissors 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.300
 If it's too small, I recommend you 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.640
 I miss adult because normally 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.630
 these scissors are very curious you can 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.630
 cut martÃ­nez 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.510
 only aesthetics 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.600
 be careful because these cuts are 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.600
 they will repeat good 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:08.010
 once you have cut it is time to paint 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.010
 the afternoon since on this side 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.989
 we are going to present it 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.989
 the figure is very individual 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:38.110
 we just mark the lines with a lot 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.819
 care and they also depend on how 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.549
 width height everything very individual of each 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.910
 person how big your hand is and 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:52.209
 bleeding valleys the galette software is 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.489
 an eternal for that now yes to paint it 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.079
 to paint it is very simple but more 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.079
 the paintings she 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.890
 once it's painted it's time to put the 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.430
 protective layer for training 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.500
 with glitter this glue serves very 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.720
 important but you should not type to 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.720
 that the glue that from top to bottom 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:29.620
 because it does not end here and we're going to paint it 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.620
 with this brightness 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.900
 to paint it he advanced uniform lines 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:41.020
 and always the same side so that it is 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.020
 best 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:49.219
 the truth I did two and one I stay very 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.650
 thick and you looked at it as an origin 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:57.349
 after facing the river that we do not want 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:04.569
 be in front of being perfect 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:04.569
 since we wanted 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:17.150
 although this one but also what is not 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:19.900
 forget a good character for him 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.900
 poor 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.090
 once already painted with all of them and 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:37.380
 dry and it's time to cut the button today is 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:40.590
 crazy but I will tell you how the needle and the 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.850
 thread as the measure of people who do not 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.850
 they can do it 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.420
 here we are comparing how big it is 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.920
 the needle to facilitate us since a 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.920
 small needle can be folded 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.520
 we put down 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.500
 everything anyone then 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:16.069
 when we lift it to the ice until 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.769
 up and we put it with the holes 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:21.959
 once down we put the sheet back 

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:24.089
 down towards the other building that 

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:26.599
 is on one side and we pass on to the other and 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.599
 so on 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.720
 very good because after this they are going to 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:37.190
 to tight 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.610
 we are active and can not ask for help 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.610
 no matter
