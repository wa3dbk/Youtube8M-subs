we<00:00:00.390> are<00:00:00.450> talking<00:00:00.599> about<00:00:01.490> innovations<00:00:02.490> today

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.020 
we are talking about innovations today

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.990 
we are talking about innovations today
because<00:00:04.020> when<00:00:04.440> we<00:00:04.589> go<00:00:04.799> through<00:00:05.160> all<00:00:05.850> this

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
because when we go through all this

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.730 
because when we go through all this
terrain<00:00:06.359> especially<00:00:06.690> when<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.500> full

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
terrain especially when this is full

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.430 
terrain especially when this is full
here<00:00:08.069> we<00:00:08.250> can<00:00:08.429> see<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.730> all<00:00:09.330> these<00:00:09.660> cars<00:00:09.960> all

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
here we can see the all these cars all

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.039 
here we can see the all these cars all
these<00:00:10.710> vehicles<00:00:11.010> let's<00:00:11.700> see<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.809> there<00:00:13.019> is

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
these vehicles let's see that there is

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.259 
these vehicles let's see that there is
one<00:00:13.349> thread<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.860> our<00:00:13.950> history<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.730> this

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
one thread in our history and this

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.150 
one thread in our history and this
thread<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.630> innovation<00:00:16.410> because<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.890> can't

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
thread is innovation because you can't

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.790 
thread is innovation because you can't
go<00:00:17.460> through<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.270> history<00:00:18.960> without

it's not that human liver but it's a

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.550 
it's not that human liver but it's a
first<00:02:09.410> prototype<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.850> human<00:02:11.240> plan<00:02:11.600> so
