level headphone amplifier in fact you
hardly<00:04:44.190> can<00:04:44.430> call<00:04:44.729> it<00:04:44.909> an<00:04:45.030> amplifier<00:04:45.659> because

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
hardly can call it an amplifier because

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.100 
hardly can call it an amplifier because
this<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:46.740> also<00:04:47.220> new<00:04:47.400> approach<00:04:47.789> where<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:48.900> don't

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
this is also new approach where we don't

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.460 
this is also new approach where we don't
need<00:04:49.289> extra<00:04:49.889> stages<00:04:50.190> we<00:04:50.729> can<00:04:50.970> simply<00:04:51.449> use<00:04:52.229> an

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
need extra stages we can simply use an

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.649 
need extra stages we can simply use an

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
IV convertor in a clever way so it's
