I build some stairs all the way down to
the<00:03:58.470> bottom<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.980> Minecraft<00:03:59.520> I<00:03:59.670> didn't<00:03:59.880> want<00:04:00.030> to

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
the bottom of Minecraft I didn't want to

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.380 
the bottom of Minecraft I didn't want to
use<00:04:00.290> ladders<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:01.920> frankly<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.090> takes

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
use ladders because frankly that takes

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.030 
use ladders because frankly that takes

stairs<00:04:10.620> since<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.459> am<00:04:11.489> mining<00:04:12.060> I'm<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:12.330> to<00:04:12.420> be

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
stairs since I am mining I'm going to be

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.020 
stairs since I am mining I'm going to be

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
using a bunch of cobblestone on might as

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.610 
using a bunch of cobblestone on might as
well<00:04:15.180> just<00:04:15.390> use<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.810> stairs<00:04:18.320> one<00:04:19.320> thing<00:04:19.530> i
