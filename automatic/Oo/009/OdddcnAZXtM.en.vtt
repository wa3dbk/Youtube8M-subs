with hard courts this year for some
reason<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.350> think<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.980> coordination<00:02:36.640> was<00:02:36.760> my

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
reason I think the coordination was my

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.550 
reason I think the coordination was my
footwork<00:02:37.359> the<00:02:37.630> whole<00:02:37.780> thing<00:02:37.989> wasn't<00:02:38.320> really

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
footwork the whole thing wasn't really

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.860 
footwork the whole thing wasn't really
going<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.310> way<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.459> was<00:02:39.670> hoping<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.329> to<00:02:40.510> go<00:02:40.660> and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
going the way I was hoping it to go and

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.650
