release you pick the f-stop and focus it
which<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.250> very<00:00:50.489> simple<00:00:50.879> matter<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.690> it's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
which is very simple matter because it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.170 
which is very simple matter because it's
a<00:00:51.930> little<00:00:52.079> rangefinder<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:53.969> pick

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
a little rangefinder and it will pick

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.459 
a little rangefinder and it will pick
the<00:00:54.329> shutter<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:56.010> has<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> little<00:00:56.640> feature<00:00:56.879> here

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
the shutter it has a little feature here

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.830 
the shutter it has a little feature here
which<00:00:58.469> gives<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.859> backlight<00:00:59.510> situations<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
which gives you backlight situations and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.799 
which gives you backlight situations and
a<00:01:01.050> self<00:01:01.289> timer<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.859> well<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.359> course<00:01:03.420> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
a self timer as well and of course it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.359 
a self timer as well and of course it
takes<00:01:04.019> thirty<00:01:04.379> five-millimeter<00:01:04.880> don't<00:01:07.369> why

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
takes thirty five-millimeter don't why

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.170 
takes thirty five-millimeter don't why
would<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.670> use<00:01:08.850> 35<00:01:09.390> millimeter<00:01:09.930> film

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
would you use 35 millimeter film

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
would you use 35 millimeter film

here with a little bit of scanning will

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.819 
here with a little bit of scanning will
actually<00:01:40.560> help<00:01:40.920> shoot<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:42.030> other<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.770> how<00:01:43.770> do

actually help shoot the other one how do

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.580 
actually help shoot the other one how do
they<00:01:44.009> compare<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.640> size<00:01:48.200> contacts<00:01:49.200> has<00:01:49.409> got

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
they compare for size contacts has got

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.249 
they compare for size contacts has got
to<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> roll<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.280> film<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.259> it's

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
to have a roll of film in it so it's

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.889 
to have a roll of film in it so it's
going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:52.920> fatter<00:01:53.630> but<00:01:54.630> there's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
going to be a little fatter but there's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.950 
going to be a little fatter but there's
an<00:01:55.020> ergonomics<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.700> both<00:01:56.909> these<00:01:57.180> cameras<00:01:57.719> they

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
an ergonomics to both these cameras they

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.350
