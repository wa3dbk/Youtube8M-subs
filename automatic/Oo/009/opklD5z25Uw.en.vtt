00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the Santa Monica Pier and as we do

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.799 
the Santa Monica Pier and as we do
you're<00:00:32.880> gonna<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> few<00:00:33.329> people<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.780> there

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you're gonna see a few people out there

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.720 
you're gonna see a few people out there
a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.649> bit<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.950> cloud<00:00:35.130> cover<00:00:35.160> pretty

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
a little bit of cloud cover pretty

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.910 
a little bit of cloud cover pretty
minimal<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.390> point<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:36.930> again<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.739> are

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
minimal at this point but again we are

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
minimal at this point but again we are
dealing<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.520> mostly<00:00:38.969> high<00:00:39.329> cloud<00:00:39.660> cover

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
dealing with it mostly high cloud cover

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.869 
dealing with it mostly high cloud cover
so<00:00:40.200> that's<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> cloud<00:00:41.219> cover<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.579> really

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so that's the cloud cover that really

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
so that's the cloud cover that really
allowed<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> sunshine<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.110> shine<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.500> earlier

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
allowed the sunshine to shine in earlier

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.229 
allowed the sunshine to shine in earlier
today<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.250> by<00:00:44.370> tomorrow<00:00:44.579> we're<00:00:45.120> actually

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
today and by tomorrow we're actually

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.000 
today and by tomorrow we're actually
expecting<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.350> bit<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.530> low<00:00:46.710> cloud

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
expecting a little bit of low cloud

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.380 
expecting a little bit of low cloud
cover<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.430> heading<00:00:47.700> our<00:00:47.820> way<00:00:47.850> because<00:00:48.090> low

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
cover it's heading our way because low

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.869 
cover it's heading our way because low
pressure<00:00:48.690> sitting<00:00:49.079> right<00:00:49.590> offshore<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.700> with

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
pressure sitting right offshore so with

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.430 
pressure sitting right offshore so with
that<00:00:51.000> we'll<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.239> cooler<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.870> cloudier<00:00:52.020> will

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440

sunshine<00:01:40.439> we're<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.740> reintroducing<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
sunshine we're actually reintroducing a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.800 
sunshine we're actually reintroducing a
little<00:01:41.729> bit<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.909> low<00:01:42.000> cloud<00:01:42.270> cover<00:01:42.570> into<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
little bit of low cloud cover into the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.870 
little bit of low cloud cover into the
mix<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.229> cooling<00:01:43.860> temperatures<00:01:44.130> down<00:01:44.549> pretty

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
mix and cooling temperatures down pretty

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.100 
mix and cooling temperatures down pretty
much<00:01:44.970> across<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.689> board

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
much across the board

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170 
much across the board
as<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.590> head<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> tomorrow<00:01:46.890> getting<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> look<00:01:48.000> at

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
as we head to tomorrow getting a look at

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.060 
as we head to tomorrow getting a look at
Mount<00:01:48.479> Wilson<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:49.110> now<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.350> are<00:01:49.740> dealing

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
Mount Wilson right now you are dealing

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.359 
Mount Wilson right now you are dealing
with

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
with

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
with
well<00:01:50.729> mostly<00:01:51.450> clear<00:01:51.750> conditions<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.680> take<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
well mostly clear conditions but take a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.789 
well mostly clear conditions but take a
look<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.000> very<00:01:54.329> upper<00:01:55.079> portion<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.680> your

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
look in the very upper portion of your

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.889 
look in the very upper portion of your
screen<00:01:55.860> we're<00:01:56.790> looking<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.180> high<00:01:57.360> clouds<00:01:57.689> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
screen we're looking at high clouds so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:58.940 
screen we're looking at high clouds so
we're<00:01:58.020> saying<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.350> mostly<00:01:58.619> clear<00:01:58.799> high

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
we're saying it's mostly clear high

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.889 
we're saying it's mostly clear high
clouds<00:01:59.250> really<00:01:59.520> let<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> sunshine<00:02:00.509> come

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
clouds really let the sunshine come

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.359 
clouds really let the sunshine come
through<00:02:01.110> earlier<00:02:01.469> today<00:02:01.799> they're<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:02.250> not

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
through earlier today they're really not

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.560 
through earlier today they're really not
clouding<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:02.969> we're<00:02:03.119> still<00:02:03.210> looking<00:02:03.540> at

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
clouding this in we're still looking at

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.149 
clouding this in we're still looking at
night<00:02:03.810> sky<00:02:04.079> out<00:02:04.290> there<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> most<00:02:04.920> part

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
night sky out there for the most part

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.010 
night sky out there for the most part
and<00:02:05.460> we're<00:02:05.700> gonna<00:02:05.820> continue<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.659> as

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and we're gonna continue to see that as

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.719 
and we're gonna continue to see that as
we<00:02:07.500> head<00:02:07.680> into<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.890> overnight<00:02:07.920> hours<00:02:08.280> here

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
we head into the overnight hours here

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
we head into the overnight hours here
but<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.030> are<00:02:09.060> bracing<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:09.840> maybe<00:02:10.200> some<00:02:10.410> low

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
but we are bracing for maybe some low

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.440 
but we are bracing for maybe some low
cloud<00:02:10.950> cover<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.370> come<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.670> low<00:02:12.120> pressure

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
cloud cover to come in low pressure

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.700 
cloud cover to come in low pressure
building<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.230> actually

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
building it's actually

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.220 
building it's actually
to<00:02:14.010> our<00:02:14.130> West<00:02:14.520> right<00:02:14.940> now<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.600> it's

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
to our West right now and with that it's

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.020 
to our West right now and with that it's
bringing<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.710> cooler<00:02:16.980> temperatures<00:02:17.430> partly

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
bringing in cooler temperatures partly

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.550 
bringing in cooler temperatures partly
cloudy<00:02:18.270> conditions<00:02:18.480> by<00:02:18.840> tomorrow<00:02:19.170> afternoon

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
cloudy conditions by tomorrow afternoon

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.370 
cloudy conditions by tomorrow afternoon
and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.280> high<00:02:20.520> pressure<00:02:20.900> rebuilding<00:02:21.900> into

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
and then high pressure rebuilding into

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.690 
and then high pressure rebuilding into
Southern<00:02:22.650> California<00:02:23.160> as<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:23.340> head<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
Southern California as we head to the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.340 
Southern California as we head to the
later<00:02:24.000> part<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.510> week<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.900> we'll<00:02:25.080> have

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
later part of the week so we'll have

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
second you'll see earlier today we got

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.620 
second you'll see earlier today we got
to<00:02:28.950> 70<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.550> we<00:02:29.730> cooled<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> down<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.300> few<00:02:30.510> degrees

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
to 70 so we cooled it down a few degrees

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.090 
to 70 so we cooled it down a few degrees
yesterday<00:02:31.020> downtown<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.710> got<00:02:31.860> up<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.070> about

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
yesterday downtown you got up to about

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.430 
yesterday downtown you got up to about
73<00:02:32.850> degrees<00:02:33.150> today<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.750> got<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.080> 70

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
73 degrees today you got up to 70

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.110 
73 degrees today you got up to 70
degrees<00:02:34.530> average<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.280> 68<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.970> were<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
degrees average is 68 so you were a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.240 
degrees average is 68 so you were a
couple<00:02:36.360> degrees<00:02:36.600> below<00:02:37.530> or<00:02:37.740> above<00:02:37.950> average

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
couple degrees below or above average

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.100

excuse me for this time of year tomorrow
you're<00:02:40.650> gonna<00:02:40.710> hit<00:02:41.070> average<00:02:41.460> for<00:02:41.670> downtown<00:02:42.120> 68

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
you're gonna hit average for downtown 68

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.350 
you're gonna hit average for downtown 68
degrees<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.890> cooler<00:02:44.220> but<00:02:44.640> again<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.180> is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
degrees so it's cooler but again this is

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.460 
degrees so it's cooler but again this is
pretty<00:02:45.690> much<00:02:45.840> where<00:02:46.020> we<00:02:46.050> should<00:02:46.350> be

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
pretty much where we should be

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.260 
pretty much where we should be
temperatures<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.580> well<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> little<00:02:48.090> bit<00:02:48.180> of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
temperatures and well a little bit of

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.670 
temperatures and well a little bit of
cloud<00:02:48.450> cover<00:02:48.480> tomorrow<00:02:49.020> so<00:02:49.320> things<00:02:49.560> are

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
cloud cover tomorrow so things are

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.380 
cloud cover tomorrow so things are
changing<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.190> way<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.400> cloud<00:02:50.610> cover<00:02:50.850> low

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
changing in the way of cloud cover low

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.330 
changing in the way of cloud cover low
clouds<00:02:51.750> actually<00:02:52.050> coming<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.100> little
