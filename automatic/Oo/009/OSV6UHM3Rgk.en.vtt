00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
okay well here's my pond

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:13.330 
okay well here's my pond
or<00:00:04.170> outdoor<00:00:04.650> fish<00:00:04.920> aquarium<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:08.900> did<00:00:10.880> yeah

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
or outdoor fish aquarium I did yeah

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.860 
or outdoor fish aquarium I did yeah
so<00:00:14.340> that's<00:00:14.519> my<00:00:14.700> homemade<00:00:15.000> aerated<00:00:15.540> bottom

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
so that's my homemade aerated bottom

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.330 
so that's my homemade aerated bottom
drain<00:00:16.109> can't<00:00:16.560> really<00:00:16.770> see<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.070> because<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
drain can't really see it because the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.849 
drain can't really see it because the
waters<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.699> crazy<00:00:18.140> but<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.199> feeds<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
waters a little crazy but that feeds a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.580 
waters a little crazy but that feeds a
Raceway<00:00:20.189> down<00:00:20.609> there<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> four<00:00:22.470> inch

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
Raceway down there and to the four inch

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.179 
Raceway down there and to the four inch
bottom<00:00:23.039> drain<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:24.050> that<00:00:25.050> bond<00:00:25.439> rain<00:00:25.650> pops<00:00:25.980> up

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
bottom drain and that bond rain pops up

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.790 
bottom drain and that bond rain pops up
in<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> Raceway<00:00:27.199> out<00:00:28.199> there<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.590> corner

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
in the Raceway out there at the corner

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.820 
in the Raceway out there at the corner
and<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.760> around<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.119> corner<00:00:30.470> down<00:00:31.470> along

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and it's around the corner down along

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.130 
and it's around the corner down along
I've<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.579> some<00:00:32.850> matting<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.020> help

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
I've got some matting there to help

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.720 
I've got some matting there to help
catch<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> algae<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.340> I've<00:00:35.579> been

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
catch some of the algae that I've been

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.880 
catch some of the algae that I've been
wiping<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> UV<00:00:36.660> sort<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> wind

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
wiping out with the UV sort of the wind

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.590 
wiping out with the UV sort of the wind
of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> filters<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.640> those<00:00:38.730> always<00:00:39.270> there

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
of the filters and those always there

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.869 
of the filters and those always there
then<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.469> Raceway<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:40.950> fed<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.489> skimmer

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
then that Raceway is fed to a skimmer

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
then that Raceway is fed to a skimmer
and<00:00:42.149> then<00:00:43.079> from<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> skimmer<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:43.800> pulling

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and then from the skimmer I'm pulling

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.610 
and then from the skimmer I'm pulling
off<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> 50<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.690> 300<00:00:46.170> or<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.410> off

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
off of it with a 50 the 300 or so off

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.010 
off of it with a 50 the 300 or so off
the<00:00:46.770> flow<00:00:46.920> pump<00:00:47.510> through<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> check<00:00:48.809> Bob

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the flow pump through the check Bob

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.770 
the flow pump through the check Bob
there<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:50.030> then<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.390> run<00:00:52.489> along<00:00:53.489> through<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.360> UV

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
there and then I run along through a UV

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.279 
there and then I run along through a UV
light<00:00:55.309> up<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:56.850> homemade<00:00:57.210> filters<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
light up to my homemade filters that you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.979 
light up to my homemade filters that you
can<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> background<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.570> will

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
can see in the background there and will

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.219 
can see in the background there and will
now<00:01:01.140> wander<00:01:01.649> over<00:01:01.680> there

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.749 

the<00:01:10.229> other<00:01:10.439> thing

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
the other thing

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.340 
the other thing
so<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> four-inch<00:01:12.659> translation<00:01:13.229> goes

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so the four-inch translation goes

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.789 
so the four-inch translation goes
through<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> Raceway<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.869> fed<00:01:16.649> in

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
through the Raceway and then it's fed in

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
through the Raceway and then it's fed in
a<00:01:16.890> two-inch<00:01:17.220> line<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.060> first<00:01:18.390> up

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
a two-inch line you can just first up

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.880 
a two-inch line you can just first up
which<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.990> an<00:01:19.140> area

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.620 

don't<00:01:23.369> seem<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.579> get<00:01:23.670> any<00:01:23.729> solids<00:01:24.329> in<00:01:24.450> there

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
don't seem to get any solids in there

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
don't seem to get any solids in there
which<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.960> good<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.490> gravity

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
which is good and then that gravity

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.830 
which is good and then that gravity
feeds<00:01:27.119> over<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.659> tote<00:01:28.340> which<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.750> more<00:01:30.750> or

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
feeds over to this tote which is more or

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
feeds over to this tote which is more or
less<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.500> gonna<00:01:31.679> use<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.039> big<00:01:32.189> void<00:01:32.399> space

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
less I'm gonna use the big void space

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.060 
less I'm gonna use the big void space
around<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.149> garbage<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:34.170> my<00:01:34.829> eating

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
the bottom you can see the little

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.359 
the bottom you can see the little
half-inch<00:01:55.079> line<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.679> there<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.069> feeds

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
half-inch line down there that feeds

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.819 
half-inch line down there that feeds
into<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> garbage<00:01:56.909> head<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.140> about<00:01:58.500> four

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
into the garbage head and about four

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.120 
into the garbage head and about four
right<00:01:59.459> there<00:01:59.689> so<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.840> boil<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.500> media<00:02:01.890> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
right there so I can boil that media to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.529 
right there so I can boil that media to
clean<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.459> up<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.380> dump<00:02:04.709> it<00:02:05.270> there's<00:02:06.270> my

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
clean it up and then dump it there's my

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.410 
clean it up and then dump it there's my
homemade<00:02:07.110> foam<00:02:07.349> fraction<00:02:07.860> err<00:02:08.420> everything

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
homemade foam fraction err everything

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.080 
homemade foam fraction err everything
your<00:02:09.509> honor<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.840> seems<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.110> be<00:02:10.229> homemade<00:02:11.090> it's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
your honor it seems to be homemade it's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.160 
your honor it seems to be homemade it's
not<00:02:12.239> really<00:02:12.390> producing<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.840> much<00:02:12.959> foam

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
not really producing that much foam

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.110 
not really producing that much foam
anymore<00:02:13.590> but<00:02:13.799> I<00:02:14.160> think<00:02:14.430> we're<00:02:14.579> over<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.910> curb

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
anymore but I think we're over the curb

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.309 
anymore but I think we're over the curb
there<00:02:15.890> actually<00:02:16.890> does<00:02:17.010> work<00:02:17.190> very<00:02:17.220> good

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
there actually does work very good

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.509 
there actually does work very good
completely<00:02:19.319> by<00:02:19.440> accident<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:20.069> just<00:02:20.250> looked<00:02:20.400> at

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
completely by accident I just looked at

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.030 
completely by accident I just looked at
a<00:02:20.549> couple<00:02:20.670> pictures<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.739> was<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:22.890> getting

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
a couple pictures and I was just getting

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.949 
a couple pictures and I was just getting
the<00:02:23.250> height<00:02:23.400> set<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:23.940> right<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.540> produce<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
the height set just right to produce the

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.440 
the height set just right to produce the
foam<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.170> did<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.769> anyways<00:02:26.549> this<00:02:26.970> second

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
foam that did it so anyways this second

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.720 
foam that did it so anyways this second
tote<00:02:27.660> here<00:02:28.019> comes<00:02:28.380> out<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.680> four<00:02:29.310> inch<00:02:29.459> line

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
tote here comes out this four inch line

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.490 
tote here comes out this four inch line
you<00:02:30.720> see<00:02:30.900> right<00:02:31.049> there

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
you see right there

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.599 
you see right there
and<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:32.519> goes<00:02:32.700> into<00:02:32.850> my<00:02:33.030> homemade<00:02:33.299> spillway

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
and that goes into my homemade spillway

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.030 
and that goes into my homemade spillway
that<00:02:35.609> I<00:02:36.239> had<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.569> build<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.620> actually<00:02:37.920> goes

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
that I had to build it actually goes

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.680 
that I had to build it actually goes
down<00:02:38.220> about<00:02:38.340> five<00:02:38.670> feet<00:02:38.910> down<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.389> the<00:02:39.480> ground

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
down about five feet down in the ground

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.330 
down about five feet down in the ground
because<00:02:39.900> when<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.650> was<00:02:40.680> too<00:02:40.889> shallow<00:02:41.160> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
because when it was too shallow the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.430 
because when it was too shallow the
water<00:02:41.459> was<00:02:41.819> kind<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.030> coming<00:02:42.269> out<00:02:42.420> there<00:02:42.690> like

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
water was kind of coming out there like

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.050 
water was kind of coming out there like
a<00:02:43.470> jet<00:02:43.829> stream<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.430> lot<00:02:44.609> less<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:44.850> a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
a jet stream and a lot less like a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.420 
a jet stream and a lot less like a
waterfall

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
waterfall

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.349 
waterfall
so<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.819> actually<00:02:48.480> worked<00:02:48.780> out<00:02:48.870> okay<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.650> then

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
so I actually worked out okay and then

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.920 
so I actually worked out okay and then
the<00:02:51.359> skimmer<00:02:51.660> line<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.440> there<00:02:53.569> fed<00:02:54.569> by<00:02:54.690> another

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
the skimmer line is there fed by another

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.039 
the skimmer line is there fed by another
fifty<00:02:55.440> three<00:02:55.650> hundred<00:02:55.680> gallon<00:02:56.370> pump<00:02:57.049> that

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
fifty three hundred gallon pump that

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.490 
fifty three hundred gallon pump that
pushes<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.680> water<00:02:58.889> around<00:02:59.489> the<00:03:00.000> totes<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.540> up

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
pushes the water around the totes and up

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.390 
pushes the water around the totes and up
to<00:03:01.859> my<00:03:02.280> homemade<00:03:02.700> lucky<00:03:03.090> shot

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.229 

a<00:03:05.480> little<00:03:06.480> spray<00:03:06.689> bar<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.170> up<00:03:07.319> there<00:03:08.000> we<00:03:09.000> see

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
a little spray bar for up there we see

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.970 
a little spray bar for up there we see
it<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.540> then<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.959> put<00:03:09.989> some<00:03:10.140> matting<00:03:10.500> over<00:03:10.799> top

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
it and then I put some matting over top

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.410 
it and then I put some matting over top
just<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.250> keep<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.519> splashing<00:03:11.909> under<00:03:12.060> control

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
just to keep the splashing under control

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.380 
just to keep the splashing under control
but<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.750> top<00:03:12.930> two<00:03:13.110> trays<00:03:13.409> are<00:03:14.280> k1<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
but the top two trays are k1 and the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.509 
but the top two trays are k1 and the
bottom<00:03:15.720> two<00:03:15.840> trays<00:03:16.049> are<00:03:16.230> live<00:03:16.349> a<00:03:16.379> rock<00:03:16.680> soon

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
bottom two trays are live a rock soon

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.429 
bottom two trays are live a rock soon
all<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.090> be<00:03:18.239> replaced<00:03:18.599> with<00:03:18.930> feather

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
all of it to be replaced with feather

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.160 
all of it to be replaced with feather
rock<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.299> then<00:03:21.299> after<00:03:21.659> those<00:03:21.840> through<00:03:22.079> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
rock and then after those through the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.800 
rock and then after those through the
Bakke<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.709> cat<00:03:23.250> collects<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.239> hundred

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
Bakke it cat collects in this hundred

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.470 
Bakke it cat collects in this hundred
gallon<00:03:25.019> Rubbermaid<00:03:25.939> water<00:03:26.939> sensible

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
gallon Rubbermaid water sensible

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.050 
gallon Rubbermaid water sensible
half-full<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.319> think<00:03:28.379> and<00:03:28.739> then<00:03:29.189> it<00:03:29.879> goes

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
half-full like I think and then it goes

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.089 
half-full like I think and then it goes
through<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.359> four<00:03:30.629> inch<00:03:30.780> line<00:03:31.049> which<00:03:31.859> shoots

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
through that four inch line which shoots

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.099 
through that four inch line which shoots
between<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.579> tubs<00:03:32.879> and<00:03:33.859> comes<00:03:34.859> out<00:03:35.129> here<00:03:36.109> it

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
between the tubs and comes out here it

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.110 
between the tubs and comes out here it
goes<00:03:37.319> back<00:03:37.590> into<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.920> pond<00:03:38.159> and<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.849> helps

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
goes back into the pond and it helps

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.240 
goes back into the pond and it helps
keep<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.569> current<00:03:40.349> going<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:43.250> three

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
keep the current going and three

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.920 
keep the current going and three
airlines<00:03:44.609> going<00:03:45.030> into<00:03:45.180> my<00:03:45.329> shed<00:03:45.629> where<00:03:45.840> I've

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
airlines going into my shed where I've

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.080 
airlines going into my shed where I've
got<00:03:46.109> two<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:47.120> v1<00:03:48.120> 50s<00:03:48.599> and<00:03:49.019> one<00:03:49.290> eighty<00:03:49.620> fifty<00:03:50.129> so

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
got two a v1 50s and one eighty fifty so

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.660 
got two a v1 50s and one eighty fifty so
one<00:03:51.389> of<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.540> 150s<00:03:52.109> is<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:52.739> charge<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:54.720> and

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
one of the 150s is in charge of that and

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.240 
one of the 150s is in charge of that and
I<00:03:56.670> switch<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.269> over<00:03:57.389> of<00:03:57.629> course<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.079> oil<00:03:58.950> the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
I switch it over of course the oil the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.670 
I switch it over of course the oil the
static<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.819> clean<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.810> other<00:04:00.930> one<00:04:01.079> 50s<00:04:01.530> on

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
static to clean it the other one 50s on

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.470 
static to clean it the other one 50s on
the<00:04:01.769> bottom<00:04:02.099> drain<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.790> think<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.269> might

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the bottom drain and I think that might

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.500 
the bottom drain and I think that might
be<00:04:03.629> a<00:04:03.659> little<00:04:03.959> excessive<00:04:04.470> for<00:04:04.859> air<00:04:05.010> but<00:04:05.510> the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
be a little excessive for air but the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.530 
be a little excessive for air but the
fish<00:04:06.689> don't<00:04:06.870> seem<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.230> mind<00:04:07.409> and<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:08.359> can<00:04:09.359> always

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
fish don't seem to mind and I can always

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.909 
fish don't seem to mind and I can always
shut<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.780> off<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.930> pen<00:04:10.199> you<00:04:10.319> just<00:04:10.500> see<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.769> koi

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
shut it off a pen you just see the koi

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.729 
shut it off a pen you just see the koi
and<00:04:11.190> then<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.239> little<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.780> B<00:04:12.989> 50<00:04:13.349> is<00:04:13.500> just

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
and then the little a B 50 is just

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.920 
and then the little a B 50 is just
pumping<00:04:14.220> away<00:04:14.340> on<00:04:14.459> my<00:04:14.760> little<00:04:14.940> foam<00:04:15.419> fraction

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
pumping away on my little foam fraction

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.640 
pumping away on my little foam fraction
er<00:04:16.400> all<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.579> it<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:18.209> connected<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.019> dreams<00:04:19.500> of

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
er all of it is connected to dreams of

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.680 
er all of it is connected to dreams of
peace<00:04:19.799> on<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.070> totes<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:21.000> lower<00:04:21.150> drain<00:04:21.479> just

peace on the totes the lower drain just

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.629 
peace on the totes the lower drain just
if<00:04:21.840> I'm<00:04:21.959> really<00:04:22.229> given<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.530> good<00:04:22.680> cleaning<00:04:22.949> but

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
if I'm really given a good cleaning but

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.950 
if I'm really given a good cleaning but

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.540 
not I have my own drains that I've
installed<00:04:25.110> on<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.620> sides<00:04:25.889> there<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.430> can

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
installed on the sides there you can

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.570 
installed on the sides there you can
kind<00:04:26.789> of<00:04:26.849> see<00:04:27.030> them<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.780> then<00:04:28.530> Bakke<00:04:29.310> drain

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
kind of see them and then Bakke drain

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.210 
kind of see them and then Bakke drain
and<00:04:29.880> all<00:04:30.120> that<00:04:30.479> good<00:04:30.630> stuff<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:31.139> goes<00:04:32.039> around

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
and all that good stuff that goes around

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.969 
and all that good stuff that goes around
the<00:04:32.880> shed<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.570> underneath<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.320> fence<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.949> a

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
the shed and underneath the fence to a

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.700 
the shed and underneath the fence to a
sump<00:04:35.430> on<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.330> other<00:04:36.479> side<00:04:36.659> of<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.840> fence<00:04:37.020> it's

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
sump on the other side of the fence it's

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.990 
sump on the other side of the fence it's
our<00:04:37.860> property<00:04:38.099> behind<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.580> fence<00:04:38.789> as<00:04:38.970> well

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
our property behind the fence as well

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.020 
our property behind the fence as well
but<00:04:39.419> this<00:04:40.289> way<00:04:40.500> we<00:04:40.650> don't<00:04:40.770> have<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:41.159> have<00:04:41.880> the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
but this way we don't have to have the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.800 
but this way we don't have to have the
sump<00:04:42.300> there<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.630> smelly<00:04:42.990> or<00:04:43.110> anything<00:04:43.830> else

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
sump there and smelly or anything else

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.870 
sump there and smelly or anything else
so<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:45.870> guess<00:04:46.020> that's<00:04:46.229> about<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:49.760> I'm<00:04:50.760> gonna

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
so I guess that's about it and I'm gonna

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.020 
so I guess that's about it and I'm gonna
see<00:04:51.060> if<00:04:51.120> there's<00:04:51.270> any<00:04:51.389> food<00:04:51.599> for<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.900> fish
