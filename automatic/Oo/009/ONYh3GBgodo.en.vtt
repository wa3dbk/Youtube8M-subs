friendly rivalry thing going on drew and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.460

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
moment to now we are thrown in this

moment to now we are thrown in this
little<00:02:51.830> room<00:02:51.860> but<00:02:52.280> don't<00:02:52.460> think<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.760> that

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
little room but don't think that that

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.640 
little room but don't think that that
means<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.570> you're<00:02:53.780> going<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.990> have<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.410> any

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
means that you're going to have it any

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.070 
means that you're going to have it any
easier<00:02:55.010> when<00:02:55.640> you're<00:02:55.730> trying<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.120> do<00:02:56.240> this

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
easier when you're trying to do this

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.940 
easier when you're trying to do this
section<00:02:58.000> like<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.030> little<00:02:59.510> room<00:02:59.720> does<00:03:00.260> give

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
section like this little room does give

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.380 
section like this little room does give
you<00:03:01.100> kills<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.760> notice<00:03:02.060> will<00:03:02.210> things

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
you kills but if you notice will things

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.000 
you kills but if you notice will things
already<00:03:02.600> caught<00:03:02.990> up<00:03:03.020> to<00:03:03.170> me<00:03:03.350> on<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.590> outside

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
already caught up to me on the outside

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.070 
already caught up to me on the outside
so<00:03:04.430> it's<00:03:04.670> not<00:03:04.850> like<00:03:05.120> these<00:03:05.360> are<00:03:05.420> free<00:03:08.080> exactly

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
so it's not like these are free exactly

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.530 
so it's not like these are free exactly
okay<00:03:09.710> it's<00:03:10.340> kind<00:03:10.610> of<00:03:10.700> it's<00:03:10.970> kind<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.210> like<00:03:11.330> they

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
okay it's kind of it's kind of like they

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.870 
okay it's kind of it's kind of like they
give<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.960> three<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.320> they<00:03:12.560> get<00:03:12.740> him<00:03:12.980> free<00:03:13.250> so

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
give you three and they get him free so

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.160 
give you three and they get him free so
it<00:03:13.940> really<00:03:14.450> just<00:03:14.750> bounces<00:03:15.650> out<00:03:15.830> yeah<00:03:17.050> or<00:03:18.050> it's

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
it really just bounces out yeah or it's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.240 
it really just bounces out yeah or it's
the<00:03:18.290> first<00:03:18.470> time<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.770> actually<00:03:18.890> have<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.220> work

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
the first time you actually have to work

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.949 
the first time you actually have to work
for<00:03:19.430> your<00:03:19.760> kills<00:03:20.000> depending<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:20.600> how<00:03:20.780> you're

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959

big<00:03:43.850> guys<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.270> I<00:03:44.300> was<00:03:44.390> punching<00:03:44.720> in<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.870> face

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
big guys that I was punching in the face

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.010 
big guys that I was punching in the face
earlier<00:03:45.610> if<00:03:46.610> you<00:03:46.700> notice<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.090> animation<00:03:47.660> I

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
earlier if you notice that animation I

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.540 
earlier if you notice that animation I
immediately<00:03:48.380> thought<00:03:48.770> okay<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.310> animation

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
immediately thought okay that animation

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.310 
immediately thought okay that animation
takes<00:03:49.760> about<00:03:50.000> 10<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.390> 15<00:03:50.510> seconds<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.200> play

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
takes about 10 to 15 seconds to play

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.620 
takes about 10 to 15 seconds to play
I'll<00:03:51.620> just<00:03:51.770> kill<00:03:51.950> them<00:03:52.010> with<00:03:52.160> my<00:03:52.190> sword<00:03:52.630> this

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
I'll just kill them with my sword this

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.470 
I'll just kill them with my sword this
is<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> poor<00:03:54.110> decision<00:03:54.320> I<00:03:54.739> make<00:03:54.950> as<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:56.180> notice

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
is a poor decision I make as you notice

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.210 
is a poor decision I make as you notice
once<00:03:57.050> I've<00:03:57.350> already<00:03:57.530> had<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.830> chance<00:03:58.040> to

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
once I've already had the chance to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.940 
once I've already had the chance to
finish<00:03:58.400> him<00:03:58.610> off<00:03:59.500> twice<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:02.530> he<00:04:03.530> finished<00:04:03.680> me

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
finish him off twice and he finished me

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.750 
finish him off twice and he finished me
off

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
off

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.300 
off
just<00:04:06.450> kind<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.959> pretty<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.680> sweet<00:04:07.980> on<00:04:08.010> its

just kind of pretty and a sweet on its
own<00:04:08.459> yeah<00:04:10.879> so<00:04:11.879> that<00:04:12.540> was<00:04:12.569> maybe<00:04:13.409> 30<00:04:14.280> seconds

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
own yeah so that was maybe 30 seconds

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.189 
own yeah so that was maybe 30 seconds
something<00:04:15.209> like<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.599> I<00:04:15.629> wasn't<00:04:15.959> really

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
something like that I wasn't really

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.979 
something like that I wasn't really
photo<00:04:16.680> tily<00:04:16.859> counting<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.370> holy<00:04:17.699> crap<00:04:18.030> just

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
photo tily counting but holy crap just

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.710 
photo tily counting but holy crap just
do<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.199> finisher<00:04:19.669> yeah<00:04:20.669> that's<00:04:21.540> what<00:04:21.690> it

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
do the finisher yeah that's what it

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.260 
do the finisher yeah that's what it
boils<00:04:21.810> down<00:04:22.139> to<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.699> time<00:04:27.030> we

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
boils down to and in that time we

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.020 
boils down to and in that time we
managed<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.630> get<00:04:27.750> more<00:04:27.990> kills<00:04:28.320> little<00:04:28.860> bastard

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.700 

so<00:04:33.030> once<00:04:33.570> we've<00:04:33.750> done<00:04:33.900> this<00:04:34.080> there's<00:04:34.350> nothing

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
so once we've done this there's nothing

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.170 
so once we've done this there's nothing
you<00:04:34.830> can<00:04:34.979> do<00:04:35.070> except<00:04:35.400> sit<00:04:35.430> around<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.030> wait

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
you can do except sit around and wait

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.180 
you can do except sit around and wait

is<00:05:27.340> just<00:05:27.580> a<00:05:27.699> angel<00:05:28.120> cannon<00:05:28.689> it<00:05:29.169> works<00:05:29.379> very

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
is just a angel cannon it works very

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.070 
is just a angel cannon it works very
similarly<00:05:30.009> to<00:05:30.249> the<00:05:30.430> Panzer<00:05:31.270> Dragoon<00:05:31.419> section

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
similarly to the Panzer Dragoon section

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.480 
similarly to the Panzer Dragoon section
only<00:05:32.229> now<00:05:32.499> we're<00:05:32.740> in<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:32.979> gears<00:05:33.219> of<00:05:33.340> war

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
only now we're in the gears of war

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.929 
only now we're in the gears of war
section<00:05:33.969> array<00:05:34.779> um<00:05:35.169> and<00:05:35.800> so<00:05:36.539> the<00:05:37.539> gun<00:05:38.349> has<00:05:38.830> a

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:38.939 
section array um and so the gun has a

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:42.869 
section array um and so the gun has a
normal<00:05:40.500> blast<00:05:41.500> it<00:05:41.770> does<00:05:41.949> not<00:05:42.159> having<00:05:42.550> a<00:05:42.610> lot<00:05:42.759> a

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:42.879 
normal blast it does not having a lot a

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.110 
normal blast it does not having a lot a
lock<00:05:43.120> on<00:05:43.300> like<00:05:43.659> the<00:05:44.669> angelic<00:05:45.669> mount<00:05:45.879> does

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
lock on like the angelic mount does

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.409 
lock on like the angelic mount does
instead<00:05:46.900> what<00:05:47.229> you<00:05:47.319> have<00:05:47.500> is<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> charred

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
instead what you have is a charred

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.999 
instead what you have is a charred
effect<00:05:49.419> which<00:05:49.750> is<00:05:49.930> really<00:05:50.259> fucking<00:05:50.680> powerful

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
effect which is really fucking powerful

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.649 
effect which is really fucking powerful
and<00:05:51.400> once<00:05:51.580> I<00:05:51.699> start<00:05:51.969> using<00:05:52.150> it<00:05:52.389> i<00:05:52.509> will

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
and once I start using it i will

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.629 
and once I start using it i will
dominate<00:05:53.080> this<00:05:53.229> video<00:05:53.560> until<00:05:54.009> then<00:05:54.219> I<00:05:54.250> almost

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
dominate this video until then I almost

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.990 
dominate this video until then I almost
died<00:05:58.259> well<00:05:59.259> I<00:05:59.439> thought<00:05:59.830> that<00:06:00.039> I<00:06:00.400> thought<00:06:00.819> that

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
died well I thought that I thought that

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.390 
died well I thought that I thought that
the<00:06:01.210> think<00:06:01.719> they<00:06:02.259> were<00:06:02.409> done<00:06:02.589> to<00:06:02.770> me<00:06:02.830> destroy

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
the think they were done to me destroy

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.269 
the think they were done to me destroy
those<00:06:03.669> those<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.750> squats<00:06:05.529> I<00:06:05.740> don't<00:06:05.919> think<00:06:05.979> they

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
those those I squats I don't think they

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.899 
those those I squats I don't think they
it<00:06:06.669> does<00:06:06.969> though<00:06:07.300> I<00:06:07.569> think<00:06:07.810> I've<00:06:07.930> tried<00:06:08.909> I

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
it does though I think I've tried I

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.510 
it does though I think I've tried I
coulda<00:06:10.419> sworn<00:06:10.900> it<00:06:11.050> did<00:06:11.409> but<00:06:11.979> maybe<00:06:12.310> you'll

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
coulda sworn it did but maybe you'll

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.159 
coulda sworn it did but maybe you'll
Thayne<00:06:12.819> was<00:06:12.849> just<00:06:13.330> breaking<00:06:13.629> them<00:06:13.930> and<00:06:14.110> I

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
Thayne was just breaking them and I

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.320 
Thayne was just breaking them and I
wasn't<00:06:14.379> paying<00:06:14.650> attention<00:06:14.800> I<00:06:15.400> think<00:06:16.180> that

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
wasn't paying attention I think that

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.040 
wasn't paying attention I think that
might<00:06:16.509> have<00:06:16.539> been<00:06:16.689> it

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.570

notice here is that angel slaughter has

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.670 
notice here is that angel slaughter has
