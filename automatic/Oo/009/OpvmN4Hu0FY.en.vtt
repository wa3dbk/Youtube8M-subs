looks actually really cool um it's got a

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.810 
looks actually really cool um it's got a
yellow<00:05:35.770> stripe<00:05:36.130> that<00:05:36.310> starts<00:05:36.640> at<00:05:36.760> the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
yellow stripe that starts at the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.220 
yellow stripe that starts at the
splitter<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.840> just

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
splitter and just

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.610 
splitter and just
goes<00:05:39.010> around<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.790> bottom<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:41.110> kind<00:05:41.470> of
