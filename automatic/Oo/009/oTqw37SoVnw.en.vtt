00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.580
 you are seeing in the title it is about 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.500

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.719
 8.1 really this tutorial serves to 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.370
 all versions of windows or that 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.560
 I think if you have not worked this 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.420
 tutorial then leave a comment 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.860
 I will try to make a video explaining 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.440
 making new tutorials this 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.990
 tutorial but with the windows version 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.460
 specific that you ask so without further 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.320
 let's start before you start 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.419
 it means sorry that you can see the 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.490
 1080p video to make it more 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.530
 comfortable at the time of seeing it so 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.060
 signed is going to start with the tutorial and 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.030
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.820
 press the windows + key on all 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.190
 the windows is going to run open this 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.810
 pestaÃ±ita to run here what 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.810
 we will do it will be to write king edit 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.570
 once in the registry editor we are going to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.700
 direct now to the local bailing folder 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.100
 machine once here we go to 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.080
 direct to system and then occurs in 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.330
 control sep once here we go to 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.240
 directing services to services you do not have to 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.250
 have the service name now what 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.060
 we are going to have to search is the folder 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.280
 call tc tcp / ip from that pib we look for it 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.020
 we will look for it in a quick moment to 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 see over here has to be this one 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.810
 ask for what we are looking for and now what we are going to 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.430
 to do is create a new word value 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 ok we give right click here 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.060
 we select the folder of that type 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.850
 we click right and we give new 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.009
 now this we have to create a value of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.170
 Word depends on this varies a lot depends 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.990
 the system that we have to be 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.800
 by our side it can be 32 or 64 bits in 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.840
 my 64 bit case so I give it 64 bit 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.859
 as to know what 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.570
 if your system 32 64 bits windows 8 is 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.810
 very simple let's go right click 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.730
 here you have them but now left and 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.350
 we look for system 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.080
 once around here we will leave the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.670
 basic information about the team we 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.050
 we are going to direct to the system and here where 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.140
 puts the system type appears on 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.790
 64-bit operating system that is if 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.430
 you have a goal is going to put the 32 is 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.050
 'difficult' is 64 poses and 64 once 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.370
 over here again in reed editor what 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.060
 let's do the same thing we'll give to 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.320
 again now we know that how many 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.170
 bits has our system 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.660
 in my case 64 I choose 64 what we are going to 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.970
 have to put is going to be global max tcp 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.650
 windows and the frad the word that 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.570
 good the phrase that you are seeing in 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.030
 the same big screen good what 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.130
 we will do is to give you click on another 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.960
 time and we will give you to modify here 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.990
 what we will do will be in information of 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.220
 We're going to change it to 7 and we're going 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.260
 to leave as we are going to give 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.940
 accept we close and we're going to have to 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.950
 restart our computer once 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.670
 done this then we can check if 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.050
 our our internet has improved 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.110
 remarkably what would be the speed 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.380
 of 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.490
 of charge etcetera so good I hope 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.410
 that this tutorial has been useful 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.930
 remember to share it and give it a light 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.430
 chivas liked has not served clear we 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.730
 we see in the next video until the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.730
 next
