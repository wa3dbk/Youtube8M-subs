00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.180
 Although, among other things, I have these here 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.969
 again he wrote that on 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.780
 finish with a bit of olive oil 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.309
 to drip 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.110
 I did not do that then 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.300
 wanted that was so very ready found 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.340
 But there was nothing in any case then 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.570
 so try and today there was 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.829
 of course also something delicious food 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.439
 and this was the ostel brockerhoff 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.970
 left this is the third broccoli 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.260
 florets with an almond lemon cream 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.520
 I have to say absolutely delicious 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.600
 sometimes one more in any case 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.400
 portion of and otherwise because it's the same 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
 still try that and payments 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.869
 I finally watch my TV for today 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 the chocolate bars come with me 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.570
 very excited about it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.600
 and, of course, that's about it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.030
 so last days already come 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.740
 500 grams of cocoa butter because you because 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.420
 email orders that it probably also one 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.369
 At least, organic quality stands up 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.890
 Organic food quality organic 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.590
 I already have cocoa butter chips from it 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.960

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.690

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.510
 on the chocolate bars 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.220
 then pop star as a layer lie 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.520

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.680
 Chris's chocolate will be otherwise 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.790
 relatively feinherb is very like a 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.009
 imperious cola as those 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.179

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.500
