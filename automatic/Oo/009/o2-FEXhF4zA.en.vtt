00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.439
 hello to everyone then 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.510
 today I find you in a 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.580
 little video fast enough so this is the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.380
 first time I realize it so 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.780
 that's how you've seen 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.910
 directs me to the organic the natural and 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.039
 today I tested a mask for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.289
 the hair and I wanted I wanted 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.919
 you speak so I bought myself 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.869
 recently this little book there we are 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.819
 can do his natural cosmetics 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.070
 it's easy the benefits of nature 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:35.940
 and homemade 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.240
 here I paid them 8 euros 70 and so 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 here 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.520
 looking for some recipes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.410
 home I looked a little on the internet 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.040
 I found a lot of recipes on 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.950
 Internet 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.650
 in my book so this is the same game 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.410
 I made a mask for my 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.010
 beer-based hair and so I 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.060
 wanted to tell you all this good 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.680
 on the other hand I'm sorry the 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.270
 preparation you will not see it because 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.740
 moment of preparation I flatly 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.320
 forgot to film but hey I made them 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.050
 photos so already just to post 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 so the beer compared to the hair that 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.860
 will prevent hair loss it will 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.990
 bring the volume of shine it's going 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.870
 but it will repair the hair and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.409
 get into trouble here at the level of the 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.020
 recipe 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.340
 I will put you the pictures after or on 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.500
 the sides just not too much how I 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.540
 come to handle the video editing rather 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.640
 so at the level of the corner recipe the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.470
 beer-based mask so it takes a 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.570
 glass of beer so I looked on 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.030
 internet is the equivalent of 30 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.560
 milliliters is so good so I'm going 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 not make you 30 milliliters 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.860
 so I'm going one of 5 here it's done 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.330
 5000 this beer the lawn I took 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.250
 a small amount makes 25 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.909
 centiliters because I do not see any 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.740
 bierges 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.289
 nothing and I had to take me too much 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.240
 at the scan is there I prices in store 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.060
 bio that I was passing through our 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.429
 shops and so for the recipe he in 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.750
 take 30 milliliters 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.429
 that's why the rest I had to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.840
 fridge with the date of when I govern 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.719
 I hope it will keep us a 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.190
 a little while later you have to add 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:14.069
 an egg and then last ingredient it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.810
 must be better than I buy like that 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.180
 it's an economical format like that 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.790
 may well keep it 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.340
 that's how we mix the 30000 avoids 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.440
 beer the egg the tablespoon of honey 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.690
 so I'm doing them with a mixer so 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.360
 for even though it's diluted I 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.980
 let it be thirty minutes 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.420
 I'm already applying it first to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.660
 level of length and after chaumont 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.170
 term at the level of the scalp 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.359
 frankly at the application level 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.640
 I have too much galera it's like 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.230
 float what as water so not so 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.299
 you have tips for asking the questions 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.700
 bases that I think I had a small 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.200
 vaporizer but it's okay it does not go up to 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.139
 tube level so I do not know too much 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.970
 how but how to do that so 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.730
 So here I am leaving them at 30 minutes 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.049
 and then he had to take my 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.900
 shower so it's soon but I 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.780
 washed my hair I made two 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.349
 shampoo shampoo with a 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.609
 organic shampoo 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.910
 frankly I have too much galley to 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.380
 wash my hair which what two 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.490
 shampoos and after I hit 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.070
 applied a similar conditioner 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.480
 after organic shampoo thinking that it 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.010
 was really well in trouble and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.900
 it was the big cat that one acts neither 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.820
 too much wrong to bikes but we know 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.860
 already that I was going in addition to facilitating 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.600
 the trouble but not at all he has 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.090
 I had to wait for it to be that the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.530
 game be dry to see already that they 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.210
 wanted a lot better I do not know 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.250
 if you go to see it shines 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.690
 enormously that's how you see I 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.850
 put my hands in my hair without 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.210
 no difficulty 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.230
 it already shines they are super beautiful 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.850
 I have the impression that it is not very 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.180
 waffles good bah it smells like beer but 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.320
 good with the conditioner there is a 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.550
 hour of the conditioner also a little 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.590
 less impressive butter that bothers me 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.330
 not particularly 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.120
 I also took the opportunity to cut 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.860
 spikes in the summer a little bit damaged so 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.140
 I cut my points quickly but 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.130
 so here's the mask level so this 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.530
 mask made from beer 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.990
 so that makes the hair very very soft 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.160
 frankly they are super water they 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.040
 are all mails and as you can 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.420
 to see it shines a lot and 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.150
 then it's true what the two good 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.180
 does at the volume level that their feet 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.460
 hair still as much raplapla 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.830
 here he dropped to a server of the 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.610
 do when we can see if we 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.130
 always loses them as often as before 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.110
 here and if not so this mask must be the 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.650
 do once every two weeks 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.400
 about 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.800
 good after honestly since beer 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.930
 it was a quantity of 25 centiliters 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.320
 and that I still have many in the 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.300
 fridge 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.880
 I think I want to do in a 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.250
 week and after I'll see if he has 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.810
 still drinking fresh kind 1 week 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.560
 so after that for this mask 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.600
 what did I want to tell you 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.890
 else I did a picture before / after 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.660
 for my hair that I will put in the end 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.610
 of video and the little tie 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.530
 preparation to show the ingredients 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.630
 for the complicated queen apart 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.460
 the application I galley month involved 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.810
 the mask on my hair to go 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.630
 clean to help but the eaglets 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.720
 after frankly the rendering is very very 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.880
 well I find them great it's great 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.890
 nice so that's for me it was a 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.470
 first first mask that I stay 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.240
 like it's homemade and I think 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.250
 continue as you can see 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.380
 I have a lot of notes 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.880
 here are masks that I like 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.830
 I'm interested I bought a lot 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.470
 ingredients yield 1.80 to make it 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.970
 so I will test all that and I will 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.370
 will say after what I think about it in video 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.680
 here I hope that this new little 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.840
 video will have pleased you I tell you to very 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.840
 fast for next videos hi
