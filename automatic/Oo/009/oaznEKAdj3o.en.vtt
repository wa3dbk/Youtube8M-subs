00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.170
 I need to make an important call 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.760
 x 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.440
 I just hope that very well today 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.820
 let's talk about pets and person not 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.800
 I have had at least one pet in his 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.960
 I have not had a pet 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.210
 you have had childhood and your pets very 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.190
 common like cats dogs fish hamsters 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.330
 boyfriends and many more but the day 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.650
 today we are going to talk about also here not 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.269
 it occurs to him to have an exotic pet 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.589
 of this holding school attacking cronies and 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.110
 so when one is a child he thinks that having 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.089
 mascot is amazing and even more so if it's a 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.890
 exotic pet or removing the problems 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.500
 what it takes to have a normal pet 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.970
 for example let the nasa shut up and 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.009
 leave color in exotic animals 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.479
 suffer from not living in their natural habitat 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.250
 then in costeÃ±o will send it to 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.680
 live in the wasteland this code here 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.869
 is serrano voice of the worst I imagine 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.430
 that an animal in captivity would pass this 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.760
 way here so the adam line 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.980
 thomas abraham 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.600
 I am a tiger and I fuck because they give me 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.800
 the rice works we want because 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.650
 I want to understand an animal in captivity 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.720
 to be original and interesting 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.760
 look good with society for that because 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.840
 nation area is in the weight of the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.840
 animals like you have the right 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 rights 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.250
 currently animal trafficking 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.560
 illegal and know how to avoid it do not 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.050
 they do not buy a toucan for 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.100
 have a snake in the kitchen for 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.270
 room or spectacled bear 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.250
 we come to this planet taking advantage of 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.600
 we are not running out in 2012, well, I 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.600
 I'm going to put my turtle 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.000
