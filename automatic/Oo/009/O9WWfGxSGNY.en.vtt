we're<00:00:13.610> going<00:00:13.820> to<00:00:13.879> be<00:00:14.029> reviewing<00:00:14.449> the<00:00:14.989> MEC<00:00:15.319> the

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
we're going to be reviewing the MEC the

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.089 
we're going to be reviewing the MEC the
MEC<00:00:16.219> is<00:00:16.429> pretty<00:00:16.820> much<00:00:16.939> a<00:00:17.150> robot<00:00:17.869> that<00:00:18.710> you<00:00:18.859> turn

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
MEC is pretty much a robot that you turn

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.989 
MEC is pretty much a robot that you turn
into<00:00:20.830> it<00:00:21.830> gives<00:00:22.009> you<00:00:22.099> extra<00:00:22.250> damage<00:00:22.789> extra

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:24.999 
into it gives you extra damage extra

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.130 
into it gives you extra damage extra
armor<00:00:25.999> and<00:00:26.179> stuff<00:00:26.390> like<00:00:26.480> that<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:26.869> we're<00:00:27.050> going

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
armor and stuff like that so we're going

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.349 
armor and stuff like that so we're going
to<00:00:27.230> go<00:00:27.349> ahead<00:00:27.499> and<00:00:27.890> turn<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.249> into<00:00:28.490> that<00:00:28.910> right

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
to go ahead and turn it into that right

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.639 
to go ahead and turn it into that right
now<00:00:31.360> you<00:00:32.360> get<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.629> move<00:00:32.840> around<00:00:32.930> with<00:00:33.379> it<00:00:33.530> you

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
now you get to move around with it you

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.869 
now you get to move around with it you
have<00:00:33.680> dual<00:00:34.120> turrets<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:35.270> guys<00:00:35.510> invisible<00:00:36.170> uh

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
have dual turrets that guys invisible uh

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.990 
have dual turrets that guys invisible uh
and<00:00:38.469> you<00:00:39.469> can<00:00:39.620> stay<00:00:39.859> in<00:00:40.039> it<00:00:40.129> for<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.399> minute<00:00:40.850> and

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
and you can stay in it for a minute and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.599 
and you can stay in it for a minute and
I<00:00:41.690> believe<00:00:42.649> it's<00:00:42.800> like<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:42.949> minute<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.309> 50

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
I believe it's like a minute and 50

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.119 
I believe it's like a minute and 50
seconds<00:00:43.910> or<00:00:44.059> something<00:00:44.180> like<00:00:44.449> that<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.559> it's

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
seconds or something like that so it's

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.619 
seconds or something like that so it's
pretty<00:00:46.219> cool<00:00:46.550> he's<00:00:47.059> already<00:00:47.210> shot<00:00:47.390> me<00:00:47.539> with

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
pretty cool he's already shot me with

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.869 
pretty cool he's already shot me with
the<00:00:47.750> sniper<00:00:47.989> twice<00:00:48.350> I<00:00:48.769> may<00:00:49.340> end<00:00:49.489> up<00:00:49.579> dying

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
the sniper twice I may end up dying

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:50.650 
the sniper twice I may end up dying
there<00:00:50.149> we<00:00:50.269> go

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
there we go

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.160 
there we go
um<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.820> when<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:52.940> do<00:00:53.149> die<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.719> mech<00:00:53.899> suit

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
um and when you do die in the mech suit

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.900 
um and when you do die in the mech suit
you<00:00:54.739> don't<00:00:54.980> die<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:56.179> destroys<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.960> mech<00:00:57.140> suit

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
you don't die it destroys the mech suit

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.669 
you don't die it destroys the mech suit
and<00:00:58.910> pretty<00:00:59.780> much<00:00:59.870> gives<00:01:00.109> you<00:01:00.199> a<00:01:00.260> second

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
and pretty much gives you a second

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.410 
and pretty much gives you a second
chance<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.670> I'm<00:01:01.910> going<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.089> come<00:01:02.269> back<00:01:02.359> here

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
chance so I'm going to come back here

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.080 
chance so I'm going to come back here
and<00:01:02.929> I'm<00:01:03.079> going<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:03.410> use<00:01:03.710> it<00:01:03.859> again<00:01:04.070> I'm<00:01:04.460> really

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
and I'm going to use it again I'm really

and I'm going to use it again I'm really
honestly<00:01:05.750> never<00:01:05.990> going<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.200> use<00:01:06.470> this<00:01:06.800> um<00:01:07.540> that

can still double jump you could still

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.800 
can still double jump you could still
move<00:01:35.930> around<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.620> way<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.800> usually<00:01:37.190> do<00:01:37.810> um

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
move around the way you usually do um

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.650 
move around the way you usually do um
only<00:01:39.680> thing<00:01:40.100> really<00:01:40.280> different<00:01:40.790> is<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.480> have

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
only thing really different is you have

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.260 
only thing really different is you have
your<00:01:42.400> dual<00:01:43.400> machineguns

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
your dual machineguns

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.440 
your dual machineguns
extra<00:01:44.570> armor<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.200> whatnot<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:45.980> I<00:01:46.430> don't<00:01:47.390> know

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
extra armor and whatnot so I don't know

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.000 
extra armor and whatnot so I don't know
where<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.750> guy<00:01:47.870> is<00:01:47.930> in<00:01:48.290> his<00:01:48.320> mech<00:01:48.620> suit<00:01:48.860> I

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
where that guy is in his mech suit I

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.840 
where that guy is in his mech suit I
think<00:01:49.100> he's<00:01:49.340> just<00:01:49.460> playing<00:01:49.730> a<00:01:49.820> little

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
think he's just playing a little

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.970 
think he's just playing a little
stealthy<00:01:50.480> um<00:01:52.510> which<00:01:53.510> is<00:01:53.720> pretty<00:01:54.320> nifty<00:01:54.560> for

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
stealthy um which is pretty nifty for

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.430 
stealthy um which is pretty nifty for
him<00:01:55.160> um<00:01:56.150> but<00:01:56.600> we're<00:01:56.840> going<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.020> go<00:01:57.110> ahead<00:01:57.200> and

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
him um but we're going to go ahead and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.160 
him um but we're going to go ahead and
get<00:01:57.710> back<00:01:57.860> into<00:01:58.100> our<00:01:58.250> mech<00:01:58.460> suit<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.170> continue

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
get back into our mech suit and continue

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.800 
get back into our mech suit and continue
this<00:02:00.320> review<00:02:00.800> now<00:02:01.340> do<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:02.090> believe<00:02:02.180> this<00:02:02.630> is

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
this review now do I believe this is

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.490 
this review now do I believe this is
worth<00:02:02.990> buying<00:02:03.440> like<00:02:03.920> buying<00:02:04.220> mech<00:02:04.550> suits<00:02:04.850> um

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
worth buying like buying mech suits um

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.180 
worth buying like buying mech suits um
not<00:02:06.500> really

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
not really

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.800 
not really

upgrades and stuff like that but I mean
it<00:03:28.609> depends<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.030> your<00:03:29.239> play<00:03:29.419> style<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:30.049> think

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
it depends on your play style I think

it depends on your play style I think
these<00:03:30.500> are<00:03:30.560> pretty<00:03:30.799> powerful<00:03:30.980> they're<00:03:31.430> pretty

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
these are pretty powerful they're pretty

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.599 
these are pretty powerful they're pretty
good<00:03:31.810> they<00:03:32.810> are<00:03:32.930> not<00:03:33.199> overpowered<00:03:33.980> for<00:03:34.370> sure

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
good they are not overpowered for sure

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.189 
good they are not overpowered for sure
um<00:03:36.160> for<00:03:37.299> how<00:03:38.299> expensive<00:03:38.629> they<00:03:38.989> are

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
um for how expensive they are

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.740 
um for how expensive they are
I<00:03:39.440> mean<00:03:39.620> that's<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:41.090> only<00:03:41.329> thing<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.690> would

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
I mean that's the only thing I would

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.439 
I mean that's the only thing I would
believe<00:03:42.199> that<00:03:42.230> is<00:03:42.500> overpowered<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.449> making

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
believe that is overpowered is making

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.869 
believe that is overpowered is making
them<00:03:44.569> invisible<00:03:44.690> I<00:03:45.620> don't<00:03:46.010> believe<00:03:46.459> that<00:03:46.489> you

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
them invisible I don't believe that you

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.949 
them invisible I don't believe that you
should<00:03:47.060> be<00:03:47.180> able<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:47.389> make<00:03:47.510> these<00:03:47.660> invisible

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
should be able to make these invisible

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.470 
should be able to make these invisible
that's<00:03:48.829> just<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.099> little<00:03:49.250> cheap<00:03:49.549> because

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
that's just a little cheap because

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.930 
that's just a little cheap because
invisibility<00:03:51.019> invisibility<00:03:51.980> lasts<00:03:52.609> about<00:03:52.699> as

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
invisibility invisibility lasts about as

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.259 
invisibility invisibility lasts about as
long<00:03:53.120> as<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.359> mech<00:03:53.599> suit<00:03:53.840> does<00:03:54.049> so<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:54.319> mean<00:03:54.590> I

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
long as the mech suit does so I mean I

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.909 
long as the mech suit does so I mean I
don't<00:03:56.269> know<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.690> would<00:03:56.989> I<00:03:57.169> would<00:03:57.530> say<00:03:57.560> don't

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
don't know I would I would say don't

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.259 
don't know I would I would say don't
make<00:03:58.099> these<00:03:58.280> invisible<00:03:58.549> that<00:03:58.970> would<00:03:59.060> be<00:03:59.180> the

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
make these invisible that would be the

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.990 
make these invisible that would be the
only<00:03:59.419> complaint<00:03:59.989> for<00:04:00.199> me<00:04:00.639> because<00:04:01.639> they're<00:04:01.790> so

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
only complaint for me because they're so

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.500 
only complaint for me because they're so
powerful<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.989> begin<00:04:03.199> with<00:04:03.379> so<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.449> don't<00:04:05.449> know

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
powerful to begin with so I don't know

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.969 
powerful to begin with so I don't know
but<00:04:05.659> it's<00:04:05.780> just<00:04:05.840> my<00:04:06.079> personal<00:04:06.500> opinion<00:04:06.829> I

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:06.979 
but it's just my personal opinion I

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.949 
but it's just my personal opinion I

believe I'm out of mech suits now yep
and<00:04:09.079> there's<00:04:09.500> seven<00:04:10.780> seven<00:04:11.780> gyms<00:04:12.379> to<00:04:13.000> get<00:04:14.000> a

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
and there's seven seven gyms to get a

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.250 
and there's seven seven gyms to get a
new<00:04:14.930> set<00:04:15.229> of<00:04:15.579> mechs<00:04:16.579> but<00:04:17.359> that<00:04:17.780> was<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.049> mechs

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260

guys<00:04:18.700> my<00:04:19.700> review<00:04:20.090> on<00:04:20.209> them<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.690> don't<00:04:21.229> believe

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
guys my review on them I don't believe

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.100 
guys my review on them I don't believe
they're<00:04:21.769> worth<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:22.159> price<00:04:22.659> but<00:04:23.659> if<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:23.900> do

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
they're worth the price but if you do

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.490 
they're worth the price but if you do
have<00:04:24.289> the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
have the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.440 
have the
and<00:04:24.980> you<00:04:25.040> really<00:04:25.340> don't<00:04:25.520> have<00:04:25.970> anything<00:04:26.270> to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
and you really don't have anything to

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.170 
and you really don't have anything to
purchase<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.170> would<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:28.130> mean<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.580> would<00:04:28.700> get<00:04:28.820> next

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
purchase I would I mean I would get next

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.610 
purchase I would I mean I would get next
I'm<00:04:29.330> they're<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.690> good<00:04:29.870> addition<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.410> game

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
I'm they're a good addition to the game

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
I'm they're a good addition to the game
it<00:04:30.860> adds<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.340> new<00:04:31.490> spin<00:04:31.850> on<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.120> game<00:04:32.390> it

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
it adds a new spin on the game it

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.770 
it adds a new spin on the game it
definitely<00:04:34.640> changes<00:04:35.120> your<00:04:35.330> play<00:04:35.510> style

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
definitely changes your play style

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.150 
definitely changes your play style
because<00:04:36.200> you<00:04:36.230> do<00:04:36.440> have<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.650> play<00:04:36.950> a<00:04:36.980> little

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
because you do have to play a little

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.910 
because you do have to play a little
more<00:04:37.430> stealthy<00:04:38.140> to<00:04:39.140> be<00:04:39.260> able<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.530> get<00:04:39.680> around

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
more stealthy to be able to get around

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.170 
more stealthy to be able to get around
to<00:04:40.160> killing<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.580> mech<00:04:40.900> but<00:04:41.900> um<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:44.030> know<00:04:44.060> I

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
to killing the mech but um you know I

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.620 
to killing the mech but um you know I
would<00:04:44.750> just<00:04:44.780> say<00:04:45.050> try<00:04:45.320> it<00:04:45.380> out<00:04:46.180> for<00:04:47.180> yourself

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
would just say try it out for yourself

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.720 
would just say try it out for yourself
there's<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:48.020> guy<00:04:48.140> invisible<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:48.860> yeah<00:04:49.340> my<00:04:49.520> only

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
there's a guy invisible and yeah my only

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.290 
there's a guy invisible and yeah my only
complaint<00:04:50.150> is<00:04:50.390> that<00:04:50.450> they<00:04:50.780> can<00:04:50.960> go<00:04:51.080> invisible

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
complaint is that they can go invisible

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.850 
complaint is that they can go invisible
that's<00:04:53.300> my<00:04:53.720> only<00:04:53.900> point<00:04:54.170> they're<00:04:54.380> not<00:04:54.410> they're

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
that's my only point they're not they're

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.220 
that's my only point they're not they're
not<00:04:55.010> too<00:04:55.220> powerful<00:04:55.700> they<00:04:55.850> still<00:04:56.150> they<00:04:56.450> take<00:04:57.200> a

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
not too powerful they still they take a

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.570 
not too powerful they still they take a
few<00:04:57.500> shots<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:58.040> kill<00:04:58.190> people<00:04:58.900> and<00:05:00.580> they're

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
few shots and kill people and they're

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.850 
few shots and kill people and they're
not<00:05:01.700> super<00:05:02.270> difficult<00:05:02.480> to<00:05:02.900> kill<00:05:03.080> unless<00:05:03.350> you

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
not super difficult to kill unless you

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.670 
not super difficult to kill unless you
only<00:05:04.040> have<00:05:04.250> like<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.430> pistol<00:05:04.820> but<00:05:05.810> besides<00:05:06.470> that

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
only have like a pistol but besides that

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.520 
only have like a pistol but besides that
that's<00:05:07.460> pretty<00:05:07.640> much<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.940> max<00:05:08.180> guys<00:05:08.500> so<00:05:09.500> I
