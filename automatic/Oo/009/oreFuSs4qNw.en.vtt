causes

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.610 
causes
if<00:03:08.860> they<00:03:09.280> are<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:10.120> kind<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.630> who<00:03:10.930> needs<00:03:11.380> to

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
if they are the kind that who needs to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.260 
if they are the kind that who needs to
learn<00:03:11.770> very<00:03:12.069> quickly<00:03:12.130> for<00:03:12.640> their<00:03:12.760> loved<00:03:13.000> ones

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
learn very quickly for their loved ones

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.059 
learn very quickly for their loved ones
for<00:03:13.840> example<00:03:13.870> they<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.620> want<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.860> bake

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
for example they just want to bake

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.580 
for example they just want to bake
cheesecake<00:03:15.430> put<00:03:15.819> in<00:03:15.910> us<00:03:16.060> once<00:03:16.270> we<00:03:16.840> have<00:03:17.050> shot

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
cheesecake put in us once we have shot

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.500 
cheesecake put in us once we have shot
and<00:03:17.890> he'll<00:03:18.130> process<00:03:18.640> we<00:03:18.790> call<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.300> that's

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
and he'll process we call it and that's

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.070 
and he'll process we call it and that's
four<00:03:19.870> hours<00:03:20.080> long<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:21.370> one<00:03:21.670> four<00:03:22.390> hours<00:03:22.840> to

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
four hours long that one four hours to

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.240 
four hours long that one four hours to
within<00:03:23.319> that<00:03:23.410> four<00:03:23.650> hours<00:03:23.920> they<00:03:24.069> will<00:03:24.160> learn

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
within that four hours they will learn

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.160 
within that four hours they will learn
everything<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:25.150> fundamentals<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:26.019> the

everything the fundamentals of the
Cheesecake<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.769> things<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.190> but<00:03:28.180> for

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
Cheesecake and things like that but for

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.009 
Cheesecake and things like that but for
those<00:03:28.780> who<00:03:29.140> really<00:03:29.590> want<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.250> learn

those who really want to learn

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.059 
those who really want to learn
techniques<00:03:32.019> different<00:03:32.350> techniques<00:03:32.890> of

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
techniques different techniques of

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.699 
techniques different techniques of
wreaking<00:03:33.549> different<00:03:34.030> techniques<00:03:34.450> of

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
wreaking different techniques of

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.289 
wreaking different techniques of
ingredient<00:03:35.709> functions<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.700> everything<00:03:36.850> like

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
ingredient functions and everything like

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.330 
ingredient functions and everything like
that<00:03:37.360> fundamentals<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.319> key<00:03:38.530> breaking<00:03:38.950> we

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
that fundamentals of key breaking we

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.729 
that fundamentals of key breaking we
have<00:03:39.489> what<00:03:39.670> we<00:03:39.790> call<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.269> modular<00:03:40.840> cost<00:03:41.110> this

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
have what we call the modular cost this

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.580 
have what we call the modular cost this
modular<00:03:42.250> causes<00:03:42.700> seven<00:03:43.209> lessons<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.350> each

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
modular causes seven lessons and each

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.070 
modular causes seven lessons and each
lesson<00:03:44.830> teaches<00:03:45.280> four<00:03:45.640> hours<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:46.900> is

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
lesson teaches four hours so this is

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.740 
lesson teaches four hours so this is
more<00:03:47.260> intensive<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.100> this<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.760> where<00:03:49.060> we<00:03:49.569> do

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
more intensive and this is where we do

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.380 
more intensive and this is where we do
post-mortem<00:03:50.230> on<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.069> baked<00:03:51.340> products<00:03:51.790> so

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
post-mortem on the baked products so

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.090 
post-mortem on the baked products so
that's<00:03:52.630> more<00:03:52.810> interesting<00:03:53.110> we<00:03:53.799> have<00:03:53.980> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
that's more interesting we have the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.770 
that's more interesting we have the
short<00:03:54.370> courses<00:03:54.670> for<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.540> long
