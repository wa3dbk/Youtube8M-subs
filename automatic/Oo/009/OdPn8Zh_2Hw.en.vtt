it<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.400> blew<00:03:07.520> my<00:03:07.700> mind

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.700 

I<00:03:22.580> just<00:03:23.580> got<00:03:23.760> out<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.060> demo<00:03:24.300> for

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.310 
look who I ran into it's not that from
game<00:03:35.730> theory<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.600> don't<00:03:36.840> know<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:36.990> you<00:03:37.140> watch

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
game theory I don't know if you watch

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.520 
game theory I don't know if you watch
shots<00:03:37.620> but<00:03:37.920> we<00:03:38.340> are<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.510> basically<00:03:40.320> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
shots but we are the basically the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.100 
shots but we are the basically the
Mythbusters<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.760> gaming<00:03:42.360> right<00:03:42.570> we<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.900> lost

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
Mythbusters of gaming right we just lost

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.680 
Mythbusters of gaming right we just lost
fill<00:03:43.350> theory<00:03:43.650> too<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.490> we're<00:03:44.640> doing<00:03:44.850> like<00:03:45.120> deep

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
fill theory too so we're doing like deep

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.530 
fill theory too so we're doing like deep
science<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.560> math<00:03:46.800> like<00:03:47.490> overthinking<00:03:48.360> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
science and math like overthinking the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.450 
science and math like overthinking the
lore

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
lore

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.630 
lore
video<00:03:50.300> games<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.020> it's<00:03:51.470> like<00:03:51.650> super<00:03:52.070> nerdy

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
video games and it's like super nerdy
