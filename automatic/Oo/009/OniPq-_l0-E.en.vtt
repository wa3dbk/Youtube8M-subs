00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.679 
don't let this little black box stopping
between<00:05:45.889> each<00:05:46.219> picture<00:05:46.490> all<00:05:47.149> you<00:05:47.360> need<00:05:47.479> to<00:05:47.569> do

between each picture all you need to do

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.929 
between each picture all you need to do
is<00:05:47.929> merge<00:05:48.379> it<00:05:48.589> down<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:49.069> the<00:05:49.159> layer<00:05:49.309> to<00:05:49.849> the

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:49.939 
is merge it down to the layer to the

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:56.279 
is merge it down to the layer to the
black<00:05:50.149> box<00:05:50.419> layer<00:05:53.740> right<00:05:54.740> click<00:05:54.800> merge<00:05:55.759> down

connected<00:05:59.449> to<00:05:59.539> that<00:05:59.629> black<00:05:59.929> background<00:06:00.499> image

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
connected to that black background image

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.850 
connected to that black background image
but<00:06:02.419> I<00:06:02.449> don't<00:06:02.659> want<00:06:02.809> my<00:06:02.869> icon<00:06:03.229> to<00:06:03.349> go<00:06:03.469> that<00:06:03.649> fast
