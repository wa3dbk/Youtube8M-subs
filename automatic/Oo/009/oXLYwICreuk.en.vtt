00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.110 
but these are the three that i bought to
be<00:01:47.170> honest<00:01:47.380> with<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.770> if<00:01:48.040> I<00:01:48.340> have<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.610> go<00:01:48.910> back

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
be honest with you if I have to go back

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.680 
be honest with you if I have to go back
if<00:01:49.480> I<00:01:49.930> could<00:01:49.990> pick<00:01:50.320> each<00:01:50.620> color<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:52.420> make

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
if I could pick each color and and make

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.300 
if I could pick each color and and make
the<00:01:52.870> set<00:01:53.080> of<00:01:53.260> three<00:01:53.290> this<00:01:54.070> definitely

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
the set of three this definitely

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.100 
the set of three this definitely
wouldn't<00:01:54.760> be<00:01:54.910> one<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.090> them<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.900> is<00:01:56.020> the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
wouldn't be one of them this is the

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.450 
wouldn't be one of them this is the
first<00:01:56.290> color<00:01:56.530> I'm<00:01:56.650> going<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.860> show<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.070> and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
first color I'm going to show you and

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.340 
first color I'm going to show you and
it's<00:01:57.490> called<00:01:57.820> Electrify<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.700> its<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:01.000> mix<00:02:01.780> /

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
it's called Electrify and its a mix /

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.920 
it's called Electrify and its a mix /
goals<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:03.640> goals<00:02:03.670> kind<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.300> like<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.480> really

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
goals the goals kind of like a really

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.420 
goals the goals kind of like a really
bright<00:02:05.140> yellow<00:02:05.500> we<00:02:05.680> goals<00:02:05.890> which<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.310> might

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
bright yellow we goals which you might

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.850 
bright yellow we goals which you might
not<00:02:06.610> necessarily<00:02:06.790> see<00:02:07.330> on<00:02:07.450> camera<00:02:07.750> but<00:02:08.379> it's<00:02:08.590> a

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
not necessarily see on camera but it's a

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.330 
not necessarily see on camera but it's a
gold<00:02:09.340> with<00:02:10.149> red<00:02:10.569> sparkling<00:02:11.290> it's<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:12.040> very

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
gold with red sparkling it's a very

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.759 
gold with red sparkling it's a very
Christmasy<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:13.989> kind<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.230> bizarre<00:02:14.379> that

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
Christmasy so it's kind of bizarre that

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.190 
Christmasy so it's kind of bizarre that
it's<00:02:14.950> out<00:02:15.190> with<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.819> collection<00:02:16.810> after

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
it's out with a collection after

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.110 
it's out with a collection after
Christmas<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:17.859> this<00:02:18.730> will<00:02:18.909> probably

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
Christmas but this will probably

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.070 
Christmas but this will probably
something<00:02:19.659> that<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.810> literally<00:02:20.200> won't<00:02:20.469> use<00:02:20.739> and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
something that I literally won't use and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.890 
something that I literally won't use and
Christmas<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:22.010> even<00:02:22.460> then<00:02:22.700> I'm<00:02:23.480> not<00:02:23.540> really

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
Christmas and even then I'm not really

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.930 
Christmas and even then I'm not really
that<00:02:24.110> keen<00:02:24.350> on<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.590> as<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:24.800> say<00:02:25.100> but<00:02:25.580> there's<00:02:25.760> the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
that keen on it as I say but there's the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.210 
that keen on it as I say but there's the
name<00:02:26.120> Electrify<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.590> I'll<00:02:27.740> show<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:27.980> what<00:02:28.100> it

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
name Electrify and I'll show you what it

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.330 
name Electrify and I'll show you what it
looks<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.520> on<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.760> nail<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.980> there's<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
looks like on a nail so there's the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.750 
looks like on a nail so there's the
color<00:02:34.520> on<00:02:34.760> my<00:02:34.940> nail<00:02:35.320> as<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:37.160> can<00:02:37.310> see<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.610> is

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
color on my nail as you can see it is

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.440 
color on my nail as you can see it is
really<00:02:38.240> glittery<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.780> sparkly<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:40.580> I<00:02:40.940> don't

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
really glittery and sparkly but I don't

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.580 
really glittery and sparkly but I don't
know<00:02:41.510> whether<00:02:41.600> it's<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.140> color<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
know whether it's just the color the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.230 
know whether it's just the color the
actual<00:02:42.920> glitter<00:02:43.220> but<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.550> just<00:02:43.790> don't<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
actual glitter but I just don't like the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.550 
actual glitter but I just don't like the
source<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.600> gold<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.080> it's<00:02:45.260> got<00:02:47.560> both

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
source of gold that it's got both

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.750 
source of gold that it's got both
obviously<00:02:49.130> some<00:02:49.730> people<00:02:49.880> will<00:02:50.210> just<00:02:50.660> not<00:02:50.840> me

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.930 

this<00:02:55.760> next<00:02:56.120> color<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.750> stone<00:02:57.320> cold<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:58.490> as<00:02:58.760> you

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
this next color is stone cold and as you

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.300 
this next color is stone cold and as you
can<00:02:59.060> see<00:02:59.090> if<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.390> bring<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.780> closer<00:03:00.050> it's<00:03:00.680> this

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
can see if I bring it closer it's this

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.840 
can see if I bring it closer it's this
really<00:03:01.340> beautiful<00:03:02.060> gray<00:03:02.959> shimmer<00:03:03.610> it's<00:03:04.610> kind

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
really beautiful gray shimmer it's kind

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.690 
really beautiful gray shimmer it's kind
of<00:03:04.880> got<00:03:05.030> little<00:03:05.330> flecks<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.930> silver<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.530> it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
of got little flecks of silver in it

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.640 
of got little flecks of silver in it
this<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> really<00:03:08.420> pretty<00:03:08.630> color<00:03:08.810> definitely

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
this is a really pretty color definitely

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.720 
this is a really pretty color definitely
for<00:03:09.740> someone<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.130> likes<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.550> darker

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
for someone that likes the darker

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.430 
for someone that likes the darker
polishes<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:13.280> pretty<00:03:13.580> similar<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.440> color

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
polishes it's pretty similar to color

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.280 
polishes it's pretty similar to color
that<00:03:15.620> I've<00:03:15.740> got<00:03:15.890> already<00:03:16.160> which<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.270> by<00:03:17.720> Rimmel

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
that I've got already which is by Rimmel

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.040 
that I've got already which is by Rimmel
brow<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:19.520> black<00:03:19.820> pale<00:03:20.240> this<00:03:20.870> is

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
brow and it's black pale this is

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.930 
brow and it's black pale this is
probably<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.350> little<00:03:21.470> bit<00:03:21.709> darker<00:03:22.220> than<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.400> but

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
probably a little bit darker than it but

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.400 
probably a little bit darker than it but
it's<00:03:23.090> again<00:03:23.330> it's<00:03:23.360> got<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.780> same<00:03:23.959> source<00:03:24.260> of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
it's again it's got the same source of

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:33.040 
it's again it's got the same source of
shimmer<00:03:24.680> tones<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.310> it

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.200 

so<00:03:33.710> there's<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.100> color<00:03:34.280> straight<00:03:34.880> out<00:03:35.060> the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
so there's the color straight out the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.210 
so there's the color straight out the
bottle<00:03:35.540> onto<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.050> nail<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.530> as<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:37.040> can<00:03:37.190> see

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
bottle onto the nail and as you can see

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.000 
bottle onto the nail and as you can see

really<00:03:42.680> good<00:03:42.770> coverage<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.550> then<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.730> took

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
really good coverage and then you took

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.240 
really good coverage and then you took
one<00:03:44.150> coat<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.600> get<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.840> looking<00:03:44.990> like<00:03:45.110> this<00:03:45.440> but
