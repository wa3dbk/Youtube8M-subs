00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.180
 did not want to buy because a lot of 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.930
 will not run on the PS nor will it buy 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.059
 I did not buy my mortgage, and I 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.530

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.009
 time of the other does not accept so nice to know 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.130

 Many thanks to you, the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.780
 Stop and fire the channel 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.780
 I worked for you on base gameplay. 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.450
 When I played well, damn well. 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.000
 God damn it, it was not good, it was well for 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.310
 My gosh, and the proposal I want 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.740
 doing for you is the following you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.200
 want to see code on channel 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.090
 Calm down, it's going to be the one I'm thinking of. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.460
 I was thinking, I'll bring the point. 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.200
 blank I'll bring the game then such a game 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.780
 that the only channel these games 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.489
 I usually do not have confidence in the year. 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.870
 I can not believe these games will see 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.769
 let's go 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.780
 for a long time and for a long time and code 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.400
 I'm sure it will last for 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.129
 long as you have your 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.110
 disagreements have their weaknesses but I 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.459
 I know it's a game that's there will not 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.970
 will leave me 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.700
 so I have the mw3 bel 2 and now which one 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.470
 of goals at home and that series that 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.209
 I talked about two videos a day like you 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.549
 can see if from here the second video of the day 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.890
 I 'm starting this way I want to 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.440
 know that you think from the beginning 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.090
 start bringing varied bull codes 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.430
 For you it was bringing some goals. 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.410
 and some w 3000 doses accepting 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.120
 So but finally maybe I'll bring you beautiful 2 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.310
 For you, I could not. 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.920
 record with the flaps but there was 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.150
 got to it gave me the myllys 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.849
 action that is a program that I super 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.670
 I recommend it for you too and I can 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.069
 save the code now on morals in morals 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.799
 I have a lot of things to learn. 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.680
 codes I've already taken a course joÃ£o 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.239
 caracas I do not know, I do not know if you are 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.859
 catching you now but I found 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.150
 who did not have his job and I 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.130
 I have to make it very clear I'm playing 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.750
 everything okay at least I ask you 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.250
 have patience on the farm because I 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.260
 I do not have a very good pc 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.970
 you will vote and when you make a 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.980
 live comment will also stay with 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.230
 quality a little bit in the quality of 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.069
 Kabul but gets a little caught gameplay 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.629
 You know 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.849
 Anyway, I wish you both had a 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.349
 little patience because my pc does not 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.450
 and those things 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.129
 anyway I'm doing what I can 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.450
 I'm having a good time and everything 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.750
 that I really wanted from the bottom of 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.489
 heart is that you accept it is this 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.500
 secondary series of the channel and indeed 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.900
 I do not even know the name of the most likely series. 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.819
 who will enter as income or even know 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.790
 here's random gameplay 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.690
 random but for those who roll and roll 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.879
 Until the never will commander vai-vai kibaki 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.040
 Roland that rolls but at last I wanted to know 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.810
 if you accept channel codes at 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.090
 not yet decide what follows 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.739
 I'll do it if I'm going to do a series on 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.810
 It's true that I'm going to do it more clearly. 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.669
 You want to know if you accept the code? 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.760
 as a secondary game here of the channel only 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:16.310
 will have video at 11 o'clock normally 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.729
 crossfire and I do not know five o'clock in the afternoon 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.340
 a code video so I want to 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.010
 start with the code ahead 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.770
 I will try to get other games there but 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.690
 I finally went 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.009
 well it took me a while to choose a game that 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.349
 I was being well inside, I do not know 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.900
 I wanted a game that would let me 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.000
 game that would make me angry and 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.440
 Code to the game I'm having fun I'm not 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.490
 A problem but I'm getting myself 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.030
 come there 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.770
 I hope you like it, I'll tell you that. 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.930
 I told you there are a lot I have a lot 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.229
 thing to learn, you still know I arrived 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.930
 in the code mw3 there I was bel 2 and now the 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.509
 code is my third code but it is not the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.030
 Paul calling it that way is not having a 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.830
 game that I know but more so 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.690
 a lot of things have even a little shame 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.340
 of talking, then I have to 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.069
 learning a lot has a lot to do. 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.590
 learn from many october leave more 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.180
 finally to get very repetitive let go 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.830
 I'm here and I hope you 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.199
 Enjoy this video. I hope you guys 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.849
 Enjoy which goal if you have 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.620
 Do not forget again, I'll leave the 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.509
 here my brother did not have here 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.190
 for you to add that you are coming to 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.919
 He ended up buying as well as 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.810
 I said at the beginning of the video and finally I'm going 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.580
 Think about the cool series I do not know if I do 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.560
 a series of that the trikes there do not know 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.659
 and yet I will come up I just want to know 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.900
 first feedback you guys think 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:36.360
 Code as Channel Secondary Game 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.550
 This is a good story. 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.229
 with the end of you all did not complain 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.860
 if I was already going to be a favorite and signed up 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.779
 in the channel 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.580
 I played more or less well're training 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:45.240
 to start to bring good game place only 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.729
 you 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.729
 then that's it the tapas in the video was
