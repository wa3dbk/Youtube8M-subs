00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.890
 in the year 2010 the united nations 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.139
 declared water and sanitation as 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.450
 human right essential for enjoyment 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.730
 expectations of life opened 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.520
 for wider access to water and 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.919
 sanitation especially for millions 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.410
 of people around the world and even 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.960
 in europe that were devoid of 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.390
 these services however in the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.059
 currently such expectations have not been 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.880
 become a reality governments must 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:34.010
 take responsibility for one side of 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.679
 guarantee them and make them accessible to 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.660
 all and on the other to preserve the 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:41.449
 water resources for generations 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.140
 coming the water is a public service 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.699
 and a common good this can not be left to 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.980
 the will of the market 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.499
 liberalization will only increase the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.289
 difference between the rich and the poor 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.929
 making the poor have it more 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.879
 difficult even to get a life 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.530
 worthy many citizens are 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.350
 worried about the future of the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.390
 water services and the reason is that 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.030
 European institutions want 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.880
 liberalize them instead of ensuring their 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.970
 accessibility and its quality that all 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.740
 have access to water and sanitation 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.020
 it remains a global challenge but what 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.150
 first is that the European Union and its 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.520
 member states ensure these 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.400
 services for all those who live in the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.619
 union and then you must increase your 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.800
 efforts to make this happen 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.950
 universal way the union federation 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.509
 European public services 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.020
 together with other organizations and 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.060
 particular has decided to launch a 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.100
 European citizens' initiative for 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.920
 ensure that water remains a 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.170
 public service and a common good if more 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.360
 of one million European citizens are 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.520
 join this initiative with your signature the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.340
 European commission will have to legislate 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.100
 to guarantee everyone's right to 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.880
 water and sanitation for it 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.179
 we need your help to support us and 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.179
