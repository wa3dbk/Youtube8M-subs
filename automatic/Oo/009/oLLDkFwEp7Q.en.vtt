00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.530
 Hi there, this is me liza and I'm starting today 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.809
 first series of paper minecraft 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.710
 probably every when ore dripped or 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.990
 when building a house met him yes how are you 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:29.150
 probably already guessed it creeper 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:31.920
 i have a black and white printer 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:38.579
 creeper consists of six parts 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.520
 these are two legs two back legs a trunk and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.000
 head 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.700
 time about it took him 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.829
 Little 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:57.780
 I think this is one of the easiest 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:00.149
 which figures I already have yes 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.680
 so I think this is one of the most 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.680
 easy here 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.880
 it means the scheme of this creeper I will leave in 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.490
 To my VKontakte group I will write a link to 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.660
 description 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:28.710
 following this we will have mumps yes 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.850
 so here I am and have a penny on 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.730
 many paper product options in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.150
 pigs are not drawn 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.420
 scheme 5. so I had a penny 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.400
 cut from the scheme 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.700
 paradise pig here turned a revolution 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.880
 cool very much as we see him not 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.940
 here in the head on the head here such 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.090
 sticks out a little behind 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.800
 more precisely head trample a little here 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.530
 this in order that it was created to 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.810
 more realistic single I can't 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.450
 understand minecraft why there are no pigs 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:17.810
 cats and pony tail would create 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:25.470
 cool here are blue there are four paws 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:35.390
 torso means head and penny and 3 on 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:35.390
 today could this we will have a zombie zombie 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:44.610
 oddly enough on this zombie 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.260
 he has two legs two arms torso 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.190
 head 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:55.530
 everything is logical that's actually green 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.519
 well i repeat my printer is black and white 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.900
 and also his scheme I will lay out my group in 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:08.100
 contact and in contact will also be 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.400
 poll who should I review next 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.400
 series 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.090
 that is, there will be such subjects for example 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:21.270
 100 enchantments small critter and 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:29.250
 for example already thrown spoons can also be 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:33.000
 chicken means you can different shapes cake 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.690
 and big steve well it is you yourself 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.410
 to choose 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.410
 and now see you all for now
