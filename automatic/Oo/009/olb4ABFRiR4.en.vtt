00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
and then went out and got an ice

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.619 
and then went out and got an ice
chocolate<00:03:31.799> ice<00:03:32.340> chokolate<00:03:33.060> with<00:03:33.239> my<00:03:33.389> mum

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
chocolate ice chokolate with my mum

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.750 
chocolate ice chokolate with my mum
which<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.440> like<00:03:34.590> ice<00:03:34.799> cream<00:03:35.129> and<00:03:35.250> ice<00:03:35.430> and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
which is like ice cream and ice and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.640 
which is like ice cream and ice and
chocolate<00:03:36.150> which<00:03:36.299> is<00:03:36.329> really<00:03:36.750> nice<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.379> I

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
chocolate which is really nice but I

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.170 
chocolate which is really nice but I
think<00:03:37.889> that<00:03:38.190> might<00:03:38.370> not<00:03:38.549> have<00:03:38.639> helped<00:03:38.970> and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
think that might not have helped and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.960 
think that might not have helped and
then<00:03:39.750> when<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.900> got<00:03:40.109> home<00:03:40.379> I<00:03:40.799> had<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.280> cup<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.669> tea

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
then when I got home I had a cup of tea

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.809 
then when I got home I had a cup of tea
it's<00:03:42.599> a<00:03:42.690> restore<00:03:43.280> I've<00:03:44.280> been<00:03:44.519> drinking

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
it's a restore I've been drinking

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.369 
it's a restore I've been drinking
everything<00:03:45.060> through<00:03:45.419> straws<00:03:45.750> which<00:03:46.049> kind<00:03:46.319> of

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
everything through straws which kind of

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.839 
everything through straws which kind of
helps<00:03:46.739> but<00:03:46.979> it<00:03:47.069> also<00:03:47.190> means<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.609> if<00:03:47.760> you

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
helps but it also means that if you
