00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.609
 hello such a greetings to everyone in this 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.560
 video will teach them as though they 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.010
 a little ugly force the download of the new 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.920
 windows 10 and installation poster by 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.480
 what do I say force because windows is 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.630
 sending by phase of the operating system 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.720
 throughout the world and so everyone 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.519
 but as he said in phases because I do not 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.710
 send all at the same time because 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.579
 obviously their servers would be 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.140
 saturated and it would be very tedious to go down 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.759
 in update when a lot of people the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.980
 world is downloading it now there's 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.870
 people are often downloading and 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.180
 that's why they can see small problems or 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.489
 that does not let you download them or a bit of 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.070
 slowness perhaps downloading ours 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.950
 operative 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.870
 so I 'm going to explain this trick 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.090
 that currently works very well in 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.730
 windows 2.1 I do not know and in windows 7 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.489
 but I would believe that if you do not try and 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.530
 they comment and as I tell them, I already 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.410
 try on my computer and if it works 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.970
 very well with an 8.1 between the videos them 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.949
 explained this trick that is very simple 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.930
 and then here is going to explain a little 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.130
 better by adding some new things like 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.350
 which as which 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.299
 that to be able to do this trick then what 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.520
 advisable and best for 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.770
 work is to have the whole update 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.500
 of windows downloaded that is to say 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.720
 be able to download the new windows 10 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.390
 you have to have your windows 8.1 or 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.850
 windows 8 a day 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.030
 This is how it is very easy to 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.130
 those who still do not know or have not done it 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.310
 open my pc or directly the panel 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.290
 control here control panel and they give you 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.680
 in appearance and personalization to the 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.550
 left system and security 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.510
 and then in windows update here is the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.610
 windows updates center 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.950
 and he looks for updates him 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.350
 will automatically search and tell you which 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.830
 are the ones that are there and you 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.440
 you are simply going to give it to install 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.580
 first they are downloaded and then they install 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.720
 restart the computer whatever 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.560
 necessary to look like the 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.689
 updates 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.009
 and if you run with luck finally you 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.380
 will let download the new update 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.970
 of windows 10 otherwise 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.770
 we proceed to the trick that I 'm going to 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.770
 indicate that I had to use it too 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.970
 what we are going to do is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.590
 and open start 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.569
 search and write cmd 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.170
 What is the command window windows 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.379
 here and we give him right click and execute 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.340
 as an administrator we say that if 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.239
 Copy the command that I leave in 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.239
 video description 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:45.569
 and they hit it right click paste is this 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.569
 we proceed to give him enter I already did 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.920
 once they give you enter and you open 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.400
 where the accessibility center of 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.080
 update and then commonly expect 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.930
 12 minutes and it will begin to 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.910
 download update otherwise 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.580
 what are we going to do that also touched me 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.210
 do it to me we put in 19 disc themes 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.420
 local c 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.540
 then in windows 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.549
 and we download a folder called 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.099
 software distribution here on download 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.599
 we select everything and we give suppress 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.609
 everything will be eliminated because we are going to eliminate 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.829
 all this that was internally 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.989
 just not the folder itself just 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.790
 before the world we stuff all this all 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.750
 I already did it are the new locations 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.820
 who is downloading 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.270
 one've done this because we now proceed 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:41.510
 yes make the step of the ccm window 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.220
 with this, it would work for them if not 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.880
 Well, all they have to do is 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.400
 restart and go back to being the step but already 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.590
 it would be that they have to wait and 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.180
 have patience because I do not know to me 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.430
 Really 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.769
 In the beginning it did not work for me and I returned it 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.870
 to do with this last type that 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.900
 I said to delete it from downloads and there yes 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.670
 it worked so for those who have not yet 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.829
 have that is the trick if you do not 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.109
 it works then to have patience because 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.359
 Windows is going to send it to everyone and 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.480
 let's hope that this operating system is 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:17.570
 as much as what windows says that is what 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.130
 that promises and we hope that if that is 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.919
 all boys I hope you have them 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.770
 liked it worked like it 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:28.090
 it worked and if they liked it I hope it 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.090
 subscribe and until next time
