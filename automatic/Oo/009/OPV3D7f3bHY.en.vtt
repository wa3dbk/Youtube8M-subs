not-too-distant future it could design
improvements<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.280> itself<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.360> now<00:02:52.570> it's

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
improvements to itself and now it's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.380 
improvements to itself and now it's
murder<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.650> know<00:02:54.370> you're<00:02:54.580> trying<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.150> get

murder so I know you're trying to get
people<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:56.140> cautious<00:02:56.920> there<00:02:57.489> but<00:02:58.239> why

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
people to be cautious there but why

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.720 
people to be cautious there but why
should<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.020> not<00:02:59.350> be<00:02:59.410> excited<00:02:59.680> about<00:03:00.160> fighting<00:03:00.550> a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
should I not be excited about fighting a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.030 
should I not be excited about fighting a
robot<00:03:01.800> littles<00:03:02.970> well<00:03:03.970> ok<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:05.170> start<00:03:05.440> we<00:03:05.830> don't

sure because what could a robot do that
I<00:03:09.880> couldn't<00:03:10.300> then<00:03:10.480> fight<00:03:10.720> back<00:03:10.930> with<00:03:11.110> by

I couldn't then fight back with by
simply<00:03:11.650> just<00:03:12.040> unplugging<00:03:12.640> him<00:03:12.940> right<00:03:13.420> there's

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
simply just unplugging him right there's

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.410 
simply just unplugging him right there's
a<00:03:14.410> story<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.910> scientists<00:03:15.910> built<00:03:16.180> an

a story that scientists built an

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.590 
a story that scientists built an
intelligent<00:03:17.230> computer<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.640> first<00:03:18.880> question

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
intelligent computer the first question

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.100 
intelligent computer the first question
they<00:03:19.750> asked<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.350> was<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:21.280> there<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.730> god<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
they asked it was is there a god the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.400 
they asked it was is there a god the
computer<00:03:23.769> replied<00:03:24.220> there<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.030> now<00:03:25.420> an<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.170> bolt

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
computer replied there is now an a bolt

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.160 
computer replied there is now an a bolt
of<00:03:26.739> lightning<00:03:27.280> striking<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.910> plug<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:28.540> it

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
of lightning striking a plug so it

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.520

couldn't<00:03:29.680> be<00:03:29.799> turned<00:03:30.250> off<00:03:30.810> holy<00:03:32.350> that's

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
couldn't be turned off holy that's

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.080 
couldn't be turned off holy that's
the<00:03:32.650> most<00:03:32.830> terrifying<00:03:33.340> story<00:03:33.700> I've<00:03:33.910> ever

that professor because if computers had

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.320 
that professor because if computers had
become<00:03:47.980> sentient<00:03:48.430> what<00:03:48.670> better<00:03:48.970> way<00:03:49.269> to

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
become sentient what better way to

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.270 
become sentient what better way to
convince<00:03:49.690> people<00:03:49.989> they<00:03:50.200> hadn't<00:03:50.680> then<00:03:51.070> by

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
that's in chaos politically socially and

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.930 
that's in chaos politically socially and
environmentally<00:04:11.470> how<00:04:12.130> can<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.459> human<00:04:12.610> race

environmentally how can the human race

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.120 
environmentally how can the human race
sustain<00:04:13.420> another<00:04:13.810> hundred<00:04:14.290> years<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.709> month

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
sustain another hundred years a month

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.610 
sustain another hundred years a month
later<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.640> said<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.239> don't<00:04:16.479> know<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.019> answer

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
later you said I don't know the answer

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.890 
later you said I don't know the answer
that's<00:04:18.100> why<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.400> asked<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.850> question<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.720> get

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
that's why I asked the question to get

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.839 
that's why I asked the question to get
people<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.289> think<00:04:20.470> about<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.430> be<00:04:21.459> aware

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
people to think about it and to be aware

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.110 
people to think about it and to be aware
of<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.240> dangers<00:04:22.630> we<00:04:22.750> now<00:04:22.930> face<00:04:23.229> so<00:04:24.039> it's<00:04:24.880> now

have an answer at least a chance of
nuclear<00:04:35.380> annihilation<00:04:35.680> has<00:04:36.490> diminished<00:04:37.030> but

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
nuclear annihilation has diminished but

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.170 
nuclear annihilation has diminished but
there<00:04:38.169> are<00:04:38.380> plenty<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.860> other<00:04:39.220> dangers<00:04:39.580> out

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
there are plenty of other dangers out

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:35.469 
wormhole yes okay what about this uh me

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:37.020 
wormhole yes okay what about this uh me
going<00:06:35.500> on<00:06:35.860> a<00:06:35.890> date<00:06:36.159> with<00:06:36.190> Charlize<00:06:36.760> Theron

going on a date with Charlize Theron

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.749 
going on a date with Charlize Theron
yeah

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
yeah

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:42.920 
yeah
not<00:06:39.120> at<00:06:39.300> all<00:06:39.629> in<00:06:39.870> in<00:06:40.199> no<00:06:40.650> universe<00:06:41.009> or<00:06:41.639> in<00:06:42.180> in

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
not at all in in no universe or in in

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.170 
not at all in in no universe or in in
none<00:06:43.229> of<00:06:43.259> the<00:06:43.469> infinite<00:06:44.099> universes<00:06:44.610> does<00:06:45.029> that

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
none of the infinite universes does that

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.189 
none of the infinite universes does that
happen<00:06:46.129> it's<00:06:47.129> completely<00:06:47.939> beyond<00:06:48.659> the<00:06:48.839> bounds

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
happen it's completely beyond the bounds

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.749 
happen it's completely beyond the bounds
of<00:06:49.289> scientific<00:06:49.800> possibilities<00:06:50.400> what<00:06:50.610> you're

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
of scientific possibilities what you're

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.070 
of scientific possibilities what you're
saying<00:06:50.939> yes<00:06:51.559> a<00:06:52.969> quick<00:06:53.969> follow-up<00:06:54.360> question<00:06:54.509> in

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
saying yes a quick follow-up question in

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.929 
saying yes a quick follow-up question in
any<00:06:55.289> of<00:06:55.469> those<00:06:55.650> potential<00:06:56.069> universes<00:06:56.789> and

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939 
any of those potential universes and

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.420 
any of those potential universes and
either<00:06:57.180> one<00:06:57.509> rejecting<00:06:58.020> her<00:06:58.379> and<00:06:58.740> that's<00:06:59.189> why

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
either one rejecting her and that's why

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.480 
either one rejecting her and that's why
it<00:06:59.490> doesn't<00:06:59.759> work<00:06:59.879> out<00:07:00.180> no<00:07:00.770> you<00:07:01.770> to<00:07:01.949> realize

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
it doesn't work out no you to realize

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.879 
it doesn't work out no you to realize
that<00:07:02.520> typing<00:07:03.330> your<00:07:03.509> response<00:07:03.960> is<00:07:04.229> difficult

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
that typing your response is difficult

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.679 
that typing your response is difficult
for<00:07:05.219> me<00:07:05.339> correct

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:06.689

okay sure yeah it's just I'm trying to
play<00:07:08.879> this<00:07:09.089> out<00:07:09.330> because<00:07:09.539> it<00:07:09.960> just<00:07:10.199> I<00:07:10.409> just

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:10.439

play this out because it just I just
trying<00:07:10.800> to<00:07:10.860> see<00:07:10.979> if<00:07:11.039> there<00:07:11.189> was<00:07:11.279> any

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
trying to see if there was any

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.239 
trying to see if there was any
hypothetical<00:07:11.969> hole<00:07:12.659> it<00:07:12.899> doesn't<00:07:13.229> matter<00:07:13.379> but

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:14.249 
hypothetical hole it doesn't matter but

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:17.929 
hypothetical hole it doesn't matter but
but<00:07:14.520> never<00:07:14.729> say<00:07:14.939> never<00:07:15.349> okay<00:07:16.349> if<00:07:16.949> time<00:07:17.460> travel

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:17.939 
but never say never okay if time travel

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:20.689 
but never say never okay if time travel
were<00:07:18.120> possible<00:07:18.710> would<00:07:19.710> you<00:07:19.860> want<00:07:20.069> to<00:07:20.189> go<00:07:20.339> back

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 
were possible would you want to go back

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.329 
were possible would you want to go back
in<00:07:20.939> time<00:07:21.149> and<00:07:21.539> refuse<00:07:22.379> to<00:07:22.409> do<00:07:22.710> this<00:07:22.919> interview
