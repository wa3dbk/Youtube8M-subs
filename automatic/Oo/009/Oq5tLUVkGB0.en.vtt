most people have experienced this you

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.519 
most people have experienced this you
create<00:00:03.179> or<00:00:03.300> select<00:00:03.449> an<00:00:03.720> object<00:00:04.080> in<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.290> scene

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
create or select an object in the scene

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.980 
create or select an object in the scene
and<00:00:04.799> then<00:00:05.609> select<00:00:05.970> one<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.180> your<00:00:06.299> transform

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
and then select one of your transform

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.549 
and then select one of your transform
tools<00:00:07.259> move<00:00:08.040> rotate<00:00:08.400> or<00:00:08.790> scale<00:00:09.469> instead<00:00:10.469> of

that are aligned with a constrained axis

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.709 
that are aligned with a constrained axis
it<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.489> difficult<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.180> move<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.510> any

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it is very difficult to move in any

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.810 
it is very difficult to move in any
other<00:01:00.989> direction<00:01:01.199> than<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.399> axis

other direction than that of that axis

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.649 
other direction than that of that axis
in<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:04.379> case<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.400> Bezier<00:01:05.790> handle<00:01:06.210> lies<00:01:06.390> on

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
in this case the Bezier handle lies on

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
in this case the Bezier handle lies on
the<00:01:06.780> y<00:01:06.960> axis<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.560> he<00:01:07.860> cannot<00:01:08.130> move<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.729> X

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the y axis and he cannot move it in X

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.570 
the y axis and he cannot move it in X
for<00:01:09.119> example<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> couple<00:01:11.369> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
for example so you have a couple of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
for example so you have a couple of
solutions<00:01:12.080> one<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.409> use<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.619> minus<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
solutions one is to use the minus and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.460 
solutions one is to use the minus and
plus<00:01:14.400> keyboard<00:01:15.119> keys<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.750> make<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> gizmo

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
plus keyboard keys to make the gizmo

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
plus keyboard keys to make the gizmo
smaller<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.159> bigger<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.360> freely<00:01:18.689> move

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
smaller or bigger so you can freely move

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.950 
smaller or bigger so you can freely move
the<00:01:19.170> handles<00:01:19.729> use<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.970> main<00:01:21.180> plus<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.689> minus

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the handles use the main plus and minus
