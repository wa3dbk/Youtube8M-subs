00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.160
 I think that I would like to carry out a product review of Hane-Domo well this time 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:13.000
 Well I and four other until Eddie article of the microphone 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.900
 I'm sleeping from a colleague Technica, isn't it Mike? 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.310
 Speaking of the type of pin-mike to put on clothes, maybe there's a big measure a little higher 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.200
 May be 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.340
 It is type to put on clothes, so price is about 800 yen for having bought to amazon 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.840
 is not it 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.610
 Well 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.360
 Kinda may be whether there is a three-dimensional effect unlike we were monaural microphone Well Throw the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.280
 Not well 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.820
 I am better because white noise spreads a little 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.860
 So from here you're not a strap 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:49.900
 Oh , it's like a clip microphone, Oh , it's wind. 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.410
 The plug-in-per method is easy to understand, I like this plug-in power. 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.990
 Do it that way 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.940
 Is it only a building 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:01.070
 Application Internet 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.180
 Also Nde some things that can not use the plug-ins of the island of microphone 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:11.090
 Please note 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.090
 The accessories seem to save quite like this pouch and then ho 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:21.730
 Let's get rid of all the clip mics 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:26.220
 It is not as nice to say at all is a feeling of weight and have 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.220
 Really cormorants also here both 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.430
 It is from at all 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.920
 Well of course this is different 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.659
 This is as you imagined a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.409
 Oh yeah 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.630
 It is these three today 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.659
 Let's reflect on the sound quality check 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:52.320
 Yes Well it here is Well 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:57.150
 Whether the first half 10 station has not harbor from ELCOM's guess is what I bought on foot 9 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:03.030
 Here is a headset headset 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.150
 It's picky and there is part that leads to the microphone from the headset like this network 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 in this way 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.920
 This is the thought that going to change because you are using a two-year Board Atomo You There is also the Tteyuu was home 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.190
 It was 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.600
 The first person who wants to buy a microphone is 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:23.210
 I think it might be better to buy something a little better 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.420
 Atk of use Technica's Let's reflected in the better of Japan and 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:31.090
 Yes here is out of the Audio-Technica's 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.790
 It is atq circle 4 atq q Marie half 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.819
 I this 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.230
 It is a story of the code which entered the player most well 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.430
 This is this 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.520
 If you touch it close to it, it will drop a little. 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.290
 Hair is almost silent- 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:54.520
 This is pretty good It is easy to move 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:58.930
 But it is not so much sound even slightly moving 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.880
 After all there is one drawback but still 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:07.100
 Because things are the microphone 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.000
 There is not much change about white noise, but this one is better a little 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.030
 ing 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.030
 I do not feel like I do not feel 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.790
 Neh so for white noise 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.510
 Too much expectation 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:27.780
 It may not be possible 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.120
 Well, people who are thinking of changing every time are not so high and I said strength but 2800 yen 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.160
 is not it 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:37.440
 You ne Moreover, in the types to be attached to the clothes think this pretty good 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.440
 Pretty I can not feel bad appearance I 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:46.370
 To have the original wind jammer window in the road screen key ? 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:51.020
 This is also with altogether It is quite good, which was also Fumofu 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:57.220
 The wind also comes in and prevents it 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:04:00.830
 This is also different is rated was narrow after all it is pretty good Do not quite 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.460
 But I know the white noise is to form Tteyuu hate 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.260
 Says the stereo of Mai-kun 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.360
 Talk microphone amplifier 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.800
 I think it is good , but I bought it by every turn of the Japanese but bought it 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.070
 It's high pretty single cold wave over 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.500
 Yes Well See you the product reviews in this side 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.709

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.300

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:31.699
 Because I'm also trying to set up a channel's audio conference and so on 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.420
 Such a mouth that there also I hope there of this 5 midi with if off the coast 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.009
