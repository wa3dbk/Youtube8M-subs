00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that's exactly what we're gonna get from

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.399 
that's exactly what we're gonna get from
this<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.150> summoners<00:01:42.810> jatt<00:01:43.079> run<00:01:43.259> us<00:01:43.380> through

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this one summoners jatt run us through

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.039 
this one summoners jatt run us through
them<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.060> barrier<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
them so with the barrier it's just the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.600 
them so with the barrier it's just the
big<00:01:46.200> difference<00:01:46.560> between<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.979> exhaust<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
big difference between the exhaust I

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.310 
big difference between the exhaust I
think<00:01:48.270> there's<00:01:48.390> more<00:01:48.509> baiting<00:01:48.899> potential

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
think there's more baiting potential

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530 
think there's more baiting potential
from<00:01:49.439> Diamond<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.920> he<00:01:50.280> has<00:01:50.549> gone<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
from Diamond and he has gone for the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.359 
from Diamond and he has gone for the
