the people on the other end if you're

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.799 
the people on the other end if you're
using<00:00:38.399> skype<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.030> example<00:00:39.360> sometimes<00:00:39.570> the

using skype for example sometimes the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:40.880 
using skype for example sometimes the
person<00:00:39.960> sounds<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.410> they're<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> tunnel

person sounds like they're in a tunnel
what<00:00:41.460> we've<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.910> tried<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
what we've really tried to do is

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.600 
what we've really tried to do is
eliminate<00:00:42.750> some<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> those<00:00:43.320> defects<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.130> for

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
eliminate some of those defects so for

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
eliminate some of those defects so for
us<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.300> start<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.630> develop<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.200> leverage

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
us as we start to develop and leverage

it's one of the only patents in the

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:14.719 
it's one of the only patents in the
space<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.350> what<00:01:13.499> it<00:01:13.590> does<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.100> allows<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
space so what it does is it allows you

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.879 
space so what it does is it allows you
to<00:01:14.939> listen<00:01:15.119> longer<00:01:15.539> louder<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.200> most

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:16.889 
to listen longer louder and most

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:18.319 
to listen longer louder and most
importantly<00:01:17.459> it<00:01:17.639> has<00:01:17.700> an<00:01:17.880> improved<00:01:18.179> sound

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
importantly it has an improved sound

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.719 
importantly it has an improved sound
quality<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.319> typically<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.009> way<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.249> kind<00:01:20.639> of

quality so typically the way we kind of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.929 
quality so typically the way we kind of
stumbled<00:01:21.209> upon<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.569> technology<00:01:22.139> per<00:01:22.319> se<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
stumbled upon the technology per se is

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.489 
stumbled upon the technology per se is
we<00:01:23.939> started<00:01:24.270> looking<00:01:24.359> at<00:01:24.659> we're<00:01:24.869> hearing<00:01:25.349> goes

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
we started looking at we're hearing goes

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:27.289

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
first and the higher frequencies what

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.489 
first and the higher frequencies what
we've<00:01:27.420> been<00:01:27.539> able<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
we've been able to do is with this
