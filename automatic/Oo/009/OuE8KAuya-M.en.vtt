00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 here to do a little 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.269
 modification thing is that on this 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.420
 bushings in this place here here you can see 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.849
 yes it is a question of depth limiter 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.990
 crushed through 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.740
 data with everything through it just 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.350
 bulging on the other hand doesn't give sex 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.430
 inch tube 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.449
 go through it limit it 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.449
 limited accumulated here we need for 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.450
 our fridge do so 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.079
 the tube it passed us bush have gotta 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.340
 get in 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.590
 sources will look like this 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.930
 while she is mobile of course the wine is full and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.170
 process and solder 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.399
 the same solder that he was afraid 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.399
 two such things from two sides 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:11.970
 knob is fed forward after turning and in 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.710
 As a result, Father cuts through the soft 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.950
 copper pipe because carbide 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.370
 as if you donâ€™t have one 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.860
 cutter to pipe can be ordinary pilot 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.580
 metal is nothing terrible blood in 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.930
 principle then sanding and everything can 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.960
 understand the principles he details his principle 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.280
 work thing is all that reflex 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.270
 colony bar falling on the second stage 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.210
 cooling is already in principle cooled 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.440
 all together 80 degrees Celsius that is 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.960
 refrigerator length in one straight method 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.710
 pipes can handle condensation 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.750
 floor carrying capacity 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:06.450
 half inch pipes of erotica habitual 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:09.300
 therefore, in principle, from calculations 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:16.830
 off to four gallons per hour 100 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:23.100
 power how it is done is taken half an inch 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:26.430
 this we are still on the dry collected 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:33.600
 one inch adapter on deck 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:35.700
 then taken home happy with 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.260
 the opposite side of our 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.260
 the fridge let's the same 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:52.090
 then come back an inch in this which 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.790
 dressed on top and it will not work 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.950
 work the casing of our fridge then 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.610
 there is water will flow into these 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.830
 holes 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.830
 going out will be open from there and 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.670
 the result will be very active 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.670
 cooling 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.850
 here on what you need to think 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.710
 when is it you collect it about which 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.700
 the side will be the directional tube will be 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.360
 they watch one side 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:28.270
 opposite all purity of the word if u 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.670
 you kitchen this size kitchen allow and 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.890
 dimensions do not allow your cube and so 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.020
 further so on we might think 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.590
 it is worth turning to the opposite 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.240
 side under 90 degrees now I will collect 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.980
 dry out for you to see completely 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:52.620
 assembly too dry assembled 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:55.840
 see the chimney passes inside the floor 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.520
 chimney outside here with this 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.490
 sides from the opposite side all 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.470
 will be sealed and sealed that 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:09.280
 the diver did not leak 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.100
 Here is the assembly at the moment, but I have 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.989
 look well let's say I want to take 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.010
 the opposite side 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.830
 options of course who as you want who 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.830
 wants to put a fast connection who 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.790
 wants permanent screw or solder 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.270
 this is your choice 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.220
 suck sport prevented add 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.670
 detachable 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.670
 brewed 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.160
 take off 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.529
 fridge 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.980
 from stepdaughter noticeable 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.190
 by hand 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.289
 the best 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.360
 right now this place is all soldered 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.560
 here 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.210
 this 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.210
 chimney set bye 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.460
 clutch will be the opposite side 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.040
 dressed in all 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.670
 what 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.670
 then we finish 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.520
 fall 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.789
 desirable 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.789
 took 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.770
 here is 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.469
 only 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.310
 this is land well you have become on of course 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.450
 walk 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.450
 pales
