so now we have new demons in runescape
and<00:00:02.190> I<00:00:02.370> decided<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:03.000> investigate<00:00:03.449> it<00:00:03.870> so<00:00:04.529> after

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
and I decided to investigate it so after

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.039 
and I decided to investigate it so after
the<00:00:05.250> update<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.700> went<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.240> read<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.540> news<00:00:06.720> post

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
and I saw that they can drop uncut onyx

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.589 
and I saw that they can drop uncut onyx
so<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.530> thought<00:00:10.980> ok<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:11.880> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.210> be<00:00:12.330> quite<00:00:12.570> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
so I thought ok it's going to be quite a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.720 
so I thought ok it's going to be quite a
tear<00:00:12.900> drop<00:00:13.110> I'm<00:00:13.440> probably<00:00:13.710> not<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.490> get

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
tear drop I'm probably not going to get

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.900 
tear drop I'm probably not going to get
one<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.900> was<00:00:16.139> actually<00:00:16.379> quite<00:00:16.740> wrong<00:00:17.460> I

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
one and I was actually quite wrong I

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.620

managed<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> get<00:00:18.660> quite<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.289> few<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.740> those<00:00:20.630> also

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
managed to get quite a few of those also

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.859 
managed to get quite a few of those also
I<00:00:22.020> asked<00:00:22.859> some<00:00:23.400> people<00:00:23.550> around<00:00:23.970> did<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:24.689> get

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
you know because right now it's level 60

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.850 
you know because right now it's level 60
only<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.759> maybe<00:01:30.060> level<00:01:30.299> 75<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.530> could<00:01:31.770> be

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
only so maybe level 75 if that could be

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.640 
only so maybe level 75 if that could be
added<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.060> would<00:01:33.329> arrive<00:01:33.810> everything

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
added then it would arrive everything

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950
