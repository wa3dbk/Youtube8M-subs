architecture is the art and science of
making<00:00:18.720> sure<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.140> our<00:00:19.609> cities<00:00:20.609> and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
making sure that our cities and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.509 
making sure that our cities and
buildings<00:00:21.060> actually<00:00:21.630> fit<00:00:22.170> with<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> way<00:00:23.310> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
buildings actually fit with the way we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.400 
buildings actually fit with the way we
want<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> live<00:00:23.939> our<00:00:24.060> lives<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:25.289> process<00:00:25.769> of

want to live our lives the process of

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.970 
want to live our lives the process of
manifesting<00:00:28.410> our<00:00:29.720> society<00:00:30.800> into<00:00:31.800> our

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
manifesting our society into our

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.860 
manifesting our society into our
physical<00:00:32.430> world<00:00:32.750> life<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.050> always<00:00:34.440> evolving

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
physical world life is always evolving

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.860 
physical world life is always evolving
and<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.140> life<00:00:37.380> evolves<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.300> should<00:00:39.300> our<00:00:39.480> cities

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
and as life evolves so should our cities

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.560 
and as life evolves so should our cities
and<00:00:40.050> buildings<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.620> they<00:00:40.770> fit<00:00:41.149> with<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> way

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and buildings so they fit with the way

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.500 
and buildings so they fit with the way
we<00:00:42.719> want<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> live<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:45.030> maybe<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
we want to live and I think maybe in the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.700 
we want to live and I think maybe in the
really<00:00:45.870> big<00:00:46.050> picture<00:00:47.629> life<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:49.020> planet<00:00:49.500> Earth

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
really big picture life on planet Earth

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.510 
really big picture life on planet Earth
has<00:00:50.420> evolved<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.930> Darwinian<00:00:52.500> sense<00:00:53.449> through

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
has evolved in a Darwinian sense through

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.819 
has evolved in a Darwinian sense through
millions<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.760> years<00:00:58.730> by<00:00:59.730> adapting<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
millions of years by adapting to the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.910 
millions of years by adapting to the
surroundings

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
surroundings

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.890 
surroundings
so<00:01:05.980> different<00:01:06.980> life-forms<00:01:07.550> would<00:01:07.940> evolve

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
so different life-forms would evolve

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.840 
so different life-forms would evolve
attributes<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.130> would<00:01:10.280> allow<00:01:10.460> them<00:01:10.670> to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
attributes that would allow them to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
attributes that would allow them to
occupy<00:01:11.920> different<00:01:12.920> eco<00:01:13.520> niches<00:01:13.910> so<00:01:14.660> life

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
occupy different eco niches so life

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.170 
occupy different eco niches so life
always<00:01:15.380> adapted<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.820> physical

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
always adapted to the physical

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.990 
always adapted to the physical
environment<00:01:17.860> when<00:01:18.860> we<00:01:19.130> invented<00:01:20.620> technology

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
environment when we invented technology

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.310 
environment when we invented technology
tools<00:01:23.470> architecture<00:01:24.700> we<00:01:26.290> reverse<00:01:27.290> that

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
tools architecture we reverse that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.469 
tools architecture we reverse that
situation<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.400> we<00:01:28.610> started<00:01:29.060> actually

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
situation and we started actually

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.469 
situation and we started actually
adapting<00:01:30.110> our<00:01:31.010> physical<00:01:31.490> environment<00:01:31.640> to

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
adapting our physical environment to

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.550 
adapting our physical environment to
life<00:01:33.400> so<00:01:34.400> rather<00:01:34.670> than<00:01:34.910> living<00:01:35.720> in<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:35.960> tree<00:01:36.200> or

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
life so rather than living in a tree or

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.040 
life so rather than living in a tree or
living<00:01:36.800> in<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:37.009> cave<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:38.240> could<00:01:38.450> build<00:01:38.690> our<00:01:38.900> own

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
living in a cave we could build our own

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.810 
living in a cave we could build our own
tree<00:01:39.410> we<00:01:39.619> could<00:01:39.770> build<00:01:39.860> our<00:01:40.009> own<00:01:40.070> cave

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
tree we could build our own cave

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.450 
tree we could build our own cave
we<00:01:41.270> got<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:42.320> possibility<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.220> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
we got the possibility and the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.870 
we got the possibility and the
responsibility<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.590> shape<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.280> world<00:01:46.520> around

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
responsibility to shape the world around

responsibility to shape the world around
life<00:01:47.810> rather<00:01:48.590> than<00:01:48.740> life<00:01:49.040> being<00:01:49.550> shaped<00:01:49.850> by

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
life rather than life being shaped by

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.410 
life rather than life being shaped by
the<00:01:50.149> world<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.310> think<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:52.850> sense<00:01:53.149> it's

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the world and I think in that sense it's

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.859 
the world and I think in that sense it's
a<00:01:53.660> it's<00:01:54.560> an<00:01:54.680> amazing<00:01:55.040> power<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:56.060> an<00:01:56.479> amazing

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
a it's an amazing power and an amazing

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.920 
a it's an amazing power and an amazing
responsibility<00:01:57.619> to<00:01:58.580> be<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.300> charge<00:01:59.630> of

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
responsibility to be in charge of

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.010 
responsibility to be in charge of
creating<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.770> world<00:02:00.800> we<00:02:01.190> want<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.460> live<00:02:01.580> in

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
creating the world we want to live in

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.770 
creating the world we want to live in
so<00:02:03.020> as<00:02:03.460> human<00:02:04.460> beings<00:02:04.759> we<00:02:05.030> don't<00:02:05.330> have<00:02:05.630> to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
so as human beings we don't have to

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.740 
so as human beings we don't have to
accept<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.619> world<00:02:09.799> as<00:02:10.010> it<00:02:10.070> is<00:02:10.450> we<00:02:11.450> can

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
accept the world as it is we can

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.990 
accept the world as it is we can
actually<00:02:11.900> create<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.739> world<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.250> our<00:02:13.370> dreams

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.039 

creating<00:02:17.000> an<00:02:17.090> office<00:02:17.239> is<00:02:17.570> also<00:02:17.840> very<00:02:18.019> much

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
creating an office is also very much

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.590 
creating an office is also very much
like<00:02:18.440> an<00:02:18.560> evolutionary<00:02:19.130> process<00:02:19.280> it's<00:02:19.820> and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
like an evolutionary process it's and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.060 
like an evolutionary process it's and
it's<00:02:20.870> an<00:02:20.989> evolution<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.470> process<00:02:21.830> because

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
it's an evolution of process because

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.060 
it's an evolution of process because
like<00:02:22.190> as<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.610> office<00:02:23.590> evolves<00:02:25.000> your<00:02:26.000> role<00:02:26.330> is

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
like as the office evolves your role is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.580 
like as the office evolves your role is
constantly<00:02:28.070> changing<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.959> think<00:02:30.440> like

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
constantly changing so I think like

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.060 
constantly changing so I think like
every<00:02:30.950> three<00:02:31.130> months<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.760> realize<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.799> can

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
every three months I realize that I can

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.860 
every three months I realize that I can
no<00:02:34.220> longer<00:02:34.430> do<00:02:34.700> what<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:34.970> did<00:02:35.239> three<00:02:35.480> months<00:02:35.660> ago

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
no longer do what I did three months ago

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.199 
no longer do what I did three months ago
I<00:02:35.989> have<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.410> do<00:02:36.530> things<00:02:36.799> differently<00:02:37.370> because

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
I have to do things differently because

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.509 
I have to do things differently because
the<00:02:39.049> project<00:02:39.440> has<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.160> office<00:02:40.430> has

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
the project has a like the office has

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.930 
the project has a like the office has
evolved<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.180> my<00:02:42.049> role<00:02:42.320> in<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:43.400> constantly

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
evolved and my role in it is constantly

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.270 
evolved and my role in it is constantly
evolving<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.630> think<00:02:45.500> one<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.860> important

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
evolving I think one of the important

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.990 
evolving I think one of the important
things<00:02:46.459> about<00:02:46.580> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
things about the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.520 
things about the
creating<00:02:48.840> an<00:02:48.930> office<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:51.350> have<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
creating an office is that you have the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.920 
creating an office is that you have the
opportunity<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.670> responsibility<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
opportunity and the responsibility to

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.770 
opportunity and the responsibility to
create<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.560> work<00:02:55.830> environment<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.780> you

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.090 

a<00:06:06.320> sort<00:06:07.010> of<00:06:07.070> a<00:06:07.100> hypothetical<00:06:07.460> deductive

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
a sort of a hypothetical deductive

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.100 
a sort of a hypothetical deductive
experimentation<00:06:10.100> that<00:06:10.310> you<00:06:11.300> use<00:06:11.870> your

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
experimentation that you use your

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.340 
experimentation that you use your
thinking<00:06:12.590> to<00:06:12.620> analyze<00:06:13.250> and<00:06:13.700> suggest<00:06:14.630> and<00:06:14.990> do

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
thinking to analyze and suggest and do

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.830 
thinking to analyze and suggest and do
build<00:06:18.350> up<00:06:18.560> a<00:06:18.800> conceptual<00:06:19.310> framework<00:06:19.370> and<00:06:19.970> then

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
build up a conceptual framework and then

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.500 
build up a conceptual framework and then
when<00:06:21.020> you<00:06:21.140> can't<00:06:21.410> reach<00:06:21.680> any<00:06:22.010> higher<00:06:22.340> you<00:06:23.330> can

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
when you can't reach any higher you can

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.230 
when you can't reach any higher you can
make<00:06:23.750> an<00:06:23.990> intuitive<00:06:24.590> jump<00:06:25.100> you<00:06:25.790> can<00:06:25.970> make<00:06:26.120> it

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
make an intuitive jump you can make it

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.720 
make an intuitive jump you can make it
guess<00:06:26.480> you<00:06:26.780> can<00:06:26.960> suggest<00:06:27.170> things<00:06:27.650> and<00:06:27.950> you<00:06:28.550> can

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
guess you can suggest things and you can

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.180 
guess you can suggest things and you can
test<00:06:29.000> them<00:06:29.180> but<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.260> higher<00:06:30.500> you've<00:06:30.830> built

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
test them but the higher you've built

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.590 
test them but the higher you've built
before<00:06:31.670> you<00:06:31.820> jump<00:06:32.150> the<00:06:32.390> higher<00:06:33.050> you<00:06:33.260> can<00:06:33.410> reach
