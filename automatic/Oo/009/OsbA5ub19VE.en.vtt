00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.159
 Is it a team trying to be mixed? 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:14.159
 It is an old man waiting for various things and coming out 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.299
 Start off 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.299
 It is useless in the prefecture but is honest 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.289
 It is bonito 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.880
 There is a certain thing that the previous self-government is selling with other games 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.419
 During that time I think it is very good 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.980
 Well with that metalgear 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.920
 Part that father and father fight 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.850
 Part of the action is probably more than three works 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.960
 I think 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.960
 I'm glad if you look around 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.470
 Apart from being a robot, it is said to grow with power again 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.570
 The 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.740
 Oman is an eternal theme in me 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.920
 In the train at the time of saying 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 I think about the snow in the lineage 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.460
 That's right 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.829
 In a good sense 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.870
 We are recruiting at the festival 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.390
 Around is also a kind 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.070
 I do asbestos 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.730
 That kind of 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.420
 Or 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.180
 Last popular 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.510
 It was outside 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.590
 That reinforced exoskeleton- 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.210
 Among players who are thinking of Tanaka with wisdom 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 I'm a doctor 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 I tried it by chance 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 I know it's an improvement plan and I'm sure 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.230
 Did you become Emoto? 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.820
 Last monitor check 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.990
 Ryo Tottori 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.170
 A girl at the time of Morita district that was at the time of sprint turn 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.930
 The same stuff 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.120
 It was written that it was in such a game 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.800
 Fukuoka 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.850
 Overnight in the mountains 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.760
 Even a cool boy 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.590
 It is the first time that it was the first time to add 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.590
 I think 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.359
 It is soaring and there is a headache 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.359
 That was a reality but 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.649
 In particular when designing characters 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.399
 That cool inside of me 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:25.320
 character 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.539
 Because 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.539
 Why only put it out 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.150
 After all maxing points and packing points in detail 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.219
 but 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.329
 Become the same ratio 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.619
 It can be expressed with polygons until the end 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.429
 It is possible that falsification can be expensive 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.309
 Fine ttl 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:52.609
 I have no choice 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.609
 The character stuff that made this is also 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.359
 I don't ask what's going on I'm getting up with a brush 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.799
 Confess that you are writing 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.979
 I cried because I said I do not know, Public after recording was different today 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.649
 With a pencil 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.989
 I had to have 2100 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.819
 I am not good at staying in the UK 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.509
 that is 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.759
 It's difficult to get closer 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.299
 To be honest with children 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.879
 I used to live above 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.999
 Um, affliction 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.209
 What is this? 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.689
 Create a place to create- 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.149
 Strengthened Exoskeleton Qatar war defeated 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.339
 But after that 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.339
 I'm honestly buying in Japan 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.659
 Oh big high 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.360
 What kind of thing 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.360
 I'm thinking about it 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:58.369
 It is the first time to write many pieces and many pieces 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:59.349
 Coming out 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.149
 There is also 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.589
 It is tough when a man comes out one time 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:10.250
 Among them, even in a country that has a number 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.169
 It is calculated further 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.430
 There are opponents and characters that appear for the first time 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.769
 Let's take this stroke when it's the number 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.620
 When color shifts during chat 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.770
 Bad fall 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.770
 There are also things to take when taking it in a good direction 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.580
 That's right I'm feeling good 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.009
 In a nutshell, there are things that are scary 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.009
 Just always high 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.129
 In this way while crying 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.240
 Each 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.020
 After all 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.160
 Well I think it depends on the person who plays 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.409
 but 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.550
 Of each person 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.180
 Do you think 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.029
 Is it heavy 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:05.859
 I think I will come out after playing well 

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:07.620
 Get it 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.620
 Yeah I'm leading you like I felt it 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:12.849
 I think I merged 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.029
 I think it would have been nice
