00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
here this is the sensor and then we need

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.720 
here this is the sensor and then we need
to<00:01:33.100> take<00:01:33.450> closer<00:01:34.450> view<00:01:34.870> that<00:01:35.470> they<00:01:35.710> can<00:01:35.920> see

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
to take closer view that they can see

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.460 
to take closer view that they can see
that<00:01:36.940> where<00:01:37.180> is<00:01:37.390> this<00:01:37.570> sensor<00:01:39.660> just<00:01:40.660> in<00:01:41.080> here

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
this these sensors is capable out and we

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.390 
this these sensors is capable out and we
need<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.330> place<00:02:01.600> that<00:02:01.930> sense<00:02:02.230> of<00:02:02.440> our<00:02:02.710> air<00:02:02.920> in

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
need to place that sense of our air in

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.020 
need to place that sense of our air in
lifetime<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.300> then<00:02:04.690> full<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.580> rotors<00:02:06.580> press

temperature<00:03:03.670> sensor<00:03:03.700> what<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:04.930> here<00:03:05.290> let's

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
temperature sensor what is in here let's

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.130 
temperature sensor what is in here let's
go<00:03:06.490> tune<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.330> next<00:03:09.060> okay<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.300> then<00:03:10.480> when<00:03:10.900> I

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
go tune that next okay and then when I

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.890 
go tune that next okay and then when I
am<00:03:11.290> planning<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.709> take<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.430> stance<00:03:13.120> or<00:03:13.330> out<00:03:13.600> I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
am planning to take that stance or out I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.970 
am planning to take that stance or out I
need<00:03:14.910> friends<00:03:15.910> both<00:03:16.450> sides<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:17.190> 19<00:03:18.190> 1<00:03:18.569> 9<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:19.980> if

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
need friends both sides is 19 1 9 and if

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.690 
need friends both sides is 19 1 9 and if
we<00:03:21.370> have<00:03:21.580> that<00:03:21.610> kind<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.360> friends<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:24.280> fits

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
we have that kind of friends it it fits

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.690 
we have that kind of friends it it fits
in<00:03:25.000> here<00:03:25.300> really<00:03:26.110> nicely<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.220> position

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
in here really nicely in that position

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.100 
in here really nicely in that position
and<00:03:28.450> then<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.020> only<00:03:29.520> take<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:31.630> kind<00:03:31.990> of

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
and then I only take that kind of

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.839 
and then I only take that kind of
position<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:34.000> terrorist<00:03:34.420> is<00:03:34.569> my<00:03:34.810> tool<00:03:35.260> and

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
position the terrorist is my tool and

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.510 
position the terrorist is my tool and
then<00:03:36.849> I<00:03:37.030> only<00:03:37.420> take<00:03:37.959> my<00:03:38.200> hand<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:39.190> here<00:03:39.459> and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
then I only take my hand in here and

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.760 
then I only take my hand in here and
this<00:03:40.300> sensor<00:03:41.290> opens<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:43.090> then<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.020> rotate<00:03:44.530> that

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
this sensor opens and then I rotate that

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:53.250 
this sensor opens and then I rotate that
in<00:03:45.010> here<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.630> there<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.890> sensor<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.959> it

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
in here and there is the sensor this it

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.309 
in here and there is the sensor this it
looks<00:03:53.620> like<00:03:53.890> that

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
looks like that

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.710 
looks like that
this<00:03:56.319> is<00:03:56.560> coolant<00:03:57.099> temperature<00:03:57.910> sensor<00:03:57.940> and

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
this is coolant temperature sensor and

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.809 
this is coolant temperature sensor and
this<00:03:59.440> works<00:04:00.069> so<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.959> when<00:04:02.819> coolant

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
this works so that that when coolant

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.910 
this works so that that when coolant
becomes<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:06.489> higher<00:04:07.260> then<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:08.470> sends

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
becomes this higher then it sends

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.420 
becomes this higher then it sends
different<00:04:09.930> electric<00:04:10.930> signal<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.590> then<00:04:11.800> when

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
different electric signal and then when

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.409 
different electric signal and then when
this<00:04:12.970> coolant<00:04:13.480> is<00:04:13.690> cool<00:04:14.380> it<00:04:14.860> sends<00:04:15.730> different

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
this coolant is cool it sends different

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.559 
this coolant is cool it sends different
resistant<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:17.259> here<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.829> then<00:04:18.549> when<00:04:19.090> we<00:04:19.329> need

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:19.569 
resistant in here and then when we need

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.980 
resistant in here and then when we need
if<00:04:19.810> we<00:04:20.169> need<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.590> new<00:04:20.799> one<00:04:21.039> I<00:04:21.479> recommend<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.810> with

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
if we need a new one I recommend to with

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.770 
if we need a new one I recommend to with
it<00:04:23.169> in

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.940 

in<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:29.060> Toyota<00:04:30.060> dealership<00:04:30.960> Center<00:04:31.410> and

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
in this Toyota dealership Center and

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.080 
in this Toyota dealership Center and
then<00:04:32.400> we<00:04:32.580> can<00:04:32.880> get<00:04:33.150> this<00:04:33.990> new<00:04:34.290> original

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
then we can get this new original

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:42.440 
then we can get this new original
quality<00:04:36.090> part<00:04:36.390> what<00:04:36.780> last<00:04:37.110> 20<00:04:38.010> years<00:04:38.220> plus<00:04:41.450> and

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
quality part what last 20 years plus and

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.830 
quality part what last 20 years plus and
everything's<00:04:43.290> ok<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:44.130> then<00:04:44.640> when<00:04:45.120> we<00:04:45.300> install

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
everything's ok and then when we install

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.810 
everything's ok and then when we install
this<00:04:46.020> sense<00:04:46.980> of<00:04:47.160> packet<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:48.060> goes<00:04:48.420> very<00:04:49.320> easily

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
this sense of packet it goes very easily

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.770 
this sense of packet it goes very easily
because<00:04:50.820> this<00:04:51.060> is<00:04:51.470> specific<00:04:52.470> metal<00:04:52.920> i<00:04:53.220> only

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
because this is specific metal i only

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.810 
because this is specific metal i only
rotate<00:04:54.780> that<00:04:55.110> in<00:04:55.380> that<00:04:55.860> way<00:04:56.660> then<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:57.840> take<00:04:58.260> my

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
rotate that in that way then I take my

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.700 
rotate that in that way then I take my
this<00:04:59.820> tool<00:05:01.190> what<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.400> in<00:05:02.580> here<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.360> if<00:05:04.320> we<00:05:04.530> have

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
this tool what is in here and if we have

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.370 
this tool what is in here and if we have
19<00:05:06.740> then<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:08.030> pass<00:05:09.030> meant<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:10.640> then<00:05:11.640> and

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
19 then I pass meant that and then and

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.140 
19 then I pass meant that and then and
when<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:14.610> length<00:05:15.090> is<00:05:15.360> okay<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:17.120> now<00:05:18.120> I

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
when that length is okay and now I

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.020 
when that length is okay and now I
believe<00:05:18.600> that<00:05:18.960> it's<00:05:19.140> okay<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.250> then<00:05:20.490> we

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
believe that it's okay and then we

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.930 
believe that it's okay and then we
connect<00:05:21.480> this<00:05:22.440> cable<00:05:25.280> institutions<00:05:26.280> cable

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
connect this cable institutions cable

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.820 
connect this cable institutions cable
back<00:05:28.100> and<00:05:29.100> then<00:05:29.430> we<00:05:29.910> start<00:05:30.360> our<00:05:30.600> car<00:05:31.200> engine

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
back and then we start our car engine

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.210 
back and then we start our car engine
and<00:05:31.980> we<00:05:32.910> check<00:05:33.420> that<00:05:33.450> there<00:05:34.350> is<00:05:34.500> no<00:05:34.710> any<00:05:34.920> leaks

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
and we check that there is no any leaks

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.270 
and we check that there is no any leaks
and<00:05:35.490> everything<00:05:36.420> should<00:05:36.720> be<00:05:36.780> ok<00:05:37.470> and<00:05:37.680> this

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
and everything should be ok and this

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.350 
and everything should be ok and this
faulty<00:05:39.030> called<00:05:39.360> 22<00:05:40.260> suit<00:05:40.740> also<00:05:41.360> disappear
