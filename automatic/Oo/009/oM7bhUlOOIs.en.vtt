00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.740
 Peter Wadhams one of the most expert 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.440
 important in ice predicted in a text 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.450
 sent to the guardian newspaper that the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 ice that covers the arctic goes to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.100
 disappear completely in the summer 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.100
 of the year 2016 just around the corner 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 another thin acute warning voice of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.099
 Institute of geophysics of the university 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.529
 National Autonomous Government of Mexico stated that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.230
 in the last 30 years it has disappeared 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.300
 the arctic ice cap in the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.730
 equivalent to 4 times the state of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.589
 chihuaua what is little less than the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.589
 half of the Mexican territory 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.460
 an animation shows the merger of 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.360
 arctic sea ice from 1 of 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.809
 July to August 24 , 2011 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.579
 every year the arctic ocean 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.110
 experience the formation and fusion of 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.110
 large amounts of floating ice 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.110
 but the pace of loss has accelerated 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.930
 methane gas reserves whose escape to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.510
 the atmosphere can accelerate the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.610
 global warming is so good 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.220
 located in the Arctic by scientists 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.740
 Russians and Americans are more than 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.590
 predicted the reserves found 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.410
 they will remain in solid state always 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 that arctic ice remains in the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.090
 same solid state in case 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.540
 think melting the same thing will happen with 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.540
 the metal 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:02:03.030
 and that's what it is 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.210
 in addition a huge mass of water kubis in 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.220
 the arctic ocean is the object of study 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.300
 by several scientists since this 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.860
 could penetrate the Atlantic 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.530
 affecting the ocean currents that 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.430
 generate the climate in the region of 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.430
 Western Europe 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.510
 so far the situation at sea from 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.270
 the last 12 years has been contained in 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.950
 the Arctic area thanks to which the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.590
 wind circulates in the direction 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.690
 hands of the clock but to enter 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.989
 the Atlantic ocean the ecosystem 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.140
 will be affected by warning an era of 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.180
 ice similar to the catastrophe described 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.180
 in the movie the day after tomorrow 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.500
 the risk is latent so much that 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.319
 can appear in a decade 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.959
 or two however they are expected to be from 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.390
 Gradually most models 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.670
 climatic forecasts for the end of this 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.299
 century a weakening of 20 by 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.450
 One hundred the key to climate and life 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.450
 Marine 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.280
 for the second time the ice cover 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.469
 arctic ocean marine is catching up 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.769
 to minimum levels according to disseminated data 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:22.019
 by the European space agency so 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.870
 that the passage opens from navigation 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.269
 from the northeast that adds to the route of the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.340
 North Sea situation that indicates that 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.379
 the speed at which the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.750
 thaw has accelerated and advances 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.750
 historical levels according to experts
