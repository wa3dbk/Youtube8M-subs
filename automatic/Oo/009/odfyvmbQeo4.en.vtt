I'm<00:01:37.119> going<00:01:37.300> to<00:01:37.420> do<00:01:38.429> is<00:01:39.429> just<00:01:39.489> a<00:01:39.970> switch<00:01:40.300> the

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
I'm going to do is just a switch the

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.460 
I'm going to do is just a switch the
camera<00:01:40.660> off<00:01:40.869> quickly<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.560> then<00:01:42.429> I'll<00:01:42.580> be<00:01:42.759> back

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:01.880 
right then so how could I possibly make
that<00:01:53.939> rig<00:01:54.240> any<00:01:54.479> better<00:01:54.780> I<00:02:00.560> don't<00:02:01.560> think<00:02:01.770> that's

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that rig any better I don't think that's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.309 
that rig any better I don't think that's
too<00:02:02.159> bad<00:02:02.369> away<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.479> yes<00:02:03.750> we're<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.229> to
