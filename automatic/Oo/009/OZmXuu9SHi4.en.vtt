00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.900
 economic we already have all the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.779
 prepared ingredients 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.869
 As you can see, the squash is cut 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.930
 big cubes we have the potatoes 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.100
 also in the size of the corn 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.860
 to see if you are 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.270
 finely chopped onion 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.800
 oil a milk jar 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.680
 we have the fresh cheese 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 the garlic 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.120
 pepper and salt 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.910
 the onion like 20 highlights has to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.500
 only software is left and it is not 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.500
 it needs to brown a lot 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.580
 we add 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.079
 the sacks 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.950
 we wait for this dressing to be ready 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.950
 to continue with our recipe 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.740
 we cooked our onions 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.530
 we take the potatoes 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.060
 as well 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.070
 let's also try to sautÃ© more potatoes 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.080
 and incorporate it with the onion 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.990
 of dish do not forget that it takes very 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.600
 little water although we are going to use almost 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.920
 a jar of milk should leave us 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.920
 pretty creamy 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.159
 you have to keep in mind that the pumpkin 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.950
 loose much liquid during cooking by 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.830
 this is that we should take as you see 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.270
 you the bottom of the pot there is almost no 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.130
 liquid and we will let you cook 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.990
 very slow fire 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.410
 we cover the pot 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.480
 we lower the fire and leave until the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.480
 pumpkin undo a little 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.220
 I have reached this cooking point 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.520
 we take the salt 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.920
 until you like them 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.440
 people who eat very little salt and others 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.020
 if they like the habit well 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.410
 we stir 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.630
 in the case that they lack liquid 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.100
 they may be adding a little 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.819
 while the cooking lasts we already have the 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.709
 squash and cooked potatoes 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.709
 As you can see, the liquid remains 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.500
 the pumpkin as I told you told 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.340
 pretty liquid we proceed to cast the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.340
 corn 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.000
 and blood dating 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.650
 we started again 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.959
 the covered pot 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.549
 and we wait a few more minutes for the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.549
 blow of spain bees 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.400
 we incorporate the fresh cheese 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.470
 and we go back to 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:59.210
 take a little more milk 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.210
 we raise the fire a little 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.190
 as well our achievement has been 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.190
 pretty creamy 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.880
 for solar maybe we put a little 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.590
 of pepper finally 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.590
 we throw the leaves of huacatay 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.110
 to give him the pleasure 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.379
 they have to be the whole leaves with 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.580
 these sheets is enough and we already have 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.580
 the finished dish 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.420

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.890
