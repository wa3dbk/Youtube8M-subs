00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.670
 Hello my dear viewers with you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.250
 sweet is my third edition of the rubric 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.800
 Procast in this issue I would like to 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.470
 tell a little about prokasy invoker 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.350
 that is, about 2 about kasa such major 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.880
 being used which are used and so 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.640
 let's go over the invoker by skill 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.779
 of the three realms you have in exo exort in 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.650
 whichever is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.929
 to position the sphere 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.230
 such such will be his and magic at 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.629
 click on the invok button and so on 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:43.890
 have a son who has 1000 2000 hp 2200 x p 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.809
 so for pro shitty for to endure 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.890
 a lot of damage, let them first for 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.920
 forge before but mostly we need something 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.670
 have sanstrayk have tune up chaos 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.489
 meteor 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:05.129
 and defining layer but you will see it later 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.470
 and so here we have a goal that what exactly 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.510
 we will run under him led on 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.030
 raise and sanstrayk sphere throw it 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.000
 chaos meteor and breathing providers him and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.000
 so you watch 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 raise 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.560
 so stop that we do not beat from he will die nose 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.770
 and so 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.479
 the guy has 200 left about it not to kill 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.479
 the guy has 200 hp left 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 1900's band is nice ass 2 that is almost 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.909
 2 thousand hp with ours 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.220
 for jami if they continued 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.640
 kill and there wasnâ€™t any would have killed 2000 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.640
 hp 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.829
 demolished him literally 2 and 2 and a half 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.460
 two and a half seconds here 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.310
 imagine 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.679
 lies such a ruin black hero you 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.970
 understand it in Yulka give him a 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.920
 he himself strikes give the blast bits of these 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.619
 once a meteor is a subclass there he is nothing 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.569
 It can do no hack would not yet 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.729
 make blink dagger something else and you 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.380
 just sharpen it 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.510
 I think very cool if he starts 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.880
 we can just run away just kent 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.900
 he has a cold snap and he will die with us about you 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.170
 this is one of the patents 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.060
 let's consider the second option on 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.980
 the area is on several heroes and so 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.840
 our second procast he to prisoner tons 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.299
 but to catch several 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.780
 heroes for this we have tornado chaos 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.760
 meteor 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.760
 and will blast on too 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.129
 I will tell a little secret to 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.500
 monino rushed more damage needs to be given 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.520
 blast 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.520
 standing in the same place 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.280
 where are we going to chaos because of you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.580
 what if bablos kitty is a little bit to the side 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.040
 it's enemies to try to the side and chaos 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.690
 meteor can not get there he is 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.440
 deals a lot of damage then when he 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.440
 him still rolling 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.590
 for speed I will not do them well 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.210
 exactly kill our enemies so the reason 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.210
 running down the Jedi tornado 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.180
 reservoir and so 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.239
 we have a ride for yourself see yes because 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.300
 how was that 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.500
 500 hp left to this which is not 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.480
 swept chaos meteor 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:39.200
 800 kb left i mean damage damage 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.069
 so will it be so 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.110
 sign but in principle, as is clear 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:50.209
 that in another case from this while 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.769
 1702 flies but when the show all 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.510
 sentir I think you will not stand either 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.730
 on the spot and then start hitting enemies and 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.810
 they will surely die because you can do 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.950
 blink dagger to the enemies 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.950
 so that 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.130
 enemies and the Duma will not be because of this 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.810
 happy well something like that basically still 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.170
 I tried a lot of different processes that is 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.480
 i used mn but the game ft this 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.400
 not very effective why because 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.170
 more effectively throw chaos meteor 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.770
 because it carries much more 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.910
 damage than im p-understand them in this expired 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:37.660
 400 mana but these 400 million and iso 400 for 400 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:40.210
 In general, any 400 manna job need 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.240
 his fully swing so that most 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.360
 the best option is that we have what 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.900
 we will have strife himself 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.810
 uranium will be with strikes why because 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.290
 that sanstrayk we have pure damage damage 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.210
 no longer dependent on armor 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.650
 contender same night forge before and 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.240
 which will interfere with armor 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.720
 ravine and we nakida and mom completely 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.650
 also certainly not very profit needed 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:15.599
 use force the world is fond of our 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:18.900
 the world surfers the enemy she push the jet 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:24.210
 from falling into the enemy 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:26.910
 every second we will have but it is 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.460
 yes we can use it then 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.280
 when we have for example 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.390
 anything to the end and not 1 head 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:39.060
 to just nastrelivat enemies with hands 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:42.240
 Well, probably somehow all 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.490
 right thing in the correctness of the movie I 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.560
 skills you achieve what you have 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:51.600
 maximum damage from invoker skills 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.820
 that's all hope you liked it 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.290
 the video probably also liked it 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.990
 put put your thumbs up 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.650
 subscribe to my channel if not yet 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.870
 have subscribed 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.070
 try to comment which hero are you 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.800
 want to see more 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.200
 how to make out that is to make it 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.700
 prank if you need to make a guide on 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:14.510
 Someone to the hero 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.510
 Thank you for watching
