00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.029
 beautiful good day youtube russia 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.960
 I warmly welcome you to the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.059
 new consequences and at the same time too 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.519
 another consequence of bodybuilding 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.029
 Supermarket 6 will definitely stay tuned 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.010
 is just as we are today 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.020
 times to the rossmann out my similar 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.720
 he would not want that drugstore 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.099
 typical supermarket but I think that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.310
 last years greatly increased at 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.689
 topic food supplements and also 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.090
 things force the dried fruits something 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.530
 nothing else and that is right 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.969
 of course good if you know what there to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.100
 buy there just look sometimes 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:51.629
 Alone look what the technology is like that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:53.610
 far delve rossmann the one out yes 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.190
 Of course, no 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.510
 Maybe somebody supermarket now 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 is also similar to the empa 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.750
 sometimes maybe nothing else 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.910
 the door or you only have a short break one 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.850
 school or a job or in college 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.430
 and then yes, in the end it always has to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.890
 quickly find 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.200
 therefore look at her I see need 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.110
 something limited me today 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.799
 my range of motion you the camera 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.920
 completely empty Bavarian hardworking 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.740
 Do not hesitate to turn left and see her 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 fits closer to the right , for example 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.540
 should cook the directions 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.909
 or breakfast and back 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.430
 a few more juices and something for me 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.290
 in between a lot of money maybe there 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.610
 it very good students photo effects that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.540
 just nuts and raisins and would have to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 I also believe that there is 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.450
 several that for example then shines 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.320
 to be his house brand 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.149
 First, for example, no sugar 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.439
 additions or the like in others 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.909
 These are a few 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.460
 sugar additives therefore fits where he 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.780
 otherwise you have to access 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.710
 of course, very good very good 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.750
 selection of dry fruits here for 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.220
 Examples follow as well as Zapf ships 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.930
 or there are mango stripes 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.910
 or here, for example, the cocoons 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.530
 Chips then not in addition 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.930
 sweetened I think personally very 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.370
 cool 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.930
 Here , too , she sees the cheeky friends 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.360
 is probably more in the way 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.210
 direction children but in children's products 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.460
 is often so really cool you are too 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.740
 already noticed that just relative 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.120
 Often no sugar is set 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.610
 yes, here are also apple and 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.830
 blueberries just dried in that way 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.530
 a pretty pretty cool and a little bag 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.290
 otherwise why here this tree in the morning 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.020
 in between is just 100% 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.670
 raisins and apricots so if you are 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.709
 just the victorious others 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.980
 Any of those sugared 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.209
 Sweets are just such a few 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.980
 dry fruits in between 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.250
 pretty personal for me personally 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.260
 cool otherwise the cologne can melt 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.450
 I guess we also 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.620
 pretty good rating 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.340
 So, who's that morning maybe? 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.310
 Needed as a substitute for the had 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.280
 100% wholegrain I find pretty 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.530
 Pretty cool 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.800
 otherwise flaxseed, for example, can 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.940
 you just look at Rhenish soul 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.120
 here, for example, on the fresh cheese 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.870
 make good fiber know each 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.430
 quite cool pretty big 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.110
 title selection so really total 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.320
 counter intuitive with left to as drug 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.700
 lets the pressure in the market also leads you 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.290
 no big food even there 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.420
 you're gonna get even normal functioning of 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.310
 gets 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.110
 I would like to have the tomatoes 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.290
 Personally nothing special noticed 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.320
 So often said something or something in it 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.340
 That's why I did not hit there 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.290
 otherwise what I find nice 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.700
 to the multi vitamins tablets I buy 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.250
 now less because of the vitamins 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.810
 but simply because it's easy 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.000
 for example, has a creamy and 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.200
 water bottle with you then you can 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.430
 just throw in a tablet and 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.769
 that's the thing that's eaten 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.090
 otherwise very cool spelled drink 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.040
 just as there are oats in which 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.320
 drinks for example if someone 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.840
 maybe I need replacement product 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.670
 or maybe it is 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.980
 What must be low in calories for recipes 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.450
 for example, as a milk substitute something on 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.280
 every case very well suited 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.910
 otherwise the last products 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.610
 Everything from the baby field seeds her 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.590
 Baby dream you have very different 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.380
 fruit juices gets relatively cheap 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.630
 and all without added sugar that's for 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.260
 me always the most important 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.080
 otherwise there is also the good 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.060
 baby qua law here for itself maracuja 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.770
 There are also very different varieties 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.570
 So make the stack in between 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.100
 of course it always needs better if you 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.680
 For example, the fresh fruit attacks 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.210
 but fresh fruit takes otherwise 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.970
 I think I can be there in between 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.370
 Definitely cool though 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.810
 Maybe now you have the opportunity 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.790
 i know, for example, rossmann here 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.250
 or then doner bude you can 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.720
 Definitely find something cool 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.340
 and yes, just the alternatives 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.020
 maybe expand a bit 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.460
 That helps one with the lifestyle 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.020
 Every case and exactly I hope so 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.860
 little insight got what is so 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.539
 what my grave 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.600
