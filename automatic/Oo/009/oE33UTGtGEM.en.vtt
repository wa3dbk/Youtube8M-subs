more ambitious and this was slightly
more<00:01:09.700> interesting<00:01:10.140> than<00:01:11.140> other<00:01:12.009> things<00:01:12.369> we

why<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.320> know<00:01:23.770> especially<00:01:23.950> this<00:01:24.670> game<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:25.300> so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
why you know especially this game is so

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.109 
why you know especially this game is so
interesting<00:01:26.740> because<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:28.000> know

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
interesting because it is you know

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.450 
interesting because it is you know
people<00:01:28.420> ask<00:01:28.660> is<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.110> a<00:01:29.259> film<00:01:29.710> or<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.160> again

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
people ask is it a film or is it again

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.180 
people ask is it a film or is it again
and<00:01:30.700> there<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.240> no<00:01:31.390> difference<00:01:31.840> not<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.649> me<00:01:32.800> you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
and there is no difference not to me you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.130 
and there is no difference not to me you
could<00:01:33.340> sit<00:01:33.610> there<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:33.940> watch<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.209> as<00:01:34.569> a<00:01:34.780> film

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
could sit there and watch it as a film

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.130 
could sit there and watch it as a film
so<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.429> way<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.940> trying<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.360> musically<00:01:37.929> tell<00:01:38.110> a

want<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.740> kill<00:04:34.980> them<00:04:35.220> with<00:04:35.580> with<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.300> theme

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
want to kill them with with this theme

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.710 
want to kill them with with this theme
that<00:04:37.800> keeps<00:04:38.100> appearing<00:04:38.490> all<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:38.970> time<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.510> I

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
that keeps appearing all the time so I

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.230 
that keeps appearing all the time so I
think<00:04:39.990> what<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.650> challenge<00:04:41.070> with<00:04:41.220> this<00:04:41.400> game

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
think what the challenge with this game

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.800 
think what the challenge with this game
was<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.660> try<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:42.900> figure<00:04:43.260> out<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.470> way<00:04:43.800> of

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
was to try to figure out a way of

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.960 
was to try to figure out a way of
musically<00:04:45.810> telling<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.500> story<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.610> having

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
musically telling a story and the having

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.790 
musically telling a story and the having
development<00:04:48.570> of<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.780> characters<00:04:49.260> but<00:04:49.500> not

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
development of the characters but not

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.040 
development of the characters but not
necessarily<00:04:50.750> become<00:04:51.890> make<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:53.040> be<00:04:53.280> repetitive

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
necessarily become make it be repetitive

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.300 
necessarily become make it be repetitive
you<00:04:55.050> know<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.410> thing<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.740> is<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:55.950> unlike<00:04:56.280> a

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
you know the thing is is that unlike a

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.050 
you know the thing is is that unlike a
film<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:57.390> only<00:04:57.750> time<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.320> actually<00:04:59.060> fully

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
film the only time you actually fully

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.330 
film the only time you actually fully
understand<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:01.020> think<00:05:01.350> with<00:05:01.500> music<00:05:01.890> what<00:05:02.070> we've

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
understand I think with music what we've

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.330 
understand I think with music what we've
managed<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:02.790> actually<00:05:02.940> do<00:05:03.390> is<00:05:03.630> when<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:05.130> have

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
managed to actually do is when you have

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.730 
managed to actually do is when you have
the<00:05:05.520> time<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.940> sit<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.180> play<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.510> game

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
the time to sit and play the game

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.480 
the time to sit and play the game
because<00:05:07.740> we<00:05:07.980> don't<00:05:08.190> fully<00:05:09.350> understand<00:05:10.490> how

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
because we don't fully understand how

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.060 
because we don't fully understand how
much<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:12.150> know<00:05:12.270> how<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.900> really<00:05:13.650> will<00:05:13.830> work

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
much you know how it really will work

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.500 
much you know how it really will work
out<00:05:14.340> especially<00:05:14.669> with<00:05:14.910> this<00:05:15.060> gate<00:05:15.330> because

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
out especially with this gate because

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.790 
out especially with this gate because
you're<00:05:15.780> choosing<00:05:16.140> different<00:05:16.229> decisions

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
you're choosing different decisions

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.190 
you're choosing different decisions
constantly<00:05:17.760> unlike<00:05:18.690> some<00:05:18.990> of<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.110> other

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
constantly unlike some of the other

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.080 
constantly unlike some of the other
games<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:19.710> we've<00:05:19.950> worked<00:05:19.979> on<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:20.850> have<00:05:21.060> a

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
games that we've worked on you have a

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.420 
games that we've worked on you have a
very<00:05:21.510> clear<00:05:21.750> vision<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:22.380> what<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.800> end<00:05:22.950> story

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
very clear vision of what the end story

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.090 
very clear vision of what the end story
is<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:24.270> with<00:05:24.390> this<00:05:24.570> it's<00:05:25.290> just<00:05:25.620> so<00:05:25.770> exciting

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
is and with this it's just so exciting

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.090 
is and with this it's just so exciting
because<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.520> story<00:05:26.760> changes<00:05:27.050> so<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.740> music

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
because the story changes so the music

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.480 
because the story changes so the music
experience<00:05:29.700> changes<00:05:30.390> so<00:05:30.600> if<00:05:31.500> hands<00:05:31.830> plays<00:05:32.190> it

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490
