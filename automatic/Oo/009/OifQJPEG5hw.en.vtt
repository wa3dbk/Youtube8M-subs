00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.310
 Draft here is my review of geely emgrand for 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.760
 group emgrand Russia and start with the fact that 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.099
 I redid redid the grille 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:15.630
 set in the mesh and cut the side 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.300
 strip redid the saber painted black 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.880
 color made headlights 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.449
 this give birth or discharge black color 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.760
 set angel eyes and set 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.640
 dim hen he is on the far 3 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.480
 initially there was also a movie but then from 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.719
 he refused 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 this is impossible to blink ahead of the spirit 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.230
 Moscow is not in the set dimensions 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.950
 LED front fog so and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.950
 xenon installed 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.149
 daytime running LEDs installed 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.230
 rock replaced 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.760
 the frame number made cilia on the lights 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.050
 so on disks repainted wheels 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.629
 I think it looks nicer 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.810
 repainted caliper 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:11.030
 the red color further set the chrome to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.150
 doors under business class looks much 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.490
 representatives 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.970
 Well, the car immediately went up for me 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.799
 back hut 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.740
 respectively where repainted also 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.689
 repainted support 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.850
 further toned rear lights 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:33.060
 I like it but I can give advice not 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.930
 do it yourself better consult salon 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.220
 you will be made much cheaper and 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.430
 better quality is what they say dimensions 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.899
 have everything shine all right 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.899
 I have no problems with this 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:59.040
 further that did not glue the inscription grant 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.840
 on the back of the sword looks like it seems to me 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.100
 it is better 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:08.610
 same colored disk colored support 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.350
 made lining installed front 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.060
 accordingly further probably noticed 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.600
 mounted fin fin is not a model 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.820
 actually acting antenna i 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:28.110
 set when did Shumkov in the cabin 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:31.440
 did as stretched the cable under the upholstery 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.100
 the roofs through this small stand 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.360
 removed as 10 cap we have 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.140
 open it then we have a bolt 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.720
 unscrew and pull over there 3 or 4 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:53.790
 latches they are easily removed spent 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:55.500
 rack on the floor and started in a torpedo started in 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.930
 torpedo but also connected respectively to 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.610
 radio tape recorder 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.370
 further what else is done here installed 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.150
 video recorder rearview mirror 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:13.940
 here probably not seen how she removes but 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.640
 Generally this is a video recorder cable 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.269
 Feeder spent behind the upholstery small stands 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.000
 and through the torpedo once I put it on this one 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.650
 sockets 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.380
 directly inside the torpedo further 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.600
 set 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:37.430
 highlight legs here in front and 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.430
 respectively behind 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.040
 then the second is very beautiful 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.930
 button is my jet washer 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.970
 headlights well here are the nozzles that we saw well 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.989
 and actually probably all the cabin and 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.340
 still stuck 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:04.090
 behind the column did not touch the shelf left 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.439
 as it was in its original form not 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:13.500
 wanted to redo it but let's go further 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:17.789
 in the trunk that remake the trunk 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.739
 I installed in the trunk 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.780
 led strip is now day 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:28.050
 accordingly, a little is seen badly 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:31.710
 glows here but also visible 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.320
 columns so they had to cut a little bit 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.150
 body because regular speakers are 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.310
 just say so dwarfs in their place 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:48.310
 stick something bigger just 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:55.180
 unreal photo shows bag our bag 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:58.630
 by the way it came out very cool on 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:04.389
 the car has become much quieter in the front 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.789
 I have installed the door when the door is not 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.760
 established 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:12.720
 logos and in front right 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.720
 accordingly also 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:25.090
 so here is the hood under the hood we have in 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.090
 Basically nothing was altered 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:44.860
 repainted the only cover 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:53.530
 headlight washer engine on them puppy 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:57.340
 quails like that 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:00.500
 fuses start new for 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:04.150
 LED lights bottoms and are brought 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.380
 to the most slender headlights 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:15.699
 LED backlight bottom probably 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:19.729
 now we do not see but the light is brighter 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:22.030
 Accordingly, the bottom lights a lot 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:29.630
 regime 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:35.630
 here are 8 colors and an additional 4 modes 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:40.700
 glow completely made noise isolation and 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:45.950
 he made the anticorrosive himself he made the bottom 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:50.060
 anti-gravity still additionally does it 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:56.500
 no clone in the cabin for this you give very 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:56.500
 a lot of money here 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:10.390
 Well, the whole machine suits the engine 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.710
 pretty frisky run well 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.920
 checked the maximum speed 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:19.790
 I drove around the ring 208 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:28.550
 accelerated in principle think kilometers 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:30.850
 5-6 still could but unfortunately did not give the car 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.850
 beautiful
