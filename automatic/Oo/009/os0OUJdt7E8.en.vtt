00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.390
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.850
 what are you doing, I hope you are 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.280
 all very welcome once again 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.440
 to science channel mystery technology 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.629
 and forgive for not uploading videos 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.230
 before we have the computer 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.490
 laptop that we are going very very very badly and 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.280
 how are we out we can not 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.710
 use the desktop obviously but 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.540
 I am going to tell you a story about 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.150
 science and that is that the astronomers of the 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.640
 NASA have found a system of planets 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.040
 of 11,200 million years of 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.660
 seniority an age that exceeds that of 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.040
 our solar system in more than two 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.320
 times and it turns out that they have seen a series 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.270
 of planets the size of the earth that 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.130
 it would change our understanding of age 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.900
 of the galaxy because the system has 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.510
 found in the Milky Way by the 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.010
 kepler telescope receives the name of 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.140
 koi bar 3.158 and is composed of 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.149
 five very similar planets for their 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.670
 size ours is at a 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.850
 distance of about 117 light years from the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.739
 land 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.780
 scientists have assumed that the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.330
 star system as they have more than 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.549
 11.2 billion years while 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.070
 our solar system does not reach 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.490
 five billion what makes 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.259
 the oldest and is also referred to by 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.259
 supposed star-size systems 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.049
 of the earth the five rocky planets 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.229
 orbit in your star in less than ten 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:31.390
 days and that's why astronomers suppose 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.970
 that the planetary climate would be very warm 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.560
 and it is very unlikely that by the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.700
 moment life forms can be given 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.649
 traditional researchers also 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.929
 they are continuing studies to 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.210
 to be able to recreate ancient life in 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.819
 planets in case it had existed 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.810
 in the past this is super interesting 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:57.550
 the truth I really flip 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.550
 you have in the image more 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.920
 in the source of the description in the 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.410
 photo or photo you see on the screen 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.400
 the planets that have found so 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.140
 nothing, guys, I hope that I have 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.090
 interested this news a little kiss all 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.650
 and see you in another video more of this 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.830
 channel until next time 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.830
 bye
