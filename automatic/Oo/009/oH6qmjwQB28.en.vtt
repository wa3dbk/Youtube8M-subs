in the past we have you know welded or

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.939 
in the past we have you know welded or
structural<00:00:23.550> parts<00:00:23.880> together<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.800> you<00:00:25.800> know

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
structural parts together and you know

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.040 
structural parts together and you know
heat<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.730> becoming<00:00:27.150> more<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> more<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> an

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
heat is becoming more of a more of an

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.720 
heat is becoming more of a more of an
issue<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.609> know<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
issue with all of the you know the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.250 
issue with all of the you know the
Steel's<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.449> we're<00:00:30.570> using<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> different

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
Steel's that we're using the different

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
Steel's that we're using the different
types<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.590> Steel's<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.579> SEMA<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.090> year

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
types of Steel's and at SEMA this year

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.510 
types of Steel's and at SEMA this year
really<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.290> big<00:00:34.500> thing<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.860> heard<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> lot<00:00:35.489> about

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
really the big thing I heard a lot about

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
really the big thing I heard a lot about
was<00:00:35.969> aluminum<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.260> think<00:00:37.320> there's

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
was aluminum you know I think there's

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.740 
was aluminum you know I think there's
gonna<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> lot<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.160> aluminum<00:00:38.910> used<00:00:39.420> on

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
gonna be a lot more aluminum used on

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.590 
gonna be a lot more aluminum used on
cars<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.530> lightweight<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.670> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
cars for the lightweight and and so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.270 
cars for the lightweight and and so
that's<00:00:42.780> gonna<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.500> bring<00:00:43.710> some<00:00:43.739> new

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that's gonna you know bring some new

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.190 
that's gonna you know bring some new
issues<00:00:44.820> well<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.239> new<00:00:45.480> lumen<00:00:45.840> wasn't<00:00:46.079> out

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
issues well not new lumen wasn't out

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.580 
issues well not new lumen wasn't out
there<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> don't<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:47.489> me<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.320> lot<00:00:49.469> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
there but you don't like me and a lot of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.290 
there but you don't like me and a lot of
repairs<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> lot<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
repairs out there you know a lot of this

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.580 
repairs out there you know a lot of this
stuff<00:00:51.449> never<00:00:51.690> did<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:52.020> affect<00:00:52.410> him

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
stuff never did really affect him

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.799 
stuff never did really affect him
because<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.270> work<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.600> high-end

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
because we don't really work on high-end

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.560 
because we don't really work on high-end
cars<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.620> these<00:00:55.789> high<00:00:56.789> technology

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
cars a lot of these high technology

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
cars a lot of these high technology
wasn't<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> average<00:00:58.350> car<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:58.890> not

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
wasn't on the average car but that's not

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.540 
wasn't on the average car but that's not
true<00:00:59.309> anymore<00:00:59.840> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
true anymore you know just like the

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.979 
true anymore you know just like the
f-150<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.879> pickups<00:01:03.239> new<00:01:03.420> pickups<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:03.899> gonna

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
f-150 for pickups new pickups are gonna

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.140 
f-150 for pickups new pickups are gonna
be<00:01:04.199> all<00:01:04.500> aluminum<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.489> mean<00:01:05.909> you're<00:01:06.060> gonna

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
be all aluminum so I mean you're gonna

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
be all aluminum so I mean you're gonna
have<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.479> deal<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.960> even<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.650> don't

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
have to deal with this even if you don't

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
have to deal with this even if you don't
deal<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.000> high-end<00:01:09.420> cars<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.020> that's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
deal with the high-end cars and that's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.410 
deal with the high-end cars and that's
what<00:01:10.320> makes<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.100> different<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:12.119> anyway

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
what makes this different but anyway

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.670 
what makes this different but anyway
when<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.689> stalking<00:01:13.020> about<00:01:13.110> repairing<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
when they stalking about repairing this

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.490 
when they stalking about repairing this
aluminum<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.310> some<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.520> these<00:01:15.500> repair

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
aluminum and some of these repair

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
aluminum and some of these repair
methods<00:01:16.890> they<00:01:17.040> was<00:01:17.189> talking<00:01:17.549> about<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.180> know

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
methods they was talking about you know

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
methods they was talking about you know
they<00:01:18.450> don't<00:01:18.570> want<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:18.990> any<00:01:19.320> straightening

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
they don't want to do any straightening

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.420 
they don't want to do any straightening
or<00:01:21.080> welding<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> probably<00:01:23.040> don't<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.400> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
or welding so you probably don't see a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
or welding so you probably don't see a
lot<00:01:23.670> less<00:01:23.939> welding<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:24.900> moving<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
lot less welding as we get moving you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
lot less welding as we get moving you
know<00:01:25.560> forward<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:27.270> they're<00:01:27.420> good<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
know forward what they're good what the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
know forward what they're good what the
recommended<00:01:28.380> procedures<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.460> these

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
recommended procedures are for these

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.929 
recommended procedures are for these
structural<00:01:30.750> parts<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.829> high-grade<00:01:32.430> rivet

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
structural parts is a high-grade rivet

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.510 
structural parts is a high-grade rivet
and<00:01:33.299> adhesive<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:34.860> gonna<00:01:34.950> rivet<00:01:35.369> these

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and adhesive so you're gonna rivet these

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100 
and adhesive so you're gonna rivet these
parts<00:01:35.850> together<00:01:36.030> probably<00:01:36.689> put<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.869> backing

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
parts together probably put a backing

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.310 
parts together probably put a backing
plate<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:37.979> behind<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.670> use<00:01:39.479> adhesive<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
plate you know behind it use adhesive to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.710 
plate you know behind it use adhesive to
put<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.560> together<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.700> put<00:01:41.970> high-grade

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
put it together and then put high-grade

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.100 
put it together and then put high-grade
rivets<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.610> know<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.210> that's<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.049> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
rivets and you know and that's going to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.719 
rivets and you know and that's going to
be<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> new<00:01:46.380> technology<00:01:47.040> rather<00:01:47.220> than<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
be the new technology rather than the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.130 
be the new technology rather than the
traditional<00:01:48.030> ways<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.540> welding<00:01:48.990> because

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
traditional ways of welding because

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.249 
traditional ways of welding because
welding<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.310> know<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:51.119> aluminum<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.140> lot

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
welding you know the aluminum and a lot

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.690 
welding you know the aluminum and a lot
of<00:01:52.320> these<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.890> high<00:01:53.189> strength<00:01:53.579> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
of these you know high strength and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.940 
of these you know high strength and
boron<00:01:53.909> skills<00:01:54.270> are<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.509> each<00:01:54.720> sensitive<00:01:55.290> so

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
boron skills are so each sensitive so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.039 
boron skills are so each sensitive so
we're<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.549> more<00:01:56.759> rivet<00:01:57.420> bonding

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
we're going to see more rivet bonding

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.609 
we're going to see more rivet bonding
type<00:01:58.439> applications<00:01:59.340> in<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> future<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.990> less

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
type applications in the future and less

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.370 
type applications in the future and less
welding<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.369> anyway<00:02:03.180> let<00:02:03.899> me<00:02:03.990> know<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
welding so anyway let me know what you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.370 
welding so anyway let me know what you
think<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.829> that

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
think about that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.240 
think about that
and<00:02:05.470> how<00:02:06.460> this<00:02:06.610> affects<00:02:06.790> your<00:02:07.120> business<00:02:07.330> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and how this affects your business and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.139 
and how this affects your business and
