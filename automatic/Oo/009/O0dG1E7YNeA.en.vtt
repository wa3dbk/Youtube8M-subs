00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.970
 and as such I hope they are very, very 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.010
 very report jorge and be all 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.950
 welcome to 1 video this time 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.260
 I bring you the review or review of this 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.060
 great picture very well I will do the review 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.190
 of the xbox band version because it's the 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.420
 version that I have although I'm also going to 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.060
 talk a little about what version 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.309
 of the computer and the xbox 360 version 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.739
 it has not been given very much information 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.110
 good the game to give more 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.230
 information about it went on sale 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.090
 7 days ago exactly March 11 and 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.430
 that's why I waited seven more days to do 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.170
 the review as you know I form 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.780
 part of the game from the private alpha 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.270
 until the public beta and I saw how it has 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 advanced the game since its inception more 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.700
 or less for people or the public and 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.800
 until what's already its final output so 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.219
 I have seen how it is changing little by little 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.600
 very well now the game what is this 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.600
 something that many complained about the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.580
 campaign and it's true because what happens 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.650
 is that the campaign I would compare it with 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.680
 what is spartan leave it 4 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.630
 a little worse I really the campaign of 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.480
 tachan fold game sails something 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.480
 mediocre the truth I feel that they could 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.430
 have done much much more since the 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.070
 truth the plot talking about that the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.170
 story is very good the truth I will 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.610
 I see potential but in terms of 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.370
 campaign of the game as they did of 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.580
 which are cooperative missions online 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.100
 I did not like the truth I feel that they can 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.290
 have done it much better but not what 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.450
 they did but obviously everyone 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.060
 we know that where the game shines is in 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.460
 the multiplayer for those who do not know 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.160
 the creators of talk iphone 'are from the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.710
 creators of call of duty 4 and modern 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.390
 warfare 2 among other titles like 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.090
 example a medal of honor that does not 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.510
 I remember right now the name then 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.830
 with that we know that they are this in 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.180
 how to say it they know what's going on with the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.390
 multiplayer know that he walks with the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.520
 characters very well so good the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.490
 game is very but very fast is very 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.010
 frantic if you fall asleep already 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.140
 you were totally wrong because because 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.430
 here you have to have many reflections 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.819
 since the game offers many 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.830
 Possibilities of confrontations offers 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.040
 both the classic face confrontations 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.750
 close combat face and also what 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.880
 that is something that I had not seen 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.110
 applied to a perez person shooter as well 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.810
 what are these like I would say type battles 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.760
 predator because you have a 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.580
 rocket backpack with which you can 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.080
 push yourself and get to the rooftops 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.120
 also your pilots who are the 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.000
 players that we control the pilots 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.730
 the soldiers of the fact they have what 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.950
 which is the ability to do parkour how 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.989
 is this because we can run by 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.590
 some moments through the walls very 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.920
 well the game as I tell you is all this 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.390
 so very fast a lot of action all that and 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.370
 I would describe it in the few words 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.250
 as it is pure that it does everywhere 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.040
 the game is well balanced and the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.760
 I really do not feel there are problems 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.769
 of weapons or pe or things like that and it's all 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.300
 very good in terms of the quality of the 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.670
 online service 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.520
 excellent since you are using the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.900
 microsoft blue servers is done the 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.890
 first game of exxon juan in 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.390
 using them 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.040
 apart from forza motorsport 5 level these 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.280
 servers what they allow is that all 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.650
 the games are dedicated servers 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.380
 but apart from that what they do is that 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.140
 they control the game guide and other post 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.870
 processes that occur in the game very 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.660
 well then the servers and everything 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.360
 which is the online connection is excellent 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.600
 the truth very very good you feel everything 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.660
 very fluid everything very stable very well in 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.270
 Regarding the graphic section of the game 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.390
 obviously it's not a great web the game is 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.520
 see very well I'm going to marley very nice to 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.250
 the view but obviously it's not a jump 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.590
 very immense graphic but the truth to me 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.980
 I really like how it looks I enjoy it 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.200
 a lot and as far as the fps are 60 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.200
 frames per second that obviously 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.540
 fall something that could be 50 frames that 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.050
 I've noticed when things get 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.210
 very very intense 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.069
 the game meets the 60 frames there is 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.110
 that was what puts us 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.240
 entretainment said that it was key and what 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.150
 they achieved 60 frames per second 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.600
 achieved very well something else also that 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.330
 them 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.060
 noteworthy is the microtransactions 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.490
 game has no better transactions and no 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.530
 is going to have micro transactions coming 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.110
 by electronic arts as they have been 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.260
 ported in recent years that the truth 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.940
 have done a few things there is half bad is 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.190
 very very nice the news that no 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.560
 go to have micro transactions since 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.920
 in these types of games the truth is 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.420
 it ruins in mobile games this like that 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.330
 it works to be in games like that 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.640
 they pay a thousand pesos for them, the truth is 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.750
 It is not good and microtransactions 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.420
 it's good that they have not put it 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.950
 the lapses of the game have already been announced 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.740
 three map packages and others 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.040
 contents and have a cost of 25 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.980
 dollars that in pesos I get 331 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.710
 weights very well more or less the price 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.780
 it's cheap and the truth is that yes it's worth 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.450
 It's a shame because the game is very, very good 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.100
 the truth also something else 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.260
 louis puts between fear he commented that he was going to 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.260
 watch free content so that's 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.990
 good in terms of competitive respect 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.990
 I do not think the game has it since 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.000
 will enter something very basic we can not create 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.620
 what are private games in the game 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.380
 and that is something very, very important 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.720
 for what is the competitive emerging and 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.280
 all that 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.350
 although this silly and I saw youtube 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.230
 in the talca launch event it was 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.120
 in Mexico spoke with two websites that make 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.310
 marketing director available 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.800
 entretainment and asked what wave 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.420
 with all that he replied that they were going to 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.520
 and see if they are taking it very 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.370
 account to implement in the future but that 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.840
 would have to see as people ask 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.920
 also another thing is very good of the game 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.380
 is that it is totally something that 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.920
 feels cool feels fun and does not 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.800
 it feels like something totally like 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.160
 say it ugly or so and then it's very 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.830
 fun to play it the game requires a 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.750
 Internet connection necessarily if not 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.120
 they have internet is not going to serve them and 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.280
 it also requires golf very necessarily 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.100
 Well, if they do not have golf they will not 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.040
 to serve good gang I give to the game 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.080
 a rating of 9.0 I do not do today 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.070
 in day is for the campaign but that is 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.560
 where the game that makes 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.750
 multiplayer is excellent very fun 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.700
 very frenetic and the truth if you buy it 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.810
 you are going to have a great time 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.510
 available for xbox 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.830
 for computer and March 25 for 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.389
 Xbox 360 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.000
 remember obviously the final version 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:10.000
 definitive without a computer with all 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.190
 graphics to the maximum et cetera etcetera and 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.500
 followed by the xbox band version 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.690
 of 360 still does not speak very well but it 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.520
 he knows he's going to be less than 60 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.250
 frames per second possibly and in the 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.080
 resolution lower than 720 p but good yo 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.150
 I give it a zero point and see you in 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.280
 the border pilots beware much actor 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.280
 better that changed and out
