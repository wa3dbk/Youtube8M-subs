00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
think that we will see in this new phone

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.529 
think that we will see in this new phone
first<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.430> all<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.520> lot<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.850> people<00:00:21.090> might<00:00:21.390> be

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
first of all a lot of people might be

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.179 
first of all a lot of people might be
wondering<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.140> when<00:00:22.410> will<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.859> released

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
wondering so when will this be released

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.550 
wondering so when will this be released
personally<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.330> think<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.840> Apple<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.380> going

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
personally I think that Apple is going

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.450 
personally I think that Apple is going
to<00:00:25.830> stay<00:00:26.699> with<00:00:26.730> their<00:00:27.240> iphone<00:00:27.599> 4s<00:00:27.960> release

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
to stay with their iphone 4s release

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.400 
to stay with their iphone 4s release
schedule<00:00:29.840> previously<00:00:30.840> they<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.199> been

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
schedule previously they have been

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
schedule previously they have been
releasing<00:00:31.710> around<00:00:32.309> july<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:33.120> did<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.390> for

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
releasing around july they did that for

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.810 
releasing around july they did that for
the<00:00:33.660> iphone<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.800> threes<00:00:35.040> yes<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> three

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the iphone for the threes yes the three

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299 
the iphone for the threes yes the three
and<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.840> I've<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.559> original<00:00:37.980> iphone<00:00:38.280> i

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
believe the 4s they announced on October
fourth<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:43.860> will<00:00:43.920> see<00:00:44.190> an

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
fourth and I think that we will see an

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.819 
fourth and I think that we will see an
announcement<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.480> iphone<00:00:45.989> let's<00:00:46.680> call

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
announcement for the iphone let's call

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.940 
announcement for the iphone let's call
it<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.950> iphone<00:00:47.250> 5<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.760> video<00:00:48.059> i<00:00:48.960> think

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it the iphone 5 of this video i think

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.830 
it the iphone 5 of this video i think
that<00:00:50.039> they're<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> announce<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.510> around

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that they're going to announce it around

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.040 
that they're going to announce it around
octoberish<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.860> 2012<00:00:53.730> i<00:00:54.000> personally<00:00:54.870> think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
octoberish of 2012 i personally think

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
octoberish of 2012 i personally think
that<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.440> new<00:00:55.710> iphone<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that this new iphone is going to be a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.200 
that this new iphone is going to be a
big<00:00:57.600> jump<00:00:58.050> from<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> iphone<00:00:58.859> 4s<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.000> think

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
big jump from the iphone 4s and I think

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
big jump from the iphone 4s and I think
the<00:01:00.329> Apple<00:01:00.660> might<00:01:00.930> keep<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> iphone<00:01:01.620> 4s

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the Apple might keep the iphone 4s

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
the Apple might keep the iphone 4s
around<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> budget<00:01:04.019> model<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.589> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
around kind of as a budget model if you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.770 
around kind of as a budget model if you
will<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.729> previous<00:01:05.909> years<00:01:06.299> this

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
will just like in previous years this

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.200 
will just like in previous years this
iphone<00:01:07.320> will<00:01:07.590> probably<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.340> powered<00:01:09.060> by<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
iphone will probably be powered by the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.230 
iphone will probably be powered by the
same<00:01:09.510> chip<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.290> ipad<00:01:10.770> 3<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.210> thinking

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
same chip as the ipad 3 so I'm thinking

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.990 
same chip as the ipad 3 so I'm thinking
the<00:01:12.689> a6<00:01:13.260> chip<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.040> anticipate<00:01:14.430> will<00:01:14.880> be

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the a6 chip which I anticipate will be

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.070 
the a6 chip which I anticipate will be
about<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.630> 1.2<00:01:16.350> gigahertz<00:01:16.740> quad-core

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
about a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.749 
about a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor<00:01:19.080> also<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.430> this

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
processor also I do think that this

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
processor also I do think that this
device<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.750> around<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.470> gigabyte<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
device will have around a gigabyte of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.850 
device will have around a gigabyte of
RAM<00:01:23.280> might<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.470> three<00:01:25.470> fourths<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
RAM might see you like three fourths of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
RAM might see you like three fourths of
a<00:01:26.070> gigabyte<00:01:26.490> or<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.729> little<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.330> more<00:01:27.570> than

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
a gigabyte or a little bit more than

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960 
a gigabyte or a little bit more than
that<00:01:27.780> however<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.439> think<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.670> good

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
that however I think that this is a good

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
that however I think that this is a good
number<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.329> Apple<00:01:30.900> they've<00:01:31.409> been<00:01:31.560> saying<00:01:31.770> at

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
number for Apple they've been saying at

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.910 
number for Apple they've been saying at
512<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.150> iphone<00:01:33.450> four<00:01:33.659> still<00:01:33.689> has<00:01:34.140> 512

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
512 the iphone four still has 512

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
512 the iphone four still has 512
megabytes<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:36.240> megabytes<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.930> ram<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.350> i

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
megabytes or get megabytes of ram so i

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.590 
megabytes or get megabytes of ram so i
think<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.820> an<00:01:38.909> increase<00:01:39.060> in

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
think that we will see an increase in

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.109 
think that we will see an increase in
ram<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.619> far<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:40.979> storage<00:01:41.340> i<00:01:41.460> think<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.820> Apple

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
ram as far as storage i think that Apple

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
ram as far as storage i think that Apple
is<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.570> keep<00:01:42.899> their<00:01:43.259> current<00:01:43.530> storage

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
is going to keep their current storage

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.639 
is going to keep their current storage
model<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:45.000> much<00:01:45.390> has<00:01:45.630> changed<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:46.380> far<00:01:46.409> as

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
model not much has changed as far as

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.350 
model not much has changed as far as
storage<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.220> mean<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.430> think<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.090> see

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
storage I mean I think that we will see

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.710 
storage I mean I think that we will see
at<00:01:48.659> most<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.860> 64<00:01:50.430> gigabyte<00:01:50.850> version<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.390> we

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
at most a 64 gigabyte version and we

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.770 
at most a 64 gigabyte version and we
will<00:01:51.810> probably<00:01:52.110> also<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.799> 32<00:01:53.790> maybe<00:01:54.360> we'll

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
will probably also see a 32 maybe we'll

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.350 
will probably also see a 32 maybe we'll
probably<00:01:55.079> also<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.560> 16<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.729> 8<00:01:56.880> gigabyte

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
probably also a 16 not an 8 gigabyte

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.789 
probably also a 16 not an 8 gigabyte
Apple<00:01:57.899> hasn't<00:01:58.350> been<00:01:58.560> doing<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.159> I<00:02:00.799> really

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
Apple hasn't been doing that so I really

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.249 
Apple hasn't been doing that so I really
doubt<00:02:02.040> anything<00:02:02.430> higher<00:02:02.909> than<00:02:02.939> 64<00:02:03.750> gigabytes

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
doubt anything higher than 64 gigabytes

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.530 
doubt anything higher than 64 gigabytes
as<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> take<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.700> more<00:02:06.060> storage

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
as it's going to take up more storage

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.410 
as it's going to take up more storage
going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.020> cost<00:02:07.350> quite<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:09.239> they

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
going to cost quite a bit and as they

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
going to cost quite a bit and as they
move<00:02:09.599> more<00:02:10.080> toward<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.379> cloud<00:02:10.739> make

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
move more toward the cloud make

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.980 
move more toward the cloud make
I don't<00:02:11.700> want<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:11.910> push<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.450> putting<00:02:12.780> things

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
I don't want to push like putting things

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.360 
I don't want to push like putting things
in<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.200> cloud<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.590> set<00:02:13.830> up<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.040> your<00:02:14.130> phone

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
in the cloud and set up on your phone

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.730 
in the cloud and set up on your phone
you<00:02:14.430> know<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.960> kind<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.200> does<00:02:16.380> make<00:02:16.530> sense

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
you know so it kind of does make sense

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.070 
you know so it kind of does make sense
as<00:02:17.010> far<00:02:17.340> as<00:02:17.460> battery<00:02:17.970> goes<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.750> this

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
as far as battery goes I think that this

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.990 
as far as battery goes I think that this
new<00:02:19.350> iphone<00:02:19.860> will<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.250> some<00:02:20.490> pretty<00:02:20.820> nice

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
new iphone will have some pretty nice

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.270 
new iphone will have some pretty nice
ones<00:02:21.270> Apple<00:02:22.140> has<00:02:22.200> been<00:02:22.560> doing<00:02:22.830> some<00:02:23.100> big

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
ones Apple has been doing some big

highly<00:02:32.670> highly<00:02:32.700> doubt<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.540> will<00:02:34.020> see<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.470> in

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
highly highly doubt we will see this in

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.830 
highly highly doubt we will see this in
the<00:02:34.820> iphone<00:02:35.820> 5<00:02:36.030> at<00:02:36.240> least<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.570> fully

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
the iphone 5 at least like fully

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.080 
the iphone 5 at least like fully
implemented<00:02:37.560> however<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.370> think<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:38.880> will

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
implemented however I think that we will

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.450 
implemented however I think that we will
see<00:02:39.420> some<00:02:39.810> kind<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.080> new<00:02:40.290> battery<00:02:40.860> technology

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
see some kind of new battery technology

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.250 
see some kind of new battery technology
or<00:02:41.640> at<00:02:41.760> least<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.240> longer<00:02:42.870> lasting<00:02:42.990> battery

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
or at least a longer lasting battery

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.250 
or at least a longer lasting battery
also<00:02:43.860> i<00:02:44.250> predict<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.940> iphone<00:02:45.390> 4s<00:02:45.750> will

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
also i predict that the iphone 4s will

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.790 
also i predict that the iphone 4s will
be<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.860> last<00:02:47.220> 3.5<00:02:47.760> inch<00:02:48.540> display<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.560> think

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
be the last 3.5 inch display I think

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.310 
be the last 3.5 inch display I think
that<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> new<00:02:50.190> iphone<00:02:50.610> 5<00:02:50.910> will<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.780> probably

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
that the new iphone 5 will have probably

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.460 
that the new iphone 5 will have probably
around<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.770> 4-inch<00:02:53.280> display<00:02:54.230> android<00:02:55.230> phones

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
around a 4-inch display android phones

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.230 
around a 4-inch display android phones
are<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.740> least<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.250> flagship<00:02:56.820> models<00:02:57.150> are

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
are at least the flagship models are

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.600 
are at least the flagship models are
really<00:02:57.660> pushing<00:02:57.900> towards<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.620> larger<00:02:59.340> screen

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
really pushing towards a larger screen

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.190 
really pushing towards a larger screen
and<00:02:59.730> i<00:02:59.910> think<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.270> is<00:03:00.450> certainly<00:03:00.810> something

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
and i think this is certainly something

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.200 
and i think this is certainly something
that<00:03:01.380> we<00:03:01.620> will<00:03:01.710> see<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.190> new<00:03:02.460> iphone<00:03:02.970> as

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
that we will see in the new iphone as

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.150 
that we will see in the new iphone as
far<00:03:03.480> as<00:03:03.630> camera<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.230> i<00:03:04.320> don't<00:03:04.680> think<00:03:05.070> that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
far as camera that i don't think that

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.340 
far as camera that i don't think that
the<00:03:05.340> back-facing<00:03:05.910> camera<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.660> actually<00:03:06.870> going

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
the back-facing camera is actually going

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.200 
the back-facing camera is actually going
to<00:03:07.440> change<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.980> think<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.550> Apple<00:03:08.880> did<00:03:09.030> a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
to change I think that Apple did a

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.170 
to change I think that Apple did a
really<00:03:09.720> nice<00:03:09.990> job<00:03:10.050> with<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.920> new<00:03:11.250> iphone<00:03:11.820> 4s

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
really nice job with the new iphone 4s

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.450 
really nice job with the new iphone 4s
camera<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.770> don't<00:03:13.890> really<00:03:14.130> need<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
camera and that don't really need a

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.610 
camera and that don't really need a
whole<00:03:14.760> lot<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:15.030> change<00:03:15.270> there<00:03:15.540> on<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.840> front

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
whole lot of change there on a front

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.949 
whole lot of change there on a front
facing<00:03:16.860> camera<00:03:17.340> however<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.940> do<00:03:18.390> anticipate

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
facing camera however I do anticipate

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.710 
facing camera however I do anticipate
some<00:03:19.590> sort<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:19.890> change<00:03:20.160> as<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.970> hasn't<00:03:21.540> changed

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
some sort of change as it hasn't changed

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.550 
some sort of change as it hasn't changed
at<00:03:22.260> all<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.160> four<00:03:23.459> or<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.760> 4s<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.300> it's

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
at all for the four or the 4s and it's

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.840 
at all for the four or the 4s and it's
not<00:03:25.560> really<00:03:25.860> that<00:03:25.980> good<00:03:26.190> especially<00:03:26.459> with<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
not really that good especially with the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.610 
not really that good especially with the
video<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.360> hopefully<00:03:28.140> we'll<00:03:28.290> see<00:03:28.350> like<00:03:28.590> a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
video so hopefully we'll see like a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.620 
video so hopefully we'll see like a
nicer<00:03:29.100> FaceTime<00:03:29.700> camera<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.450> would<00:03:30.540> be

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
nicer FaceTime camera that would be

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.830 
nicer FaceTime camera that would be
really<00:03:30.810> nice<00:03:31.050> personally<00:03:31.680> um<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:33.030> maybe<00:03:33.060> even

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
really nice personally um and maybe even

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.410 
really nice personally um and maybe even
HD<00:03:34.650> as<00:03:34.950> far<00:03:35.310> as<00:03:35.340> they<00:03:35.550> design<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:36.060> think<00:03:36.300> that

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
HD as far as they design I think that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.440 
HD as far as they design I think that
will<00:03:36.540> see<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> aluminum<00:03:38.490> body<00:03:38.970> kind<00:03:39.360> of

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
will see like a aluminum body kind of

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.150 
will see like a aluminum body kind of
thing<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.840> think<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:40.830> be<00:03:40.950> pretty

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
thing I think it's going to be pretty

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.920 
thing I think it's going to be pretty
thin<00:03:41.520> might<00:03:41.820> see<00:03:42.000> something<00:03:42.240> like<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.480> tapered

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
thin might see something like a tapered

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.290 
thin might see something like a tapered
edge<00:03:43.080> unlike<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.770> macbook<00:03:44.459> air<00:03:44.910> work<00:03:45.090> like

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
edge unlike in the macbook air work like

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.620 
edge unlike in the macbook air work like
it's<00:03:45.510> thinner<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:47.820> think<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.240> this<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.480> going

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
it's thinner I think that this is going

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.900 
it's thinner I think that this is going
to<00:03:48.810> be<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.140> really<00:03:49.740> thin<00:03:50.010> foam<00:03:50.250> probably

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
to be a really thin foam probably

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.790 
to be a really thin foam probably
thinner<00:03:51.150> than<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.480> iphone<00:03:51.900> 4s<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.440> iphone

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
thinner than the iphone 4s in the iphone

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.640 
thinner than the iphone 4s in the iphone
24<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.870> like<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.990> said<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.290> back<00:03:55.470> will

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
24 and like I said the back will

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.040 
24 and like I said the back will
probably<00:03:56.160> be<00:03:56.310> made<00:03:56.520> out<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:57.120> aluminum<00:03:57.600> also<00:03:58.020> I

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
probably be made out of aluminum also I

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.350 
probably be made out of aluminum also I
predict<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.920> is<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.550> year<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.090> the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
predict that this is the year that the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.860 
predict that this is the year that the
iphone<00:04:00.810> finally<00:04:01.380> gets<00:04:02.190> 4g<00:04:02.550> finally<00:04:03.420> after<00:04:03.690> all

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
iphone finally gets 4g finally after all

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.640 
iphone finally gets 4g finally after all
this<00:04:03.990> time<00:04:04.170> i<00:04:05.040> just<00:04:05.459> think<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.760> apple<00:04:06.650> just

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
this time i just think that apple just

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.310 
this time i just think that apple just
needs<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.160> do<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.540> they've<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.780> mean<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
needs to do this they've I mean the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.110 
needs to do this they've I mean the
iphone<00:04:10.650> 4<00:04:10.890> was<00:04:11.010> supposed<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.340> have<00:04:11.430> 4g<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.030> it

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
iphone 4 was supposed to have 4g and it

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.560 
iphone 4 was supposed to have 4g and it
didn't<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:13.050> personally<00:04:13.700> LTE<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:15.090> probably

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
didn't so personally LTE is probably

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.940 
didn't so personally LTE is probably
what<00:04:15.720> they're<00:04:15.840> going<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:15.989> do<00:04:16.109> probably<00:04:16.859> with

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
what they're going to do probably with

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.310 
what they're going to do probably with
hsd<00:04:18.530> hsdpa<00:04:19.530> plus<00:04:19.890> as<00:04:20.070> well<00:04:20.489> however<00:04:21.330> 4G<00:04:22.140> speeds

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
hsd hsdpa plus as well however 4G speeds

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
hsd hsdpa plus as well however 4G speeds
are<00:04:22.680> definitely

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
are definitely

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.340 
are definitely
going<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.639> be<00:04:23.760> in<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.150> iphone<00:04:24.540> 5<00:04:24.840> well<00:04:25.139> that

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
going to be in the iphone 5 well that

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.930 
going to be in the iphone 5 well that
isn't<00:04:25.590> that<00:04:25.800> just<00:04:26.220> about<00:04:26.310> wraps<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.790> up<00:04:26.850> for

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
isn't that just about wraps it up for

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.240 
isn't that just about wraps it up for
