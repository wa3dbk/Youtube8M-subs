 You're the one, you come to a table and you. 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.429

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.329

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.989
 wedding they say has always been very 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.980
 wonderful people have never argued about 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.430
 anything 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.629
 you get that face you try to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.850
 to explain 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.510
 but not so kind that we fight 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.699
 always once lost people i never 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.339
 I fought the five years of relationship 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.020
 I never had a fight at birth. 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.619
 he wanted a shampoo for hair and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.909
 work still tries because at 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.070
 Sometimes the person starts with a 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.750
 fairy tale thing and you go 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.640
 breaking the person with some truths 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.409
 its speaking short happens with everything 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 her world begins to open up if she so 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.810
 there is no such thing as living with 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.770
 marry me and punk, because we live 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.090
 next to that ends up not having sex all over 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.790
 day, my friend, lie, people, I do not know. 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.320
 happens five years ago we have sex 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.820
 Type 4 of the day we just never had sex 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.950
 so when he operated the foot 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.180
 I want it was sex was something else that he 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.549
 did in the hospital 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.100

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.630
 explain a business so always the grass 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.700
 neighbor is always greener 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.860
 Girlfriend will make more sex, you will. 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.479
 catch - that you her boyfriend will be 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.259
 coolest she will tell you what 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.689
 your 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.369
 Her wedding is going to be 15 times more. 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.170
 easy her love story will be 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.030
 most romantic wedding ring from her 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.460
 Will the higher the request for marriage go? 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.400
 be more unusual but may lie 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.670
 I distrust people who are being 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.070
 great 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.960
 It's always wonderful to know who 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.320
 these people who stay floriano the life 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.240
 them and make you feel a phase 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.190
 people feel trash speak an emergent 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.380
 How is my life not like that? 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.730
 because then to be boring the witch or 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.340
 lives fighting with my husband my 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.500
 boyfriend I do not know, I have tpm and what's the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.930
 What problem is my problem is until 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.220
 Something wrong with my life has nothing. 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.040
 wrong with you 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.830
 we young women humans have 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.910
 very insecure and with the waters of the 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.580
 social 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.260
 business tightened because it's not just now 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.840
 that you sit at a table and talk to 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.620
 Your families with your friends will enter 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.440
 in their instagram and they will analyze if 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.420

 I think people have bigger bigger 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.770
 the world's right to arrive 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.630
 and post what they want on the 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.360
 your relationships 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.170

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.750
 There is nothing against but what I have is 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.280
 against are the exaggerations 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.590
 no one has a perfect relationship 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.260

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.270

 she's going to stay at home will question 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.660
 it will move to question the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.670
 The relationship of her life will speak 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.860
 because I'm not like my friend 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.590
