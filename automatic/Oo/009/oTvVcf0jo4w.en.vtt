make this fast any buildings i can get

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200 
make this fast any buildings i can get
this<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:41.400> know<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.729> he's<00:01:41.850> gonna<00:01:41.970> have

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
this one I don't know if he's gonna have

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.620 
this one I don't know if he's gonna have
troops<00:01:42.659> let's<00:01:43.200> draw<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> wall<00:01:43.829> breaker<00:01:44.630> you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
troops let's draw up a wall breaker you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.999 
troops let's draw up a wall breaker you
can<00:01:45.750> actually<00:01:45.869> find<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.649> people<00:01:46.920> have

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
can actually find out if people have

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
can actually find out if people have
troops<00:01:47.340> by<00:01:47.700> dropping<00:01:48.390> wall<00:01:48.570> breakers<00:01:48.869> just

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
troops by dropping wall breakers just

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.499 
troops by dropping wall breakers just
because<00:01:49.399> they<00:01:50.399> will<00:01:50.520> go<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.880> walls<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
because they will go for the walls and

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.609 
because they will go for the walls and
so<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.750> there's<00:01:51.930> something<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> way

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
so if there's something then the way

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.030 
so if there's something then the way
