want to go ahead and start here with

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.650 
want to go ahead and start here with
things<00:00:51.100> with<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.789> pattern<00:00:52.149> just<00:00:52.359> flipped

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
things with the pattern just flipped

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.049 
things with the pattern just flipped
over<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.230> I'm<00:00:54.039> going<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.370> just<00:00:54.609> go<00:00:54.820> ahead<00:00:54.940> and

over and I'm going to just go ahead and

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.090 
over and I'm going to just go ahead and
put<00:00:55.329> a<00:00:55.359> little<00:00:55.420> big<00:00:56.079> glob<00:00:56.739> of<00:00:56.769> glue<00:00:56.980> right

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
put a little big glob of glue right

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.819 
put a little big glob of glue right
along<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.699> side<00:00:58.359> here<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.410> can<00:00:59.530> really<00:00:59.679> be

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
along the side here and it can really be

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.889 
along the side here and it can really be
you<00:01:00.399> know<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.519> good<00:01:00.699> centimeter<00:01:01.239> wide<00:01:01.480> because

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
you know a good centimeter wide because

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.989 
you know a good centimeter wide because
there's<00:01:02.530> enough<00:01:02.829> overlap<00:01:03.190> so<00:01:03.699> we'll<00:01:03.879> have

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
there's enough overlap so we'll have

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:05.840 
there's enough overlap so we'll have
room<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.269> kind<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.660> get<00:01:04.780> everything<00:01:05.140> lined<00:01:05.320> up

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
room to kind of get everything lined up

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.550 
room to kind of get everything lined up
but<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:07.120> want<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.810> just<00:01:07.960> bring<00:01:08.410> everything

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
but I want to just bring everything

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.160 
but I want to just bring everything
around<00:01:09.010> in<00:01:09.250> ass<00:01:09.370> in<00:01:09.909> a<00:01:10.000> loop<00:01:10.240> kind<00:01:10.630> of<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.930> keep

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
around in ass in a loop kind of to keep

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.120 
around in ass in a loop kind of to keep
the<00:01:11.560> pattern<00:01:12.010> together<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.770> just<00:01:14.800> a

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
the pattern together and this is just a

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.940 
the pattern together and this is just a
nice<00:01:15.760> way<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.090> avoid<00:01:16.660> extra<00:01:17.110> creases<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.620> you

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
nice way to avoid extra creases that you

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.120 
nice way to avoid extra creases that you
maybe<00:01:18.100> don't<00:01:18.400> want<00:01:18.760> in<00:01:19.120> your<00:01:19.990> design<00:01:20.410> it's<00:01:20.980> a

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
maybe don't want in your design it's a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.210 
maybe don't want in your design it's a
nice<00:01:21.280> way<00:01:21.550> to<00:01:21.610> kind<00:01:21.880> of<00:01:22.000> avoid<00:01:22.330> that<00:01:22.600> if<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
nice way to kind of avoid that if you

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.970 
nice way to kind of avoid that if you
know<00:01:24.340> you're<00:01:24.730> doing<00:01:24.850> something<00:01:25.150> and<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:26.290> want

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
know you're doing something and you want

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.380 
know you're doing something and you want
to<00:01:27.070> try<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.250> avoid<00:01:27.520> that<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.920> just<00:01:30.910> kind<00:01:31.330> of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
to try to avoid that but I just kind of

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.270 
to try to avoid that but I just kind of
go<00:01:32.260> through<00:01:32.320> here<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.830> try<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:35.890> get<00:01:36.130> it<00:01:36.250> as

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
go through here and try to get it as

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.870 
go through here and try to get it as
lined<00:01:36.850> up<00:01:37.030> as<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.330> can<00:01:37.630> be<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.200> little<00:01:38.380> tricky

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
lined up as you can be a little tricky

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.310 
lined up as you can be a little tricky
sometimes<00:01:40.050> but<00:01:41.050> think<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:43.080> kind<00:01:44.080> of<00:01:44.140> play

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
sometimes but think I kind of play

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.780 
sometimes but think I kind of play
around<00:01:44.350> with<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.860> enough<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.220> should<00:01:45.460> be<00:01:45.730> able

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
around with it enough you should be able

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.690 
around with it enough you should be able
to<00:01:45.940> get<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.860> line<00:01:48.040> up<00:01:48.250> pretty<00:01:48.550> good

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
to get it kind of line up pretty good

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.270 
to get it kind of line up pretty good
here<00:01:49.050> but<00:01:50.050> when<00:01:50.200> we<00:01:50.320> smooth<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.860> out<00:01:50.950> we<00:01:51.130> get<00:01:51.250> a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
here but when we smooth it out we get a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.090 
here but when we smooth it out we get a
nice<00:01:51.490> smooth<00:01:52.150> doubt<00:01:52.390> surface<00:01:52.900> here<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.650> then

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
nice smooth doubt surface here and then

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.100 
nice smooth doubt surface here and then
we<00:01:54.190> want<00:01:54.370> to<00:01:54.430> just<00:01:54.610> go<00:01:54.760> ahead<00:01:54.880> on<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.720> front

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
we want to just go ahead on the front

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.960 
we want to just go ahead on the front
side<00:01:56.320> here<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:56.860> try<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.220> find<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.640> center

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
side here and try to find the center

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.790 
side here and try to find the center
know<00:01:58.120> some<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.390> these<00:01:58.600> patterns<00:01:59.170> it's<00:01:59.560> pretty

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
know some of these patterns it's pretty

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.040 
know some of these patterns it's pretty
easy<00:02:00.010> sometimes<00:02:00.490> it's<00:02:00.790> a<00:02:00.850> little<00:02:00.940> tricky<00:02:01.420> one

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
easy sometimes it's a little tricky one

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.200 
easy sometimes it's a little tricky one
thing<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.410> can<00:02:02.590> do<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.890> use<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.250> qr-code<00:02:03.730> and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
thing you can do is use the qr-code and

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.060 
thing you can do is use the qr-code and
a<00:02:04.270> little<00:02:04.510> bit<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:04.630> light<00:02:04.900> put<00:02:05.650> it<00:02:05.710> up<00:02:05.770> against

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
a little bit of light put it up against

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.400 
a little bit of light put it up against
the<00:02:06.130> light<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.670> try<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.060> match<00:02:07.570> up<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.170> two

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
the light and try to match up the two

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.699 
the light and try to match up the two
halves<00:02:09.039> of<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.819> QR<00:02:10.209> code<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.470> will<00:02:11.680> give

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
halves of the QR code and that will give

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.369 
halves of the QR code and that will give
you<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.550> first<00:02:12.819> step<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.690> getting<00:02:13.900> things

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
you the first step to getting things

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.369 
you the first step to getting things
kind<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:14.890> lined<00:02:15.160> up<00:02:15.459> right<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.090> once<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.230> kind

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
kind of lined up right and once you kind

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.070 
kind of lined up right and once you kind
of<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.830> part<00:02:18.129> going<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:19.600> make<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> little

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
of get that part going you make a little

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.320 
of get that part going you make a little
pinch<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.560> kind<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.800> get<00:02:20.980> stuff<00:02:21.310> started<00:02:21.790> then

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
pinch to kind of get stuff started then

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.360 
pinch to kind of get stuff started then
you<00:02:22.480> can<00:02:22.660> go<00:02:22.810> ahead<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.050> do

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
you can go ahead and do

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.470 
you can go ahead and do
do<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.610> rest<00:02:23.930> smooth<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.049> up<00:02:26.209> flip<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.330> over

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
do the rest smooth it up flip it over

of<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.090> ears<00:02:36.330> open<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.200> part<00:02:37.500> up<00:02:37.650> here<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
of the ears open this part up here and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.149 
of the ears open this part up here and
smoosh<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.120> down<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:40.260> same<00:02:40.560> thing<00:02:40.799> over<00:02:40.950> on

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
the bottom part of the bag then you can

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.289 
the bottom part of the bag then you can
just<00:02:46.470> take<00:02:46.709> an<00:02:46.890> overlap<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.849> little<00:02:48.120> from

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
just take an overlap just a little from

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.089 
just take an overlap just a little from
this<00:02:48.480> edge<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:51.079> then<00:02:52.079> we'll<00:02:52.260> bring<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.739> part

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
this edge and then we'll bring this part

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.559 
this edge and then we'll bring this part
in<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.519> when<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.760> bring<00:02:53.909> this<00:02:54.060> part<00:02:54.329> in<00:02:54.450> you

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
in and when you bring this part in you

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.839 
in and when you bring this part in you
want<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.810> make<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.349> this<00:02:55.530> edge<00:02:55.890> hits

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
want to make it so that this edge hits

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.289 
want to make it so that this edge hits
and<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.329> creates<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.720> nice<00:02:57.989> little<00:02:59.060> point<00:03:00.060> there

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
and it creates a nice little point there

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.059 
and it creates a nice little point there
from<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:03.049> try<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.109> keep<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.440> as<00:03:04.530> straight<00:03:04.739> as

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
from that try to keep it as straight as

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.069 
from that try to keep it as straight as
you<00:03:05.129> can<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.030> should<00:03:06.239> just<00:03:06.480> cut<00:03:06.720> right<00:03:06.750> on

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
you can and it should just cut right on

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.680 
you can and it should just cut right on
the<00:03:07.230> underneath<00:03:07.680> part<00:03:07.859> of<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.459> design<00:03:08.690> so

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
the underneath part of the design so

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.569 
the underneath part of the design so
like<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.079> bag<00:03:10.260> almost<00:03:10.530> rests<00:03:11.099> right<00:03:11.159> on<00:03:11.400> that

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
like the bag almost rests right on that

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.170 
like the bag almost rests right on that
crease<00:03:12.409> and<00:03:13.409> then<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:14.069> take<00:03:14.370> my<00:03:14.909> paper

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
crease and then I can take my paper

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.180 
crease and then I can take my paper
again<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.840> i<00:03:15.870> was<00:03:16.140> using<00:03:16.319> so<00:03:16.650> don't<00:03:16.799> get<00:03:16.890> glue

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
again that i was using so don't get glue

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.860 
again that i was using so don't get glue
everywhere<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.970> put<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.269> little<00:03:18.359> bit<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.599> glue

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
everywhere and put a little bit of glue

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.559 
everywhere and put a little bit of glue
on<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.200> flap<00:03:19.560> here<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.640> want<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:20.909> go<00:03:21.000> too<00:03:21.030> far

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
on this flap here you want to go too far

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.990 
on this flap here you want to go too far
in<00:03:21.629> because<00:03:22.260> you'll<00:03:23.250> wind<00:03:23.430> up<00:03:23.489> accidentally

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
in because you'll wind up accidentally

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.300 
in because you'll wind up accidentally
gluing<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.599> inside<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.230> bag<00:03:25.440> when<00:03:26.069> that's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
gluing the inside of the bag when that's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.690 
gluing the inside of the bag when that's
not<00:03:26.879> what<00:03:27.239> we<00:03:27.359> want<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.660> have<00:03:27.750> happen<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.669> put<00:03:29.669> a

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
not what we want to have happen so put a

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.900 
not what we want to have happen so put a
little<00:03:29.849> bit<00:03:30.060> glue<00:03:30.299> here<00:03:31.609> get<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.760> all

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
little bit glue here get that all

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.629 
little bit glue here get that all
smoothed<00:03:33.329> out<00:03:33.859> that's<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:35.040> last<00:03:35.250> time<00:03:35.519> you

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
smoothed out that's the last time you

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.199 
smoothed out that's the last time you
need<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.940> use<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.239> glue<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:38.250> then<00:03:38.459> we're<00:03:39.180> just

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
need to use the glue and then we're just

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.330 
need to use the glue and then we're just
going<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.540> fold<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.019> sides<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.650> create<00:03:40.829> the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
going to fold the sides to create the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.890 
going to fold the sides to create the
little<00:03:41.579> creases<00:03:41.849> that<00:03:42.060> are<00:03:42.269> in<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.389> bag<00:03:42.569> and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
little creases that are in the bag and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.050 
little creases that are in the bag and
it's<00:03:43.560> usually<00:03:43.919> about<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.459> know<00:03:44.609> so<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.849> can

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
it's usually about you know so you can

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.319 
it's usually about you know so you can
see<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.389> half<00:03:45.569> of<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.989> QR<00:03:46.799> code<00:03:46.829> here<00:03:47.459> try<00:03:48.239> to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
see the half of the QR code here try to

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.819 
see the half of the QR code here try to
keep<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.660> as<00:03:48.720> straight<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.500> it's<00:03:49.709> a

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
keep it as straight as you can it's a

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.050 
keep it as straight as you can it's a
narrow<00:03:50.040> crease<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.669> can<00:03:50.760> be<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:50.879> little

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
narrow crease so it can be a little

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.369 
narrow crease so it can be a little
tricky<00:03:51.150> but<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.660> want<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.840> try<00:03:51.930> keep<00:03:52.139> it<00:03:52.290> as

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
tricky but you want to try keep it as

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.920 
tricky but you want to try keep it as
straight<00:03:52.530> as<00:03:52.829> you<00:03:52.859> can<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.489> then<00:03:53.569> do<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.720> same

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
straight as you can and then do the same

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.390 
straight as you can and then do the same
thing<00:03:55.139> on<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.379> side<00:03:55.440> too<00:04:01.099> and<00:04:02.099> once<00:04:02.250> you've

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
thing on this side too and once you've

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.210 
thing on this side too and once you've
gotten<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:02.849> totally<00:04:03.799> creased<00:04:04.799> out<00:04:05.040> it

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
gotten that totally creased out it

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.559 
gotten that totally creased out it
should<00:04:05.250> be<00:04:05.519> about<00:04:05.699> center<00:04:06.209> there<00:04:06.389> in<00:04:06.480> the

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
should be about center there in the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.099 
should be about center there in the
middle<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.290> then<00:04:07.769> I'm<00:04:07.919> just<00:04:08.040> going<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.310> take<00:04:08.609> a

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
middle and then I'm just going to take a

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.360 
middle and then I'm just going to take a
pencil<00:04:10.109> or<00:04:10.530> something<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:11.099> you<00:04:11.160> might<00:04:11.310> have

pencil or something that you might have
to<00:04:12.359> pop<00:04:13.319> out<00:04:13.530> your<00:04:13.739> design<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:14.910> just<00:04:15.120> take<00:04:15.299> a

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
to pop out your design so just take a

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.930 
to pop out your design so just take a
pencil<00:04:15.599> not<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.590> sharp<00:04:16.799> end<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.310> use<00:04:17.669> that<00:04:17.699> to

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
pencil not the sharp end and use that to

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.360 
pencil not the sharp end and use that to
help<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.419> kind<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.750> pop<00:04:19.079> out<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.590> bottom<00:04:20.160> part

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
help you kind of pop out the bottom part

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.060 
help you kind of pop out the bottom part
of<00:04:20.609> everything<00:04:21.030> here<00:04:21.359> by<00:04:22.139> just<00:04:22.349> opening<00:04:22.710> up

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
of everything here by just opening up

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.510 
of everything here by just opening up
the<00:04:23.250> bag<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:24.240> getting<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.349> side<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:26.099> pop<00:04:26.280> out

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
the bag and getting that side to pop out

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.970 
the bag and getting that side to pop out
here

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.960 

then<00:04:29.250> at<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.490> bottom<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:34.040> then<00:04:35.040> this<00:04:35.550> crease

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
then at the bottom and then this crease

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.670 
then at the bottom and then this crease
right<00:04:36.180> here<00:04:36.660> there's<00:04:36.990> one<00:04:37.080> that's<00:04:37.440> already

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
right here there's one that's already

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.320 
right here there's one that's already
going<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.130> right<00:04:38.250> way<00:04:38.310> we<00:04:38.700> need<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:39.030> reverse

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
going the right way we need to reverse

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.600 
going the right way we need to reverse
one<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:39.900> them<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.320> then<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.950> center<00:04:41.280> crease

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
one of them and then the center crease

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.090 
one of them and then the center crease
we<00:04:41.880> need<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.180> reverse<00:04:42.480> too<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.770> can<00:04:43.800> get<00:04:44.070> a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
we need to reverse too so you can get a

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.430 
we need to reverse too so you can get a
nice<00:04:44.310> little<00:04:44.550> zigzag<00:04:45.480> crease<00:04:45.810> there<00:04:46.050> for<00:04:46.350> the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
nice little zigzag crease there for the

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.040 
nice little zigzag crease there for the
inside<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.580> bag<00:04:47.790> onto<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.690> other<00:04:48.810> side

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
inside of the bag onto the other side

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:59.330 
inside of the bag onto the other side
too<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:55.130> then<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:56.340> can<00:04:56.520> just<00:04:58.340> don't

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
too and then you can just don't

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.980 
too and then you can just don't
necessarily<00:05:00.000> need<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.180> close<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.870> know

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
necessarily need to close you know

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.360 
necessarily need to close you know
complete<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.620> crease<00:05:01.830> down<00:05:02.010> at<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.220> bottom

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
complete the crease down at the bottom

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.530 
complete the crease down at the bottom
here<00:05:02.520> we're<00:05:02.760> just<00:05:02.880> going<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.030> leave<00:05:03.210> that<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
here we're just going to leave that the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.450 
here we're just going to leave that the
way<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:03.720> is<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.170> then<00:05:04.890> you<00:05:04.980> can<00:05:05.100> just<00:05:05.250> take<00:05:05.400> the

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
way it is and then you can just take the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.370 
way it is and then you can just take the
top<00:05:05.730> part<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.180> fold<00:05:06.450> it<00:05:06.570> down<00:05:06.720> until<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.230> can

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
top part and fold it down until you can

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.460 
top part and fold it down until you can
match<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.620> up<00:05:07.950> with<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:09.660> pattern<00:05:10.020> on<00:05:10.200> the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
match it up with the pattern on the

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.660 
match it up with the pattern on the
front<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:13.220> there's<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:14.280> couple<00:05:14.460> different

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
front and there's a couple different

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.150 
front and there's a couple different
ways<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.390> create<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.080> closure<00:05:16.470> for<00:05:16.800> this<00:05:16.950> you

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
ways to create a closure for this you

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.770 
ways to create a closure for this you
could<00:05:17.310> just<00:05:17.610> leave<00:05:17.820> it<00:05:17.940> like<00:05:18.060> it<00:05:18.090> is<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.600> could

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
could just leave it like it is you could

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.990 
could just leave it like it is you could
glue<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.170> or<00:05:19.260> tape<00:05:19.440> it<00:05:19.590> down<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:20.010> can<00:05:20.160> also<00:05:20.310> put

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
glue it or tape it down you can also put

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.970 
glue it or tape it down you can also put
some<00:05:21.060> string<00:05:21.840> I've<00:05:22.080> shown<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.290> couple<00:05:22.470> times<00:05:22.620> of

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
some string I've shown a couple times of

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.430 
some string I've shown a couple times of
that<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.400> also<00:05:24.030> twist<00:05:24.420> tire<00:05:24.690> like<00:05:24.960> this<00:05:25.200> kind

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
that and also twist tire like this kind

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.170 
that and also twist tire like this kind
of<00:05:25.530> version<00:05:25.710> it's<00:05:26.040> kind<00:05:26.220> of<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.370> fun<00:05:26.580> way<00:05:26.760> to<00:05:26.790> do

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
of version it's kind of a fun way to do

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.230 
of version it's kind of a fun way to do
things<00:05:27.390> we<00:05:28.200> just<00:05:28.230> take<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:28.980> find<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.700> natural

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
things we just take and find a natural

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.700 
things we just take and find a natural
place<00:05:30.360> here<00:05:30.720> like<00:05:30.930> right<00:05:31.080> under<00:05:31.380> her<00:05:31.560> and

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
place here like right under her and

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.440 
place here like right under her and
right<00:05:32.100> where<00:05:32.250> her<00:05:32.370> neck<00:05:32.550> would<00:05:32.730> be<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:33.240> fold

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
right where her neck would be to fold

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.360 
right where her neck would be to fold
down<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:33.690> little<00:05:33.990> bit<00:05:34.200> we're<00:05:34.860> just<00:05:35.010> creating<00:05:35.190> a

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
down a little bit we're just creating a

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.340 
down a little bit we're just creating a
little<00:05:35.580> ledge<00:05:35.790> where<00:05:36.330> we<00:05:36.450> can<00:05:36.660> catch<00:05:36.930> either

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
little ledge where we can catch either

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.410 
little ledge where we can catch either
the<00:05:37.650> string<00:05:37.890> or<00:05:38.220> in<00:05:38.430> this<00:05:38.550> case<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:39.030> twisty

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
the string or in this case the twisty

I'm<00:05:40.020> just<00:05:40.200> going<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.350> line<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:40.740> up<00:05:40.800> right

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
I'm just going to line that up right

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.390 
I'm just going to line that up right
there<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.580> it<00:05:42.360> moves<00:05:42.570> really<00:05:42.870> easily<00:05:43.290> so<00:05:43.410> just

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
there and it moves really easily so just
