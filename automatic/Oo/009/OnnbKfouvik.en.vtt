enhanced bass bass comfortable fit with
excellent<00:02:06.780> noise<00:02:06.989> reduction<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> basically

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
excellent noise reduction so basically

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.650 
excellent noise reduction so basically
cancels<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> bit<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.310> background<00:02:12.269> noise

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
cancels a bit of background noise

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.559 
cancels a bit of background noise
obviously<00:02:13.500> probably<00:02:14.160> not<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> lot<00:02:14.549> there<00:02:15.510> are

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
obviously probably not a lot there are

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.080 
obviously probably not a lot there are
better<00:02:15.959> headphones<00:02:16.380> which<00:02:16.890> will<00:02:17.099> do<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.400> but

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
better headphones which will do that but

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.789 
better headphones which will do that but
it<00:02:18.269> will<00:02:18.390> cost<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.870> probably<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.530> few<00:02:19.769> hundred

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
it will cost you probably a few hundred

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.430 
it will cost you probably a few hundred
dollars<00:02:20.389> five<00:02:21.389> to<00:02:21.569> six<00:02:21.750> hundred<00:02:21.840> dollars<00:02:22.079> i

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
dollars five to six hundred dollars i

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.039
