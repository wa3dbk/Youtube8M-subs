the game because this is actually one of

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.410 
the game because this is actually one of
the<00:00:13.410> earlier<00:00:13.740> games<00:00:14.120> that<00:00:15.120> I've<00:00:15.269> played<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
the earlier games that I've played and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.760 
the earlier games that I've played and
jumped<00:00:18.420> right<00:00:18.539> into<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.529> played

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
jumped right into it I have not played

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.160 
jumped right into it I have not played
the<00:00:19.920> campaign<00:00:20.330> expensively<00:00:21.330> yet<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> may<00:00:22.109> be

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the campaign expensively yet I may be

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.140 
the campaign expensively yet I may be
played<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.769> hour<00:00:22.949> into<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.029> was

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
played an hour into that but that was

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.089 
played an hour into that but that was
one<00:00:24.269> because<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> servers<00:00:25.080> crash<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
one because the servers crash be a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.820 
one because the servers crash be a
server<00:00:26.519> crash<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.410> it's<00:00:28.410> probably<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.800> good

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
server crash so it's probably a good

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.470 
server crash so it's probably a good
thing<00:00:29.130> though<00:00:29.340> because<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.820> want<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.150> hit<00:00:30.330> on

apologize<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:08.080> gameplay<00:02:08.319> is<00:02:08.649> a<00:02:08.679> little<00:02:08.979> bit

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
apologize this gameplay is a little bit

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.300 
apologize this gameplay is a little bit
slow<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.269> I<00:02:10.599> do<00:02:10.989> understand<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.769> but<00:02:12.010> this

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
slow it is I do understand that but this

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.910 
slow it is I do understand that but this
is<00:02:12.489> absolutely<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.630> only<00:02:13.660> way<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.890> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
is absolutely the only way to have a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.640 
is absolutely the only way to have a
pretty<00:02:15.489> good<00:02:15.630> kill<00:02:16.630> death<00:02:16.810> ratio<00:02:16.930> at<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.530> end

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
pretty good kill death ratio at the end

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.830 
pretty good kill death ratio at the end
of<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.799> game<00:02:17.829> and<00:02:18.250> offer<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.150> lot<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.450> support

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
of the game and offer a lot of support

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.190 
of the game and offer a lot of support
because<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.440> killstreaks<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.190> game<00:02:21.430> are

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
because the killstreaks in this game are

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.830 
because the killstreaks in this game are
really<00:02:23.200> hard<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.470> obtain<00:02:23.739> if<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.489> are<00:02:24.840> trying

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
really hard to obtain if you are trying

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.620 
really hard to obtain if you are trying
to<00:02:25.989> rush<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.560> that's<00:02:27.310> probably<00:02:27.549> due<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
to rush and that's probably due to the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.080 
to rush and that's probably due to the
fact<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.410> all<00:02:29.859> the<00:02:30.100> games<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.640> I've<00:02:30.880> seen

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
fact that all the games that I've seen

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.660 
fact that all the games that I've seen
so<00:02:31.390> far<00:02:31.420> are<00:02:31.660> all<00:02:32.109> 12<00:02:32.470> v12<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.220> there<00:02:33.370> are<00:02:33.459> 12

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
so far are all 12 v12 so there are 12

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.400 
so far are all 12 v12 so there are 12
people<00:02:33.819> on<00:02:34.060> either<00:02:34.239> team<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:35.290> really

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
people on either team and it's really

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.640 
people on either team and it's really
hard<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.739> get<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:35.980> upper<00:02:36.220> hand<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:37.109> an<00:02:38.109> enemy

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
hard to get the upper hand on an enemy

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.920 
hard to get the upper hand on an enemy
team<00:02:39.069> of<00:02:39.310> 12<00:02:39.579> people<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.239> it's<00:02:40.510> kind<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.840> a

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
team of 12 people and it's kind of a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.199 
team of 12 people and it's kind of a
little<00:02:41.019> bit<00:02:41.170> more<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:42.160> guess<00:02:42.489> what<00:02:43.180> I

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
little bit more like I guess what I

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.180 
little bit more like I guess what I
would<00:02:43.299> assume<00:02:43.750> actual<00:02:44.530> warfare<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:45.100> be

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
would assume actual warfare to be

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.710 
would assume actual warfare to be
because<00:02:45.549> there<00:02:45.730> are<00:02:45.850> more<00:02:45.880> people<00:02:46.389> and<00:02:46.569> it's

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
because there are more people and it's

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.349 
because there are more people and it's
hard<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.109> Jax<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:47.739> run<00:02:48.430> around<00:02:48.549> with<00:02:49.120> a

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
hard to Jax to just run around with a

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.870 
hard to Jax to just run around with a
submachine<00:02:49.780> gun<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.560> tear<00:02:51.250> people<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.609> shreds

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
submachine gun and tear people to shreds

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.599 
submachine gun and tear people to shreds
so<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.900> am<00:02:53.200> playing<00:02:53.500> with<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.709> battle<00:02:54.280> rifle

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
so I am playing with a battle rifle

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.309 
so I am playing with a battle rifle
although<00:02:54.940> our<00:02:55.180> sniper<00:02:55.600> rifle<00:02:55.959> depending<00:02:56.230> on

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
although our sniper rifle depending on

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.470 
although our sniper rifle depending on
how<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.500> want<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.769> look<00:02:56.859> at<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.209> do<00:02:58.269> have

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
how you want to look at it and I do have

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.809 
how you want to look at it and I do have
the<00:02:58.600> ACOG<00:02:58.959> scope<00:02:58.989> on<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.590> thing<00:02:59.829> so<00:02:59.859> I'm<00:03:00.639> just

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
the ACOG scope on this thing so I'm just

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.849 
the ACOG scope on this thing so I'm just
kind<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.030> sitting<00:03:01.239> around<00:03:01.359> at<00:03:01.720> our<00:03:02.079> spawn<00:03:02.470> and

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
kind of sitting around at our spawn and

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.530 
kind of sitting around at our spawn and
trying<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.400> take<00:03:03.549> people<00:03:03.700> out<00:03:03.970> now<00:03:04.180> there<00:03:04.389> is<00:03:04.510> a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
trying to take people out now there is a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.090 
trying to take people out now there is a
point<00:03:04.810> where<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.019> do<00:03:05.139> run<00:03:05.380> out<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.530> ammo<00:03:05.769> of<00:03:05.980> my

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
point where I do run out of ammo of my

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.860 
point where I do run out of ammo of my
sniper<00:03:06.370> rifle<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:06.970> do<00:03:07.030> rush<00:03:07.420> around<00:03:07.600> with

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
sniper rifle and I do rush around with

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.890 
sniper rifle and I do rush around with
my<00:03:07.959> pistol<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.730> cap<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.760> couple<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.239> points<00:03:10.630> to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
my pistol and cap a couple of points to

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.280 
my pistol and cap a couple of points to
help<00:03:11.590> secure<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:12.040> victory<00:03:12.250> for<00:03:12.579> 19

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
help secure the victory for 19

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.429 
help secure the victory for 19
but<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.510> first<00:03:15.750> thing<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.140> want<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.379> point

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
but the first thing that I want to point

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.630 
but the first thing that I want to point
out<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:16.890> guys<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:19.640> servers

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
out to you guys is that the servers

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.429 
out to you guys is that the servers
there<00:03:20.939> are<00:03:21.030> dedicated<00:03:21.569> servers<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.200> game

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
there are dedicated servers to this game

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.429 
there are dedicated servers to this game
but<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.640> probably<00:03:24.510> not<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.930> good<00:03:25.170> thing<00:03:25.379> when

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
but it's probably not a good thing when

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.610 
but it's probably not a good thing when
you<00:03:25.709> think<00:03:25.920> about<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.159> the<00:03:26.700> servers<00:03:27.209> are<00:03:27.620> quite

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
you think about it the servers are quite

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.520 
you think about it the servers are quite
possibly<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.280> lag<00:03:29.819> is<00:03:30.090> I've<00:03:30.359> ever<00:03:30.810> seen<00:03:31.140> in

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
possibly the lag is I've ever seen in

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.030 
possibly the lag is I've ever seen in
any<00:03:31.739> video<00:03:32.040> game<00:03:32.340> I've<00:03:32.909> ever<00:03:32.970> played<00:03:33.239> really

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
any video game I've ever played really

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.399 
any video game I've ever played really
you<00:03:35.040> can<00:03:35.340> come<00:03:35.879> around<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.180> corner<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.810> empty<00:03:37.379> a

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
you can come around a corner and empty a

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.530 
you can come around a corner and empty a
clip<00:03:37.709> into<00:03:37.980> someone<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.700> hit<00:03:39.180> nothing<00:03:39.510> but

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
clip into someone and hit nothing but

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.539 
clip into someone and hit nothing but
air<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.709> next<00:03:40.889> thing<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.159> know<00:03:41.310> they

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
air and the next thing you know they

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.099 
air and the next thing you know they
have<00:03:41.760> stuck<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.359> in<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.540> back<00:03:42.689> of<00:03:42.840> your<00:03:42.930> head

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
have stuck you in the back of your head

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.170 
have stuck you in the back of your head
with<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> knife<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.829> it's<00:03:44.609> really<00:03:44.879> hard<00:03:45.060> to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
with a knife and it's really hard to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.580 
with a knife and it's really hard to
explain<00:03:45.420> how<00:03:45.629> they<00:03:45.750> got<00:03:45.780> behind<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.349> but

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
explain how they got behind you but

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.330 
explain how they got behind you but
that's<00:03:46.889> that's<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.760> way<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:47.970> goes<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:49.340> when

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
that's that's the way it goes and when

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.949 
that's that's the way it goes and when
you<00:03:50.400> are<00:03:50.549> fortunate<00:03:50.819> enough<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.269> beat<00:03:51.540> someone

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
you are fortunate enough to beat someone

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.789 
you are fortunate enough to beat someone
an<00:03:52.049> outright<00:03:53.030> firefight<00:03:54.030> which<00:03:54.989> happens<00:03:55.470> from

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
an outright firefight which happens from

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.750 
an outright firefight which happens from
time<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:56.280> time<00:03:57.500> my<00:03:58.500> my<00:03:59.220> thing<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.669> I've

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
time to time my my thing that I've

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.849 
time to time my my thing that I've
noticed<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:00.419> that<00:04:00.450> i<00:04:00.659> will<00:04:00.989> kill<00:04:01.200> someone<00:04:01.650> and

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
noticed is that i will kill someone and

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.530 
noticed is that i will kill someone and
their<00:04:02.159> body<00:04:02.400> will<00:04:02.609> fall<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.060> hit<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.329> ground

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
their body will fall and hit the ground

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.830 
their body will fall and hit the ground
and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:04.379> I'm<00:04:04.709> hit<00:04:05.430> by<00:04:05.579> their<00:04:05.790> bullets<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.569> I

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
and then I'm hit by their bullets so I

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.349 
and then I'm hit by their bullets so I
can<00:04:07.200> only<00:04:07.319> assume<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:08.099> for<00:04:08.669> that<00:04:08.819> instance

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
can only assume that for that instance

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.970 
can only assume that for that instance
my<00:04:09.599> internet<00:04:09.930> connection<00:04:10.019> was<00:04:10.470> just<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.709> little

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
my internet connection was just a little

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.970 
my internet connection was just a little
bit<00:04:11.069> faster<00:04:11.519> than<00:04:11.669> theirs<00:04:11.909> and<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:13.290> beat<00:04:13.739> them

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
bit faster than theirs and I beat them

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.240 
bit faster than theirs and I beat them
solely<00:04:14.819> on<00:04:15.239> internet<00:04:16.139> connectivity<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.979> and

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
solely on internet connectivity and and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.159 
solely on internet connectivity and and
that's<00:04:17.340> that's<00:04:17.699> a<00:04:17.940> big<00:04:18.090> problem<00:04:18.359> hopefully<00:04:18.780> EA

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
that's that's a big problem hopefully EA

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.210 
that's that's a big problem hopefully EA
will<00:04:19.560> will<00:04:20.039> fix<00:04:20.430> this<00:04:20.639> issue<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.860> if<00:04:22.860> they

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
will will fix this issue and if they

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.219 
will will fix this issue and if they
don't<00:04:23.460> I'll<00:04:23.970> be<00:04:24.210> quite<00:04:24.419> honest<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.810> really<00:04:24.840> find

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
don't I'll be quite honest I really find

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.159 
don't I'll be quite honest I really find
it<00:04:25.440> hard<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:26.699> see<00:04:26.909> myself<00:04:27.150> playing<00:04:27.659> this<00:04:27.960> game

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
it hard to see myself playing this game

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.710 
it hard to see myself playing this game
for<00:04:28.229> any<00:04:28.680> length<00:04:28.889> of<00:04:29.039> time<00:04:29.099> with<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.300> servers

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
for any length of time with the servers

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.740 
for any length of time with the servers
being<00:04:30.960> as<00:04:31.260> bad<00:04:31.590> as<00:04:31.830> they<00:04:31.979> are<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:33.270> being<00:04:33.510> said

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
being as bad as they are that being said

being as bad as they are that being said
though<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:33.990> don't<00:04:34.680> want<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:35.099> give<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.340> guys<00:04:35.370> the

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
though I don't want to give you guys the

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.250 
though I don't want to give you guys the
wrong<00:04:35.789> impression<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.419> is<00:04:36.570> not<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.750> bad<00:04:37.020> game

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
wrong impression this is not a bad game

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.680 
wrong impression this is not a bad game
this<00:04:37.500> game<00:04:37.710> could<00:04:37.979> be<00:04:38.190> absolutely<00:04:38.760> fantastic

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
this game could be absolutely fantastic

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.170 
this game could be absolutely fantastic
if<00:04:39.840> they<00:04:40.440> would<00:04:40.590> fix<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:41.010> issue<00:04:41.159> all<00:04:41.820> of<00:04:42.090> the

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
if they would fix that issue all of the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.260 
if they would fix that issue all of the
guns<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:42.900> do<00:04:42.960> mean<00:04:43.260> all<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.740> guns<00:04:43.949> are

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
guns and I do mean all of the guns are

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.689 
guns and I do mean all of the guns are
expertly<00:04:45.270> balanced<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.080> you<00:04:46.979> might<00:04:47.220> see<00:04:47.550> that

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
expertly balanced and you might see that

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.659 
expertly balanced and you might see that
as<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.940> problem<00:04:48.210> because<00:04:48.750> an<00:04:49.050> ak-47<00:04:50.010> in<00:04:50.220> real

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
as a problem because an ak-47 in real

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:51.860 
as a problem because an ak-47 in real
life<00:04:50.849> is<00:04:51.060> going<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.300> do<00:04:51.419> much<00:04:51.599> more<00:04:51.810> damage

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
life is going to do much more damage

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.399 
life is going to do much more damage
than<00:04:52.409> an<00:04:52.530> m16<00:04:53.159> but<00:04:53.940> in<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.270> video<00:04:54.510> game<00:04:54.570> balance

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
than an m16 but in a video game balance

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.250 
than an m16 but in a video game balance
is<00:04:55.740> very<00:04:55.830> important<00:04:56.490> so<00:04:56.760> I<00:04:57.030> can<00:04:57.780> understand

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
is very important so I can understand

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.850 
is very important so I can understand
why<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:59.120> damage<00:05:00.120> per<00:05:00.389> second<00:05:00.900> is<00:05:01.500> really

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
why that damage per second is really

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.770 
why that damage per second is really
balanced<00:05:02.370> out<00:05:02.520> between<00:05:02.729> almost<00:05:03.300> all<00:05:03.539> of<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
balanced out between almost all of the

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.279 
balanced out between almost all of the
guns<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.380> that's<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.220> very<00:05:05.250> good<00:05:05.490> thing

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
guns so that's a very good thing

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.379 
guns so that's a very good thing
killstreaks<00:05:07.289> are<00:05:07.470> not<00:05:07.740> easy<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.820> obtain

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
killstreaks are not easy to to obtain

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.300 
killstreaks are not easy to to obtain
even<00:05:09.900> if<00:05:10.199> you<00:05:10.320> are<00:05:10.440> really<00:05:10.590> good<00:05:10.800> player<00:05:11.039> and

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
even if you are really good player and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.189 
even if you are really good player and
you're<00:05:11.639> playing<00:05:11.789> extremely<00:05:12.389> defensively

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
you're playing extremely defensively

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.800 
you're playing extremely defensively
they're<00:05:13.770> still<00:05:13.979> not<00:05:14.099> easy<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.550> obtain<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:15.060> you

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
they're still not easy to obtain and you

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.360 
they're still not easy to obtain and you
do<00:05:15.960> have<00:05:16.110> an<00:05:16.259> option<00:05:16.740> when<00:05:16.919> you<00:05:17.009> unlock<00:05:17.310> a

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
do have an option when you unlock a

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.159 
do have an option when you unlock a
killstreak<00:05:17.820> to<00:05:18.449> either<00:05:18.630> go<00:05:18.900> with<00:05:19.050> an

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
killstreak to either go with an

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.020 
killstreak to either go with an
offensive<00:05:19.680> kill<00:05:19.860> streak<00:05:20.070> or<00:05:20.250> defensive<00:05:20.849> kill

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
offensive kill streak or defensive kill

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.980 
offensive kill streak or defensive kill
streak<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.450> I<00:05:21.750> would

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
streak and I would

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.300 
streak and I would
recommend<00:05:22.500> that<00:05:22.560> if<00:05:22.680> you<00:05:22.770> guys<00:05:22.890> are<00:05:23.100> playing
