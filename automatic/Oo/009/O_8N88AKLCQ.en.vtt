and<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.520> was<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.270> I'm<00:02:11.780> not<00:02:12.020> all<00:02:12.200> about

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
and that was it and I'm not all about

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.250 
and that was it and I'm not all about
that<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:13.130> don't<00:02:13.730> need<00:02:13.880> my<00:02:14.120> butt<00:02:14.720> cheeks<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.230> be

that I don't need my butt cheeks to be

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.120 
that I don't need my butt cheeks to be
hanging<00:02:15.650> out<00:02:15.740> so<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.100> didn't<00:02:16.490> buy<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.420> bottom

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
hanging out so I didn't buy the bottom

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.560 
hanging out so I didn't buy the bottom
instead<00:02:19.130> I<00:02:19.160> went<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.550> Target<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:20.180> see<00:02:20.360> if<00:02:20.480> I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
instead I went to Target to see if I

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.960 
instead I went to Target to see if I
could<00:02:20.750> find<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.350> bottom<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.040> match<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.490> target

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
could find a bottom to match a target

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.320 
could find a bottom to match a target
and<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.690> did<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.260> found<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.740> orange<00:02:25.430> bottom<00:02:25.940> it

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
and I did I found this orange bottom it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.180 
and I did I found this orange bottom it
basically<00:02:26.960> kind<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.290> matches<00:02:27.740> like<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
basically kind of matches like the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.540 
basically kind of matches like the
orange<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.290> top<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:31.610> matches<00:02:32.650> it'll<00:02:33.650> do<00:02:33.800> so

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
orange in the top it matches it'll do so

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.680
