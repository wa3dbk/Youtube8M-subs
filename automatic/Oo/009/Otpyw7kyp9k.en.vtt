gonna go ahead and use a pencil to give
myself<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:27.320> spot<00:00:28.320> there<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.949> where<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> don't

want to go in very deep try that so and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.670 
want to go in very deep try that so and
then<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.460> kind<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.329> lot

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
then you can kind of see it it's a lot

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.709 
then you can kind of see it it's a lot
not<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:49.860> thick<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.420> in

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
not as thick there as it is you know in

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.060 
not as thick there as it is you know in
this<00:00:51.989> spot<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.500> need<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.890> careful

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
this spot so you need to be careful

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.950 
this spot so you need to be careful
about<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.610> too<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.059> fact<00:00:54.239> that's<00:00:54.420> very

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
about that too that in fact that's very

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.299 
about that too that in fact that's very
thin<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.469> there<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.100> we're<00:00:56.250> gonna

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
thin right there but I think we're gonna

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.819 
thin right there but I think we're gonna
be<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.640> enough<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.530> around<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
be in enough and you just go around and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.069 
be in enough and you just go around and
make<00:00:58.980> sure<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:00.809> it's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
make sure that you know that you're it's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.920 
make sure that you know that you're it's
not<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> thin<00:01:02.280> part<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
not a thin part like that right here and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.560 
not a thin part like that right here and
you<00:01:04.739> were<00:01:04.890> trying<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> cut<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> out

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you were trying to cut that out

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.780 
you were trying to cut that out
you<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:06.990> clean<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.860> make<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> little

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
you know clean that out to make a little

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.910 
you know clean that out to make a little
dish<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.360> you'll<00:01:09.840> cut<00:01:10.080> through<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.830> or

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
dish there you'll cut through in here or

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.289 
dish there you'll cut through in here or
something<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.610> kind<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.880> keep<00:01:11.939> an<00:01:12.180> eye<00:01:12.270> on

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
something so just kind of keep an eye on

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.920 
something so just kind of keep an eye on
that<00:01:12.600> let's<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.590> ahead<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.900> go<00:01:15.900> with

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that let's just go ahead and go with

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.320 
that let's just go ahead and go with
that<00:01:16.200> mark<00:01:16.500> right<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> second<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.030> see

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that mark right now for a second and see

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:46.230 
that mark right now for a second and see
how<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.540> works

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.180 

and<00:01:47.240> then<00:01:47.390> just<00:01:47.720> go<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.530> know<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.830> check<00:01:49.010> it

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
and then just go you know and check it

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.890 
and then just go you know and check it
as<00:01:49.310> as<00:01:49.550> you<00:01:49.790> go<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.330> make<00:01:50.480> sure<00:01:50.510> you're<00:01:50.780> not

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
as as you go to make sure you're not

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.570 
as as you go to make sure you're not
going<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.140> come<00:01:51.980> through<00:01:52.220> any<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.490> those

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
going to come through any of those

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.600 
going to come through any of those
shallow<00:01:52.910> spots<00:01:53.410> and<00:01:54.410> just<00:01:54.590> keep<00:01:55.190> going<00:01:55.520> I

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
shallow spots and just keep going I

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.100 
shallow spots and just keep going I
think<00:01:55.790> we<00:01:55.880> can<00:01:56.030> come<00:01:56.270> out<00:01:56.300> maybe<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.720> little<00:01:56.780> bit

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
think we can come out maybe a little bit

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.970 
think we can come out maybe a little bit
more<00:01:57.320> on<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:58.090> that's<00:01:59.090> that's<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.500> only<00:02:00.770> spot

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
more on it that's that's the only spot

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.530 
more on it that's that's the only spot
I'm<00:02:01.280> really<00:02:01.520> worried<00:02:01.790> about<00:02:01.850> right<00:02:02.180> there<00:02:02.360> but

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
I'm really worried about right there but

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:27.949 
I'm really worried about right there but
it's<00:02:02.690> it's<00:02:03.050> still<00:02:03.260> pretty<00:02:03.530> thick

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.009 

let's<00:02:29.790> use<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.970> depth<00:02:31.180> gauge<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.659> make<00:02:31.810> sure

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
let's use the depth gauge and make sure

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.420 
let's use the depth gauge and make sure
we're<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:32.230> not<00:02:32.920> coming<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.459> too<00:02:33.700> far<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
we're not not coming in too far the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.759 
we're not not coming in too far the
center<00:02:36.819> there<00:02:38.579> so<00:02:39.579> we<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:39.849> still<00:02:40.120> got<00:02:40.239> plenty

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
center there so we get still got plenty

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.800 
center there so we get still got plenty
plenty<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:42.040> room<00:02:42.220> where<00:02:42.609> our<00:02:42.640> gonna<00:02:42.939> you<00:02:43.689> know

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
plenty of room where our gonna you know

plenty of room where our gonna you know
cup<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.230> back<00:02:44.409> of<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.769> little<00:02:44.980> bit<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.280> it's

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
cup the back of it a little bit so it's

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.660 
cup the back of it a little bit so it's
it's<00:02:45.609> flat<00:02:45.879> but<00:02:46.290> let's<00:02:47.290> go<00:02:47.500> ahead<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.890> come<00:02:48.549> in

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's flat but let's go ahead and come in

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.839 
it's flat but let's go ahead and come in
a<00:02:48.700> little<00:02:48.939> bit<00:02:49.060> more<00:02:50.370> let's<00:02:51.370> go<00:02:51.430> ahead<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:51.730> use
