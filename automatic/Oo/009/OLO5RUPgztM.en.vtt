00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.490 
to a drumbeat can really be helpful
sometimes<00:00:50.100> music<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.300> take<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:52.109> a<00:00:52.289> lots

of different directions and so music

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.470 
of different directions and so music
that's<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.199> complex<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:57.210> layered

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that's really complex and really layered

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
that's really complex and really layered
it<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.109> beautiful<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.010> you're

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
it can be beautiful but if you're

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
reality and attach you to the rest of

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.740

the<00:01:07.110> group<00:01:07.580> using<00:01:08.580> music<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.060> has<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> driving

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the group using music that has a driving

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.039 
the group using music that has a driving
beat<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:11.030> even<00:01:12.030> using<00:01:12.420> music<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:12.810> maybe

not<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.439> layered<00:01:13.680> sometimes<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> really

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
not so layered sometimes is really

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.940 
not so layered sometimes is really
helpful<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.780> look<00:01:15.990> into<00:01:16.200> cultures

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
helpful when you look into cultures

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.270 
helpful when you look into cultures
throughout<00:01:17.790> history<00:01:17.850> than<00:01:18.390> abuse<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.810> visions

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
throughout history than abuse in visions

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.670 
throughout history than abuse in visions
many<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.460> them<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:21.000> used<00:01:21.630> drums<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
many of them have used drums and the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.530 
many of them have used drums and the
shaman<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> drum<00:01:23.759> at<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> solid

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
shaman would be to drum at a solid

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.910 
shaman would be to drum at a solid
steady<00:01:24.930> beat<00:01:25.229> throughout<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> entire

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
steady beat throughout the entire

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.060 
steady beat throughout the entire
experience<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:28.140> sound<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
experience and so that sound that you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.819 
experience and so that sound that you
hear<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:30.329> help<00:01:30.600> tie<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.439> group<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
hear can help tie you to the group and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.700 
hear can help tie you to the group and
tied<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.340> reality<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.590> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
tied to reality in a way and so in that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.789 
tied to reality in a way and so in that
same<00:01:34.950> principle<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:36.090> would<00:01:36.840> either<00:01:37.020> use<00:01:37.470> drums

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
same principle I would either use drums

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.340 
same principle I would either use drums
or<00:01:38.159> use<00:01:38.490> singing<00:01:38.909> mantras<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.079> reason

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
or use singing mantras and the reason

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.289 
or use singing mantras and the reason
why<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.890> sing<00:01:41.130> mantras<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.820> because

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
why I would sing mantras it's because

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.030 
why I would sing mantras it's because
they<00:01:42.659> they<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.259> come<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> me<00:01:43.740> during<00:01:43.920> my

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
they they would come to me during my

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.010 
they they would come to me during my
experience<00:01:44.640> isn't<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> felt<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.719> it<00:01:45.899> was

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
experience isn't it felt like it was

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.679 
experience isn't it felt like it was
what<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> should<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:47.030> but<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.360> saying<00:01:48.600> that

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
what I should do but I'm not saying that

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.530 
what I should do but I'm not saying that
everyone<00:01:49.079> should<00:01:49.439> sing<00:01:49.710> mantras<00:01:50.250> or<00:01:50.540> should

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
to you but one thing that I have found

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.210 
to you but one thing that I have found
is<00:01:57.180> music<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> really

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
is music is a really

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.240 
is music is a really
good<00:01:58.340> way<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:59.170> attach<00:02:00.170> yourself<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.680> reality

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
good way to attach yourself to reality

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.000 
good way to attach yourself to reality
and<00:02:01.550> another<00:02:02.390> good<00:02:02.660> way<00:02:02.810> is<00:02:03.080> by<00:02:03.470> following

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
and another good way is by following

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.280 
and another good way is by following
your<00:02:04.160> breath<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:04.820> sometimes<00:02:05.600> this<00:02:05.900> can<00:02:06.110> be<00:02:06.260> a

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
your breath and sometimes this can be a

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.590 
your breath and sometimes this can be a
double-edged<00:02:06.740> sword<00:02:06.820> I've<00:02:07.820> had<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.450> wear

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
double-edged sword I've had it to wear

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.380 
double-edged sword I've had it to wear
following<00:02:09.380> my<00:02:09.560> breathing<00:02:10.040> in<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.729> experience

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
following my breathing in the experience

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.260 
following my breathing in the experience
and<00:02:11.630> trying<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.620> kind<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:12.920> take<00:02:13.400> really<00:02:14.030> deep

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
and trying to kind of take really deep

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.530 
and trying to kind of take really deep
slow<00:02:14.630> breaths<00:02:15.040> have<00:02:16.040> helped<00:02:16.520> me<00:02:16.640> Center

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
slow breaths have helped me Center

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.520 
slow breaths have helped me Center
myself<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.410> be<00:02:19.130> able<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.550> sort<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.690> reattach

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
myself and be able to sort of reattach

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.220 
myself and be able to sort of reattach
to<00:02:21.950> my<00:02:22.730> base<00:02:22.940> state<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.330> consciousness<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:24.110> a

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
to my base state of consciousness in a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.550 
to my base state of consciousness in a
lot<00:02:24.380> of<00:02:24.500> ways<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:25.040> I've<00:02:25.730> also<00:02:25.940> had<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.660> make<00:02:27.350> it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
lot of ways but I've also had it make it

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.500 
lot of ways but I've also had it make it
make<00:02:28.010> me<00:02:28.190> even<00:02:28.370> more<00:02:28.400> anxiety<00:02:28.730> written<00:02:29.420> and

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
make me even more anxiety written and

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.050 
make me even more anxiety written and
made<00:02:29.600> me<00:02:29.690> go<00:02:29.840> even<00:02:30.440> further<00:02:30.620> out<00:02:30.800> there<00:02:31.190> and

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
made me go even further out there and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.660 
made me go even further out there and
because<00:02:32.600> of<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.810> fact<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.530> couldn't<00:02:34.430> I

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
because of the fact that I couldn't I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.699 
because of the fact that I couldn't I
wasn't<00:02:35.300> breathing<00:02:35.450> at<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.930> normal<00:02:36.260> rate<00:02:36.290> of

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
wasn't breathing at the normal rate of

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.580 
wasn't breathing at the normal rate of
time<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.400> usually<00:02:37.970> am<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.230> would

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
time that I usually am and so I would

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.620 
time that I usually am and so I would
feel<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.130> eons<00:02:40.520> had<00:02:40.790> passed<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.330> hadn't

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
feel like eons had passed and I hadn't

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.590 
feel like eons had passed and I hadn't
taken<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.990> breath<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.490> so<00:02:43.490> that's<00:02:44.300> why<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.480> think

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
taken a breath and so that's why I think

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.970 
taken a breath and so that's why I think
following<00:02:45.230> your<00:02:45.350> breath<00:02:45.530> could<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:45.950> a

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
following your breath could be a

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.500 
following your breath could be a
double-edged<00:02:46.459> sword<00:02:46.490> but<00:02:47.030> it's<00:02:47.209> something

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
double-edged sword but it's something

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.230 
double-edged sword but it's something
that<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.750> could<00:02:47.900> definitely<00:02:48.080> try<00:02:48.680> and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
that you could definitely try and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.610 
that you could definitely try and
another<00:02:50.240> thing<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.900> may<00:02:51.140> sound<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.590> little

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
another thing this may sound a little

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.580 
another thing this may sound a little
bit<00:02:51.980> unconventional<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:53.170> some<00:02:54.170> people<00:02:54.470> are

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
bit unconventional and some people are

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.350 
bit unconventional and some people are
going<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:54.890> say<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.670> they<00:02:55.820> are<00:02:55.940> absolutely

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
going to say that they are absolutely

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.390 
going to say that they are absolutely
guess<00:02:56.750> we're<00:02:56.959> having<00:02:57.260> about<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.590> tell<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:58.040> but

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
guess we're having about to tell you but

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.940 
guess we're having about to tell you but
it<00:02:58.850> has<00:02:59.060> worked<00:02:59.360> for<00:02:59.540> me<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.959> but<00:03:00.530> went<00:03:00.709> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
it has worked for me and but went and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.650
