00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
key construction so you can take it

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.640 
key construction so you can take it
apart<00:03:24.010> now<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.060> liner<00:03:25.599> lock<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:26.109> really

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
apart now the liner lock is really

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.460 
apart now the liner lock is really
really<00:03:27.220> really<00:03:27.639> really<00:03:27.760> really<00:03:27.970> thin<00:03:28.629> but

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
really really really really thin but

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.309 
really really really really thin but
it's<00:03:29.620> adequate<00:03:30.040> right<00:03:30.569> but<00:03:31.569> it's<00:03:31.689> really<00:03:32.019> thin

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319
