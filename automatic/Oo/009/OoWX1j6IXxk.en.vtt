00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
on what backhoes doing here he's going

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.519 
on what backhoes doing here he's going
to<00:00:02.909> see<00:00:03.090> backhoe<00:00:03.330> getting<00:00:03.750> much<00:00:04.170> earlier

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
to see backhoe getting much earlier

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.589 
to see backhoe getting much earlier
Reavers<00:00:05.029> then<00:00:06.029> tester<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.569> getting<00:00:08.599> tester

still<00:00:09.870> just<00:00:10.019> hanging<00:00:10.170> around<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.620> minerals

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
still just hanging around the minerals

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
still just hanging around the minerals
may<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.820> waiting<00:00:12.179> for<00:00:12.360> enough<00:00:12.540> minerals<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
may be waiting for enough minerals to

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.160 
may be waiting for enough minerals to
force<00:00:13.710> his<00:00:14.309> probe<00:00:14.610> through<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.960> cancels

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
force his probe through and it cancels

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.930 
force his probe through and it cancels
that<00:00:16.470> pylon<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.250> he<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.760> get<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
that pylon so he is going to get the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.230 
that pylon so he is going to get the
scout<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.449> unless<00:00:18.810> backhoe<00:00:19.199> can't<00:00:19.680> stop<00:00:19.980> him

backhoe<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.570> protecting<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.430> robotics

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
backhoe is protecting that robotics

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
backhoe is protecting that robotics
support<00:00:24.119> way<00:00:24.240> up<00:00:24.390> there<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.869> dragoons<00:00:25.289> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
support way up there with dragoons and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.529 
support way up there with dragoons and
he's<00:00:25.949> coming<00:00:26.160> down<00:00:26.369> with<00:00:26.490> his<00:00:26.699> dragoons<00:00:27.269> right

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
he's coming down with his dragoons right

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.419 
he's coming down with his dragoons right
now<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:27.840> trying<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.349> kill<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.890> probe<00:00:29.189> I

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
now just trying to kill that probe I

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.970 
now just trying to kill that probe I
killed<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.420> oh<00:00:30.660> he<00:00:30.840> does<00:00:31.019> kill<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> probe<00:00:31.650> so

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
killed up oh he does kill the probe so

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.690 
killed up oh he does kill the probe so
nice<00:00:32.160> kill<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:33.120> him<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.920> do<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.040> think<00:00:35.100> yeah

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
nice kill from him I do not think yeah

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.729 
nice kill from him I do not think yeah
tester<00:00:36.180> did<00:00:36.390> not<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> robotics<00:00:37.380> support

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
tester did not see the robotics support

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.130 
tester did not see the robotics support
base<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.070> he<00:00:38.100> does<00:00:38.340> not<00:00:38.579> quite<00:00:39.570> know<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
base so he does not quite know that

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.330 
base so he does not quite know that
rivers<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.500> coming<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.890> think<00:00:41.100> he<00:00:41.190> can

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
rivers are coming but I think he can

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280 
rivers are coming but I think he can
assume<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> since<00:00:42.059> he<00:00:42.210> saw<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.570> robotics

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
assume it since he saw the robotics

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.690 
assume it since he saw the robotics
facility<00:00:45.950> tester<00:00:46.950> trying<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.489> another

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
facility tester trying to get another

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.130 
facility tester trying to get another
economic<00:00:47.940> advantage<00:00:48.600> we'll<00:00:48.750> see<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:48.989> he<00:00:49.079> can

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
economic advantage we'll see if he can

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
economic advantage we'll see if he can
do<00:00:49.829> something<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.850> economic

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
do something with this economic

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240 
do something with this economic
advantage<00:00:51.809> he<00:00:52.020> didn't<00:00:52.469> quite<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:53.129> enough

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
advantage he didn't quite get enough

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.660 
advantage he didn't quite get enough
done<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> last<00:00:54.149> game<00:00:55.160> but<00:00:56.160> he<00:00:56.250> does<00:00:56.460> have

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
done with it last game but he does have

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.189 
done with it last game but he does have
the<00:00:56.789> advantage<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.750> he<00:00:57.840> should<00:00:58.050> probably

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the advantage here so he should probably

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.020 
the advantage here so he should probably
put<00:00:58.559> down<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> shield<00:00:59.070> battery<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.579> play<00:00:59.760> very

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
put down a shield battery and play very

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.900 
put down a shield battery and play very
defensively<00:01:00.539> try<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> keep<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.530> base<00:01:01.910> since

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
defensively try to keep that base since

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.810 
defensively try to keep that base since
backhoe<00:01:03.600> does<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.650> only<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.339> base<00:01:05.580> right

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
backhoe does have only one base right

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.490 
backhoe does have only one base right
now<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> much<00:01:09.450> earlier<00:01:09.630> economic

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
now and this is a much earlier economic

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.039 
now and this is a much earlier economic
advantage<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.159> tester<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.760> tester<00:01:12.150> wait

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
advantage for tester I think tester wait

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.630 
advantage for tester I think tester wait
a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.439> longer<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.100> his<00:01:14.310> base<00:01:14.610> in

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
a little bit longer to get his base in

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.210 
a little bit longer to get his base in
the<00:01:15.000> last<00:01:15.030> game<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:16.290> course<00:01:16.530> both<00:01:16.710> players<00:01:16.979> got

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the last game of course both players got

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
the last game of course both players got
their<00:01:17.369> bases<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.909> about<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> same<00:01:18.299> time<00:01:18.479> last

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
their bases at about the same time last

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.550 
their bases at about the same time last
game<00:01:20.270> hora<00:01:21.270> backhoe<00:01:21.570> tried<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.170> least<00:01:22.290> he

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
game hora backhoe tried to at least he

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.649 
game hora backhoe tried to at least he
we<00:01:22.680> had<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> bunch<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> troops<00:01:23.729> outside<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
we had a bunch of troops outside of it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.700 
we had a bunch of troops outside of it
natural<00:01:26.450> now<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> Gateway<00:01:27.869> coming<00:01:28.350> down<00:01:28.500> for

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
natural now the Gateway coming down for

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.410 
natural now the Gateway coming down for
tester<00:01:29.100> tester<00:01:29.549> trying<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.150> troops

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
tester tester trying to get some troops

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.300 
tester tester trying to get some troops
on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.630> ground<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:31.049> time<00:01:31.110> learning<00:01:31.950> from

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
on the ground this time learning from

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.819 
on the ground this time learning from
his<00:01:32.460> mistakes<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> last<00:01:33.299> game<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.659> think

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
his mistakes of the last game I think

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.260 
his mistakes of the last game I think
well<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.890> looks<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.070> backhoes<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.060> try

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
well it looks like backhoes going to try

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.730 
well it looks like backhoes going to try
some<00:01:36.509> harassment<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:37.170> he's<00:01:37.259> coming<00:01:37.590> in

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
some harassment here he's coming in

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
some harassment here he's coming in
going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.490> spotted<00:01:38.820> by<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.270> observer<00:01:39.630> I

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
going to be spotted by that observer I

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.319 
going to be spotted by that observer I
think<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> probe<00:01:40.850> sitting<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:41.970> there<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
think and the probe sitting out there to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.190 
think and the probe sitting out there to
scout<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.880> either<00:01:45.030> way<00:01:45.240> tester<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.750> prepared

scout but either way tester is prepared

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
scout but either way tester is prepared
in<00:01:46.380> his<00:01:46.829> main<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.549> sure<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.820> he's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
in his main but I'm not sure if he's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.450 
in his main but I'm not sure if he's
prepared<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> natural<00:01:49.229> hidden<00:01:50.100> natural

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
harassment there but always actually

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.460 
harassment there but always actually

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
here to pick off this pylon

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.759 
here to pick off this pylon
to<00:02:14.290> stop<00:02:14.620> some<00:02:15.310> supply<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:16.150> tester

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
to stop some supply of tester

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.929 
to stop some supply of tester
momentarily<00:02:17.769> while<00:02:18.400> he<00:02:18.489> tries<00:02:18.609> to<00:02:18.700> build

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
momentarily while he tries to build

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.220 
momentarily while he tries to build
another<00:02:19.120> pylon<00:02:19.719> and<00:02:20.939> he's<00:02:21.939> just<00:02:22.120> keeping<00:02:22.569> his

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
another pylon and he's just keeping his

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.899 
another pylon and he's just keeping his
troops<00:02:23.650> back<00:02:23.889> here<00:02:24.159> he<00:02:24.249> has<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.459> couple<00:02:24.790> of

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
troops back here he has a couple of

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.089 
troops back here he has a couple of
zealots<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.480> defend<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.959> River<00:02:26.290> as<00:02:26.349> well<00:02:26.590> but

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
zealots to defend that River as well but

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.949 
zealots to defend that River as well but
I<00:02:27.159> think<00:02:27.189> backhoe<00:02:27.670> should<00:02:28.060> probably<00:02:28.510> back<00:02:28.719> off

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
I think backhoe should probably back off

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.110 
I think backhoe should probably back off
now<00:02:29.230> oh<00:02:29.500> he's<00:02:30.069> still<00:02:30.579> going<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:30.909> with<00:02:31.000> his

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
long time denied mining just long enough

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.849 
long time denied mining just long enough
to<00:03:15.310> get<00:03:15.519> up<00:03:15.730> his<00:03:15.939> own<00:03:16.150> base<00:03:16.449> here<00:03:16.719> so<00:03:16.959> now<00:03:17.139> he<00:03:17.739> is

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
to get up his own base here so now he is

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.920 
to get up his own base here so now he is
not<00:03:18.040> going<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.340> be<00:03:18.489> at<00:03:18.699> a<00:03:18.930> economic

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
not going to be at a economic

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.469 
not going to be at a economic
disadvantage<00:03:20.470> like<00:03:20.620> he<00:03:20.709> was<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:20.889> last<00:03:21.159> game<00:03:21.479> he

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479 
disadvantage like he was a last game he

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.999 
disadvantage like he was a last game he
won<00:03:22.689> the<00:03:22.810> last<00:03:22.989> game<00:03:23.229> but<00:03:23.409> it<00:03:23.500> was<00:03:23.620> quite<00:03:23.979> a

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:24.009 
won the last game but it was quite a

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.270 
won the last game but it was quite a
risk<00:03:24.280> going<00:03:25.150> for<00:03:25.569> pretty<00:03:26.290> much<00:03:26.349> all<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.949> troop

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
risk going for pretty much all in troop

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.640 
risk going for pretty much all in troop
they're<00:03:27.549> trying<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.509> fight<00:03:28.900> off<00:03:28.930> tester<00:03:29.500> if

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
they're trying to fight off tester if

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.289 
they're trying to fight off tester if
tester<00:03:30.069> had<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.340> shield<00:03:30.639> battery<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> little<00:03:31.209> bit

tester had a shield battery a little bit
earlier<00:03:31.449> I<00:03:31.840> don't<00:03:32.319> think<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.620> backhoe<00:03:33.189> would

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
earlier I don't think that backhoe would

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.770 
earlier I don't think that backhoe would
have<00:03:33.519> been<00:03:33.609> able<00:03:33.699> to<00:03:33.849> win<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:34.209> game<00:03:34.419> okay

believe since he has his own observers
out<00:03:42.549> right<00:03:42.729> now<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.449> tester<00:03:43.780> has<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.900> pretty

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
out right now the tester has a pretty

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.610 
out right now the tester has a pretty
large<00:03:44.470> ground<00:03:44.919> army<00:03:45.310> he<00:03:46.299> has<00:03:46.540> probably<00:03:47.409> two

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
large ground army he has probably two

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.379 
large ground army he has probably two
ravers<00:03:47.979> in<00:03:48.099> that<00:03:48.220> shuttle<00:03:48.459> right<00:03:48.669> now<00:03:48.819> so<00:03:49.090> he's

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
ravers in that shuttle right now so he's

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.080 
ravers in that shuttle right now so he's
going<00:03:49.569> to<00:03:49.689> be<00:03:50.379> able<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.709> defend<00:03:51.009> always<00:03:51.849> going

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
going to be able to defend always going

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.420 
going to be able to defend always going
for<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.299> third<00:03:52.359> base<00:03:52.840> i<00:03:53.079> think<00:03:53.379> i<00:03:53.590> think<00:03:53.919> tester

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
for a third base i think i think tester

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.830 
for a third base i think i think tester
is<00:03:54.519> going<00:03:54.699> to<00:03:54.790> try<00:03:54.939> to<00:03:54.970> plop<00:03:55.299> down<00:03:55.479> a<00:03:55.540> third

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
is going to try to plop down a third

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.009 
is going to try to plop down a third
base<00:03:56.079> this<00:03:56.409> could<00:03:56.620> be<00:03:56.799> a<00:03:57.009> bit<00:03:57.699> much<00:03:58.019> from

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
base this could be a bit much from

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.069 
base this could be a bit much from
tester<00:03:59.439> I<00:04:00.209> think<00:04:01.209> he<00:04:01.269> needs<00:04:01.479> to<00:04:01.509> focus<00:04:01.689> more<00:04:02.049> on

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
tester I think he needs to focus more on

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.349 
tester I think he needs to focus more on
defending<00:04:02.650> his<00:04:03.310> other<00:04:03.549> natural<00:04:04.060> expansion

defending his other natural expansion

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.679 
defending his other natural expansion
which<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:04.959> still<00:04:05.229> pretty<00:04:05.409> exposed<00:04:06.329> he<00:04:07.329> has<00:04:07.479> no

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
which is still pretty exposed he has no

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:08.999 
which is still pretty exposed he has no
real<00:04:07.900> way<00:04:08.049> of<00:04:08.079> defending<00:04:08.409> that<00:04:08.680> except

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
real way of defending that except

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.490 
real way of defending that except
shuttling<00:04:09.489> troops<00:04:10.150> over<00:04:10.509> to<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:11.109> space
