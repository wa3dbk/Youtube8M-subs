00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.820
 hello dear wander and photo friends today 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.620
 I want you the jack wolfskin acs 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.570
 imagine photo backpack namely in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 one per park version of 30 liters 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.320
 I had already read that on Amazon 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.000
 a whole lot of people happy about it 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 that was a high one now 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.810
 Comfort from the acs system 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.060
 connected with the really extreme 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 storage space for photo technology from therefore 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.699
 I want you in the first part 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.830
 Imagine how to backpack the whole thing 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.840
 can pack what possibilities there are 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.840
 and in the second part you will see how 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.610
 I carry well on the way 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.040
 now the backpack exaggerated 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.600
 jam-packed alone to show what's there 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.649
 everything goes with it and I start it 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.300
 outside area 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.710
 Here we have one and a half liters 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.100
 water bottle the one on the side 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.899
 can stow and firmly to the opponent 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 as well if you have a tripod inside 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.850
 do the tripod then yourself is here 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.350
 the front is attached and has 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.940
 quick closures that means you get 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.700
 it is relatively well off underneath 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.409
 the first storage compartment and up here the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.810
 second again the significantly more spacious 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.610
 is in the ground then we have that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.350
 rain capes that means when it rains 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.119
 that really protects everything well 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.320
 is and it also acts simultaneously 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.780
 as a damper then we always have the time 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.520
 One really big lift 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.369
 highlights is the so-called acs 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.500
 Carrying system and as you can see is here 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.689
 underneath a construction and a 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.369
 power supply that you the backpack 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.780
 little of the good takes away with it 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.090
 sweats not as much as it wears 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.650
 something pleasant and the concept sets 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.210
 be lax continued here in the pages 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.400
 here again we have one 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.290
 It is very wide for the net 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.939
 wearing comfort and here you too 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.390
 we have to do something up a bit 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.329
 can 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.009
 on the other side then a bag 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.540
 where we can do something clean I have 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.030
 For example, a small camera you 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.829
 just take it out quickly 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.790
 and then of course we have the question 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.460
 bring 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.469
 which has very wide are well padded 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.259
 are here again fast closures 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.850
 turn and opportunity for example 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.399
 here son of the temple mountain the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.720
 hose into it that is to say 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.790
 already in the outdoor area we already have 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.450
 to offer a whole lot and therefore he 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.739
 can be worn well, for example 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.959
 there is also a lax here again 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.390
 I've noticed that is not 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.120
 let's just get so stupid to our 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.239
 opening up completely overcrowded interior 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.830
 you just do that over this 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.629
 and they are edited that way too 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.640
 with gloves for example is possible 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.650
 you just have the lid back 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.300
 and here you see is really a lot 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.140
 place that on the individual parts 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.819
 can access 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.630
 I have here for example in there in the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.870
 full frame camera with a telephoto lens 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.690
 my phone with battery pack a second 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.840
 full-frame camera with a 50 mm 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.120
 lens a wide-angle lens and 24 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.579
 70 always on top of it a bit 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.430
 small stuff as you can see that's all 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.630
 really good in here then in the lid 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.790
 we have the same again 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.150
 possibility for this cf cards in too 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.610
 bring 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.079
 and above a lockable compartment me 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.079
 I have to separate here, for example 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.550
 Let's get to that 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.370
 the spacious upper area and gerd 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.950
 on top of it a really wonderful 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.750
 bag that is so big that I mean mine 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.000
 complete triangel not into it 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.100
 get including my battery is the 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.110
 adaptern and that's pretty much 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.510
 ingenious 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.460
 only below is the real one 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.720
 main subject yet you get with 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.580
 must have on these beautiful zippers 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.060
 to say the camera is just in front 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.340
 me 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.380
 which is usually in this subject 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.180
 there is still room for everyone 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.890
 lots of little accessories and here you have 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.390
 the possibility to bring in a laptop 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.820
 I tried it with my 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.000
 were 17 inches fits easily here 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.000
 purely 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.350
 that means also in the upper area have 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.450
 you have a lot of space for everything 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.910
 to stow and the whole is still 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.910
 quite safe and spacious great thing 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.220
 I was traveling twice for you 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.450
 once to the solar eclipse on the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.549
 trail and here on our 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.380
 Homestead to just test how 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.080
 is the comfort of jack wolfskin 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.130
 acs backpacks and i have to say that 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.500
 have them with 17 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.910
 really packed and you can tell 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.790
 very clearly that here in the upper 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.500
 shoulder area and also talents 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.169
 overpaid a lot of weight on it 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.140
 Nevertheless, the comfort is good 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:41.180
 because we really have a lot here 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:43.310
 Wide strap with padding and 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.330
 the same is also here in the pages 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.010
 flowed from the backpack 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.840
 So he lies on it but is padded 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.910
 to that comes that acs system that me 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.720
 allows me to breathe a lot 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.430
 get back 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.130
 The backpack itself will be so 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.529
 piece away from the back and everything 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.509
 In all, this is fantastic 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.429
 let's come to the conclusion of jack 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.479
 Wolfskin acs backpack and I have to 

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:08.279

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.259
 surprised how much of mine 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.799
 technology get in the backpack into 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.239

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:15.689
 one of course is the big one 

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:17.069
 Interior for those for the dsl compartment and 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.899

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.789
 Lockable are it has fun 

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:22.529

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.429
 You're off and it just has 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.529
 everything sat 

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:28.409
 that also means wearing comfort though 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.059
 We 17 kilograms were fantastic for 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.349
