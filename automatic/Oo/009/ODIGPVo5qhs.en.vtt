00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.300
 hello everyone let's see how to modify 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.810
 the look of a beach dress 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.810
 purchased on sales 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.750
 let's use a thread bobbin 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.640
 elastic like this that we will take to 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.280
 along the entire side seam of the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.559
 dress from the back 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.989
 we started to sew about 5 or 10 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.700
 centimeters from the top up 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.940
 the bottom edge 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.370
 we have to use a stitch type 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.800
 zig zag that we select in our 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.450
 sewing machine and a stitch length 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.450
 small I have chosen 12 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.890
 now we start sewing on the site 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.320
 marked but we let the thread 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.030
 protrude a few centimeters by the part 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.670
 higher 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 We are sewing carefully so as not to 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.400
 catch the thread with the stitches after 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.520
 we're going to have to pull the ends 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 if we catch the thread when sewing we can 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.450
 break the seam 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.350
 once we finished our stitching 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.490
 we pull the ends of wine to 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.490
 frown the seam 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.240
 when we have produced it to our 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.670
 taste 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.409
 we make several knots at the two ends 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.999
 of the elastic thread 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.999
 and we cut what 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.880
 we have finished our work 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.490
 we found that both sides of the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.920
 dress have been left with a produced 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.920
 similar with the same height
