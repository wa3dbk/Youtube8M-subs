answer<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.510> say<00:01:12.780> probably<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
answer here and say probably not the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.010 
answer here and say probably not the
main<00:01:14.400> reason<00:01:14.430> being<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.119> xenoverse<00:01:15.540> has<00:01:15.810> been

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
main reason being is xenoverse has been

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.440

in<00:01:16.110> development<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.890> already<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
in development for already about I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.999 
in development for already about I
believe<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.110> coming<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.530> its<00:01:19.680> third<00:01:19.979> year

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
believe it's coming up on its third year

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.539 
believe it's coming up on its third year
here<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.500> possible<00:01:23.070> unless

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
here I just don't see it possible unless

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.429 
here I just don't see it possible unless
this<00:01:23.970> new<00:01:24.240> Dragon<00:01:24.689> Ball<00:01:24.810> Z<00:01:24.840> movie<00:01:25.259> that's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.429 
movie has been in the works for quite
some<00:01:29.729> time<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.840> seriously<00:01:31.200> doubt

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
some time I'm going to seriously doubt

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.399 
some time I'm going to seriously doubt
it<00:01:31.590> unless<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.670> late<00:01:33.000> addition<00:01:33.409> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
it unless it's like a late addition and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.200 
it unless it's like a late addition and
another<00:01:34.950> thing<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:35.369> into<00:01:35.430> account<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
another thing to take into account is I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.330 
another thing to take into account is I
still<00:01:36.570> very<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.380> believe<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
still very much so believe that

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.480 
still very much so believe that
xenoverse<00:01:38.970> will<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.479> coming<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:39.990> very<00:01:40.490> early

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
xenoverse will be coming out very early

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.510 
xenoverse will be coming out very early
on<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.450> 2015<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:44.040> doubt<00:01:44.280> they're

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
on in 2015 so I really doubt they're

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.420 
on in 2015 so I really doubt they're
going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.850> spoil<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:46.140> movie<00:01:46.409> characters<00:01:47.100> by

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.670 
hardly ever communicate and when they do
I<00:02:02.610> would<00:02:03.149> almost<00:02:03.719> guarantee<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.140> short-lived

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
I would almost guarantee it short-lived

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.319 
I would almost guarantee it short-lived
and<00:02:04.770> they're<00:02:04.890> probably<00:02:05.100> not<00:02:05.430> communicating

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
and they're probably not communicating

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.719 
and they're probably not communicating
about<00:02:06.479> things<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.860> now<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
about things like this now is that to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.260 
about things like this now is that to
say<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:10.709> never<00:02:11.340> communicated<00:02:12.090> about

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
say that's they never communicated about

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.730 
say that's they never communicated about
it<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.690> course<00:02:13.020> not<00:02:13.230> for<00:02:13.500> we

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
it of course not for we

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.790 
it of course not for we
xenoverse<00:02:14.220> could<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.520> releasing<00:02:15.090> late<00:02:15.800> next

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
xenoverse could be releasing late next

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160 
xenoverse could be releasing late next
year<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.370> they<00:02:18.270> could<00:02:18.510> implement<00:02:18.900> these

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
year and they could implement these

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.530 
year and they could implement these
characters<00:02:19.710> who<00:02:20.250> knows<00:02:20.520> but<00:02:20.880> I'm<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> go

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
characters who knows but I'm going to go

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.300 
characters who knows but I'm going to go
out<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.840> limb<00:02:21.960> here<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.500> say<00:02:22.770> they're

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
out on a limb here and say they're

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.190 
out on a limb here and say they're
probably<00:02:23.640> gonna<00:02:23.940> save<00:02:24.240> those<00:02:24.390> characters<00:02:24.960> for

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
probably gonna save those characters for

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.220 
probably gonna save those characters for
the<00:02:25.230> next<00:02:25.890> dragon<00:02:26.580> ball<00:02:26.940> z<00:02:27.180> game<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.080> just

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the next dragon ball z game that is just

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.250 
the next dragon ball z game that is just
my<00:02:28.680> bet<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.550> know<00:02:29.670> no<00:02:30.570> one<00:02:30.750> really<00:02:30.780> knows<00:02:31.200> yet

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
my bet you know no one really knows yet

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.070 
my bet you know no one really knows yet
but<00:02:31.770> if<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.980> were<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> betting<00:02:32.460> man<00:02:32.670> which<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.750> am

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
but if I were a betting man which I am

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.560 
but if I were a betting man which I am
by<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.560> way<00:02:34.860> I'm<00:02:35.520> not<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.790> betting<00:02:36.090> man<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.390> don't

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
by the way I'm not a betting man I don't

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.240 
by the way I'm not a betting man I don't
even<00:02:36.750> know<00:02:36.930> how<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.110> bet<00:02:37.380> but<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:38.010> what<00:02:38.220> I

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
even know how to bet but that is what I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.060 
even know how to bet but that is what I
