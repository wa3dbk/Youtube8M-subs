00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:12.880
 any thread is not a fake 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:21.610
 agreement on the decision is really alpine 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:24.180
 This is the original thing that is assembled on 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.180
 taiwan 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.470

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.340
 3-band equalizer 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.730
 low pass filter and what we listen 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.950
 we'll show it to you now when 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.220
 it works let's my cap 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.530
 the curtain opens very easily insert 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.500
 flash drive and that's real alpine ahmed al not 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.700
 really like it can and it is convenient so 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.830
 that we inserted a flash drive 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.580

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.790
 Press the button to change the mode disk to 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.100
 drive throws no drive here yusbi we 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.020
 should do it 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.440
 mechanically too it is automatically 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.120
 not happening it seems to me it will even be 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.520
 more convenient if you are listening to the radio 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.580
 leave a USB flash drive 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.530
 You do not immediately transfer to a USB flash drive and not 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.560
 turn off does not turn off the radio does not 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:49.320
 radio wave itself is the creator of his 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.320
