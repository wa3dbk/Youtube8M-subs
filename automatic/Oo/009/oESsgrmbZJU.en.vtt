deshield the little handheld shield
device<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:01.199> right<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
device and and it's just going right to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.240 
device and and it's just going right to
the<00:01:01.890> computer<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.489> then<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.420> guys<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:04.250> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the computer and then you guys are and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
the computer and then you guys are and
then<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.700> see<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.510> controlling<00:01:06.869> my

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
then I can see I'm just controlling my

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.950 
then I can see I'm just controlling my
shield<00:01:08.159> through<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> computer<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.630> mobizen

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
shield through the computer with mobizen

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.800 
shield through the computer with mobizen
so<00:01:10.860> basically<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.420> by

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so basically that's it and that is by

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.700 
so basically that's it and that is by
far<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.170> best<00:01:13.680> way<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> um<00:01:15.680> what<00:01:16.680> else

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
far the best way to do it um what else

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.030 
far the best way to do it um what else

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
mobizen that's that's pretty much the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.430 
mobizen that's that's pretty much the
standard<00:04:55.070> that's<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.910> best<00:04:56.150> thing<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.510> do<00:04:56.630> so

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
standard that's the best thing to do so

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.440 
standard that's the best thing to do so
of<00:04:57.710> course<00:04:57.979> of<00:04:58.310> course<00:04:58.910> another<00:04:59.389> long-winded

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
of course of course another long-winded

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.659 
of course of course another long-winded
another<00:05:02.450> long-winded<00:05:02.990> me<00:05:03.950> explaining

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
another long-winded me explaining

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.020 
another long-winded me explaining
something<00:05:05.540> that<00:05:06.050> took<00:05:06.770> 15<00:05:07.220> seconds<00:05:07.729> and<00:05:07.850> did

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
something that took 15 seconds and did

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.020 
something that took 15 seconds and did
five<00:05:08.210> minutes<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.600> do<00:05:08.750> so<00:05:08.930> so<00:05:09.919> I<00:05:10.250> guess<00:05:10.580> maybe

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
five minutes to do so so I guess maybe

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.620 
five minutes to do so so I guess maybe
