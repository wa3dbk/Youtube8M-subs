welcome to rebuilding a large old

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.510 
welcome to rebuilding a large old
twin-cylinder<00:00:03.510> steam<00:00:03.990> engine<00:00:04.380> most<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.400> the

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
twin-cylinder steam engine most of the

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.610 
twin-cylinder steam engine most of the
parts<00:00:05.819> so<00:00:06.000> far<00:00:06.299> have<00:00:06.750> been<00:00:06.810> about<00:00:07.230> stripping

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
parts so far have been about stripping

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.919 
parts so far have been about stripping
the<00:00:07.799> engine<00:00:08.160> down<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.599> first

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
the engine down and this is the first

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.450 
the engine down and this is the first
part<00:00:10.260> about<00:00:10.769> building<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> engine<00:00:11.580> back<00:00:11.730> up

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
part about building the engine back up

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.160 
part about building the engine back up
the<00:00:14.460> crankshaft<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.179> singularly<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.990> most

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
the crankshaft is singularly the most

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.529 
the crankshaft is singularly the most
important<00:00:16.770> part<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.279> steam<00:00:17.490> engine<00:00:17.880> if

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
important part on the steam engine if

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.599 
important part on the steam engine if
this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.170> right<00:00:19.470> then<00:00:19.890> nothing<00:00:20.460> else

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
this is not right then nothing else

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.450 
this is not right then nothing else
above<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.119> crankshaft<00:00:21.449> will<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:22.460> most

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
above the crankshaft will be right most

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.580 
above the crankshaft will be right most
crank<00:00:23.789> shafts<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> three<00:00:24.810> bearing<00:00:25.199> system

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
crank shafts have a three bearing system

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.589 
crank shafts have a three bearing system
as<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> five

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
as you can see here some have a five

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.660 
as you can see here some have a five
bearing<00:00:28.019> system<00:00:28.439> which<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.769> better<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.490> more

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
bearing system which is better the more

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.820 
bearing system which is better the more
bearings<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> better<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.619> case

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
bearings the better but in this case

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.069 
bearings the better but in this case
we've<00:00:32.160> stuck<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.550> three<00:00:32.730> bearings<00:00:33.180> Center

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
we've stuck with three bearings Center

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.119 
we've stuck with three bearings Center
and<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.829> left<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> right

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
and one at the left and one at the right

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.200 
and one at the left and one at the right
so<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.460> me<00:00:38.730> placing<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
so here you see me placing the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.020 
so here you see me placing the
crankshaft<00:00:39.510> loosely<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.350> position<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
crankshaft loosely in position and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.069 
crankshaft loosely in position and
having<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.090> look<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.540> sits<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
having a look how it sits in the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.700 
having a look how it sits in the
bearings<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:44.280> seems<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> sit<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.120> well

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
bearings it seems to sit very well

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
bearings it seems to sit very well
someone<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.829> some<00:00:47.039> stage<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.700> machine<00:00:48.210> too

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
someone at some stage as machine too

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.660 
someone at some stage as machine too
much<00:00:48.690> off<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.930> end<00:00:49.200> caps<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.280> we'll<00:00:50.489> need

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
much off the end caps so we'll need

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.810 
much off the end caps so we'll need
considerable<00:00:51.239> shimming<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> make<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.410> work

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
considerable shimming to make it work

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.340 
considerable shimming to make it work
the<00:00:53.820> main<00:00:54.000> bearing<00:00:54.329> caps<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> very

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the main bearing caps have to be a very

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.889 
the main bearing caps have to be a very
solid<00:00:55.860> stable<00:00:56.340> fit<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.270> rest<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> main

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.750 
bearing and the only way to do this
successfully<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> use<00:01:01.379> spaces<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.309> shims

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
about fitting the crankshaft would have

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.030 
about fitting the crankshaft would have
made<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> miniseries<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.939> its<00:01:54.090> own<00:01:55.040> fitting

this<00:01:56.159> crankshaft<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> real<00:01:57.420> test<00:01:57.750> of

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
this crankshaft is a real test of

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.990 
this crankshaft is a real test of
patience<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.649> need<00:01:58.979> lots<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.399> patience<00:01:59.850> for

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
patience you need lots of patience for

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.050 
patience you need lots of patience for
this<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.860> warned<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.640> run<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.030> of

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this and be warned if you run out of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.209 
this and be warned if you run out of
patience<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.619> will<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.920> it's

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
patience and think all that will do it's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.889 
patience and think all that will do it's
a<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:05.549> tight<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:05.850> you'll<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.240> okay<00:02:06.390> it'll

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
a bit tight but you'll be okay it'll

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.940 
ruling not a good idea
it<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.539> run<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.110> at<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> expense<00:02:10.770> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
it will run in but at the expense of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.950 
it will run in but at the expense of

alternatively<00:02:16.770> if<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.100> think<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.820> will<00:02:18.000> do

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
alternatively if you think that will do

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.330

what<00:02:20.910> will<00:02:21.060> happen<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.780> engine<00:02:22.110> will

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
what will happen is the engine will

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260 
what will happen is the engine will
rattle<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.100> will<00:02:23.220> make<00:02:23.430> knocking<00:02:23.880> noises

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
lubricated crankshaft and it's a little

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.520 
lubricated crankshaft and it's a little
bit<00:02:50.160> tight<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:51.210> not<00:02:51.600> quite<00:02:51.870> as<00:02:52.050> smooth<00:02:52.320> as<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
bit tight it's not quite as smooth as I

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.950 
bit tight it's not quite as smooth as I
would<00:02:52.740> like<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.120> off<00:02:54.330> comes<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> top

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
would like it to be so off comes the top

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.780 
would like it to be so off comes the top
cap<00:02:55.200> at<00:02:55.380> once<00:02:55.560> again<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.190> I'll<00:02:56.460> put<00:02:56.670> another

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
cap at once again and I'll put another

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.780 
cap at once again and I'll put another
shim<00:02:57.240> in<00:02:57.360> there<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.690> see<00:02:57.840> what<00:02:58.020> happens<00:03:01.790> this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
shim in there and see what happens this

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.850 
shim in there and see what happens this
is<00:03:02.970> not<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.360> doing<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.720> car<00:03:03.990> engine<00:03:04.230> with<00:03:04.830> a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
is not like doing a car engine with a

car engine with the main bearings on a
car<00:03:06.810> engine<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.740> would<00:03:07.860> have<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.130> use<00:03:08.250> a

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
car engine you would have to use a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.070 
car engine you would have to use a
torque<00:03:08.670> wrench<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.210> really<00:03:09.600> tighten<00:03:09.840> them

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
torque wrench and really tighten them

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.920 
torque wrench and really tighten them
apart<00:03:10.820> that's<00:03:11.820> because<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.330> bearings<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:12.900> a

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
apart that's because the bearings on a

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.260 
apart that's because the bearings on a
car<00:03:13.230> engine<00:03:13.440> are<00:03:13.860> carried<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.760> very<00:03:14.970> hard

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
car engine are carried in a very hard

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.050 
car engine are carried in a very hard
metal<00:03:15.720> support<00:03:16.190> whereas<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> steam<00:03:17.640> engine

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
metal support whereas on a steam engine

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.030 
metal support whereas on a steam engine
generally<00:03:18.750> speaking<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.470> bearings<00:03:19.890> are

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
generally speaking the bearings are

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.040 
generally speaking the bearings are
manufactured<00:03:20.730> from<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.150> bearing<00:03:21.510> material

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
manufactured from the bearing material

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.890 
manufactured from the bearing material
in<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.380> case<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.860> gunmetal<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:24.480> if<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.750> do

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
in this case is gunmetal so if you do

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.990 
in this case is gunmetal so if you do
over<00:03:25.200> tighten<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.740> top<00:03:25.920> cap<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.580> are<00:03:26.730> likely

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
over tighten the top cap you are likely

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.240 
over tighten the top cap you are likely
to<00:03:27.210> distort<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.930> entire<00:03:28.290> bearing<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:28.980> will

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
to distort the entire bearing and will

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.010 
to distort the entire bearing and will
probably<00:03:29.430> make<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.820> crankshaft<00:03:30.240> feel<00:03:30.690> tight

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
probably make the crankshaft feel tight

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.550 
probably make the crankshaft feel tight
when<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.590> isn't<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:33.110> mentioned<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.350> will

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
when it isn't I mentioned that you will

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.410 
when it isn't I mentioned that you will
need<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.800> lot<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.220> patience<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.730> do<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.150> and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
need a lot of patience to do this and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.120 
need a lot of patience to do this and
you<00:03:36.630> will<00:03:36.750> also<00:03:36.900> need<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.230> lot<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.470> patience<00:03:38.010> to

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
you will also need a lot of patience to

you will also need a lot of patience to
watch<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.490> video<00:03:38.700> as<00:03:39.330> I'm<00:03:39.510> trying<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.780> cover

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
watch this video as I'm trying to cover

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.020 
watch this video as I'm trying to cover
as<00:03:40.260> many<00:03:40.470> points<00:03:40.920> as<00:03:41.010> possible<00:03:41.070> about<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
as many points as possible about the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.550 
as many points as possible about the
fitting<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.600> crankshaft<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> steam

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
fitting of a crankshaft to a steam

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.420 
fitting of a crankshaft to a steam
engine<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:45.350> here<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.620> over<00:03:46.920> tighten<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
engine and here I over tighten the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.280 
engine and here I over tighten the
bearing<00:03:47.760> cap<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.330> illustrate<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> point

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
bearing cap to illustrate the point

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.680 
bearing cap to illustrate the point
and<00:03:49.740> if<00:03:49.860> I<00:03:49.980> just<00:03:50.160> back<00:03:50.400> off<00:03:50.430> very<00:03:50.850> slightly<00:03:51.210> the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
and if I just back off very slightly the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.200 
and if I just back off very slightly the
crank<00:03:51.960> shaft<00:03:52.230> spins<00:03:52.530> beautifully<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.790> much<00:03:54.000> so

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
crank shaft spins beautifully so much so

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.730 
crank shaft spins beautifully so much so
that<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:54.450> can<00:03:54.630> turn<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.960> round<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.410> do<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
that I can turn it round and do the

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.130 
that I can turn it round and do the
other<00:03:55.770> end<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.540> doing<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.660> other<00:03:57.750> end<00:03:57.990> is

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
other end and doing the other end is

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.990 
other end and doing the other end is
exactly<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.710> same<00:03:58.920> process<00:03:59.160> as<00:03:59.610> doing<00:03:59.910> the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
exactly the same process as doing the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.450 
exactly the same process as doing the
first<00:04:00.270> one<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:01.320> avoid<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.740> risk<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.130> coma

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
first one and to avoid the risk of coma

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.210 
first one and to avoid the risk of coma
or<00:04:02.730> for<00:04:03.150> anyone<00:04:03.390> with<00:04:03.690> ADHD<00:04:04.110> I'm<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:05.130> to

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
or for anyone with ADHD I'm going to

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.950 
or for anyone with ADHD I'm going to
speed<00:04:05.580> up<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.850> video<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.210> get<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.570> over<00:04:06.810> with

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
speed up the video to get it over with

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.380 
speed up the video to get it over with
quickly

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
quickly

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.589 
quickly
first<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:09.570> all<00:04:09.660> I'll<00:04:09.900> lubricate<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.710> bearing

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.209 

when<00:04:13.749> I<00:04:13.780> was<00:04:13.959> making<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:14.439> video<00:04:14.769> I<00:04:15.010> did<00:04:15.189> a

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:15.219 
when I was making this video I did a

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.279 
when I was making this video I did a
really<00:04:15.459> stupid<00:04:15.579> thing<00:04:15.999> I<00:04:16.389> set<00:04:16.840> up<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.109> first

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
really stupid thing I set up the first

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.960 
really stupid thing I set up the first
shot<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.919> forgot<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.430> press<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.820> record

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
shot and forgot to press the record

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.909 
shot and forgot to press the record
button<00:04:19.269> so<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.139> first<00:04:20.380> shot<00:04:20.470> which<00:04:20.889> was

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
button so the first shot which was

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.430 
button so the first shot which was
showing<00:04:21.370> how<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:21.970> put<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.509> center<00:04:22.900> cap<00:04:23.259> on

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
showing how to put the center cap on

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.100 
showing how to put the center cap on
first<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.100> get<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.639> shims<00:04:24.880> right<00:04:25.210> is<00:04:25.539> missing

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
first and get the shims right is missing

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.800 
first and get the shims right is missing
it's<00:04:26.650> not<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.889> massive<00:04:27.250> issue<00:04:27.520> but<00:04:28.270> what<00:04:28.479> I<00:04:28.509> did

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
it's not a massive issue but what I did

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.140 
it's not a massive issue but what I did
first<00:04:29.110> was<00:04:29.410> put<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.160> center<00:04:30.669> bearing<00:04:30.880> in

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
first was put the center bearing in

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.510 
first was put the center bearing in
place<00:04:31.389> check<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.500> shims<00:04:32.770> that<00:04:33.039> I<00:04:33.070> need<00:04:33.310> and

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
place check the shims that I need and

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.820 
place check the shims that I need and
put<00:04:33.910> them<00:04:34.060> on<00:04:34.180> one<00:04:34.389> side<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:35.349> when<00:04:35.500> I<00:04:35.530> finally

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
put them on one side so when I finally

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.100 
put them on one side so when I finally
fit<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.310> center<00:04:36.699> bearing<00:04:37.090> it's<00:04:37.570> perfectly

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
fit the center bearing it's perfectly

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.249 
fit the center bearing it's perfectly
shimmed<00:04:39.000> not<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> big<00:04:40.270> problem<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.780> can<00:04:40.990> do<00:04:41.139> it

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
shimmed not a big problem you can do it

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.050 
shimmed not a big problem you can do it
last<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.620> all<00:04:41.770> but<00:04:41.949> it's<00:04:42.130> easy<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.580> do<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:42.789> first

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
last of all but it's easy to do it first

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.330 
last of all but it's easy to do it first
because<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.139> don't<00:04:44.169> have<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.680> interference

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
because you don't have the interference

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.339 
because you don't have the interference
of<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.520> two<00:04:45.759> bearings<00:04:46.210> at<00:04:46.389> each<00:04:46.539> end<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.020> you

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
of the two bearings at each end and you

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:48.900 
of the two bearings at each end and you
know<00:04:47.500> that<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.770> center<00:04:48.099> bearings<00:04:48.490> fit<00:04:48.759> is

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
know that the center bearings fit is

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.480 
know that the center bearings fit is
going<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.210> be<00:04:49.300> somewhere<00:04:49.720> near

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.760 

by<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.639> video<00:04:53.880> even<00:04:54.300> at<00:04:54.539> 10<00:04:54.750> times<00:04:54.930> speed<00:04:55.349> this

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
by the video even at 10 times speed this

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.100 
by the video even at 10 times speed this
cap<00:04:56.099> is<00:04:56.280> coming<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.759> and<00:04:56.940> off<00:04:57.030> like<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:57.479> yo-yo

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110

what<00:04:59.440> I<00:04:59.470> tend<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.980> do<00:05:00.160> if<00:05:00.400> I'm<00:05:00.550> making<00:05:00.760> shims<00:05:01.210> is

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
what I tend to do if I'm making shims is

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.820 
what I tend to do if I'm making shims is
I<00:05:01.570> make<00:05:01.780> them<00:05:01.960> like<00:05:02.110> I'm<00:05:02.290> showing<00:05:02.590> on<00:05:02.710> the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
I make them like I'm showing on the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.040 
I make them like I'm showing on the
video<00:05:03.060> instead<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.120> it<00:05:04.270> being<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.540> piece<00:05:04.900> of

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
video instead of it being a piece of

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.990 
video instead of it being a piece of
metal<00:05:05.230> with<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.590> hole<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:05.890> it<00:05:06.190> which<00:05:06.640> means<00:05:06.850> that

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
metal with a hole in it which means that

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.580 
metal with a hole in it which means that
you<00:05:07.180> have<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.450> take<00:05:07.660> off<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.990> entire<00:05:08.320> bedding

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
cap I cut a slot in my shims which means

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.920 
cap I cut a slot in my shims which means
that<00:05:12.040> you<00:05:12.130> can<00:05:12.280> just<00:05:12.430> lift<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.730> cap<00:05:13.030> thread

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
that you can just lift the cap thread

these<00:05:17.230> shims<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:17.740> I'm<00:05:17.890> making<00:05:18.370> a<00:05:18.550> very<00:05:18.910> very

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
these shims that I'm making a very very

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.100 
these shims that I'm making a very very
