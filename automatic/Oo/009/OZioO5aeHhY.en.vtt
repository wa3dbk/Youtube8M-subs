good crease there and you can also get
this<00:01:44.170> center<00:01:44.470> crease<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.950> helps<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.369> kind<00:01:45.520> of

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
this center crease it helps to kind of

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.999 
this center crease it helps to kind of
know<00:01:45.939> so<00:01:46.329> that<00:01:46.540> you<00:01:46.750> can<00:01:46.930> then<00:01:47.049> make<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.860> next

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
know so that you can then make the next

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.620 
know so that you can then make the next
step<00:01:48.549> a<00:01:48.579> little<00:01:48.850> easier<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:49.180> can<00:01:49.479> go<00:01:49.570> ahead

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
step a little easier you can go ahead

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.929 
step a little easier you can go ahead
and<00:01:49.719> fold<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:50.140> too<00:01:50.460> then<00:01:51.460> just<00:01:51.670> go<00:01:51.729> ahead<00:01:51.790> and

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
and fold that too then just go ahead and

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.060 
and fold that too then just go ahead and
fold<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.240> down<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.630> that<00:01:52.750> we<00:01:52.840> say<00:01:53.680> goodbye<00:01:54.009> to

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
fold it down so that we say goodbye to

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
that little logo there and then we've

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.679 
that little logo there and then we've
got<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.280> like<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.000> here<00:01:58.270> with<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.420> little

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
got it like this here with a little

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.420 
got it like this here with a little
window<00:01:58.960> at<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.110> top<00:01:59.320> I'm<00:01:59.860> just<00:01:59.920> going<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.250> take

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
window at the top I'm just going to take

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.340 
window at the top I'm just going to take
the<00:02:00.610> side<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.119> fold<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.659> in<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.140> center

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
the side and fold it in to the center

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.440 
the side and fold it in to the center
and<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.009> might<00:02:03.280> wind<00:02:03.610> up<00:02:03.729> needing<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.119> kind<00:02:04.390> of

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
and you might wind up needing to kind of

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.240 
and you might wind up needing to kind of
adjust<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:04.990> as<00:02:05.229> we<00:02:05.380> go<00:02:05.590> you're<00:02:05.890> going<00:02:06.039> to<00:02:06.100> be

adjust this as we go you're going to be

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.160 
adjust this as we go you're going to be
basically<00:02:06.840> popping<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:07.990> open<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:10.020> doing<00:02:11.020> a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
basically popping this open and doing a

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.990 
basically popping this open and doing a
squash<00:02:11.500> fold<00:02:11.530> as<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.040> smushed<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.520> out<00:02:12.670> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
squash fold as you smushed it out and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
you want to try to get this as close to

first and then kind of push this out and
try<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> get<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.480> as<00:02:21.660> close<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:22.200> accurate<00:02:22.800> as

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
try to get this as close to accurate as

try to get this as close to accurate as
well<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.000> kind<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.209> play<00:02:24.450> around<00:02:24.480> with

well you can kind of play around with

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.479 
well you can kind of play around with
adjusting<00:02:25.470> some<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.040> need<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.250> as

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.940 

and<00:02:37.380> then<00:02:38.280> open<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.209> up<00:02:39.390> as<00:02:39.569> well<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.989> want

and then open that up as well you want
to<00:02:41.100> try<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.730> course<00:02:42.000> get<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:43.260> know<00:02:43.380> this

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
pulled over as close to the center as

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.140 
pulled over as close to the center as
you<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.769> might<00:02:46.950> need<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.280> readjust<00:02:47.550> some

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
you can you might need to readjust some

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.380 
you can you might need to readjust some
creases<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.989> little<00:02:49.410> bit<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.800> do<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.239> but<00:02:51.239> you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
creases a little bit to do that but you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.870 
creases a little bit to do that but you
should<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.780> able<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.319> also<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.370> course<00:02:53.400> get

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
should be able and also of course get

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.710 
should be able and also of course get
that<00:02:54.030> as<00:02:54.209> lined<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:54.810> as<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.080> can<00:02:55.290> there<00:02:55.500> too

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
and sometimes there's a little bit of

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.550 
and sometimes there's a little bit of
extra<00:02:59.580> paper<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.360> kind<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.660> shifts<00:03:01.200> because

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
extra paper that kind of shifts because

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.559 
extra paper that kind of shifts because
of<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.739> way<00:03:01.830> things<00:03:02.069> are<00:03:02.340> put<00:03:02.880> together<00:03:03.090> but

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
of the way things are put together but

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.120 
of the way things are put together but
you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.750> try<00:03:04.110> your<00:03:04.290> best<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.620> kind<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> give

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
you can try your best to kind of give

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.979 
you can try your best to kind of give
things<00:03:05.489> like<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.819> said<00:03:06.209> kind<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.569> line<00:03:06.750> together

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
things like I said kind of line together

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.960 
things like I said kind of line together
here<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:08.250> in<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.459> end<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.670> should<00:03:08.730> get

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
here but in the end you should get

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.039 
here but in the end you should get
something<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.390> kinda<00:03:09.569> looks<00:03:09.720> like<00:03:09.780> this

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
something that kinda looks like this

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.420 
something that kinda looks like this
which<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.739> sort<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.950> one<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.250> fun

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
which is just sort of one of the fun

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.449 
which is just sort of one of the fun
little<00:03:11.700> designs<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.510> house<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.370> like<00:03:14.370> I

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
little designs for the house and like I

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.190 
little designs for the house and like I
said<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:14.940> get<00:03:15.390> all<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.630> other<00:03:15.750> patterns

said you can get all the other patterns

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.780 
said you can get all the other patterns
that<00:03:16.319> we<00:03:16.470> have<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.860> other<00:03:16.980> two<00:03:17.190> patterns<00:03:17.670> we

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
that we have the other two patterns we

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.280 
that we have the other two patterns we
have<00:03:17.910> online<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.569> know<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.080> they'll<00:03:19.230> be

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
have online and know that they'll be

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.370 
have online and know that they'll be
more<00:03:19.620> even<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.100> come<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.750> that's<00:03:21.750> kind<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.140> our
