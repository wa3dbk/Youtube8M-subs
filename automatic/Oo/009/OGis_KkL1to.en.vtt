00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.710
 hello to all boys it is nice about this 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.169
 brand new video today I'm here for 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.909
 tell you about windows 10 and what it does 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.429
 I think I wrote it on the facebook page 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.349
 if you wanted a video just where 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.070
 I was talking about this new system 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.410
 operative came out on July 29th and I have it 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.749
 tried these days and I have to say 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.240
 I really do n't like that 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.279
 no bugs found so far and there 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.679
 have been improvements over 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.840
 windows 8.1 that I liked 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.090
 really really much as per 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.739
 example the non-presence of the m yes 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.109
 because the presence of the metro was 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.449
 really an annoying thing for some 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.440
 maybe it was easier to reach them 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.809
 various applications 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.730
 the various programs and everything made the 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.010
 computer as if it were a device 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.949
 mobile thing that the computer just does not 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.370
 it's improvements in windows 10 we can 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.769
 see microsof and a revolution of 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.829
 browser system that internet explorer 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.199
 can make a screen and draw 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.680
 on the portan script will be yours 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.140
 system assistant then if per 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.600
 example of you look for me on the internet 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.370
 something she is looking for you this is one 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.650
 which we have also seen on 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.700
 siri or even in devices 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.010
 Android 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.690
 we have this voice assistant we'll see 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.910
 in another video better how it works 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.690
 there is precisely this possibility of the 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.690
 start menu 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.330
 the start menu returns this possibility 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.740
 to have the m a little m we say 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.690
 inside the start menu and this is 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.450
 really a good thing because it is not 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.190
 absolutely worthy explores file e 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.700
 we can access directly from the menu 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.460
 start 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.510
 we can access the settings 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.670
 stop all apps 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.950
 this is a new thing we all have 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.770
 app adds the recent this thing 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.970
 we also see the windows mobile systems 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.070
 there is the possibility to the whole 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.060
 act with xbox and there will be precisely 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.910
 facilities with windows and xbox 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.830
 one is definitely that we have the room 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.040
 and we have the possibility of 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.790
 register through ours ours 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.560
 computer 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.140
 in this case a laptop computer etc. 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.020
 to the webcam but if it is not equipped with a webcam 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.720
 and we use a fixed pc normally 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.630
 therefore it should not occur 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.930
 have a camera attached to ours 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.820
 pc 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.430
 this was something that not that not 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.680
 all brought to the point have however it is 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.420
 then integrated into windows one thing 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.310
 really fantastic because maybe who 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.920
 wants to record directly on windows 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.380
 sense to use external software you can 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.940
 record and really good rose 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.950
 we have the store we can 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.690
 buy candy crush applications 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.160
 also hungry here on windows 10 e 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.209
 we also have the opportunity to look 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.030
 news such as sports trips etc. 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.650
 download skype the skype and I am there 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.170
 many other things many others 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.970
 applications already installed food and 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.130
 health drink wellness yes this no 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.470
 maybe the news there is 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.870
 directly on windows 10 another thing 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.880
 we have the notification bar on 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.400
 right thing that was already there and we can here 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.560
 have south to manage all the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.200
 connections directly via the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.700
 our notification bar then the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.220
 same thing that we also find on 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.930
 android or ios or on windows phone by 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.420
 be able to easily access these 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.540
 disable or enable connections 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.209
 the bluetooth location is all there is 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.320
 also the tablet mode and activates the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.900
 meter as there was on windows 8 and 8.1 yes 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.489
 active at the meter and precisely it works 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.720
 like a tablet like I already said 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.430
 first it works 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.380
 precisely like a tablet a 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.720
 mobile device things I hate 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.640
 precisely it is a light and 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.920
 an operating system that respects 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.810
 to the previous versions anyway 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.510
 I advise everyone to install it 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.459
 update your your system e 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.930
 although really really well done and 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.050
 here too we have the bar of 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.780
 instruments and notes of the 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.090
 shortcuts of the programs that really 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.370
 well done now remember the old man 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.040
