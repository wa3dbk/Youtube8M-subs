00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
comparison video I have to say was a bit

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.000 
comparison video I have to say was a bit
bias<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:15.480> lot<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> things<00:00:16.230> i<00:00:16.440> did<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.740> wrong

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
bias and a lot of things i did get wrong

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
bias and a lot of things i did get wrong
and<00:00:17.369> now<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.210> me<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> year<00:00:18.660> later<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.050> lot<00:00:19.439> of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
and now it's me a year later a lot of

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.200 
and now it's me a year later a lot of
 has<00:00:19.949> changed<00:00:20.460> within<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> gaming

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
 has changed within the gaming

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.450 
 has changed within the gaming
industry<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.439> i<00:00:22.470> think<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.100> high<00:00:23.430> time

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
industry and so i think it is high time

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.390 
industry and so i think it is high time
for<00:00:23.730> another<00:00:24.150> price<00:00:24.900> comparison<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.800> so

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
for another price comparison and so

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.240 
for another price comparison and so

experience<00:05:41.850> you're<00:05:42.420> going<00:05:42.750> to<00:05:42.900> need<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.230> have

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
experience you're going to need to have

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.380 
experience you're going to need to have
to<00:05:44.100> move<00:05:44.310> controllers<00:05:44.970> per<00:05:45.390> person<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.010> so

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
to move controllers per person and so

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.300 
to move controllers per person and so
that<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.350> to<00:05:49.440> move<00:05:49.680> control<00:05:49.980> out<00:05:50.130> some

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
that and so to move control out some

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.360 
that and so to move control out some
extra<00:05:50.790> bucks<00:05:50.970> so<00:05:51.150> that<00:05:51.300> equals<00:05:51.570> on<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.830> 360

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
extra bucks so that equals on the 360

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.390 
extra bucks so that equals on the 360
for<00:05:53.700> 360<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.840> reason<00:05:55.170> why<00:05:55.290> it's<00:05:55.500> 370<00:05:56.220> on<00:05:56.310> the

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
for 360 the reason why it's 370 on the

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.070 
for 360 the reason why it's 370 on the
wii<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:56.610> ps3<00:05:56.910> is<00:05:57.150> because<00:05:57.390> you<00:05:57.510> have<00:05:57.540> to<00:05:57.870> order

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
wii and ps3 is because you have to order

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.160 
wii and ps3 is because you have to order
a<00:05:58.230> disc<00:05:58.680> for<00:05:58.980> and<00:05:59.730> it's<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.390> free<00:06:00.600> disk<00:06:00.840> but<00:06:01.110> you

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
a disc for and it's a free disk but you

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.390 
a disc for and it's a free disk but you
stopped<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.410> base<00:06:01.620> shipping<00:06:01.920> and<00:06:02.040> handling

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
stopped the base shipping and handling

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.820 
stopped the base shipping and handling
so<00:06:02.820> I<00:06:02.850> just<00:06:03.150> averaged<00:06:03.540> it<00:06:03.750> out<00:06:03.900> at<00:06:04.080> ten<00:06:04.380> dollars

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
so I just averaged it out at ten dollars

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.280 
so I just averaged it out at ten dollars
so<00:06:05.100> it's<00:06:05.640> about<00:06:05.820> ten<00:06:06.360> is<00:06:06.570> about<00:06:06.900> ten<00:06:07.170> dollars

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
so it's about ten is about ten dollars

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.930 
so it's about ten is about ten dollars
shipping<00:06:07.560> so<00:06:07.860> I<00:06:07.920> just<00:06:08.070> add<00:06:08.250> ten<00:06:08.490> bucks<00:06:08.670> so

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
shipping so I just add ten bucks so

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.630 
shipping so I just add ten bucks so
