but but yeah but the garden looks kind

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.310 
but but yeah but the garden looks kind
of<00:00:15.150> about<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> same<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:15.780> maybe<00:00:15.929> these<00:00:16.080> beds

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
of about the same with maybe these beds

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.470 
of about the same with maybe these beds
have<00:00:16.500> just<00:00:16.680> gotten<00:00:16.859> super<00:00:17.220> huge<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:17.880> for<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
have just gotten super huge but for the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.970 
have just gotten super huge but for the
first<00:00:18.660> time<00:00:18.810> well<00:00:19.230> not<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.560> first<00:00:19.770> time

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
first time well not for the first time

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.099 
first time well not for the first time
but<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.670> probably<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> times

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
but this is probably one of the times

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.689 
but this is probably one of the times
that<00:00:22.230> I've<00:00:22.380> had<00:00:22.560> probably<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> most<00:00:23.369> red

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
that I've had probably the most red

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.240 
that I've had probably the most red
tomatoes<00:00:24.150> set<00:00:24.510> at<00:00:24.689> any<00:00:24.750> given<00:00:25.740> particular

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
time and the rest of the stuffs kind of

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.929 
time and the rest of the stuffs kind of
normal<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:28.349> i<00:00:28.650> think<00:00:29.130> i<00:00:29.220> actually<00:00:29.429> will<00:00:29.730> get

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
normal but i think i actually will get

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.130 
normal but i think i actually will get
through<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.150> quickly<00:00:30.449> i'm<00:00:30.689> going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.990> say

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
through this quickly i'm going to say

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.810 
through this quickly i'm going to say

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
that let's see if it's under five

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.180 
that let's see if it's under five
minutes<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.450> would<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.660> miraculous<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.500> but

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
minutes that would be miraculous so but
