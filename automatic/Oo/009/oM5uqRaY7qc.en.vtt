00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.290
 tell yourself the fence is a project of the 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.150
 technique 3 that includes various 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.830
 activities in which you are looking for 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.650
 raise funds for the perimeter fence 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.870
 of the institution since it is necessary 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.420
 rebuild it in its entirety and the 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.750
 costs amounting to approximately 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.000
 million pesos now already new because the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.700
 that we already have represents a danger 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.860
 for our boys and for the pro for 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.720
 the citizens themselves who are outside 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.120
 from the campus thanks we have not had 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.239
 the results that we expected 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.420
 we are not missing some activities 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.070
 we aim to gather a 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.899
 million pesos that is what it costs the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.540
 reconstruction of all this fence 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.480
 perimeter is a very large school 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.300
 much land logically is a wall 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.480
 very big then we need a 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.280
 million pesos that if we believe that with 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.770
 the activities that we lack 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.990
 throw to walk 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.050
 one of the activities that make the 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.840
 next May 31 is a race of 5 and 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.460
 10 kilometers as well as a walk this 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.830
 sports activity that leads as 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.350
 name runs and flies from the wall not only 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.390
 seeks to generate funds but to promote 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.860
 school coexistence and participation 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.420
 of athletes from the region 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.700
 this is run and flyer the fence is a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.730
 activity that we are also leading to 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.070
 out with inviting all the dads of 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.680
 the school of all the children of the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.970
 both shifts so that we have the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.400
 opportunity to cooperate apart 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.800
 the opportunity to live with children 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.260
 they need that and this is a good 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.140
 opportunity and logically whoever 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.940
 register you will be entitled to a good 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.300
 T-shirt with all the recommendations 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.380
 that athletes do not demand or 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.790
 demand and that the company knows and is going to 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.300
 also have a chip that to make 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.009
 so that everything is very very straight from 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.070
 let it be known that it has really run 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.590
 in the times and logically there will be 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.239
 a medal for all the all the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.430
 people who come to register the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.890
 date is May 31 at 8 o'clock in the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.099
 tomorrow we leave here the school goes 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.090
 to be this race 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.910
 practically in all the streets 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.800
 centric of xalapa that's why it's going to be a 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.040
 colorful career that's why it's going to be a 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.510
 good successful career and maybe it 's the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.849
 first race that we make of the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.739
 technical 3 of many that will come after 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.010
 what interests us a lot is to be given 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.690
 this this race does not have to leave what 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.629
 we know that he is going to leave something that is going to 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.730
 help for the truth but I feel for 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.560
 the other side more important I feel what 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.140
 more important the coexistence that 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.990
 have with 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.410
