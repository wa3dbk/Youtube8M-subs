to any cellular dermal matrix and I know

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.480 
to any cellular dermal matrix and I know
that<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.300> sort<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.539> abstract<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.490> my

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that it's sort of abstract so my

videographer is going to show you today
what<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.210> about<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.690> we're<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
what it's all about so we're going to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.370 
what it's all about so we're going to
focus<00:00:34.140> down<00:00:34.469> over<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.480> in

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
focus down over here and you can see in

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.920 
focus down over here and you can see in
this<00:00:37.590> illustration<00:00:38.149> that<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:39.809> we

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
this illustration that this is what we

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.380 
this illustration that this is what we
have<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> acellular<00:00:41.399> dermal<00:00:41.550> matrix<00:00:41.969> this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
have as a acellular dermal matrix this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.979 
have as a acellular dermal matrix this
is<00:00:42.540> actually<00:00:42.840> human<00:00:43.200> tissue<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.750> and<00:00:45.750> it's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
is actually human tissue here and it's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.900 
is actually human tissue here and it's
treated<00:00:46.879> chemically<00:00:47.930> among<00:00:48.930> other<00:00:49.140> ways<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
treated chemically among other ways to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.290 
treated chemically among other ways to
reduce<00:00:50.910> its<00:00:52.010> potential<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.039> reaction<00:00:53.879> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
reduce its potential for reaction so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.959 
reduce its potential for reaction so
it's<00:00:54.750> actually<00:00:54.989> well<00:00:55.350> suited<00:00:55.860> for<00:00:55.940> human<00:00:56.940> use

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it's actually well suited for human use

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
it's actually well suited for human use
I've<00:00:57.780> been<00:00:57.930> using<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.320> probably<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.890> about

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
I've been using this probably for about

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.729 
I've been using this probably for about
six<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.340> seven<00:00:59.670> years<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.899> comes<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.379> various

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
six or seven years it comes in various

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.390 
six or seven years it comes in various
thickness<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.940> very<00:01:03.629> strong<00:01:04.250> it's<00:01:05.250> very

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
thickness it's very strong it's very

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.060 
thickness it's very strong it's very
pliable<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.869> see<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> grab<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
pliable you can see when I grab it and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.450 
pliable you can see when I grab it and
has<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> lot<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.270> resistance<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.950> use

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
has a lot of resistance and what I use

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
has a lot of resistance and what I use
this<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> secondary<00:01:12.600> surgery<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.260> all

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
this for in secondary surgery not all

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.249 
this for in secondary surgery not all
cases<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.729> certain<00:01:14.970> cases<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.810> found<00:01:16.110> that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
cases but in certain cases I found that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.670 
cases but in certain cases I found that
this<00:01:16.409> material<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.580> almost<00:01:17.850> indispensable<00:01:18.680> it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
this material is almost indispensable it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
this material is almost indispensable it
really<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.180> incredible<00:01:21.180> how<00:01:21.299> it's

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
really is incredible how it's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.140 
really is incredible how it's
revolutionized<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.890> results<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:24.000> been

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
revolutionized the results it's been

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.820 
revolutionized the results it's been
shown<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.570> some<00:01:24.720> studies<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.200> reduce<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
shown in some studies to reduce the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.230 
shown in some studies to reduce the
incidence<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> capsular<00:01:26.580> contracture<00:01:27.060> which

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
incidence of capsular contracture which

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.870 
incidence of capsular contracture which
happens<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.520> most<00:01:29.520> common

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
happens to be the most common

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.710 
happens to be the most common
complication<00:01:31.250> when<00:01:32.250> breast<00:01:32.850> implants<00:01:33.329> are

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
complication when breast implants are

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.960 
complication when breast implants are
used<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.500> usually<00:01:34.829> becomes<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.520> sheets

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
used this usually becomes in sheets

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.020 
used this usually becomes in sheets
these<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.229> already<00:01:38.009> been<00:01:38.130> cut<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
these this has already been cut up and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940 
these this has already been cut up and
used<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.360> pieces<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.110> these<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.770> little

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
used in pieces so these are just little

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
used in pieces so these are just little
pieces<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> residual<00:01:42.030> tissue<00:01:42.240> that's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
pieces of the residual tissue that's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.109 
pieces of the residual tissue that's
left<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.159> I'll<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.670> I'll<00:01:44.820> pass<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
left but what I'll do is I'll pass a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
left but what I'll do is I'll pass a
needle<00:01:45.659> through<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.110> tissue<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.860> then

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
needle through this tissue and then

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.039 
needle through this tissue and then
secure<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.090> something<00:01:48.479> else<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
secure it to something else like the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.030 
secure it to something else like the
muscle<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.009> really<00:01:50.310> does<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> great<00:01:50.790> job<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
muscle and it really does a great job of

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.520 
muscle and it really does a great job of
adding<00:01:53.040> strength<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.060> cover<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.750> really

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
adding strength and in cover and really

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.020 
adding strength and in cover and really
addressing<00:01:55.920> some<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> fundamental

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
addressing some of the fundamental

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.230 
addressing some of the fundamental
issues<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:58.159> with<00:01:59.159> secondary<00:01:59.969> breast

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
issues that we see with secondary breast

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.080 
issues that we see with secondary breast
surgeries<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.680> again<00:02:02.490> thin<00:02:03.649> tough<00:02:05.090> natural

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
surgeries so again thin tough natural

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.630 
surgeries so again thin tough natural

sometimes<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.179> humans<00:02:08.600> sometimes<00:02:08.899> it's

sometimes it's humans sometimes it's

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.559 
sometimes it's humans sometimes it's
pigskin<00:02:09.710> and<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:09.950> suppose<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.520> future<00:02:10.850> will<00:02:11.480> be

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
pigskin and I suppose the future will be

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.230 
pigskin and I suppose the future will be
more<00:02:11.780> synthetic<00:02:12.250> varieties<00:02:13.250> where<00:02:13.490> it's<00:02:14.090> not

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
more synthetic varieties where it's not

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.660 
more synthetic varieties where it's not
coming<00:02:14.510> from<00:02:14.630> any<00:02:14.870> animal<00:02:15.650> source<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:16.430> just

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
coming from any animal source but just

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.090 
coming from any animal source but just
basically<00:02:17.209> out<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.930> laboratory<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:18.980> we're

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
basically out of a laboratory but we're

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.309 
basically out of a laboratory but we're
not<00:02:19.220> quite<00:02:19.400> there<00:02:19.459> yet<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.569> hope<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.900> helps

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
not quite there yet so I hope this helps

not quite there yet so I hope this helps
