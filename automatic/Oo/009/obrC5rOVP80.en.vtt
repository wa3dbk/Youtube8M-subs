00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
there is a little bit tricky compared to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
there is a little bit tricky compared to
the<00:00:50.280> rest<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> cupcake<00:00:51.270> only<00:00:52.230> because

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the rest of the cupcake only because

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.010 
the rest of the cupcake only because
they<00:00:52.860> need<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> stand<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.750> need<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
they need to stand up and they need to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.560 
they need to stand up and they need to
have<00:00:55.140> tylose<00:00:55.620> powder<00:00:55.670> in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> actual<00:00:57.120> fondant

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
have tylose powder in the actual fondant

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.590 
have tylose powder in the actual fondant

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so when you get a little section off to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.770 
so when you get a little section off to
knead<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.649> pink<00:01:01.859> part<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.000> add<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
knead the pink part in you just add the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.520 
knead the pink part in you just add the
timer's<00:01:04.439> powder<00:01:04.739> which<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:06.350> it's<00:01:07.350> white

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
timer's powder which is it's white

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.399 
timer's powder which is it's white
powder<00:01:07.830> here

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
powder here

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.020 
powder here
it's<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> strengthening<00:01:11.040> agent<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.610> makes<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's a strengthening agent it makes the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.050 
it's a strengthening agent it makes the
fondant<00:01:12.590> harder<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.400> dries<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.880> sets

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
fondant harder so it dries it sets

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.740 
fondant harder so it dries it sets
harder<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.720> doesn't<00:01:16.130> collapse<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.490> would

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
harder so doesn't collapse as it would

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.789 
harder so doesn't collapse as it would
if<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.049> using<00:01:19.229> normal<00:01:19.470> fondant<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
if you're just using normal fondant that

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.170
