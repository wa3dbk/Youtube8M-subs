terrible<00:05:07.229> on<00:05:07.410> there<00:05:07.620> but<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.830> did<00:05:08.040> get<00:05:08.220> a

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
terrible on there but I did get a

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.760 
terrible on there but I did get a
blending<00:05:08.760> brush<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.030> hopefully<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.900> like<00:05:10.500> this

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
blending brush and hopefully I like this

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.560 
blending brush and hopefully I like this
but<00:05:11.070> from<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.460> looks<00:05:11.669> of<00:05:11.820> it<00:05:11.940> I<00:05:12.060> might<00:05:12.330> not

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
but from the looks of it I might not

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.020 
but from the looks of it I might not
because<00:05:12.900> it's<00:05:13.050> kind<00:05:13.260> of<00:05:13.290> flat<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.700> reminds

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
because it's kind of flat and it reminds

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.730 
because it's kind of flat and it reminds
me<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.210> like<00:05:15.360> an<00:05:15.510> eyeshadow<00:05:15.960> brush<00:05:16.229> I<00:05:16.380> so<00:05:16.560> yeah

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
me of like an eyeshadow brush I so yeah

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.590 
me of like an eyeshadow brush I so yeah
I<00:05:16.770> don't<00:05:16.979> really<00:05:17.280> like<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.610> brush<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.300> I'm

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
I don't really like that brush and I'm

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.400 
I don't really like that brush and I'm
probably<00:05:19.050> not<00:05:19.530> going<00:05:19.860> to<00:05:19.979> do<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.990> okay<00:05:21.990> so<00:05:22.229> I

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
probably not going to do it okay so I

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.670 
probably not going to do it okay so I
also<00:05:22.680> get<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.610> HD<00:05:24.360> concealer<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.560> I'm

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
also get the HD concealer and I'm

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.200 
also get the HD concealer and I'm
thinking<00:05:26.190> I'm<00:05:26.310> really<00:05:26.340> gonna<00:05:26.729> like<00:05:26.940> this

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
thinking I'm really gonna like this

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.490 
thinking I'm really gonna like this
because<00:05:27.690> it's<00:05:27.930> in<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.140> color

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
because it's in a color

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.500 
because it's in a color
Casilla<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.520> don't<00:05:29.820> really<00:05:30.030> have<00:05:30.300> and

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
it's this like light color but it's

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.610 
it's this like light color but it's
really<00:05:34.470> pretty<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:36.050> like<00:05:37.050> it's<00:05:37.260> coming<00:05:37.500> up

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
really pretty and like it's coming up

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
brighter than what it really is on

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.870 
brighter than what it really is on
camera<00:05:39.570> but<00:05:39.720> this<00:05:39.840> is<00:05:40.020> in<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.289> color<00:05:40.500> medium

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880

like<00:06:02.490> using<00:06:02.820> elf<00:06:03.210> pictures<00:06:03.690> because<00:06:04.220> the

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
like using elf pictures because the

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.070 
like using elf pictures because the
reason<00:06:05.580> why<00:06:05.669> I<00:06:05.700> got<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.060> medium<00:06:06.419> concealer

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
reason why I got the medium concealer

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.600 
reason why I got the medium concealer
was<00:06:07.200> because<00:06:07.500> I<00:06:07.620> said<00:06:07.800> it<00:06:07.919> was<00:06:08.039> a<00:06:08.190> little<00:06:08.520> bit

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
was because I said it was a little bit

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.740 
was because I said it was a little bit
it<00:06:08.729> looked<00:06:08.940> a<00:06:09.090> bit<00:06:09.120> darker<00:06:09.810> on<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:11.419> photo<00:06:12.419> that
