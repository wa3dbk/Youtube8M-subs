Nolan's trilogy started and apparently

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.520 
Nolan's trilogy started and apparently
it<00:00:55.739> carried<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:57.090> Victor<00:00:58.050> Zsasz<00:00:58.170> has<00:00:58.350> never

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it carried on so Victor Zsasz has never

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.229 
it carried on so Victor Zsasz has never
hit<00:00:58.739> man<00:00:58.890> he<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.370> always<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.640> crazy<00:00:59.940> serial

killer

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
killer

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.260 
killer
period<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.100> Dark<00:01:02.340> Knight<00:01:02.460> mentioned<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
period the Dark Knight mentioned it that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509 
period the Dark Knight mentioned it that
he<00:01:03.449> was<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> crazy<00:01:03.899> guy<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
he was the crazy guy that in the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.210 
he was the crazy guy that in the
courtroom<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> first<00:01:06.479> Batman<00:01:07.170> Begins<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
courtroom in the first Batman Begins so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
courtroom in the first Batman Begins so
I<00:01:08.250> guess<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.729> trend<00:01:09.210> has<00:01:09.450> kind<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> carried

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
I guess that trend has kind of carried

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.649 
I guess that trend has kind of carried
on<00:01:10.580> however<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.150> mind<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.570> don't

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
