a bunch of candy um you can find them

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.359 
a bunch of candy um you can find them
pretty<00:00:21.869> much<00:00:22.080> anywhere<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:23.220> you're

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
pretty much anywhere and then you're

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.450 
pretty much anywhere and then you're
gonna<00:00:23.460> put<00:00:23.820> some<00:00:24.180> sugar<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.750> your<00:00:24.840> plate<00:00:25.460> just

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
gonna put some sugar on your plate just

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.679 
gonna put some sugar on your plate just
to<00:00:26.609> make<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.789> easier<00:00:27.240> when<00:00:27.359> you're<00:00:27.510> cutting

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
to make it easier when you're cutting

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.779 
to make it easier when you're cutting
the<00:00:27.960> orange<00:00:28.289> slice<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.160> doesn't<00:00:29.369> stick<00:00:29.580> and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the orange slice so it doesn't stick and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.310 
the orange slice so it doesn't stick and
then<00:00:30.330> you're<00:00:30.420> gonna<00:00:30.510> cut<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> orange<00:00:31.170> slice

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
then you're gonna cut the orange slice

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.049 
then you're gonna cut the orange slice
into<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> triangle<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.460> will<00:00:32.610> see<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
into a triangle which you will see in a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.520 
into a triangle which you will see in a
second<00:00:35.600> yeah<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.930> look<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
second yeah so it look like that and

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.190 
second yeah so it look like that and
they're<00:00:37.770> gonna<00:00:37.829> cut<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.700> half

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
they're gonna cut that in half

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.780 
they're gonna cut that in half
vertically<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.860> you'll<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.190> two<00:00:41.430> triangles

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
vertically so you'll have two triangles

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.360 
vertically so you'll have two triangles
and<00:00:42.260> you're<00:00:43.260> pretty<00:00:43.410> much<00:00:43.530> gonna<00:00:43.890> take<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and you're pretty much gonna take one of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130 
and you're pretty much gonna take one of
the<00:00:44.520> triangles<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.570> cut<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.110> half

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the triangles and then cut that in half

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.650 
the triangles and then cut that in half
again<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.760> you'll<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.030> two<00:00:48.329> really

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
again so then you'll have two really

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.040 
again so then you'll have two really
long<00:00:48.960> triangles<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.480> then<00:00:51.480> gonna<00:00:51.629> take<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
long triangles and then gonna take the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
long triangles and then gonna take the
two<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.469> you're<00:00:52.949> kind<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.399> gonna<00:00:53.550> start

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
two and you're kind of just gonna start

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.229 
two and you're kind of just gonna start
pinching<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.340> forming<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.550> into<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
pinching and forming them into like the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
pinching and forming them into like the
beak<00:00:57.449> shape<00:00:57.750> um<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.770> really<00:00:58.859> hard<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
beak shape um it's really hard to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
beak shape um it's really hard to
explain<00:00:59.520> you're<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.059> gonna<00:01:00.180> try<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.840> best

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
explain you're just gonna try your best

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.500 
explain you're just gonna try your best
to<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.739> sort<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.190> eye<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> pretty<00:01:03.090> much<00:01:03.210> I'm

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to just sort of eye it pretty much I'm

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.469 
to just sort of eye it pretty much I'm
just<00:01:04.500> making<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.309> beat<00:01:05.610> shape<00:01:05.880> by<00:01:06.030> pinching

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
just making to a beat shape by pinching

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.880 
just making to a beat shape by pinching
it<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.200> should<00:01:07.290> look<00:01:07.560> something<00:01:07.770> like

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it and it should look something like

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010 
it and it should look something like
that<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:09.000> you're<00:01:09.150> gonna<00:01:09.240> take<00:01:09.540> some<00:01:09.600> red

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that and then you're gonna take some red

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.740 
that and then you're gonna take some red
frosting<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.280> tinted<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.850> food<00:01:12.119> dye<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
frosting that I tinted with food dye and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.990 
frosting that I tinted with food dye and
then<00:01:13.380> you're<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.490> pretty<00:01:14.640> much<00:01:14.729> just

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
then you're going to pretty much just

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.520 
then you're going to pretty much just
frost<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.540> cupcake<00:01:15.960> um<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:19.170> don't<00:01:19.290> want<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
sugar I'm using the Wilton and it pretty

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.940 
sugar I'm using the Wilton and it pretty
much<00:01:39.869> looks<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.740> find

full<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.579> sugar<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> optional<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:50.909> I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
full of the sugar this is optional but I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.069 
full of the sugar this is optional but I
think<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.360> looks<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.659> lot<00:01:51.780> better<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:54.079> then

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
think it looks a lot better and then

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.789 
think it looks a lot better and then
you're<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.759> pretty<00:01:57.719> much<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.930> scrape
