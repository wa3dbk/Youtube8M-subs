you how to create a bootable USB flash

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.660 
you how to create a bootable USB flash
drive<00:00:06.029> using<00:00:06.660> command<00:00:07.049> prompt<00:00:07.410> only<00:00:07.680> here<00:00:08.550> I'm

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
drive using command prompt only here I'm

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.089 
drive using command prompt only here I'm
creating<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.150> Windows<00:00:09.510> 7<00:00:09.660> bootable<00:00:10.110> USB<00:00:10.260> for

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
creating a Windows 7 bootable USB for

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.030 
creating a Windows 7 bootable USB for
Windows<00:00:11.340> XP<00:00:11.460> Vista<00:00:12.450> or<00:00:12.660> Windows<00:00:12.780> 8<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.769> steps

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
Windows XP Vista or Windows 8 the steps

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.730 
Windows XP Vista or Windows 8 the steps
are<00:00:14.309> exactly<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.059> same<00:00:15.199> so<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> steps<00:00:16.560> on

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
are exactly the same so the steps on

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.040 
are exactly the same so the steps on
first<00:00:17.100> plug<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.760> your<00:00:17.850> USB<00:00:17.940> flash<00:00:18.300> drive<00:00:18.869> into

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
first plug in your USB flash drive into

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.460 
first plug in your USB flash drive into
computer<00:00:19.880> here<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.939> am<00:00:21.119> plug<00:00:21.359> into<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:21.960> flash

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
computer here I am plug into my flash

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.029 
computer here I am plug into my flash
drive<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:24.320> don't<00:00:25.320> forget<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.680> backup<00:00:25.859> your

any existing data stored on it because

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.200 
any existing data stored on it because
when<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.740> perform<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> steps<00:00:29.699> we'll<00:00:30.029> be

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
when we perform the steps we'll be

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.540 
when we perform the steps we'll be
racing<00:00:30.420> everything<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.099> don't<00:00:32.309> forget

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you can see this 0 on disk 1 index 0 is

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.530 
you can see this 0 on disk 1 index 0 is
my<00:01:20.759> main<00:01:21.000> hard<00:01:21.299> drive

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
my main hard drive

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.070 
my main hard drive
and<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.740> my<00:01:23.009> USB<00:01:23.520> flash<00:01:23.820> drive<00:01:24.180> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and this one is my USB flash drive so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.780 
and this one is my USB flash drive so
here<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.409> am<00:01:25.470> selecting<00:01:26.040> disk<00:01:26.610> 1<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> type

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
here I am selecting disk 1 so type

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:37.069 
here I am selecting disk 1 so type
select<00:01:32.840> just<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.340> center<00:01:35.810> now<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> disk

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
select just one the center now the disk

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.460 
select just one the center now the disk
1<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> selected<00:01:38.570> then<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.810> want<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> clean<00:01:40.290> our

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
1 is selected then we want to clean our

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.969 
1 is selected then we want to clean our
decks

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
decks

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.510

so<00:01:41.430> type<00:01:42.060> clean<00:01:43.759> then<00:01:44.759> press<00:01:45.450> Enter<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
so type clean then press Enter so the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.740 
so type clean then press Enter so the
risk<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:47.820> succeed<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.329> cleaning<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> disk

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
risk for succeed in cleaning the disk

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.560 
risk for succeed in cleaning the disk
then<00:01:51.750> next<00:01:52.290> step<00:01:52.490> we<00:01:53.490> want<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.759> create<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.240> new

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
then next step we want to create a new

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.060 
then next step we want to create a new
partition<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.040> type<00:01:56.700> create<00:01:58.939> partition

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.200 

primary<00:02:05.610> create<00:02:06.610> partition<00:02:07.180> primary

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
primary create partition primary

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.580 
primary create partition primary
presenter<00:02:09.150> now<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:11.410> partition<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.130> created

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
presenter now the partition is created

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.030 
presenter now the partition is created
then<00:02:15.630> select<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.870> newly<00:02:17.110> created<00:02:17.560> partition

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
then select the newly created partition

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:27.570 
then select the newly created partition
for<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.210> type<00:02:19.780> select<00:02:21.030> partition<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:26.580> press

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
for that type select partition one press

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.990 
for that type select partition one press
enter<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:29.110> what<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.100> partition<00:02:30.490> one<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.820> now

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
enter so what the partition one is now

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.950 
enter so what the partition one is now
selected<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.760> next<00:02:34.090> step<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.390> format<00:02:34.840> in

selected then the next step is format in

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.700 
selected then the next step is format in
the<00:02:35.050> partition<00:02:35.350> for<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.010> type<00:02:36.960> format<00:02:39.120> FS

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710

here don't forget to type quick because
normal<00:02:54.120> format<00:02:54.420> will<00:02:54.570> take<00:02:54.840> probably<00:02:55.380> 5<00:02:55.710> to<00:02:55.950> 15

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
normal format will take probably 5 to 15

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.670 
normal format will take probably 5 to 15
or<00:02:56.700> 20<00:02:57.060> minutes<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.450> complete<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> click

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.330 
seconds ok the formatting is successful
next<00:03:15.450> step<00:03:15.570> is<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.410> want<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.650> act<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.100> the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
next step is you want to act you the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.950 
next step is you want to act you the
partition<00:03:18.000> for<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.750> type<00:03:19.260> active<00:03:20.960> press

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
partition for that type active press

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.260 
partition for that type active press
enter

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
enter

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.680 
enter
so<00:03:24.590> partition<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.680> active<00:03:26.250> then<00:03:27.120> we<00:03:27.540> can

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
so partition is active then we can

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.600 
so partition is active then we can
assign<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:28.080> drive<00:03:28.140> letter<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.770> this<00:03:28.890> USB<00:03:29.250> flash
