00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.129

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.150
 how the fuck what we call it I repeat it 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.460
 where you go with a train on the street 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.989
 as well as if it was a bus and it does not pass 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.820
 nothing nothing happens here as I am seeing 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.140

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.260
 that trains obviously go 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.990

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.610

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.030

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.440
