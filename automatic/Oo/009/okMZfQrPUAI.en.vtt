00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello people I'm here to start a new one 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.560
 pride channel 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.539
 so I'm a beginner and when we talk 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.279
 How does this work? 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.499
 I do not know how else to do it but I'm here. 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.949
 To tell you some products. 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:27.960
 I use my hair since the peti 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.619
 use on a whim 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.910
 a lot of people asked me to ah but the channel 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 shows how you take care of your 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.480
 hair 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.929
 How do you use it then after 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.449
 A lot of time I decided to do it so I'm 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:47.539
 Here to show you some. 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.539
 products that I use and that's it 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.510
 so let's start with the three creams 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.059
 that I use in my hair 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.730
 I do not like to use just one cream on the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.530
 hair accustomed and got accustomed and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.590
 ends up losing what makes me one 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.490
 rock where you leave me so I use this 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.700
 on here 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.140
 this is born here that argan oil and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.119
 oranges 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.229
 I think you've heard a lot 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.840
 his 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.820
 I really like him, I liked him more. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.440
 now they do not like it but I like it more 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.619
 because he leaves I think my hair 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.670
 looking eye use looks like light 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.950
 It seems that I'm wet. 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.289
 particularly do not look at what we want is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.420
 so I think hair leaving cream 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.780
 dry right 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.610
 So this one I like but it was already one of the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.310
 My favorites 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.759
 I really like dance ', which is the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.759
 collagen 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.569
 I 'm using it today. I like it. 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.520
 enough of it always use it and I think 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:03.179
 that gives a good set in my hair if 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 It's for the best that's the best. 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.420
 to me is a pretty setting it 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.880
 always hard I always leave my hair 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.830
 find from one day to another and this right 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.740
 here I did not like it he 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.900
 I was found at the pharmacy I do not even know. 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.010
 How I found it is I never heard 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.080
 talk about him 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.730
 I thought I liked this market a lot 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.830
 quite light 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.370
 I love him too but he's no good. 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.590
 leave your hair curly one day or another 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.349
 Your time has passed and your hair 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.599
 It's a good use, it's more to finish. 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.520
 when my grandfather're already I use but 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.319
 was finished in the boxes 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:47.700
 this college and the sides in the hair 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:50.760
 this here the argan oil these two 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.520
 here shampoo cream that I use to wash the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.530
 my hair but only twice a week 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.530
 This is more for hydration to open 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.670
 did not end up very dry and this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.470
 here I wear the pantene I 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.850
 use 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:12.920
 the normal day and if the hydration I use in the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:16.010
 day to day use when he is good the face 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.920
 them here that the use of time in 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:25.850
 when, at last, as I had spoken of 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:27.740
 jequiti and the professional is can vary 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.170
 plenty of shampoo and cream because I do not 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.910
 I really like to use the same thing as 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.940
 hair then becomes accustomed when the 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.940
 Hair usually look cool and also uses 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.130
 this here is my hair is blond too 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.900
 already it went much further than what 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.220
 has better known in it strictly use 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.959
 says yellow pain its hard already you know right? 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.770
 because this is for blond hair 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.900
 huh 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:56.060
 who makes the hair look brighter with a 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:00.290
 more lively style people do not use enough 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.730
 If you think I learned that karina 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.490
 but there are other brands also 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.610
 Good but I'm enough for what to 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:11.450
 the Frenchman will learn that 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.190
 I waited here is very good to take the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.419
 Front in cold weather but neighbors 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.820
 Do you know that the effort is taken and the place looks great? 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.100
 It is also something that the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.870
 my hair I learned 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.870
 You're not going to believe what you want. 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:37.040
 that is, but it is history that is not the 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.580
 Actually the blue blouse as a towel on my 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.820
 hair is subject in the sack made you 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.040
 can replace my hair instead 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.510
 to wear a towel wear this shirt to dry 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.960
 because the cotton towel is on the plug and 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.060
 the knit shirt that the knit she does not 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.130
 It's happy to have one day, I'll make one. 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.090
 video for you because the difference is not 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.520
 so I hope you 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.470
 liked any kitchen with its new 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.210
 I do not know how to use a normal 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.210
 I hope you liked a kiss.
