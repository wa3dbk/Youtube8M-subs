00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:19.989 
then the insides the outside so that's
where<00:01:17.270> I<00:01:17.299> messed<00:01:17.569> up<00:01:18.159> secondly<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:19.700> shouldn't

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
where I messed up secondly you shouldn't

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:21.730 
where I messed up secondly you shouldn't
be<00:01:20.090> using<00:01:20.240> ribbon<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.840> begin<00:01:21.109> with<00:01:21.289> because

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
be using ribbon to begin with because

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.059 
be using ribbon to begin with because
obviously<00:01:22.549> your<00:01:23.029> page<00:01:23.359> pages<00:01:24.170> are<00:01:24.469> going<00:01:24.649> to

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
obviously your page pages are going to

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.510 
obviously your page pages are going to
change<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.179> fluctuate<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.560> my<00:01:28.100> suggestion

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
change and fluctuate so my suggestion

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.580 
change and fluctuate so my suggestion
would<00:01:28.789> be<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:29.179> use<00:01:29.359> an<00:01:29.630> elastic<00:01:29.929> ribbon

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
would be to use an elastic ribbon

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.489 
would be to use an elastic ribbon

that<00:01:57.200> today<00:01:57.380> but<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:58.099> can<00:01:58.279> basically<00:01:58.459> take

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
that today but you can basically take

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.349 
that today but you can basically take
any<00:01:59.209> charm<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.020> want<00:02:00.259> for<00:02:00.529> example<00:02:00.560> and

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
any charm that you want for example and

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.419 
any charm that you want for example and
then<00:02:02.359> just<00:02:02.719> hang<00:02:02.929> it<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:03.439> like<00:02:03.770> there's<00:02:04.130> the

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
then just hang it so like there's the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.120 
then just hang it so like there's the
Mockingjay<00:02:05.079> and<00:02:06.079> I<00:02:06.169> can<00:02:06.319> put<00:02:06.469> a<00:02:06.499> chain<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.799> it

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
Mockingjay and I can put a chain on it

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.930 
Mockingjay and I can put a chain on it
and<00:02:07.340> hang<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:09.110> yeah<00:02:10.009> it's<00:02:10.429> not<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
and hang it so yeah it's not the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.330 
and hang it so yeah it's not the
cleanest<00:02:11.510> again<00:02:12.430> but

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
cleanest again but

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.510 
cleanest again but
let<00:02:14.580> me<00:02:14.670> show<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.910> how<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.300> looks<00:02:15.330> there<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:17.310> is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
let me show you how it looks there it is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.340 
let me show you how it looks there it is
textured<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.450> try<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.720> do<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:18.990> as<00:02:19.080> clean<00:02:19.319> as

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
textured and I try to do it as clean as

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.550 
textured and I try to do it as clean as
possible<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.400> again<00:02:21.060> use<00:02:21.510> an<00:02:21.750> elastic<00:02:22.050> ribbon

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
possible and again use an elastic ribbon

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.930 
possible and again use an elastic ribbon
so<00:02:23.100> if<00:02:23.430> all<00:02:23.640> else<00:02:23.850> fails<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.890> decide<00:02:26.280> why

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
so if all else fails and you decide why

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.850 
so if all else fails and you decide why
is<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.240> my<00:02:27.390> camera<00:02:27.720> focusing<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.319> you

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
is that my camera focusing and you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.380 
is that my camera focusing and you
decide<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.490> don't<00:02:29.610> want<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.940> use<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.090> as

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
decide that you don't want to use it as

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.150 
decide that you don't want to use it as
a<00:02:30.420> bookmark<00:02:30.690> although<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> think<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.800> cute

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
a bookmark although I think it's a cute

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.240 
a bookmark although I think it's a cute
idea<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:33.270> there's<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.380> piece<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.620> metal<00:02:34.920> right

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
idea and there's a piece of metal right

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.760 
idea and there's a piece of metal right
here<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.030> strong<00:02:36.660> heavy-duty<00:02:37.260> magnet

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
here and a strong heavy-duty magnet

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.690 
here and a strong heavy-duty magnet
there<00:02:38.010> what<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.209> do<00:02:39.390> instead<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.200> watch

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
there what you can do instead is watch

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:50.810 
there what you can do instead is watch
so<00:02:41.700> I'm<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.940> wrap<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.150> around<00:02:49.820> does

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
so I'm going to wrap it around does

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.020 
so I'm going to wrap it around does
anything<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.170> there's<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:56.030> you

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
anything to it so there's that and you

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.729 
anything to it so there's that and you
can<00:02:57.209> essentially<00:02:57.540> wear<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.989> as<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> bracelet<00:02:58.530> if

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
can essentially wear it as a bracelet if

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.009 
can essentially wear it as a bracelet if
you<00:02:58.800> wanted<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.489> as<00:02:59.640> well<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.870> book

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
inspiration off of this like I said the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.290 
inspiration off of this like I said the
basic<00:03:07.170> tools<00:03:07.470> I'm<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.069> list<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.090> downbar

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
basic tools I'm in a list in the downbar

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.229 
basic tools I'm in a list in the downbar
here<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.830> do<00:03:10.890> want<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.400> mention<00:03:11.760> two<00:03:11.970> very

here but I do want to mention two very

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.150 
here but I do want to mention two very
basic<00:03:12.510> things<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.260> you'll<00:03:13.470> need<00:03:13.650> one<00:03:14.040> of

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
basic things that you'll need one of

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.180 
basic things that you'll need one of
them<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.910> strip<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.720> metal<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.950> bought

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
them is a strip of metal and I bought

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.280 
them is a strip of metal and I bought
this<00:03:17.400> at<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:18.120> hardware<00:03:18.480> store<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.200> was

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
this at a hardware store and it was

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.680 
this at a hardware store and it was
about<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.470> dollar<00:03:19.829> for<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> foot<00:03:20.730> long<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.239> it's

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
about a dollar for a foot long and it's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.259 
about a dollar for a foot long and it's
really<00:03:22.110> really<00:03:22.380> thin<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.010> you'll<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.180> have

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
really really thin and you'll just have

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.670 
really really thin and you'll just have
to<00:03:24.480> cut<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.720> down<00:03:24.840> with<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> pair<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.260> scissors

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
to cut it down with a pair of scissors

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.890 
to cut it down with a pair of scissors
and<00:03:26.010> make<00:03:26.220> sure<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.700> obviously<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.420> magnet

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and make sure that obviously a magnet

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.789 
and make sure that obviously a magnet
works<00:03:28.110> with<00:03:28.380> it

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
works with it

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.819 
works with it
and<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:29.790> use<00:03:30.180> these<00:03:30.510> super<00:03:30.989> heavy-duty<00:03:31.380> magnets

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
and I use these super heavy-duty magnets

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.870 
and I use these super heavy-duty magnets
that<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.430> can<00:03:32.610> buy<00:03:32.910> at<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:34.340> hobby<00:03:35.340> store<00:03:35.430> or<00:03:35.850> a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
that you can buy at the hobby store or a

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.479 
that you can buy at the hobby store or a
hardware<00:03:36.090> store<00:03:36.600> see<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.769> this<00:03:37.950> case<00:03:38.220> I

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
hardware store see so in this case I

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.870 
hardware store see so in this case I
know<00:03:38.610> for<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.180> fact<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:40.230> works<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.519> metal

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
know for a fact it works so the metal

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.780 
know for a fact it works so the metal
piece<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:43.049> just<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.440> show<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.680> again<00:03:43.739> here<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
piece is just to show you again here the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.360 
piece is just to show you again here the
metal<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.450> behind<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.320> piece<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.680> paper<00:03:46.829> and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
metal is behind this piece of paper and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.390 
metal is behind this piece of paper and
then<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.150> actual<00:03:48.570> magnet<00:03:49.440> disc<00:03:49.709> itself<00:03:50.220> see

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
then the actual magnet disc itself see

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.870 
then the actual magnet disc itself see
as<00:03:50.640> well<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.530> see<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.340> other<00:03:53.489> magnet

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
as well as you can see the other magnet

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.870 
as well as you can see the other magnet
piece<00:03:54.299> is<00:03:54.630> stuck<00:03:55.109> inside<00:03:55.519> behind<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.730> other

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
piece is stuck inside behind the other

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.560 
piece is stuck inside behind the other
paper<00:03:57.380> so<00:03:58.380> yeah<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.340> hope<00:03:59.880> you<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.390> I
