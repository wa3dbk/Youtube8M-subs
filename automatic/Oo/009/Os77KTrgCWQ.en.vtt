00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
give you an example by looking at a

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.710 
give you an example by looking at a
youth<00:02:37.320> or<00:02:37.530> men's<00:02:38.040> team<00:02:38.340> which<00:02:38.790> trains<00:02:39.209> two<00:02:39.510> to

also<00:02:44.340> known<00:02:44.550> as<00:02:44.700> movement<00:02:44.940> preps<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.959> be

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
also known as movement preps can be

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.040 
also known as movement preps can be
integrated<00:02:46.830> into<00:02:47.010> every<00:02:47.489> training<00:02:47.790> session

integrated into every training session

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.590 
integrated into every training session
it's<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.200> more<00:02:49.410> effective<00:02:49.800> warm-up<00:02:50.550> because<00:02:51.239> it

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
it's a more effective warm-up because it

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.020 
it's a more effective warm-up because it
lowers<00:02:51.810> injury<00:02:52.350> risks<00:02:52.830> while<00:02:53.310> improving<00:02:53.760> the

athletic performance at the same time

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.370 
athletic performance at the same time
that's<00:02:56.850> why<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.120> should<00:02:57.420> choose<00:02:57.690> three<00:02:58.110> to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
that's why you should choose three to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.040 
that's why you should choose three to
four<00:02:58.620> preps<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.269> incorporate<00:03:00.269> them<00:03:00.480> into<00:03:00.720> the

athleticism and stability into football
training<00:03:23.370> one<00:03:24.299> way<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.870> start<00:03:25.079> right<00:03:25.680> after

training one way is to start right after

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.009 
training one way is to start right after
the<00:03:26.190> movement<00:03:26.579> preps<00:03:26.820> because<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.750> player<00:03:27.989> is

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
the movement preps because the player is

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.930 
the movement preps because the player is
under<00:03:28.320> pressure<00:03:28.890> during<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.549> training

working with his feet let's look at

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.490 
working with his feet let's look at
basketball<00:04:30.160> for<00:04:30.520> example<00:04:31.289> basketball<00:04:32.289> is<00:04:32.470> a

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
basketball for example basketball is a

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.310 
basketball for example basketball is a
non-contact<00:04:33.430> sport<00:04:33.960> there<00:04:34.960> is<00:04:34.990> no<00:04:35.110> tackling

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
non-contact sport there is no tackling

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.689 
non-contact sport there is no tackling
like<00:04:36.100> in<00:04:36.280> football<00:04:37.740> but<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.800> basketball<00:04:39.520> player

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
like in football but a basketball player

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.300 
like in football but a basketball player

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
has to move quickly as well too while

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.610 
has to move quickly as well too while
trying<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:42.729> avoid<00:04:42.910> evasive<00:04:43.720> core<00:04:44.050> movements

trying to avoid evasive core movements

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.040 
trying to avoid evasive core movements
which<00:04:44.979> slow<00:04:45.250> him<00:04:45.460> down<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.970> create<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.690> lack<00:04:46.810> of

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
which slow him down and create a lack of

mobility of the leg axis tennis players

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.029 
mobility of the leg axis tennis players
rotate<00:04:54.940> their<00:04:55.360> arms<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:55.960> are<00:04:56.740> often

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
rotate their arms and are often

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.839 
rotate their arms and are often
