hey<00:00:08.580> whats<00:00:08.849> up<00:00:09.000> guys<00:00:09.090> kasia<00:00:09.630> from<00:00:09.900> zombies

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
hey whats up guys kasia from zombies

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.270 
hey whats up guys kasia from zombies
intel<00:00:10.500> here<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.830> today<00:00:10.980> i'll<00:00:11.099> be<00:00:11.190> talking

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
intel here and today i'll be talking

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.999 
intel here and today i'll be talking
about<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.910> quantum<00:00:12.150> entanglement<00:00:12.870> device

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
about the quantum entanglement device

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.829 
about the quantum entanglement device
alright<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.219> there's<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.549> sort<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.330> theory

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
alright so there's this sort of theory

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.800 
alright so there's this sort of theory
going<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.289> around<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.520> internet<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.570> I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
going on around the internet and I I

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.370 
going on around the internet and I I
find<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.289> pretty<00:00:19.699> pretty<00:00:20.699> real<00:00:21.080> it<00:00:22.080> makes

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
find it pretty pretty real it makes

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.099 
find it pretty pretty real it makes
sense<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:23.100> ahh<00:00:23.369> I'll<00:00:23.779> explain<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> you

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
sense like ahh I'll explain it to you

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.050 
sense like ahh I'll explain it to you
right<00:00:25.350> now<00:00:25.380> well<00:00:25.769> I'll<00:00:25.949> read<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:27.000> you

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
right now well I'll read it out for you

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.419 
right now well I'll read it out for you
guys<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.140> quantum<00:00:28.500> entanglement<00:00:28.980> causes

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
guys so the quantum entanglement causes

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.630 
guys so the quantum entanglement causes
atoms<00:00:29.849> there<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.929> get<00:00:31.050> mixed<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.470> together<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
atoms there to get mixed up together the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.670 
atoms there to get mixed up together the
atoms<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.210> share<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.719> same<00:00:33.930> electrons<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
atoms then share the same electrons and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
atoms then share the same electrons and
protons<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> when<00:00:36.149> quantum<00:00:36.570> entanglement

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
protons so when quantum entanglement

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.139 
protons so when quantum entanglement
happens<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.340> two<00:00:38.579> atoms<00:00:38.940> at

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
happens you can have two atoms at

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
happens you can have two atoms at
opposite<00:00:39.600> ends<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.020> universe<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
opposite ends of the universe and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.130 
opposite ends of the universe and
they're<00:00:41.129> still<00:00:41.460> connected<00:00:41.840> whenever<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.989> do

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
they're still connected whenever you do

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.139 
they're still connected whenever you do
to<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:43.530> atom<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.280> same<00:00:44.520> happens<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
to one atom the same happens to the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.869 
to one atom the same happens to the
other<00:00:45.590> alright<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.950> zombies<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.670> throw

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
other alright so in zombies if you throw

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.209 
other alright so in zombies if you throw
this<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> pile<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.950> one

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
this out a pile of them and you get one

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.290 
this out a pile of them and you get one
hitch<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> ones<00:00:51.059> aadmi<00:00:52.969> every<00:00:53.969> other<00:00:54.090> song

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
hitch on a ones aadmi every other song

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
hitch on a ones aadmi every other song
is<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> head<00:00:55.050> shot<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:56.039> they're

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is going to get a head shot so they're

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.130 
is going to get a head shot so they're
all<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> die<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.480> zombie<00:00:57.840> hits

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
all going to die but if one zombie hits

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.599 
all going to die but if one zombie hits
you<00:00:58.820> well<00:00:59.820> they<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.629> hit<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.280> this

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you well they all hit you this this this

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.549 
you well they all hit you this this this
is<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> mean<00:01:03.180> by<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.480> blesses<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
is what I mean by it blesses you and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.230 
is what I mean by it blesses you and
curses<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> headshot<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
curses you you get one a headshot you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.520 
curses you you get one a headshot you
kill<00:01:06.420> everybody<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.049> get<00:01:08.510> hit<00:01:09.510> by<00:01:09.780> by<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
kill everybody you get hit by by a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
kill everybody you get hit by by a
zombie<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.580> get<00:01:11.729> hit<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:11.970> every<00:01:12.330> zombie<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
zombie you get hit but every zombie so

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
zombie you get hit but every zombie so
that's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.110> curse<00:01:14.210> now<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.830> what

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that's a curse now I don't know what

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.830 
that's a curse now I don't know what
what<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.820> else<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.240> benefit<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
what what else you can benefit out of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.280 
what what else you can benefit out of
this<00:01:19.049> maybe<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:21.570> points<00:01:22.049> or

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
this maybe I don't know more points or

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.969 
this maybe I don't know more points or
actually<00:01:23.040> less<00:01:23.280> points<00:01:23.580> i'm<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:23.909> sure<00:01:24.090> but

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
actually less points i'm not sure but

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.320 
actually less points i'm not sure but
this<00:01:25.979> theory<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.939> looks<00:01:27.150> actually

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
this theory look looks actually

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.910 
this theory look looks actually
plausible<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> best<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.380> i<00:01:28.409> heard<00:01:28.650> yet

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
plausible it's the best one i heard yet

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.450 
plausible it's the best one i heard yet
and<00:01:29.869> yeah<00:01:30.869> guys<00:01:31.110> by<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.979> way<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and yeah guys by the way this is a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.429 
and yeah guys by the way this is a
picture<00:01:32.729> everybody's<00:01:33.420> posting<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.020> i'm<00:01:34.140> not

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
picture everybody's posting and i'm not

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.109 
picture everybody's posting and i'm not
really<00:01:34.619> sure<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.820> call<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> duty

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
really sure it's on the the call of duty

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.069 
really sure it's on the the call of duty
wiki<00:01:37.430> website<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.759> i'm<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.990> sure

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
wiki website but i'm really not sure

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.600 
wiki website but i'm really not sure
this<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> quantum<00:01:41.070> entanglement<00:01:41.579> device

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
this is the quantum entanglement device

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.630 
this is the quantum entanglement device
i<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> feeling<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.810> something<00:01:43.140> else

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
i have a feeling it's something else

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.280 
i have a feeling it's something else
smaller<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.780> huge<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
smaller because this is this is huge it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.840 
smaller because this is this is huge it
looks<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:47.009> begging<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.579> has<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
looks like really begging and has a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.710 
looks like really begging and has a
handle<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.450> stuff<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.640> anyway<00:01:50.640> guys<00:01:50.820> thanks

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
handle and stuff so anyway guys thanks

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:01.640 
handle and stuff so anyway guys thanks
for<00:01:51.750> watching<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.710> peace

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

Oh
