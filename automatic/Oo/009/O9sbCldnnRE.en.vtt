we're<00:00:55.190> trying<00:00:55.550> out<00:00:55.699> both<00:00:55.969> versions<00:00:56.480> of<00:00:56.749> the

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
we're trying out both versions of the

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.069 
we're trying out both versions of the
silicone<00:00:57.649> Bowl<00:00:58.030> we've<00:00:59.030> got<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.449> funnel

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
silicone Bowl we've got the funnel

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.770 
silicone Bowl we've got the funnel
loaded<00:01:00.409> with<00:01:00.620> chocolate<00:01:01.159> mint<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.149> we've<00:01:02.569> got

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
loaded with chocolate mint and we've got

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.250 
loaded with chocolate mint and we've got
some<00:01:03.079> fruit<00:01:03.710> mint<00:01:04.010> in<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.780> regular<00:01:05.780> Egyptian

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
some fruit mint in the regular Egyptian

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.620 
some fruit mint in the regular Egyptian
style<00:01:06.470> Bowl<00:01:06.740> I<00:01:06.979> think<00:01:07.909> I<00:01:07.970> really<00:01:08.330> like<00:01:08.450> the

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
style Bowl I think I really like the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.500 
style Bowl I think I really like the
design<00:01:08.990> on<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.860> regular<00:01:10.400> Egyptian<00:01:10.820> style<00:01:11.090> or

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
design on the regular Egyptian style or

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.140 
design on the regular Egyptian style or
better<00:01:11.780> than<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.110> funnel<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.970> holes<00:01:13.970> are

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
better than the funnel the holes are

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.220 
better than the funnel the holes are
raised<00:01:14.500> so<00:01:15.500> it's<00:01:15.680> kind<00:01:16.010> of<00:01:16.040> advanced<00:01:17.230> Egyptian

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
raised so it's kind of advanced Egyptian

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.890 
raised so it's kind of advanced Egyptian
style<00:01:18.470> bowls<00:01:19.090> I'm<00:01:20.090> not<00:01:20.330> getting<00:01:20.540> any<00:01:20.690> weird

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
style bowls I'm not getting any weird

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.310 
style bowls I'm not getting any weird
taste<00:01:21.170> from<00:01:21.650> this<00:01:21.860> one<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:22.810> would<00:01:23.810> say<00:01:24.110> it's<00:01:24.230> a

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
taste from this one I would say it's a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.070 
taste from this one I would say it's a
plus<00:01:24.530> we're<00:01:25.190> using<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.550> without<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.150> metal

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
plus we're using it without the metal

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.300 
plus we're using it without the metal
piece<00:01:27.290> that<00:01:27.320> comes<00:01:27.680> with<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:28.010> we're<00:01:28.160> just

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
piece that comes with it we're just

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.910 
piece that comes with it we're just
using<00:01:28.430> regular<00:01:28.580> foil<00:01:29.120> I<00:01:29.710> when<00:01:30.710> we<00:01:30.800> were

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
using regular foil I when we were

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.470 
using regular foil I when we were
smoking<00:01:31.100> out<00:01:31.340> of<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.490> yesterday<00:01:31.700> we<00:01:32.030> did<00:01:32.330> go

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
smoking out of this yesterday we did go

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.390 
smoking out of this yesterday we did go
through<00:01:32.660> two<00:01:32.930> rounds<00:01:33.440> of<00:01:33.530> coals<00:01:33.770> on<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.220> bowl

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
through two rounds of coals on the bowl

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.540 
through two rounds of coals on the bowl
and<00:01:35.140> smoke<00:01:36.140> just<00:01:36.200> flying<00:01:36.590> no<00:01:36.800> weird<00:01:37.010> tastes

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550

and smoke just flying no weird tastes
after<00:01:38.150> those<00:01:38.270> two<00:01:38.330> rounds<00:01:39.130> no<00:01:40.130> changes<00:01:40.580> in<00:01:40.610> the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
after those two rounds no changes in the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.170 
after those two rounds no changes in the
bowl
