00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
a novel suggestion why doesn't everyone

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:13.180 
a novel suggestion why doesn't everyone
stop<00:02:00.390> talking<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.020> let<00:02:01.110> me<00:02:01.200> inspect<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.619> body

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.820 

okay<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> spark<00:02:15.900> eater<00:02:16.110> if<00:02:16.620> that's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
okay so it is a spark eater if that's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.720 
okay so it is a spark eater if that's
what<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.070> want<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.280> call<00:02:17.430> it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
what you want to call it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.700 
what you want to call it
technically<00:02:18.690> it's<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.990> robo<00:02:19.260> carnivorous

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710
