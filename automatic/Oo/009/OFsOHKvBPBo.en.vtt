 you heading life news and took a little 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.650
 more than a year after the van company 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.720
 plus showed us her first killer 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.640
 flagships and what are you walking now 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.619
 more than three months of news about what 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.779
 the company is going to release a new 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 flagship van plus 2 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.189
 agree very interesting what will be 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.920
 because the model van plus one has become a real 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.469
 hit all over the world today July 28 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.180
 there was a presentation of this smartphone i 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.920
 I hasten to inform you all the information 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 which we know about flamme 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.120
 for a start, we will look at its appearance 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.610
 front panel is unprotected 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 4th generation gorilla glass 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 the lower part is located two sensory 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
 buttons and one mechanical is built into it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.980
 fingerprint scanner and top 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.379
 parts are located conversational speaker 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.539
 light sensor proximity sensor 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.579
 event indicator and camera frame 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.559
 new items made of magnesium alloy and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.820
 aluminum on the right side we 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.309
 see the power button and the button 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.960
 volume control left special 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.510
 sound mode switch 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.760
 standard priority and silent on 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 bottom end settled yusb port said 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 7 microphone and external speaker 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.159
 standard jay three and a half 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.200
 millimeter headset 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.479
 the back panel is made of plastic 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.549
 but the manufacturer also offers four 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.890
 versions of removable bamboo covers 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.290
 black apricot kevlar tree and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.299
 rosewood top you panels 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.650
 see the double flash camera and sensor 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.990
 laser focus 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.880
 just below the manufacturer's logo back 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 the cover is removable just below it you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.049
 find a tray for two sim cards 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.119
 battery is not removable thickness 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.700
 the hull was almost 10 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.710
 two millimeters 172 game consent from 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.420
 The external data of this product is not particularly 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.100
 different from its predecessor 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.080
 rear panel layout 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.090
 laser focusing camera 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.770
 do from this smartphone Cyclops 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.869
 In general, yes, where there is not all this is not much 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.940
 pretty agree van called 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.440
 looked much better than that 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.750
 I can select super fast 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.369
 Fingerprint scanner triggered by 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.840
 manufacturer claims time 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.020
 fingerprint scan 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.940
 it takes us 0.36 seconds and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.230
 the manufacturer pays special attention to this 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.110
 attention because scanning time 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.470
 the imprint on iphone six is ​​1.3 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.209
 seconds she meizu mx5 half a second of course 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.040
 same all this marketing i think that on 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.840
 this should not sharpen our attention 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.819
 general fingerprint scanner should be 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.440
 cool also a mechanical button which 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.690
 located on the front panel can 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.860
 we can set various smart functions 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.840
 set the function to using 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.670
 long hold and open the stone 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.739
 either with a double click opened 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.660
 gallery as it is possible to someone 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.580
 this is useful marketing about all 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.769
 little things need to say well what are you now 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.790
 I'll tell you about the most interesting 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.980
 the technical part of this smartphone 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.870
 the display diagonal is five with 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.870
 half inches full hd resolution 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.660
 matrix and the weight does not work includes 8 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.280
 snapdragon 810 core processor but in 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.959
 Unlike competitors to avoid 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.660
 overheating maximum clock frequency 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.420
 makes 1 and 8 gigahertz works 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.920
 adreno 430 video accelerator 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.590
 the amount of RAM is 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.049
 3 gigabytes in standard version 4 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.750
 gigabytes in top-end built-in 16 gigabytes 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.920
 standard version and 64 in top slot 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.250
 missing for memory expansion 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.260
 13 megapixel rear camera 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.660
 sensor that does not lead to pragma 20 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.250
 there is optical stabilization 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.019
 front camera is 5 megapixels 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.450
 responsible for the autonomy of work 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.220
 3300 milliampere battery 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.720
 hours when I personally got acquainted with 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.340
 the technical characteristics of this 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.690
 I can not say the smartphone was 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.670
 surprised at essentially nothing 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.620
 supernatural but when a bit 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.970
 went deep yet there are nuances that 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.250
 worth paying special attention 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.720
 let's compare this smartphone let's say with 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.700
 The same xiaomi mi laptop about 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.780
 First of all, van plus is worth giving away. 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.220
 due to the fact that not 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.300
 worried about their future 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.520
 user because their hands will not 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.230
 the fact that the device overheats and 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.360
 Essentially what difference will recruit 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.760
 smartphone 50 thousand points in antutu either 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.950
 47 anyway all applications will fly 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.000
 agree I can not wait 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.740
 test his temperature this 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.050
 second thing when i heard that 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.120
 the camera will be 13 megapixel sensor it 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.890
 there is no vision i will think a little but when 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.630
 went deep into the heart of the matter realized that 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.030
 the camera should be awesome due to 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.440
 that occur very well finished and the 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.570
 It is worth noting that the physical dimensions 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.519
 the sensor itself and the pixels are much larger 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.410
 rather than competitors, this means that 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.360
 the sensor will receive more light three 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.100
 same light conditions and all 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.980
 let's compare it with the same sensor 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.570
 from sony ms200 14 so quality 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.290
 shots in poor light 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.670
 provided 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.710
 also due to the built-in laser 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.620
 focus producer promises time 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.330
 focusing 0.3 seconds and this is very 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.340
 fast and since this company van plus 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.960
 she can trust but may be 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.940
 some kind of small error when 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.500
 will come test well so far 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.630
 of the visible cons, I can only note 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.610
 one moment not much liked 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.380
 smartphone design though materials which 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.240
 used the manufacturer when assembling 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.070
 much richer than its predecessor 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.540
 even take into account the metal 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.310
 frame predecessor was completely 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.320
 made of plastic from pluses I can 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.750
 immediately note the presence of two SIM cards and 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.310
 availability of usb port taip s agree 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.680
 need to keep up with the times they 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.570
 establish old microusb Well 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.280
 Well now we go to the most interesting 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.230
 moment of product value for 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.169
 standard version with integrated memory 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.000
 16 gigabyte manufacturer asking for 329 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.320
 dollars for the top version on board 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.450
 which will be four gigabytes 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.570
 RAM and 64 gigabytes 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.640
 built-in memory of 389 dollars of course 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.560
 is it the official prices unequivocally in 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.050
 Chinese online stores they will 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.000
 us on 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.770
 And above, whatever you twist if it equally considers 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.479
 that this model will be quite relevant 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.129
 because van company plus sign in 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.419
 last time could stand low 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.639
 cost and excellent technical 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.259
 characteristics and that we have already made our 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.360
 before ordering her legs that to the middle 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.099
 on August, he will have studios for us 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.409
 full testing who left 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.879
 questions or am I somewhere wrong write about 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.500
 this in the comments and now
