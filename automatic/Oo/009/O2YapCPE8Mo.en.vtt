00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.200
 Well, here are three steps that 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.450
 you are going to use to be able 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.510
 paint your nails very easy and without 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.110
 stain your cuticle and around your 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 nail the first thing is to choose an enamel a 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.590
 time like this 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.550
 let's remove all the excess enamel 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.810
 have 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.630
 so only from one side 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.020
 and a droplet 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.460
 let's start here 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.460
 and let's make a line 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.630
 now 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.500
 let's put the other side and we're going to 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.500
 make another line 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.089
 we do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 and so we have our nail without 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.940
 stain our cuticle and around 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.940
 her 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.259
 I will teach them one more time 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.900
 we remove excess glaze 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.710
 let's put a line from here to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.710
 here and we are going to give a little push 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.210
 up to the cuticle 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.290
 if it 's love to the line then we fold 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.290
 a little our nail 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.340
 another line 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.340
 the week on the other side 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.390
 and there we have it painted 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.840
 ok well it is very easy to paint 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.420
 nails with just three steps one 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.650
 line towards the middle of the nail is a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.680
 cuticle is the end 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.390
 another line bending a bus with our 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.800
 finger like that 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.080
 from here to there 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.700
 then we call her again our finger 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.349
 well and another the line 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.739
 it's just very easy I hope that you 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:55.349
 have liked and served them a lot 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.790
 and well I liked these two colors that 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:02.860
 use the brand good and it is correction and 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.020
 this is number 12 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.370
 this is also from the connection mark and 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.270
 is the number 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.940
 4 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.150
 and well it is not pressed that many 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.500
 good colors little bit and if you liked it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.450
 good are those and it's very easy 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.450
