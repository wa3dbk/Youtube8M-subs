about the plastic stew in the ocean and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.319 
about the plastic stew in the ocean and
I<00:00:42.059> thought<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.390> people<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:42.960> home<00:00:43.140> address<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
I thought how people at home address and

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.029 
I thought how people at home address and
certainly<00:00:45.329> backwards<00:00:45.809> mean<00:00:45.989> they're<00:00:46.200> sort<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
certainly backwards mean they're sort of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.729 
certainly backwards mean they're sort of
classic<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.730> amazingly<00:00:48.300> definitely<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.590> no

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
classic is amazingly definitely are no

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.130 
classic is amazingly definitely are no
friends<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> plastic<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.899> kept<00:00:51.899> coming<00:00:52.110> back

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
friends of plastic but kept coming back

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.900 
friends of plastic but kept coming back
to<00:00:52.260> bottled<00:00:52.680> water<00:00:52.860> over<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.430> over<00:00:53.520> again<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to bottled water over and over again and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.240 
to bottled water over and over again and
thought<00:00:54.210> maybe<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.590> without<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:55.829> day

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
thought maybe we can do without for day

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.160 
thought maybe we can do without for day
for<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.059> energy<00:00:57.449> efficient<00:00:57.780> light<00:00:57.930> bulb

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
for the the energy efficient light bulb

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.470 
for the the energy efficient light bulb
we<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.980> need<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> simple<00:00:59.579> sacrifice<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
we all just need a simple sacrifice of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.529 
we all just need a simple sacrifice of
getting<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> water<00:01:01.910> you<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.420> could

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
getting up on a water you see we could

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
getting up on a water you see we could
have<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> tremendous<00:01:04.379> effect<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.739> environment

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
have a tremendous effect on environment

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.090 
have a tremendous effect on environment
for<00:01:06.180> me<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.869> started<00:01:07.229> telling<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> story

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
for me when we started telling the story

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
for me when we started telling the story
we<00:01:08.610> weren't<00:01:08.820> exactly<00:01:08.880> sure<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.720> direction

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
we weren't exactly sure the direction

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.770 
we weren't exactly sure the direction
that<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.350> were<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.740> take<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.430> knew

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
that we were going to take it we knew

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.240 
that we were going to take it we knew
you<00:01:12.780> know<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> certain<00:01:13.140> number<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.650> things<00:01:14.040> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you know a certain number of things that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.800 
you know a certain number of things that
were<00:01:14.340> terrible<00:01:14.790> about<00:01:14.970> bottled<00:01:15.360> water<00:01:15.540> who

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
were terrible about bottled water who

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.149 
were terrible about bottled water who
certainly<00:01:16.170> didn't<00:01:16.500> know<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.740> whole<00:01:16.920> story

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
certainly didn't know this whole story

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.100 
certainly didn't know this whole story
we<00:01:17.520> learned<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> majority<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
we learned the majority of this in the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
we learned the majority of this in the
last<00:01:19.259> 15<00:01:20.220> months<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.700> making<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> film

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
last 15 months in the making of the film

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.160 
last 15 months in the making of the film
and<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.640> moment<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.509> stood<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.049> that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and the moment that I stood on that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.910 
and the moment that I stood on that
beach<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:26.070> Hawaii<00:01:27.439> absolutely<00:01:28.439> changed<00:01:28.799> my

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
beach in Hawaii absolutely changed my

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.190 
beach in Hawaii absolutely changed my
life<00:01:29.159> need<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.729> look<00:01:29.909> down<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.540> dig<00:01:30.900> down

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
life need to look down and to dig down

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.190 
life need to look down and to dig down
into<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.710> sand<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:33.299> think<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.049> expected

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
into the sand and you think we expected

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
into the sand and you think we expected
the<00:01:34.740> beach<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.100> look<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> landfill<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the beach to look like a landfill and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420 
the beach to look like a landfill and
frankly<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> didn't<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.590> walked<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> my

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
frankly it didn't we walked out and my

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.580 
frankly it didn't we walked out and my
first<00:01:38.700> thought<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:39.119> oh<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.259> great

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
first thought was oh this is not great

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.870 
first thought was oh this is not great
it's<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> look<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:41.520> great<00:01:41.700> on

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it's not going to look how great on

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.630 
it's not going to look how great on
camera<00:01:42.119> there's<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.200> much<00:01:43.710> plastic<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
camera there's not that much plastic and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.940 
camera there's not that much plastic and
then<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.570> dig<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.259> you're

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
then you dig down and you're

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.039 
then you dig down and you're
that's<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.240> plastic<00:01:48.780> there<00:01:48.930> was

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that's all it is is plastic there was

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.630 
that's all it is is plastic there was
almost<00:01:49.320> no<00:01:49.740> sand<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.399> at<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:52.640> was

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
almost no sand there at all it was

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
almost no sand there at all it was
absolutely<00:01:53.909> life-changing<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.710> us

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
absolutely life-changing for all of us

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.310 
absolutely life-changing for all of us
standing<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.429> that<00:01:56.460> moment<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.840> already

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
standing on that moment and I already

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.529 
standing on that moment and I already
given<00:01:58.710> up<00:01:58.799> bottled<00:01:59.219> water<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.909> second<00:02:00.390> day

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
given up bottled water and my second day

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.840 
given up bottled water and my second day
on<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.810> project<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:02.130> an<00:02:02.250> occasional

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
on the project I was an occasional

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
on the project I was an occasional
bottled<00:02:03.179> water<00:02:03.360> drinker<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:04.170> inserted

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
bottled water drinker and then inserted

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.999 
bottled water drinker and then inserted
greediness<00:02:05.179> horrified<00:02:06.179> at<00:02:06.509> my<00:02:07.140> contribution

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
greediness horrified at my contribution

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.680 
greediness horrified at my contribution
of<00:02:08.099> drinking<00:02:08.489> even<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.789> couple<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.239> bottles<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
of drinking even a couple of bottles a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.789 
of drinking even a couple of bottles a
week<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.220> think<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.670> story<00:02:11.940> really

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
week and so I think the story really

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.620 
week and so I think the story really
came<00:02:13.799> together<00:02:14.069> as<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.670> months<00:02:14.910> went<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.209> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
came together as the months went on and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.839 
came together as the months went on and
we<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.140> thought<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.400> story<00:02:17.760> that

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
we just thought this is a story that

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.690 
we just thought this is a story that
can't<00:02:18.269> afford<00:02:18.599> not<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:19.080> be<00:02:19.200> told<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.709> not<00:02:20.310> just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
can't afford not to be told and not just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.360 
can't afford not to be told and not just
certain<00:02:21.120> parts<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.739> whole<00:02:23.010> story

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
certain parts of it but the whole story

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.400 
certain parts of it but the whole story
of<00:02:23.489> bottled<00:02:23.849> water<00:02:24.060> how<00:02:24.420> absurd<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.140> whole

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
of bottled water how absurd the whole

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.589 
of bottled water how absurd the whole
idea<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.340> what<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> waste<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.360> there's

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
idea is and what a waste it is there's

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.330 
idea is and what a waste it is there's
up<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:28.260> obviously<00:02:28.470> believe<00:02:28.769> there's<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.160> place

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
up we obviously believe there's a place

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.789 
up we obviously believe there's a place
for<00:02:29.370> bottled<00:02:29.849> water<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.299> world

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
for bottled water in the world

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.949 
for bottled water in the world
ultimately<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:32.910> an<00:02:33.030> absurd<00:02:33.329> product<00:02:33.810> to

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
ultimately it is an absurd product to

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.920 
ultimately it is an absurd product to
even<00:02:34.170> be<00:02:34.290> available<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.760> every<00:02:35.970> day<00:02:36.120> sales<00:02:36.390> so

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
even be available for every day sales so

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.170 
even be available for every day sales so
that<00:02:37.650> was<00:02:37.799> kind<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.160> what<00:02:38.310> led<00:02:38.489> us<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.670> get<00:02:38.940> you

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
simple bill that we put in which just

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.670 
simple bill that we put in which just
said<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.920> we<00:04:21.160> would<00:04:21.370> extend<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.780> groundwater

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
said that we would extend to groundwater

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.950

the<00:04:24.160> same<00:04:24.370> protection<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.270> surface<00:04:25.690> water

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
the same protection that surface water

the same protection that surface water
has<00:04:26.200> its<00:04:26.980> one<00:04:27.510> hydrological<00:04:28.510> system<00:04:29.050> with<00:04:29.560> two

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
bodies of law so how simple can that be
