know<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.730> msata<00:00:42.329> mo<00:00:43.020> 300b<00:00:43.739> form<00:00:44.129> factor<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
know the msata mo 300b form factor is

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.650 
know the msata mo 300b form factor is
going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.680> very<00:00:46.730> blossoming<00:00:47.730> segment

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660

performance with the smaller form factor

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.620 
performance with the smaller form factor
it<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.560> for<00:01:07.860> chips<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.180> way<00:01:09.330> we've

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it is for chips but the the way we've

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.510 
it is for chips but the the way we've
been<00:01:09.780> able<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.110> configure<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:11.340> still

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
been able to configure these we still

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.410 
been able to configure these we still
get<00:01:11.729> 560<00:01:12.720> megabytes<00:01:13.140> per<00:01:13.350> second<00:01:13.680> read

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
get 560 megabytes per second read

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.370 
get 560 megabytes per second read
actually<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:16.880> deluxe<00:01:17.880> version<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.720> toggle

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
we've been working on a PCIe SSD this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.460 
we've been working on a PCIe SSD this
will<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:39.240> available<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> second<00:01:40.290> quarter

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
will be available in the second quarter

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.219 
will be available in the second quarter
of<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.130> year<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.049> take<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.030 
of this year as you can see we take a
modular<00:01:43.829> approach<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.710> know<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.950> have

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
modular approach so you know we have

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.800 
modular approach so you know we have
sales<00:01:47.310> opportunities<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> solve<00:01:48.689> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
sales opportunities for this to solve it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.080 
sales opportunities for this to solve it
with<00:01:48.990> only<00:01:49.200> two<00:01:49.829> modules<00:01:50.070> installed<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.970> end

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
with only two modules installed the end

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
with only two modules installed the end
users<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.600> upgrade<00:01:51.780> later<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.619> sell<00:01:52.860> with

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
users can upgrade later we can sell with

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.749 
users can upgrade later we can sell with
four<00:01:53.189> miles<00:01:53.399> each<00:01:53.640> other<00:01:54.079> right<00:01:55.079> removal

know this year you know we're still
doing<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.630> high-performance<00:02:14.230> memory<00:02:14.650> still

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
doing the high-performance memory still

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.310 
doing the high-performance memory still
very<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:16.000> know<00:02:16.030> successful<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.870> we're

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
very you know successful in that we're

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.080 
very you know successful in that we're
we're<00:02:17.590> still<00:02:17.890> making<00:02:18.130> innovations<00:02:18.790> with<00:02:18.940> that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
we're still making innovations with that

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.880 
we're still making innovations with that
but<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.420> cs<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:20.020> really<00:02:20.260> want<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.470> focus<00:02:20.620> on

but the cs we really want to focus on
the<00:02:21.010> flash<00:02:21.250> products<00:02:21.760> mmm<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.600> what<00:02:23.350> we<00:02:23.440> think

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
the flash products mmm and what we think

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.560 
the flash products mmm and what we think
are<00:02:23.890> some<00:02:25.770> some<00:02:26.770> areas<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.460> we<00:02:27.850> can<00:02:28.060> make<00:02:28.360> big

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
are some some areas that we can make big

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.690 
are some some areas that we can make big
strides<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.410> know<00:02:29.530> some<00:02:29.800> some<00:02:30.070> form<00:02:30.310> factors

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
strides you know some some form factors

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.190 
strides you know some some form factors
and<00:02:30.850> segments<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.540> haven't<00:02:31.840> done<00:02:31.960> in<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
and segments that we haven't done in the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200 
and segments that we haven't done in the
past<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.710> now<00:02:32.800> we're<00:02:33.010> kind<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.250> branching<00:02:34.090> out

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
past and now we're kind of branching out

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.060 
past and now we're kind of branching out
to<00:02:34.270> new<00:02:34.690> new<00:02:35.440> areas<00:02:37.380> he's<00:02:38.380> very<00:02:38.410> version

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
to new new areas he's very version

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.270 
to new new areas he's very version
