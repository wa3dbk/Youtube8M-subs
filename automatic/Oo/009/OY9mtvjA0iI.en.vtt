it's probably really blurry but those
four<00:01:05.120> little<00:01:05.420> solder<00:01:05.810> dots<00:01:06.140> on<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.470> very<00:01:06.650> end

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
four little solder dots on the very end

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.210 
four little solder dots on the very end
of<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.070> opposite<00:01:07.760> of<00:01:07.880> my<00:01:08.030> thumb<00:01:08.380> there's<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.740> red

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
of it opposite of my thumb there's a red

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.270 
of it opposite of my thumb there's a red
black<00:01:10.670> green<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.450> yellow<00:01:11.830> red<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:12.980> black<00:01:13.070> for

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
black green and yellow red and black for

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.630 
black green and yellow red and black for
power<00:01:13.460> green<00:01:14.120> in<00:01:14.650> white<00:01:15.650> I<00:01:15.890> should<00:01:16.130> say<00:01:16.340> they

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
power green in white I should say they

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.870 
power green in white I should say they
are<00:01:16.880> for<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.660> syncing<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:19.400> those<00:01:19.640> are<00:01:19.790> all

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
are for the syncing so those are all

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.580 
are for the syncing so those are all
broken<00:01:20.090> off<00:01:20.270> I'm<00:01:20.540> going<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.870> restart<00:01:21.230> those

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
broken off I'm going to restart those

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.160 
broken off I'm going to restart those
and<00:01:21.920> I'm<00:01:22.700> going<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:22.970> resolder<00:01:23.450> on<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.990> ones

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
and I'm going to resolder on the ones

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.220 
and I'm going to resolder on the ones
for<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.530> cable<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.840> this<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:26.960> going<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.170> be

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
for the cable and this is going to be

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.900 
for the cable and this is going to be
really<00:01:27.410> took<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.650> Connie<00:01:27.920> because<00:01:28.160> look<00:01:28.880> at

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
really took the Connie because look at

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.510 
really took the Connie because look at
how<00:01:29.060> big<00:01:29.240> that<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:30.320> can<00:01:30.470> see<00:01:30.770> how<00:01:31.160> big<00:01:31.370> those

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
how big that you can see how big those

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.380 
how big that you can see how big those
are<00:01:32.800> and<00:01:33.800> look<00:01:33.980> at<00:01:34.070> how<00:01:34.160> big<00:01:35.320> soldering<00:01:36.320> tip<00:01:36.560> is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
are and look at how big soldering tip is

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.440 
are and look at how big soldering tip is
so<00:01:38.390> it's<00:01:38.600> going<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:38.870> really<00:01:38.990> tight<00:01:39.760> but<00:01:40.760> I'm

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
so it's going to be really tight but I'm

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.880 
so it's going to be really tight but I'm
going<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.690> attempt<00:01:42.020> it<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:43.090> see<00:01:44.090> if<00:01:44.150> it<00:01:44.270> works

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.990 

all<00:01:48.700> right<00:01:48.940> um<00:01:50.260> God<00:01:50.920> my<00:01:51.070> tools<00:01:51.310> got<00:01:51.640> out<00:01:51.820> my

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
all right um God my tools got out my

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.640 
all right um God my tools got out my

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
wire stripper mutters flux for tending

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.730 
wire stripper mutters flux for tending
the<00:01:56.740> wires<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:58.330> my<00:01:58.630> solder<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.230> my<00:01:59.440> solder

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.000 
iron said if the highest setting 40
which<00:02:02.140> isn't<00:02:02.290> hot<00:02:02.530> at<00:02:02.650> all<00:02:02.910> but<00:02:03.910> and<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.540> got<00:02:04.720> my

which isn't hot at all but and I got my

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.520 
which isn't hot at all but and I got my
iced<00:02:06.010> coffee<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:08.170> about<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.380> get

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
iced coffee and we're about to get

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.370 
iced coffee and we're about to get
started

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
started

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.650 
started
all<00:02:11.380> right<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:12.030> cut<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.210> off<00:02:13.450> from<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:14.410> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
all right I cut that off from there and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.840 
all right I cut that off from there and
you<00:02:16.660> get<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> black<00:02:17.110> green<00:02:17.590> white<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.760> red

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
you get the black green white and red

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.120 
you get the black green white and red
then<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.930> get<00:02:20.050> all<00:02:20.110> these<00:02:20.230> random<00:02:20.470> iron<00:02:20.770> wires

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
then you get all these random iron wires

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.110 
then you get all these random iron wires
that<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.730> think<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.420> preventing<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.230> from<00:02:24.120> like

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
that I think of preventing it from like

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.840 
that I think of preventing it from like
I<00:02:25.450> don't<00:02:26.290> know<00:02:26.470> printing<00:02:26.950> or<00:02:27.070> something<00:02:27.370> but

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
all right I got these stripped off and I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.420 
all right I got these stripped off and I
want<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.170> kind<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.380> go<00:02:36.530> over<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.800> procedure<00:02:37.160> of

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
want to kind of go over the procedure of

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.150 
want to kind of go over the procedure of
pinning<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:37.940> wires<00:02:38.739> now<00:02:39.739> if<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.010> go<00:02:40.130> with

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
pinning the wires now if you go with

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.290 
pinning the wires now if you go with
thinning<00:02:40.489> as<00:02:40.760> you're<00:02:40.910> going<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> take<00:02:41.180> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
thinning as you're going to take the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.500 
thinning as you're going to take the
waters<00:02:41.569> and<00:02:41.900> you're<00:02:42.590> going<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.739> stick<00:02:43.010> them<00:02:43.130> in

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
waters and you're going to stick them in

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.670 
waters and you're going to stick them in
the<00:02:44.510> flops<00:02:44.810> over<00:02:45.080> there<00:02:45.200> get<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.470> tips

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
the flops over there get the tips

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.589 
the flops over there get the tips
covered<00:02:45.980> up<00:02:46.099> with<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.400> stuff<00:02:46.670> then<00:02:47.510> you're

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
covered up with that stuff then you're

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.199 
covered up with that stuff then you're
going<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.810> go<00:02:47.989> over<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.319> your<00:02:48.760> side<00:02:49.760> ring<00:02:50.030> iron

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
going to go over to your side ring iron

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.540 
going to go over to your side ring iron
get<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:50.860> burn<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.069> tip<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.400> soldering

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
get that burn the tip of the soldering

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.000 
get that burn the tip of the soldering
iron<00:02:52.910> in<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.269> solder<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.500> solder<00:02:54.739> will

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
iron in the solder and the solder will

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.370 
iron in the solder and the solder will
stay<00:02:55.190> on<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.459> iron<00:02:55.610> then<00:02:56.599> you<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:56.900> touch<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
stay on the iron then you just touch the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.559 
stay on the iron then you just touch the
wires<00:02:57.560> with<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.099> then<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.060> will<00:02:59.150> melt<00:02:59.360> all

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
wires with it and then it will melt all

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.630 
wires with it and then it will melt all
over<00:02:59.599> the<00:02:59.930> wires<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.530> will<00:03:00.620> spit<00:03:01.459> and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
over the wires and it will spit and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.330 
over the wires and it will spit and
crackle<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.269> then<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:04.010> way<00:03:04.160> they'll

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
crackle and then that way they'll

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.860 
crackle and then that way they'll
already<00:03:04.489> be<00:03:04.640> ten<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.209> when<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.420> go<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.569> solder

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
already be ten so when you go to solder

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.240 
already be ten so when you go to solder
mine<00:03:06.140> whatever<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:06.620> need<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.830> solder<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.160> on

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
mine whatever you need to solder it on

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.059 
mine whatever you need to solder it on
sort<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.239> smelt<00:03:08.480> real<00:03:08.660> quick<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.170> it'll<00:03:09.920> be<00:03:10.040> a

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
sort of smelt real quick and it'll be a

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.960 
sort of smelt real quick and it'll be a
quick<00:03:10.310> thing<00:03:10.370> it'll<00:03:10.819> be<00:03:10.940> easy<00:03:12.610> all<00:03:13.610> right<00:03:13.790> I

quick thing it'll be easy all right I
got<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.510> wires<00:03:15.110> resolder<00:03:15.680> down<00:03:16.010> there<00:03:16.250> um<00:03:16.480> I

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
got the wires resolder down there um I

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.650 
got the wires resolder down there um I
labeled<00:03:18.739> them<00:03:18.860> with<00:03:19.400> different<00:03:19.549> notches<00:03:20.120> tell

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
labeled them with different notches tell

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.030 
labeled them with different notches tell
what<00:03:20.840> color<00:03:21.080> they<00:03:21.260> work<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.709> only<00:03:21.799> have<00:03:22.010> one

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
what color they work so I only have one

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.839 
what color they work so I only have one
type<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.400> wire<00:03:23.260> now<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.290> have<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.650> solder<00:03:24.950> the
