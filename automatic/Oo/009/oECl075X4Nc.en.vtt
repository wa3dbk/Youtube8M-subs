 or 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.200
 died at age 100 on the river 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.550
 I came back home 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.830
 Ah, it was a bank employee of the brazilian bank. 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.160
 big match 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.110

 I also studied librarianship mifune librarian 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.239
 coincided that I worked in the library of the brazilian bank 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.510
 alongside this 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.670
 I've always been 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.870
 poet writer silas actress 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.600
 they are things that do not give money 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.130
 but we make some fungi 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.499
 others out of necessity in my case were by an imperative necessity 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.590
 because I needed to find some valve 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.730
 marquinho compensate the company what I want I was passing 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.590
 I knew that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.600
 my illness is exactly the same as the market 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.490
 the rice milk was unheard of in childhood 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.240
 I fully booked after age 40 but I already knew that this was sea to 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.090
 chronicle of a blindness announced 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.030
 I've been to God's hand. 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.760
 there was no way 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.280
 it was isolating me 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.960
 of the other boys I use the line too much of me 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.420
 I saw it, it's very handsome. 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.840
 I could not ride a bike I could not play ball could not do what 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.510
 others do not market 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.289
 I was even discriminated against because of 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.960
 in a periphery the sock that has contract thus ended up becoming punching bag 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:59.539
 cool 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.270
 the interest of the group is not 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.400
 and that also marked me why it was an experience but what this one that I 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.990
 I internalized 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.180
 and transformed after the 'no' literary feitiche 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:16.399
 this explains this autobiographical book that you have in your hand in a hand to the people 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:17.079
 tin 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:17.780
 shipowner 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.850
 which was reissued now after 20 years the first issue came out and 86 now 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.979
 in 2006 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.240
 he is being medicated 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.240
 as happened with the brazilian newspaper that left 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.790
 81 min and was credited 20 years later in 2001 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.639
 by the illuminations 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.079
 the Brazilian newspaper belonged do I still see the possibility 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.639
 was the time when everyone was doing something 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.569
 country because officially nothing can be done 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.669
 the dictatorship 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.909
 is to curtail freedom of expression, then the new generation is the one who pulls 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.389
 alternative channels that were the fanzine 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.010
 were the recitals in public square were the letters of color because the staff sing 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.540
 the economic losses of all Brazil 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.919
 was an option that flows completely alongside the Swedish woman 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.079
 so what I did stay there in my 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.859
 in my little room by typing as I fla arrive fully typed 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.980
 in a craft thing is a mixture of bathroom graffiti with concretism 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.889
 Then the glass, because the day was all over. 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.079
 all the round that had a whole diagramming and celtic the most 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.829
 the visual result was one thing 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.019
 creative 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.590
 and this is just a slack ahead of the whole geography is a reference to 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.159
 many people spoke of the work depends on the demand seen as the card did not give 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.300
 for few people because they were few copies but it 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.389
 these few people did 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.909
 seven people to form an opinion 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.099
 - intellectuals in everything and named the most 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.589
 a poster of luxury the boutique hotel of fields 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:54.589
 and there gave birth very well to his poetry 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.249
 grandson we look for people and from then on it was a wait a reverberation 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:02.900
 asked the pope to use a word of the same joao paulo bravo was a 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.220
 &lt;Previous Next&gt; 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.030
 and that resulted in my literary career and there after the last 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.349
 country out of censorship 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.499
 from 1980 when hi5 was finishing up 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:20.180
 the brasiliense publisher as it all started public that first collection 

00:04:20.179 --> 00:04:21.269
 steps 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.509
 were the small pocketbooks on specific subjects net 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.000
 and I wrote what is marginal poetry 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.599
 and what is torture in that collection 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:31.919
 after 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.900
 I published Hugo 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.910
 the evil 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.520
 of the podolatra an ache 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.539
 and then turned into comics account the new album glauco mix 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.810
 incorporated some succeeding governments forgave the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.889
 curse that is a bilingual dictionary 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.379
 English-Portuguese Portuguese and English that I go out there I remember 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.360
 and most recently 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.889
 and if the master the maiden's plant 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.889
 which is a re-reading of the work of José de Alencar 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:01.800
 one of my best known poems 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800
 called 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.629
 I used to like it and said like that 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.300
 but it's good to point out the myth of myth 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.360
 the new new generation with the title for those who have already joined with 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.490
 palm heart with greater focus than any one perfect dog made to 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.040
 holding any color 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.340
 barbon pop 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.770
 popcorn or the lawsuit 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.190
 have the coke and coconut hair with coke 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.779
 dinis that merely explains lover 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:29.300
 soon the dead we have the language that I speak 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.290
 came to deny canese that is crazy in coren banana Sunday robinho rocked the 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.499
 supercup off click and pacu home 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:37.229
 the goal 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.430
 juju unify south and cacequi 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.509
 I hope 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.219
 I speak the tupiniquim 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:48.189
 poems like the ones that are very mixed with not deon but mixed 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:53.129
 including me this poem says 1977 the Caetano suffered with the pure language in 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:58.709
 1984 but the theme is the same and we already had contact then the route of knowing that 

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:00.490
 it's a kind of exchange 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.430
 of influences that I had an influence of tropicalismo 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.890
 I'm after tropicalism but at the same time I changed something because 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.520
 the gaitán made no goal because of this poem including hemicycle in his lyrics
