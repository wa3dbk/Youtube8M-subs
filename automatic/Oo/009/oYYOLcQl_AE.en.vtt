 But that's not right I'm not that already 

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:09.700
 The mind evolves more more 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.000
 If it is a relationship that will disappear if you put it into words 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.000
 I do it if I delete the words 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.000
 I thought I was afraid 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.800
 But that? Somewhat different 

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:36.000
 From the bottom of the world 

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.900
 Hard like a stone With such a will 

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:40.000
 If there is dust, it will be a mountain. 

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:42.300
 I'm not going to die! 

00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.400
 Fluffy Fluffy 

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:50.300
 You just call your name and it just floats into the air

 It is happy that I was able to see you 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.950
 But that's not right I'm not that already 

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:23.900
 The mind evolves more more 

00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:28.000
 That's right that's it, it's not it. 

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:33.000
 Look at me, forever 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.200
 As you in me, my being in you is 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 I also know that it is not big yet 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 I feel that I am sharing the same moment now 

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:05.000
 If there is dust, it will be a mountain! For short? Tiritsumo Yamato Nadeko! 

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.300
 Kurakura kurakura 

00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:13.000
 When you look up at you 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.350
 Kurakura kurakura 

00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:21.300
 Just thinking of you 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:30.000
