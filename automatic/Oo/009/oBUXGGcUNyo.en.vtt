00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
battery tester just connect the balance

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.359 
battery tester just connect the balance
plot<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.720> side<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.590> test<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> 8

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

cell<00:00:32.669> batteries<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.600> ok<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:36.440> C<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.890> show

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
cell batteries just ok in C was you show

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.080 
cell batteries just ok in C was you show
you<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.430> total<00:00:38.850> voltage<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> battery<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.970 

so<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> voltage<00:00:45.719> per<00:00:46.140> cell<00:00:46.440> Sol

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so you can see the voltage per cell Sol

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.029 
so you can see the voltage per cell Sol
and<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.760> test<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> each<00:00:48.390> cell<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.039> ok

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and can test up to each cell with it ok

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
and can test up to each cell with it ok
that's<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> battery<00:00:50.670> tester<00:00:51.120> function<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that's the battery tester function and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.220 
that's the battery tester function and
you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.250> use<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> servo<00:00:54.180> tester<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.809> well

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you can use it as a servo tester as well

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
you can use it as a servo tester as well

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and same as dumb power input make sure

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.270 
and same as dumb power input make sure
you<00:01:36.180> connect<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.659> correctly<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.590> you'll<00:01:38.070> burn

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
you connect it correctly or you'll burn

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580

pressing up and you see how the server

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.180 
pressing up and you see how the server
is<00:02:26.640> going<00:02:27.500> faster<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:34.080> do<00:02:34.830> so
