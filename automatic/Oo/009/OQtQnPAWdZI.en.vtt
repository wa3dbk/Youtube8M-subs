idea to cleaner vacuum those areas to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.490 
idea to cleaner vacuum those areas to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
make sure air can circulate but as

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.580 
make sure air can circulate but as

little resistance as possible it is a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
good idea to clean your case at least

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.180 
good idea to clean your case at least
once<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.450> year<00:03:12.629> one<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.409> best<00:03:13.620> ways<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:13.859> do

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
once a year one of the best ways to do

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.399 
once a year one of the best ways to do
so<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.640> buy<00:03:14.879> a<00:03:14.909> can<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.480> compressed<00:03:15.720> air<00:03:16.170> and

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
so is to buy a can of compressed air and

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.380 
so is to buy a can of compressed air and
bring<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.799> computer<00:03:17.069> outside<00:03:17.640> on<00:03:17.879> a<00:03:17.909> nice<00:03:18.150> day

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
bring the computer outside on a nice day

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.330 
bring the computer outside on a nice day
and<00:03:18.599> simply<00:03:19.260> blow<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.560> dust<00:03:19.859> from<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.129> case

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
and simply blow the dust from the case

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.610 
and simply blow the dust from the case
make<00:03:21.180> sure<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.450> nozzle<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.959> can<00:03:22.230> stays<00:03:22.500> a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
make sure the nozzle of the can stays a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.530 
make sure the nozzle of the can stays a
couple<00:03:22.950> inches<00:03:23.130> away<00:03:23.519> from<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.940> components

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
couple inches away from the components

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.599 
couple inches away from the components
so<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:24.989> do<00:03:25.109> not<00:03:25.230> damage<00:03:25.709> them<00:03:25.919> and<00:03:26.069> do<00:03:26.579> not

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
so you do not damage them and do not

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.180 
so you do not damage them and do not
make<00:03:26.970> fans<00:03:27.329> spin<00:03:27.630> more<00:03:28.319> than<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.680> necessary

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
make fans spin more than is necessary

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.190 
make fans spin more than is necessary
otherwise<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:30.209> could<00:03:30.450> shorten<00:03:30.870> their

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
otherwise you could shorten their

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.830 
otherwise you could shorten their
lifetime<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:32.579> is<00:03:32.730> also<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.090> good<00:03:33.269> idea<00:03:33.329> not<00:03:33.810> to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
lifetime it is also a good idea not to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.990 
lifetime it is also a good idea not to
