 he cleans the appliance and leaves 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.810
 the device is lighter so it can not 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.629

 it scans your device and 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.490
 has here paris accelerator closed 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.130
 because they are residual files files 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.770
 these applications you can 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.990
 install and verify the network as well 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.510
 safety and battery 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.510
 what interests us at the moment 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.510
 accelerator 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.740
 it will see how many in ram 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.530
 available when each application is 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.340
 using and will release this space 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.770
 memory 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:07.990
 then he made a clean sweep and 22% or accelerate 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:10.390
 rock after I finish and come here me 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.880
 to rubbish where it will delete everything that 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.070
 files unnecessary applications 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.470
 that are there without useless 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.750
 memory being used this need 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.630
 cash files of steel that are leftover from 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.240
 applications were installed in the 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.230
 own system and other files 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.930
 useless 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:37.780
 if you finish, you already have 800 on average 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:47.260
 of useless file almost 1 gig hit one 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:50.739
 giga ready one giga 280 averages 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.340
 here's a useless file underneath the 777 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.080
 deleting these useless things can 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.540
 make sure that after the two cleanings 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.660
 you will feel a big difference in the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.739
 your mobile phone 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.959
 applications is to exclude some 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.700
 applications you have and do not use 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.120
 but I will not discuss any because 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.160
 I already did this and network to test the 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.799
 speed of your internet I will not 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:21.520
 Pass this shame on you 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.770
 will be able to block some applications is 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.330
 can install antivirus manage 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.270
 what can be done and what 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.400
 can not be part 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.400
 he is battery 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.550
 if I'm not mistaken, ask to speak 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.770
 a new application that this one from the battery 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.990
 which I already have installed that I 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.990
 can teach you in the next video 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.150
 I hope you enjoy it there the videos 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.520
 My idea is to help everyone who 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.340
 want to share with new friends 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.340
 videos from other applications will 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.340
 so you can do more things on the channel
