because they came off the pasture when

because they came off the pasture when

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
you look at the cattle they're a biology

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.840 
you look at the cattle they're a biology
experiment<00:01:50.650> right<00:01:50.950> they're<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.250> ruminant

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850

nutrition it's different than
monogastric<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.340> can<00:01:54.490> look<00:01:54.640> at<00:01:54.729> nutrition

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
monogastric so you can look at nutrition

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.750 
monogastric so you can look at nutrition
on<00:01:55.479> how<00:01:55.630> they<00:01:55.780> eat<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.670> ingredients<00:01:57.670> that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
on how they eat and the ingredients that

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.760 
on how they eat and the ingredients that
they<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.520> there's<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.790> triangle<00:02:01.479> here<00:02:01.750> this<00:02:02.590> is

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
they so there's a triangle here this is

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.820 
they so there's a triangle here this is
her<00:02:02.920> jugular<00:02:03.310> vein<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.030> that's<00:02:04.869> her<00:02:05.140> cervical

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
her jugular vein and that's her cervical

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.680 
her jugular vein and that's her cervical
vertebrae<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.970> can<00:02:07.090> look<00:02:07.240> at<00:02:07.390> them<00:02:07.479> from

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
vertebrae you can look at them from

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.660 
vertebrae you can look at them from

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
immunological standpoint how your

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.760 
immunological standpoint how your

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.699 
vaccines prevent them from being sick
those<00:02:12.040> kind<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.310> things<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:17.350> morning<00:02:17.650> I

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
those kind of things so this morning I

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.430 
those kind of things so this morning I
vaccinated<00:02:18.459> is<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> five-way<00:02:19.290> vaccination<00:02:20.290> so

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
vaccinated is a five-way vaccination so

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.650 
vaccinated is a five-way vaccination so
that<00:02:20.590> prevented<00:02:21.070> five<00:02:21.250> different<00:02:21.790> viruses

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
that prevented five different viruses

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.460 
that prevented five different viruses
and<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.790> prevention<00:02:25.480> we<00:02:25.989> don't

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
and because of the prevention we don't

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.260 
and because of the prevention we don't
have<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.770> use<00:02:26.890> as<00:02:27.040> many<00:02:27.160> antibiotics<00:02:27.580> it's

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
have to use as many antibiotics it's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.670 
have to use as many antibiotics it's
much<00:02:28.570> more<00:02:28.750> efficient<00:02:29.170> for<00:02:29.320> us<00:02:29.440> because

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
much more efficient for us because

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.260 
much more efficient for us because
there's<00:02:29.950> less<00:02:30.160> sick<00:02:30.370> cattle<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.880> long<00:02:31.030> run

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
there's less sick cattle in the long run

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.470 
there's less sick cattle in the long run
and<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:32.320> for<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.459> health<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.820> our<00:02:33.970> animals

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
and it's for the health of our animals

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.750 
and it's for the health of our animals
should<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.350> good<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:35.680> get<00:02:35.800> Riddler<00:02:36.220> -<00:02:36.430> hunter

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
should be good we get Riddler - hunter

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.510 
should be good we get Riddler - hunter

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
definitely used in every aspect of our

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.070 
definitely used in every aspect of our
operation<00:02:42.790> at<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.540> feed<00:02:43.690> yard<00:02:43.780> we<00:02:43.930> have<00:02:44.020> a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
operation at the feed yard we have a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.170 
operation at the feed yard we have a
program<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:44.980> enter<00:02:45.310> treatments<00:02:46.060> and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
program that we enter treatments and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
vaccinations for different pens of

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.550 
vaccinations for different pens of
cattle<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.489> because<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.690> we're<00:02:50.049> able<00:02:50.230> to

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
cattle and because of that we're able to

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.380 
cattle and because of that we're able to
make<00:02:50.860> sure<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.549> withdrawal<00:02:51.730> dates<00:02:52.209> are

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
make sure that the withdrawal dates are

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.240 
make sure that the withdrawal dates are
correct<00:02:52.570> in<00:02:52.959> that<00:02:53.140> cattle<00:02:53.650> aren't<00:02:53.860> sent<00:02:54.100> to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
correct in that cattle aren't sent to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.710 
correct in that cattle aren't sent to
market<00:02:54.549> while<00:02:54.670> they're<00:02:54.820> still<00:02:55.060> antibiotics

market while they're still antibiotics

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.570 
market while they're still antibiotics
in<00:02:55.840> their<00:02:55.989> system<00:03:01.080> normally<00:03:02.080> we<00:03:02.860> just<00:03:03.190> give

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
in their system normally we just give

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.000 
in their system normally we just give
them<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.910> vaccines<00:03:04.420> but<00:03:04.750> usually<00:03:05.709> there's<00:03:05.950> a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
them the vaccines but usually there's a

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.740 
them the vaccines but usually there's a
there's<00:03:06.790> something<00:03:07.120> wrong<00:03:07.239> with<00:03:07.420> at<00:03:07.600> least

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
there's something wrong with at least

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.170 
there's something wrong with at least
one<00:03:08.140> steer<00:03:08.560> that's<00:03:08.830> other<00:03:09.070> than<00:03:09.190> that<00:03:09.549> it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
one steer that's other than that it

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.509 
one steer that's other than that it
means<00:03:10.390> vaccines<00:03:11.019> one<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.890> cattle<00:03:12.220> had<00:03:12.370> an

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
means vaccines one of the cattle had an

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.570 
means vaccines one of the cattle had an
abscess<00:03:13.049> like<00:03:14.049> right<00:03:14.440> under<00:03:14.709> his<00:03:14.830> chin<00:03:14.860> there

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
abscess like right under his chin there

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.750 
abscess like right under his chin there
so<00:03:15.730> we<00:03:15.820> had<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.150> UM<00:03:16.390> flush<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.049> out

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.040 

you<00:03:25.760> can<00:03:25.910> go<00:03:26.030> over<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.300> crop<00:03:26.480> side<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:26.990> you

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
you can go over to the crop side and you

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.540 
you can go over to the crop side and you
turn<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.260> agronomy<00:03:27.800> you<00:03:28.220> know<00:03:28.310> that's

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
turn to agronomy you know that's

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.620 
turn to agronomy you know that's
something<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.000> learn<00:03:29.030> when<00:03:29.330> you're<00:03:29.480> little

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
something you learn when you're little

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.900 
something you learn when you're little

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
and water conservation erosion I mean it

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.720 
and water conservation erosion I mean it
just<00:03:36.020> seems<00:03:36.290> like<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.650> is<00:03:36.980> all<00:03:37.250> around<00:03:37.520> this

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.670 

even<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:41.420> way<00:03:41.600> our<00:03:41.780> pens<00:03:42.080> are<00:03:42.260> designed

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
even the way our pens are designed

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.800 
even the way our pens are designed
whether<00:03:43.040> it's<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.550> slope<00:03:43.850> of<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.209> Pens<00:03:44.480> or

whether it's the slope of the Pens or

how the water runoff happens or even the

electric fence that's all physics and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.510 
electric fence that's all physics and
that's<00:03:49.910> all<00:03:50.030> science<00:03:50.510> so<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:51.160> like<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.280> said<00:03:52.489> I

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
that's all science so I like I said I

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.220 
that's all science so I like I said I
literally<00:03:53.150> live<00:03:53.450> in<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.660> science<00:03:54.019> laboratory

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230

literally live in a science laboratory
my<00:03:57.230> kids<00:03:57.560> since<00:03:58.010> they<00:03:58.220> were<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> newborn<00:03:58.580> had

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
my kids since they were a newborn had

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.759 
my kids since they were a newborn had
written<00:03:59.239> in<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.480> saddle<00:03:59.750> with<00:03:59.959> me<00:04:00.200> at<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.560> feed

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
written in a saddle with me at the feed

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.170 
written in a saddle with me at the feed
yard<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.280> they've<00:04:01.459> looked<00:04:01.670> at<00:04:01.820> stairs

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
yard and so they've looked at stairs

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.350 
yard and so they've looked at stairs
every<00:04:02.690> day<00:04:02.870> since<00:04:03.380> they<00:04:03.709> were<00:04:04.130> little<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:05.090> so

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
every day since they were little and so

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.740 
every day since they were little and so
steers<00:04:05.690> are<00:04:05.900> what<00:04:06.050> they<00:04:06.260> do<00:04:06.319> I<00:04:06.970> go<00:04:07.970> with<00:04:08.120> listen

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
steers are what they do I go with listen

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.900 
steers are what they do I go with listen
we<00:04:08.900> ride<00:04:09.170> pens<00:04:09.590> at<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.920> feed<00:04:10.100> in<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.519> mornings

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
we ride pens at the feed in the mornings

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.440 
we ride pens at the feed in the mornings
and<00:04:11.060> check<00:04:11.269> for<00:04:11.300> sick<00:04:11.810> her<00:04:12.110> her<00:04:12.830> cattle<00:04:13.760> also

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
and check for sick her her cattle also

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.440 
and check for sick her her cattle also
every<00:04:14.780> morning<00:04:15.140> we<00:04:15.260> wash<00:04:15.590> our<00:04:15.970> 4-h<00:04:16.970> show

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.870 
every morning we wash our 4-h show
cattle<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.440> brush<00:04:18.709> them<00:04:18.889> up<00:04:19.010> just<00:04:19.459> working

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
cattle and brush them up just working

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
in a little bit and so he's evaluating a

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.820 
in a little bit and so he's evaluating a
good<00:04:41.000> structure<00:04:41.540> he<00:04:41.810> wants<00:04:42.080> good<00:04:42.230> balance<00:04:42.650> he

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
good structure he wants good balance he

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.740 
good structure he wants good balance he
wants<00:04:43.040> a<00:04:43.100> thickness<00:04:43.340> throughout<00:04:44.060> from<00:04:44.360> his

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
wants a thickness throughout from his

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.480 
wants a thickness throughout from his
rear<00:04:44.990> all<00:04:45.170> the<00:04:45.290> way<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.470> his<00:04:45.740> shoulder<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:46.400> you

the main part of your tenderloin your
prime<00:04:50.900> rib<00:04:50.930> that's<00:04:51.350> where<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.800> comes<00:04:52.100> from

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
prime rib that's where that comes from

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.670 
prime rib that's where that comes from
oh<00:04:55.090> so<00:04:56.090> what<00:04:56.240> we<00:04:56.420> did<00:04:56.570> we<00:04:56.750> had<00:04:56.900> about<00:04:57.170> six

oh so what we did we had about six
different<00:04:58.150> animals<00:04:59.150> there<00:04:59.390> was<00:04:59.540> a<00:04:59.570> market<00:05:00.200> and

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
different animals there was a market and

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.200 
different animals there was a market and
a<00:05:00.470> breeding<00:05:00.860> for<00:05:01.010> each<00:05:01.130> type<00:05:01.400> of<00:05:01.430> animal<00:05:02.000> and

a breeding for each type of animal and

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.540 
a breeding for each type of animal and
we<00:05:02.990> just<00:05:03.230> had<00:05:03.350> to<00:05:03.470> pick<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.860> best<00:05:03.890> one<00:05:04.370> that

we just had to pick the best one that
would<00:05:04.700> suit<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.150> for<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.600> thing<00:05:05.900> like<00:05:06.080> you'd

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
would suit it for that thing like you'd

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.160 
would suit it for that thing like you'd
pick<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.130> largest<00:05:07.670> animal<00:05:08.630> with<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.900> best

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.080 
clinic goes I've been taught Anatomy
since<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.750> was<00:05:17.960> three<00:05:18.590> just<00:05:19.190> watching<00:05:19.640> them<00:05:19.820> and

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
since I was three just watching them and

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:32.830 
since I was three just watching them and
learning<00:05:20.510> from<00:05:20.780> them

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.379 

the<00:05:33.840> Spay<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.289> we<00:05:34.410> did<00:05:34.620> i've<00:05:34.949> helped<00:05:35.490> mom<00:05:35.699> do

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
the Spay that we did i've helped mom do

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.640 
the Spay that we did i've helped mom do
those<00:05:36.630> space<00:05:36.960> for<00:05:37.430> many<00:05:38.430> years<00:05:38.819> and<00:05:39.150> i<00:05:39.650> learn

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
those space for many years and i learn

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.540 
those space for many years and i learn
about<00:05:41.240> suturing<00:05:42.500> their<00:05:43.500> little<00:05:43.830> minds<00:05:44.099> ever

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
about suturing their little minds ever

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.159 
about suturing their little minds ever
since<00:05:44.940> they<00:05:45.120> were<00:05:45.150> little<00:05:45.300> when<00:05:45.720> ryan<00:05:45.960> would

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
since they were little when ryan would

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.620 
since they were little when ryan would
be<00:05:46.259> doing<00:05:46.500> a<00:05:46.590> necropsy<00:05:46.979> on<00:05:47.160> a<00:05:47.250> calf<00:05:47.550> what<00:05:48.300> organ

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
be doing a necropsy on a calf what organ

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.230 
be doing a necropsy on a calf what organ
is<00:05:48.780> that<00:05:49.020> how<00:05:49.349> does<00:05:49.410> that<00:05:49.560> organ<00:05:50.099> function<00:05:50.639> he

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
is that how does that organ function he

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.629 
is that how does that organ function he
did<00:05:51.690> life<00:05:52.199> science<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:52.949> anatomy<00:05:53.430> and

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
did life science and anatomy and

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.309 
did life science and anatomy and
physiology<00:05:53.819> as<00:05:54.599> they<00:05:55.020> went<00:05:57.319> critical

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
physiology as they went critical

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.140 
physiology as they went critical
thinking<00:05:58.710> is<00:05:58.889> something<00:05:59.069> i<00:05:59.310> want<00:05:59.490> my<00:05:59.669> kids<00:05:59.729> to

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
thinking is something i want my kids to

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.129 
thinking is something i want my kids to
learn<00:06:00.300> more<00:06:00.690> than<00:06:00.840> anything<00:06:01.050> and<00:06:01.409> that<00:06:01.560> goes

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
learn more than anything and that goes

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.930 
learn more than anything and that goes
beyond<00:06:04.139> the<00:06:04.289> farm<00:06:04.590> whether<00:06:04.830> you<00:06:05.460> know<00:06:05.550> just

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
beyond the farm whether you know just

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.809 
beyond the farm whether you know just
thinking<00:06:06.650> critically<00:06:07.650> about<00:06:07.800> does<00:06:08.699> this

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
thinking critically about does this

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.390 
thinking critically about does this
process<00:06:09.300> make<00:06:09.509> sense<00:06:09.840> or<00:06:10.080> should<00:06:10.830> I<00:06:10.949> do<00:06:11.009> this

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
process make sense or should I do this

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.839 
process make sense or should I do this
or<00:06:11.699> not

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
or not

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:18.740 
or not
I<00:06:16.400> think<00:06:17.400> there's<00:06:17.849> absolutely<00:06:18.330> no<00:06:18.539> comparison

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
I think there's absolutely no comparison

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.779 
I think there's absolutely no comparison
to<00:06:19.380> actually<00:06:19.800> just<00:06:20.099> doing<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:20.520> work<00:06:20.610> and

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
to actually just doing the work and

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.460 
to actually just doing the work and
watching<00:06:21.090> it<00:06:21.180> happen<00:06:21.210> there's<00:06:21.659> no<00:06:21.900> way<00:06:22.110> that

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
watching it happen there's no way that

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.939 
watching it happen there's no way that
you<00:06:23.009> can<00:06:23.419> learn<00:06:24.419> that<00:06:24.479> by<00:06:24.990> sitting<00:06:25.830> in<00:06:25.860> a

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
you can learn that by sitting in a

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.110 
you can learn that by sitting in a
classroom<00:06:26.159> and<00:06:26.340> having<00:06:26.610> somebody<00:06:26.759> tell<00:06:27.090> you

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
classroom and having somebody tell you

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.089 
classroom and having somebody tell you
that<00:06:27.240> I<00:06:27.599> think<00:06:28.259> that<00:06:28.440> since<00:06:28.710> I've<00:06:28.860> grown<00:06:29.070> up

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
that I think that since I've grown up

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.490 
that I think that since I've grown up
with<00:06:29.400> my<00:06:29.430> parents<00:06:30.000> I've<00:06:30.389> learned<00:06:30.930> so<00:06:31.289> much

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
with my parents I've learned so much

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.219 
with my parents I've learned so much
just<00:06:31.949> basic<00:06:32.789> problem-solving<00:06:33.690> that<00:06:33.900> I<00:06:33.960> don't

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
just basic problem-solving that I don't

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.800 
just basic problem-solving that I don't
think<00:06:34.440> you<00:06:34.590> get<00:06:34.919> what<00:06:35.759> if<00:06:35.940> you're<00:06:36.120> not<00:06:36.270> in<00:06:36.659> the

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
think you get what if you're not in the

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.019 
think you get what if you're not in the
workforce

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029 
workforce

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:45.379 
camera so make sure are they on zero and
I<00:06:43.139> think<00:06:43.379> through<00:06:43.529> problems<00:06:43.939> solving<00:06:44.939> I<00:06:45.089> think

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
I think through problems solving I think
