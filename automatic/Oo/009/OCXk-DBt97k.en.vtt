00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.640
 Well and that's what it's all about today and the Wadden Sea in the Wadden Sea is ours 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.130
 Theme today in the only environmental lottery 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.380
 a unique habitat for several months World Heritage Site by UNESCO 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.049
 Who he is while he sees at first glance but only mud and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.689
 silt 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.880
 However, many innumerable living things can be found in it 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.099
 but where exactly do you find the Kirsten less wanted to know that and have 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.539
 that sometimes by a professional show that by the head of 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.539
 National Park house Lake Como 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.850
 that is very quiet now 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.890
 and listen 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.010
 and look like Erftstadt 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.760
 to buy the whole forest 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.760
 but everywhere you see what you do about everything 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.330
 There are some dance music then 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.540
 the beach chairs are at home 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.540
 your life more than 2000 species of animals 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.680
 You can see that at first glance 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 Secrets of the Wadden Sea lie deep down in the gray temples 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.729
 By the way, you do not like the black lugworm in the fresh air 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.189
 Air and not very nice I'm overwhelmed 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.110
 Now everyone is waiting here in the water 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.500
 He wants to go back to the dark fast 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.790
 because there he constantly eats the mudflat soil which is extremely nutrient-poor 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.910
 mandatory 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.070
 On a square centimeter of seabed life millions of the smallest living things like that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.280
 Small that you can hardly imagine 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 and that starts here once 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.330
 It's getting closer to the source dapd to tell their children 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
 The National Park from Dornumersiel learns more about all the animals 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.090
 take a close look and buy more weapons in the microcosm 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.220
 that is the well-perfused nervous system of Israel Worms 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.340
 and here we see so-called barnacles a cancer at breakfast 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 they are just leaving plankton and microorganisms 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.130
 but it is even smaller 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.980
 beating countless diatoms in just one droplet can be observed 408 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.459
 and there are in the Wadden Sea 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.769
 are plants that move themselves 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.919
 they do photosynthesis and produce like the forest constantly 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.109
 oxygen 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.809
 soon there will be a lot more here in the village 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.109
 Experienced Wadden Sea 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.979
 that he became the first national park for children 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.089
 because they should preserve the natural Wadden Sea in the future 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.109
 With the support of Bingo the house is completely rebuilt 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.789
 and next May because it will be new none
