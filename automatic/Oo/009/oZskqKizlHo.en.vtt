developed by dana hall I have to the
circuitry<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.500> work<00:01:17.920> with<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.280> amp<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
circuitry to work with this amp the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.529 
circuitry to work with this amp the
cabinetry<00:01:20.649> is<00:01:20.920> solid<00:01:21.490> finger<00:01:21.850> jointed<00:01:22.270> pine

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
cabinetry is solid finger jointed pine

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.609 
cabinetry is solid finger jointed pine
and<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:24.009> are<00:01:24.190> using<00:01:24.460> only<00:01:24.910> hide<00:01:25.390> glue<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:26.320> glue

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
and we are using only hide glue to glue

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.639 
and we are using only hide glue to glue
the<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.759> Tweed<00:01:28.030> onto<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.660> cabinetry<00:01:29.229> because

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
the the Tweed onto the cabinetry because

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.950 
the the Tweed onto the cabinetry because
high<00:01:29.979> glue<00:01:30.250> dries<00:01:30.580> much<00:01:30.910> harder<00:01:31.330> is<00:01:31.479> much<00:01:31.780> more

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
high glue dries much harder is much more

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.529 
high glue dries much harder is much more
resonant<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.619> tone<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.729> cabinet<00:01:34.179> is<00:01:34.300> part

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
resonant in tone so the cabinet is part

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.810 
resonant in tone so the cabinet is part
of<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.720> tone<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.619> particular<00:01:36.220> ant<00:01:36.429> features
