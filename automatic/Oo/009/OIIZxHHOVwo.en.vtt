 ajax that in the cup final that 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.270
 turns out to be a simple one for us but it is always one again 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.059
 performance it is always nice to be close to the main prize 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.840

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.090
 was then also played in the cockpit 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.210
 at ajax, a team then had a sort of mix of the old routine from the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.210
 glory days of the beginning of the decade 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.059
 the legs a series 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.330
 takes shape from rooms and 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.320
 arneses 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.390
 no striker after the count 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 but it seemed like we had taken over the year before 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.760
 meets the joker for speed vineyard who certainly knew why 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.020
 well where needed mention in those small growers make someone how can I 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020

 the final of 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.670
 the NFL cup 2 over two matches that was not the intention but the NFL 

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:46.229
 had determined that if the final would end right and he did that in the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.090
 cockpit was against FC Twente 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.270
 always promising fc twente with the one also after extension two weeks later 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.570
 match had to be played 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 it went a lot better at ajax 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.520
 the hague 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.520

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.199
 this role of a quarter percent delay Jan Krol 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.369

 cross first pole clear, the brake 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.409
 when i was a little ciman 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.409
 it was getting smaller but good simon tahamata 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.819
 a long shot 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
 tamata 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.159

 a good technique also have the stairs than rock hard stairs 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.159
 that was it 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.959
 actually 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.479
 kramer the death blow for the frequent 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.979
 you go to rest with a 0 0 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.459
 a lot of twente that they might be able to make it right but 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.739
 short after 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.759
 after the second half the score simon 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.539
 it was 2 0 it had actually been played for a long time and then it became 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:32.839
 profession of moment I think 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:37.319
 of the competition and the waste from farther stood fuel on his knee 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.059
 just not quite good washing installation actually lay dick schooner 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.279
 walked a position decided a bit on the foot an end I probably had 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.209
 missed and

 bakery house stand still a lot 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.479
 in short, write 3 0 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.239
 can go a bit lower 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.089
 what a monster 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:14.109
 Utah 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.069
 that could actually make this a bit 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.430
 illogical I was pretty hard to head the ball 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.309
 anyway it was one of my qualities 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.309
 then scored with the head 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.629
 it's incredibly important 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.219
 the honoring you will find a suspension

 we know that wishes 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:26.789
 that's normal 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.900
 tradition we must have been there several young possible 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.860
 can not we 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.779
 by working hard 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.990
 inside the Dutch cup 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.879
 to take into account 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.879
 Bart was the average weaver 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:43.969

 the team up and running 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.680
 partly because of that
