00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.710 

it's<00:00:01.369> just<00:00:01.579> making<00:00:01.790> the<00:00:01.969> most<00:00:02.060> of<00:00:02.389> what<00:00:02.449> we've

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:02.720 
it's just making the most of what we've

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.940 
it's just making the most of what we've
got<00:00:02.929> we've<00:00:03.260> got<00:00:03.290> to<00:00:03.679> just<00:00:04.569> keep<00:00:05.590> digging<00:00:06.590> away

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
got we've got to just keep digging away

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.039 
got we've got to just keep digging away
at<00:00:07.099> it<00:00:07.250> it's<00:00:07.580> hard<00:00:08.240> when<00:00:08.480> it's<00:00:08.629> so<00:00:08.780> light<00:00:09.019> and

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
at it it's hard when it's so light and

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.650 
at it it's hard when it's so light and
it's<00:00:09.290> so<00:00:09.440> hot<00:00:09.679> but<00:00:10.070> we're<00:00:10.940> seeing<00:00:11.089> the<00:00:11.269> benefit

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
it's so hot but we're seeing the benefit

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.850 
it's so hot but we're seeing the benefit
of<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:11.929> hard<00:00:12.110> work<00:00:12.289> now

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
of the hard work now

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.289 
of the hard work now
and<00:00:12.950> I<00:00:13.039> think<00:00:13.099> that<00:00:13.400> gives<00:00:13.669> everyone<00:00:13.910> a<00:00:13.999> bit<00:00:14.240> of

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
and I think that gives everyone a bit of

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.020 
and I think that gives everyone a bit of
a<00:00:14.329> positive<00:00:14.809> edge<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.790> encouragement<00:00:16.790> to<00:00:16.880> do

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.030 
a positive edge to encouragement to do

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.050 
a positive edge to encouragement to do
better<00:00:17.360> and<00:00:17.570> do<00:00:17.750> more<00:00:17.960> of<00:00:17.990> it<00:00:18.290> so<00:00:19.160> that<00:00:19.880> should

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
better and do more of it so that should

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.370 
better and do more of it so that should
be<00:00:20.150> good<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:20.480> get<00:00:20.660> us<00:00:20.750> through<00:00:20.870> the<00:00:20.930> next<00:00:21.020> 24

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
be good and get us through the next 24

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.500 
be good and get us through the next 24
hours<00:00:21.590> which<00:00:21.770> is<00:00:21.830> going<00:00:21.920> to<00:00:21.980> be<00:00:22.070> tricky<00:00:22.390> so<00:00:23.390> we

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
hours which is going to be tricky so we

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.530 
hours which is going to be tricky so we
have<00:00:23.600> a<00:00:23.630> theory<00:00:24.220> with<00:00:25.220> with<00:00:26.180> a<00:00:26.210> few<00:00:26.420> of<00:00:26.480> the

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
have a theory with with a few of the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.930 
have a theory with with a few of the
boys<00:00:26.690> on<00:00:26.870> our<00:00:26.960> of<00:00:27.050> America<00:00:27.700> that<00:00:28.700> we<00:00:28.790> have<00:00:28.820> a

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
boys on our of America that we have a

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.880 
boys on our of America that we have a
big<00:00:29.150> bungy<00:00:29.570> big<00:00:29.810> big<00:00:30.140> elastic<00:00:30.560> put<00:00:30.650> a<00:00:30.710> rope

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
big bungy big big elastic put a rope

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.220 
big bungy big big elastic put a rope
between<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:31.310> two<00:00:31.460> boats<00:00:31.719> every<00:00:32.719> time<00:00:32.929> one

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
between the two boats every time one

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.040 
between the two boats every time one
boat<00:00:33.469> goes<00:00:33.679> ahead<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.179> other<00:00:35.629> boat<00:00:35.839> gets

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
boat goes ahead the other boat gets

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.810 
boat goes ahead the other boat gets
pulled<00:00:36.289> up<00:00:36.379> to<00:00:36.589> it<00:00:36.679> and<00:00:36.829> vice<00:00:37.249> versa<00:00:37.519> and<00:00:37.699> then

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
pulled up to it and vice versa and then

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.399 
pulled up to it and vice versa and then
we<00:00:37.940> sling<00:00:38.179> apart<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.719> life<00:00:38.870> again

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.409 
we sling apart and the life again

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.169 
we sling apart and the life again
it<00:00:40.159> would<00:00:40.280> appear<00:00:40.519> it's<00:00:40.640> working<00:00:40.940> quite<00:00:41.059> well

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:41.179 
it would appear it's working quite well

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.139 
it would appear it's working quite well
in<00:00:41.839> this<00:00:42.019> race<00:00:42.249> even<00:00:43.249> after<00:00:43.460> they<00:00:43.550> stopped<00:00:43.850> to

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
in this race even after they stopped to

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.470 
in this race even after they stopped to
stand<00:00:44.390> by<00:00:44.539> Vestas<00:00:44.929> their<00:00:46.059> shock<00:00:47.059> cord<00:00:47.300> their

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
stand by Vestas their shock cord their

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.279 
stand by Vestas their shock cord their
way<00:00:47.600> back<00:00:47.809> into<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.230> race<00:00:48.409> nicely<00:00:50.109> we<00:00:51.109> just

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
way back into the race nicely we just

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.329 
way back into the race nicely we just
got<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:51.469> work<00:00:51.589> out<00:00:51.710> how<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:51.859> use<00:00:51.979> it<00:00:52.159> for<00:00:52.249> good

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
got to work out how to use it for good

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.430 
got to work out how to use it for good
not<00:00:52.460> evil<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.120> slingshot<00:00:53.749> ourselves<00:00:54.199> plus

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
not evil and slingshot ourselves plus

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:20.270 
not evil and slingshot ourselves plus
the<00:00:54.620> whole<00:00:54.739> fleet

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.390 

I<00:01:20.750> think<00:01:21.750> because<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.530> live<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.830> such<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.040> salt

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
I think because we live in such a salt

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.560 
I think because we live in such a salt
environment

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
environment

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510 
environment
whenever<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.440> a<00:01:25.500> range<00:01:25.740> now<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.280> fresh

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
whenever you get a range now it's fresh

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.030 
whenever you get a range now it's fresh
water<00:01:26.550> and<00:01:27.120> just<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.680> difference<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.860> having

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
water and just the difference of having

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.060 
water and just the difference of having
a<00:01:29.250> fresh<00:01:29.490> water<00:01:29.960> rinse<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.500> being<00:01:31.950> able

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
a fresh water rinse or just being able

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.920 
a fresh water rinse or just being able
to<00:01:32.220> watch<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.700> salt<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.540> body<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.900> just

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
to watch the salt your body is just

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.920 
to watch the salt your body is just
amazing<00:01:34.620> thing<00:01:34.830> is<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.240> main<00:01:36.720> song

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
amazing thing is that the main song

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
amazing thing is that the main song
makes<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.200> good<00:01:37.380> catcher<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> good

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
makes a good catcher and get a good

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.510 
makes a good catcher and get a good
little<00:01:39.090> wash<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.080> boom<00:01:40.290> after<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
little wash up in the boom after the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.200 
little wash up in the boom after the
rain<00:01:42.290> about<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.440> take<00:01:43.590> places<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.970> what<00:01:45.180> I
