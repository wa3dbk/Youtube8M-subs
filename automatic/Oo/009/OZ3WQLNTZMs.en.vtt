00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 just like this we started the week then 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.069
 good as we all know the end of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.599
 Sunday morning in the morning good 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.519
 I say as we all know it as a place 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.639
 common, not because it became very public 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.100
 but Monday on Sunday morning in 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.650
 a clash was nazario killed 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 Moreno Gonzalez the most crazy 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.630
 doctor of the many nicknames nicknames 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.400
 that the chayo was arrested because 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.140
 let's say in this confrontation and the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.090
 headed the family group 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 michoacana and then it became a 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.840
 important ideologist of the knights 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.300
 Templars' where is this great 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.870
 story that is good first is a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.620
 great story despite beating a very very 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.629
 important and outstanding leader of a group 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 of drug dealers the knights 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.250
 Templars but the second thing is the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.730
 story that we all bring to mind 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.719
 these days is that the chayo on the 9th of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.550
 December 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.829
 he knows for dead on 10 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.369
 December was officially informed of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.720
 2010 that had also died killed in 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.880
 a confrontation 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.800
 information, look, it was not any 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.350
 person was the Secretary of the Interior 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.570
 President Calderón Alejandro Poiré 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.650
 who said he had been killed gave 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 the reasons this palomino enclosure gave 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.200
 the information the gentleman this garcía moon 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.130
 he also said something in the end everyone said 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.650
 that the guy had been killed 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.750
 the years passed and suddenly in Morelia 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.840
 in michoacán in general he started doing 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.600
 as a vox populi he was alive he 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 the chayo who lived there and was given 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.380
 his laps and he was going here over there 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.900
 and everywhere and it was everywhere what 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.400
 at first it seemed like a 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.320
 kind of legend was becoming 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.229
 in a reality because there were people who already 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.540
 I could give precise data about him 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.880
 then what comes to pass as already 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.740
 we know is that this confrontation 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.930
 they are limiting the government of peña 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.509
 grandson ends up saying he does not have 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.670
 elements to say that he is dead and 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.580
 good all begin to realize a 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.220
 conclude the morning of Sunday very 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.350
 early when he is downcast what it is that 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.780
 happens with all this that is that the great 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.470
 the one of a matter is that this fact 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.810
 puts in a very questionable structure 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.050
 very questionable to the government of Calderón 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.390
 in terms of security because look for 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.010
 example the kidnapping of US rubén 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.200
 omar roman requested when the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.130
 trainer of the blue cross was kidnapped 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.140
 this and it was a very painful affair well 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.240
 It resolved but was a start 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.850
 scene the staging was that the 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.670
 Roman did as if he came out in that 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.500
 precise moment of being released and 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.880
 then there were the drivers 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.950
 important of the television networks 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.230
 As if that were possible, I would 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.170
 we know the release of a kidnapped 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.180
 can not be called into question and does not 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.980
 you can place the television there 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.510
 the risks that this entails imagine 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.520
 that you can control or that there is someone 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.050
 hidden that they have not seen or something 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.730
 of this nature has released a 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.320
 shoot that what you want to put in 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.180
 so it has either in the case of 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.640
 florence cassez staging in 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.640
 scene staging many many 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.370
 cases that have been precisely that 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.200
 calling what draws the attention of 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.160
 the strategy that the government of 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.590
 pilot 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.840
 the michoacanazo simply 3 more than 30 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.090
 people arrested and a good part of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.680
 they arrested under the argument of a 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 protected witness that it seems that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.180
 they were in many places at the same 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.150
 time like now yes boston believe me 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.970
 not omnipresent in the above then 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.680
 here what there are are two things 1 yesterday 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.860
 They tried to tell us that the chayo is 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.120
 the boy no and second we must leave 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.160
 things as they are in that let's say 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.790
 good already appeared and ready 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.680
 should be investigated who were the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.630
 that they left him for dead and on what basis 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.490
 they gave him for dead because in the background 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.620
 there is something that is very strong what is 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.660
 very strong is that we could reach the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.270
 conclusion that many of the things 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.260
 what happened in the past sexennium 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.970
 they had as methodology 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.610
 situations similar to those of the chayo 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.620
 and it's not going to be that the time is that 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.109
 those that appear to us alive not and then 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.400
 we go there we took it in sabinas there 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.229
 for a coahuila not that was where 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.210
 they achieved a baseball game and it turns out 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.340
 that the time the ask to that of the cd 's 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.130
 the zetas because he was not dead because 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.169
 remember you had it could not 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.120
 identify the fullness and at nine 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.680
 the night at a funeral home a group arrived 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.090
 armed and took him away he took the corpse 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.650
 and of course, what I would say is 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.270
 very important yesterday and there is no need 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.250
 to skimp is very important about the 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.750
 Chapo beyond the declarations of 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.520
 saviano that an agreement between the 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.500
 May and Chapo these things that now 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.770
 as they try a bit to interpret 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.000
 very singularly what happened to 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.560
 I think that is important 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.860
 detention and I think it 's important 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.389
 the one that has killed the kid but what 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.789
 what important business is that it continues 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.979
 having two earrings one there 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.630
 behind the arrest of the chapo wants 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.510
 say what are the characters that 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.100
 they allowed this scaffolding and second who 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.300
 will be responsible or who are 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.699
 those responsible for having taken 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.229
 died a character that also came out in 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.950
 everyone that had arrested him and 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.780
 result 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.240
 that the dead man was not dead but that 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.310
 I was walking around Michoacán near 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.650
 hawk and now the dead do not if 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.720
 they say that if it's dead good there's 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.790
 I send greetings starting the week by 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.130
 true and if you can see a valued 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.870
 Tenth interview we had with Andrew 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.130
