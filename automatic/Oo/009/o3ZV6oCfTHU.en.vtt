00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.690
 abel went with fly 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.140
 it's called was filled no no it's not that it's 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.140
 singing 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.309
 the screen broke 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.160
 I do not know if I have enough run 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.850
 saw the goal or is it like that, it's already 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.410
 we go 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.470
 the back ones have more run than 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.400
 I good 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.400
 See you later 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.890
 because the bullet is going to fall badly that you 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.270
 you play no no no 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.520
 OK 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.790
 is not the goal tim here you know that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.500
 imagine that the first key to the goal 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.500
 of the goal is easy 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:53.040
 it's not that I wear it I get nervous god 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.660
 okay I see the goal planets I'll stay 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.320
 first I will arrive without more 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.320
 - tiny 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.760
 so you just have one foot out of the air 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.090
 It has to be so that's it stinks you 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.560
 your feet and you're giving yourself a little 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.550
 stalled a little the idea mother my uncle 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.190
 I can see you in person not 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.150
 true 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.590
 aziz but tour can rotate and that has 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.759
 that I just saw embedded inside the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.759
 fourth quarter map 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.850
 I want to see how you get the point every 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.840
 point 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.630
 that's how you do the bullet 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.780
 we just caught 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.170
 and now suddenly wand stick 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.030
 you want to see how it turns 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.200
 it's a little bit down 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.719
 you are very bad at doing that 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.510

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:06.210
 let a tomato 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:08.680
 you have to do 1 bullet in action and 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.110
 enfilaban is rather goes up a little 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.670

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.690

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.300
 little raises a little in us so much 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.300
 a little better 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.950
 if I had the command in my hand that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 we have very bad 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.880
 down 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.430

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.950
