00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.900
 good to all and to all 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.050
 today I bring you alex 3 kimonos well 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.050
 what 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.649
 good that you know that this is the second 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.109
 Once you give alcohol because I do not know why 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:29.239
 my camera but the camera has not 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.980
 recorded because as you know you will have a 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.680
 clip that I'll put on how I'm left 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.930
 our friends the clothes while I go 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.430
 explaining in good agreement first is 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.149
 Hence this is the least I 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.449
 like the last non-black bands 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.110
 transparent so black and the exchange 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.449
 could the lace not bad the nice 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.140
 but I think it has the lace in some 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.750
 areas that do not quite look at all 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.690
 but hey it's my first one in the photo to 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.350
 say twice as long in reality 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.170
 it's twice as short so good things 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.430
 that pass between 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 and nothing is a fabric like this this seems like 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.290
 lace seems to be stained with 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.060
 water and it will break right away 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.670
 to see is not bad but I more than 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 knowing I more than five euros is already 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.119
 too much for this I did not approve the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.850
 second team is not this one here is a 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.430
 cream and black kimono because no 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.440
 it's white if you look closely it's not white 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.569
 it's all a very close-up white 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.550
 so the whites if you put on a 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.340
 Basic white shirt below goes to 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.159
 stay but because it seems that it is not 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.380
 block is not bad this team does not 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.610
 I really like the fabric because it has 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.229
 much fall and also weighs for this from 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.580
 down here then it makes it fall from 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.180
 a very cool way has as a 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:08.090
 an edge like that all over the bottom 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:10.280
 as well as crochet I do not know I think then 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.730
 it comes pretty well topped by all 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.380
 the sides and it does not get very nice 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.480
 with any bar I want you to put on 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.880
 a black basic t-shirt or trousers 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.690
 black I do not know I think it looks very good 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.390
 stylized so much and gives a touch like that 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.130
 different I like it a lot if the last 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.550
 team can not teach or dresses 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.510
 here that is one with a floral print and 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.420
 fringes on the bottom 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.019
 it's a beautiful kimono they gave me with a 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.709
 psoe label do not know what to put 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.709
 at 80 euros 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.920
 the sleeve is this wide mother we have left 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.990
 more or less above the elbow doing 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.330
 then what I really like about this is 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.980
 that has this black band as well as more 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.099
 durita that like that marks the kimono 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.480
 I do not know I think it's very beautiful 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.610
 especially for me I always go for 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.020
 black then with this you add 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.630
 a touch of color after 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.420
 it's a very soft fabric there are many 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.150
 rights is giving me the time and the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.630
 bottom part is what is super nice 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.540
 that ends like this 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.510
 how bad that these fringes when you 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.850
 hooks with ado minimally begin to 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.220
 open up and then something by you go 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.790
 walking and they have a fringe that takes you 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.730
 good soil is what has little things 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.950
 of these reflexes and above analysis but 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.870
 I love this one 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.360
 Well guys that almost these are my 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.430
 I do not know how excited I am 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.140
 with the swindles in succession and in fact 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.610
 I have two or three more in the crisis 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.640
 that I love and that this is 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.430
 retained tell me which one you liked the most 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.400

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.410
 know that the left links here 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.750

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.190
