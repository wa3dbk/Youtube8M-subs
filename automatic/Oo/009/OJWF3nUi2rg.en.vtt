yeah<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.250> think<00:01:37.550> um<00:01:37.760> you<00:01:38.480> know<00:01:38.570> guys<00:01:38.810> have

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
yeah I think um you know guys have

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.470 
yeah I think um you know guys have
played<00:01:39.200> up<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.560> down<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:40.850> go<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.120> give<00:01:41.270> Josh<00:01:41.450> a

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
lot of credit hasn't been there very

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.590 
lot of credit hasn't been there very
long<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.760> I<00:01:43.790> think<00:01:43.880> for<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.300> circumstances

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
and comics yeah i think is faster you

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.369 
and comics yeah i think is faster you
know<00:02:53.040> he's<00:02:53.730> more<00:02:54.030> elusive<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:55.080> know<00:02:55.170> when<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
know he's more elusive you know when the

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.790 
know he's more elusive you know when the
plate<00:02:55.560> breaks<00:02:55.830> down<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:57.200> know<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.410> it's

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
plate breaks down you know and so it's

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.949 
plate breaks down you know and so it's
pretty<00:02:59.010> amazing<00:02:59.250> usually<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.540> gotta<00:03:00.690> replace

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
pretty amazing usually you gotta replace

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.080 
pretty amazing usually you gotta replace
the<00:03:01.140> guy<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.260> leaves<00:03:01.590> early<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.129> yet<00:03:02.940> some

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
off that they've actually improved

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.339 
off that they've actually improved
today's<00:03:05.430> practice<00:03:05.640> had<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> very<00:03:06.209> fast<00:03:06.720> pace<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
today's practice had a very fast pace to

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.839 
today's practice had a very fast pace to
it<00:03:07.500> how<00:03:07.830> do<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:07.950> plan<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.160> carry<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.519> serious

any<00:03:11.550> time<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.120> play<00:03:12.300> up-tempo<00:03:12.480> teams

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
any time that you play up-tempo teams

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.900 
any time that you play up-tempo teams
you're<00:03:13.709> trying<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.980> create<00:03:14.160> practice<00:03:14.700> that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
you're trying to create practice that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.509 
you're trying to create practice that
way<00:03:15.060> as<00:03:15.930> we<00:03:16.080> have<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.319> last<00:03:16.500> two<00:03:16.709> weeks<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.280> we

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
way as we have the last two weeks and we

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.949 
way as we have the last two weeks and we
do<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.819> in<00:03:17.940> general<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.299> don't<00:03:18.330> wait<00:03:18.569> till<00:03:18.780> we

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
do that in general we don't wait till we

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.530 
do that in general we don't wait till we
play<00:03:19.140> those<00:03:19.319> type<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.560> teams<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:21.330> know<00:03:21.360> so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
play those type of teams you know so

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.120 
play those type of teams you know so
that<00:03:21.569> hopefully<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.200> resembles<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.860> game<00:03:23.010> as

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
that hopefully it resembles the game as

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.270 
that hopefully it resembles the game as
much<00:03:23.160> as<00:03:23.370> we<00:03:23.519> can<00:03:23.700> coach

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
in the country came in

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.960 
in the country came in
everybody<00:03:43.330> out

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.580 

further<00:03:46.180> than<00:03:46.270> their<00:03:46.390> first-half<00:03:46.840> scoring<00:03:46.990> a

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
further than their first-half scoring a

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.610 
further than their first-half scoring a
method

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
method

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.650 
method
in<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:49.980> first<00:03:50.220> half<00:03:50.400> so

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
in the first half so

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.030 
in the first half so
we<00:03:52.020> have<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.320> be<00:03:52.350> ready<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.740> think<00:03:52.950> our

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
we have to be ready and I think our

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.750 
we have to be ready and I think our
players<00:03:53.550> are<00:03:56.600> two<00:03:57.600> men<00:03:57.780> back<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:58.770> he<00:03:58.980> goes

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
players are two men back so he goes

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.429 
players are two men back so he goes

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.230 

I<00:06:46.050> do<00:06:46.590> I<00:06:46.919> think<00:06:47.160> he<00:06:47.220> gets<00:06:47.370> lost<00:06:47.610> on<00:06:47.789> the<00:06:47.910> numbers

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
I do I think he gets lost on the numbers

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.930 
I do I think he gets lost on the numbers
because<00:06:48.919> he's<00:06:49.919> heard<00:06:50.190> me<00:06:50.340> say<00:06:50.490> before<00:06:50.520> I<00:06:50.759> think

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
because he's heard me say before I think

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.679 
because he's heard me say before I think
the<00:06:51.030> most<00:06:51.180> important

that staff is average for play you know

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:59.759
