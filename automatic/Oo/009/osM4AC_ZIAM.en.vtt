you<00:00:00.450> know<00:00:01.370> to<00:00:02.370> me<00:00:02.720> nimpah<00:00:03.720> fishing<00:00:04.080> is

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
you know to me nimpah fishing is

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.670 
you know to me nimpah fishing is
probably<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:05.569> know<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.660> lot<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:06.990> people<00:00:07.440> think

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
probably I know a lot of people think

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.749 
probably I know a lot of people think
it's<00:00:09.019> mindless<00:00:10.019> bobber<00:00:10.500> chase<00:00:10.980> or<00:00:11.280> something

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
it's mindless bobber chase or something

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.320 
it's mindless bobber chase or something
I<00:00:11.969> suppose<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.719> could<00:00:12.900> make<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:14.330> relay

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
I suppose you could make it that relay

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.859 
I suppose you could make it that relay
to<00:00:15.389> me<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:15.809> about<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.109> most<00:00:17.869> challenging

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
to me it's about the most challenging

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.830 
to me it's about the most challenging
way<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> fish<00:00:19.439> there<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:22.100> because<00:00:23.420> it's<00:00:24.420> all

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
way to fish there is because it's all

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.250 
way to fish there is because it's all
invisible<00:00:25.710> there's<00:00:26.340> nothing<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:27.840> know<00:00:27.960> yeah

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
invisible there's nothing you know yeah

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.050 
invisible there's nothing you know yeah
if<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.529> went<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.160> bobber<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.880> let

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
if you went out to a bobber and just let

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.290 
if you went out to a bobber and just let
it<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.980> know<00:00:31.980> chase<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.759> down<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.149> river

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
it you know chase it down the river

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970 
it you know chase it down the river
doing<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> mindless<00:00:34.020> bobber<00:00:34.350> dance<00:00:34.829> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
doing the mindless bobber dance I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.040 
doing the mindless bobber dance I
supposed<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.550> pretty<00:00:35.790> boring<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.210> when

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
supposed to be pretty boring but when

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.700 
supposed to be pretty boring but when
you<00:00:37.140> start<00:00:37.410> breaking<00:00:37.710> down<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.489> fact<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
you start breaking down the fact that

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.350 
you start breaking down the fact that
everything's<00:00:40.710> under<00:00:40.950> water<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.520> mean<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.180> have

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
everything's under water I mean you have

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.330 
everything's under water I mean you have
to<00:00:42.570> visualize<00:00:42.870> everything<00:00:43.710> that's<00:00:44.160> what

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
to visualize everything that's what

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.330 
to visualize everything that's what
makes<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.969> intense<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.559> every<00:00:47.100> when

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
makes it so intense you know every when

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.740 
makes it so intense you know every when
you're<00:00:47.460> fishing<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.789> dry<00:00:48.059> fly<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.570> know<00:00:48.690> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
you're fishing a dry fly you know you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.540 
you're fishing a dry fly you know you
know<00:00:48.989> you're<00:00:49.200> always<00:00:49.500> thinking<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.219> fish

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
know you're always thinking that fish

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
know you're always thinking that fish
coming<00:00:51.420> underneath<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.960> fly<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
coming underneath your fly and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.639 
coming underneath your fly and
inspecting<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.370> when<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.579> underwater

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
inspecting it but when it's underwater

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.020 
inspecting it but when it's underwater
the<00:00:55.649> most<00:00:55.860> subtle<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:57.180> things<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.620> do

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
the most subtle of things that you do

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.299 
the most subtle of things that you do
can<00:01:00.030> make<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.960> biggest<00:01:01.199> difference<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:02.070> earth

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
can make the biggest difference on earth

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.650 
can make the biggest difference on earth
I<00:01:02.550> mean<00:01:02.730> that's<00:01:02.940> what<00:01:03.149> makes<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.480> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
I mean that's what makes it so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
I mean that's what makes it so
challenging<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.589> that's<00:01:05.159> why<00:01:05.430> we're<00:01:05.640> showing

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
challenging and that's why we're showing

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.450 
challenging and that's why we're showing
so<00:01:06.180> many<00:01:06.330> different<00:01:06.869> styles<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.710> ways<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
so many different styles and ways to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.710 
so many different styles and ways to
fish<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.180> mean<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.530> me<00:01:11.720> understanding

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
fish I mean to me understanding

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440 
fish I mean to me understanding
subsurface<00:01:13.710> currents<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.850> subsurface

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
subsurface currents and subsurface

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.590 
subsurface currents and subsurface
hydraulics<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.740> affecting<00:01:17.729> your<00:01:17.880> way

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
hydraulics that are affecting your way

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080 
hydraulics that are affecting your way
your<00:01:18.810> fly's<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.560> back<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> forth<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.640> mean

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
your fly's going back and forth I mean

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.969 
your fly's going back and forth I mean
to<00:01:21.210> me<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.080> ultimate<00:01:22.110> challenge

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to me that's like the ultimate challenge

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
to me that's like the ultimate challenge
you<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.990> see<00:01:24.990> underwater<00:01:25.790> not<00:01:26.790> physically

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
you get to see underwater not physically

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
you get to see underwater not physically
but<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.530> visualize<00:01:28.920> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
but you have to visualize that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.230 
but you have to visualize that
underwater<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.960> makes<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.240> incredibly

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
underwater what makes it so incredibly

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
underwater what makes it so incredibly
challenging<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.350> let<00:01:34.650> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
challenging if you let it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.910 
challenging if you let it
I<00:01:35.240> had<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> buddy<00:01:36.570> telling<00:01:36.990> me<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
I had a buddy telling me that I have a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.370 
I had a buddy telling me that I have a
tendency<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.670> overcomplicate<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:40.079> stuff

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
tendency to overcomplicate this stuff

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.219 
tendency to overcomplicate this stuff
and<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.180> disagree<00:01:42.180> completely<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.869> mean<00:01:42.960> what

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
and I disagree completely I mean what

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.679 
and I disagree completely I mean what
I'm<00:01:43.380> doing<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.860> every<00:01:44.820> day<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.240> trying<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
I'm doing is every day I'm trying to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.410 
I'm doing is every day I'm trying to
figure<00:01:45.869> something<00:01:46.229> different<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:48.270> know

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
figure something different up you know

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.749 
figure something different up you know
not<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.229> throwing<00:01:49.530> out<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> bobber<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
not just throwing out a bobber and the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.300 
not just throwing out a bobber and the
watching<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.950> everything<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.040> about<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
watching it go everything is about a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.060 
watching it go everything is about a
little<00:01:53.700> micro<00:01:54.570> drift<00:01:55.020> what<00:01:55.380> do<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.710> change

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
little micro drift what do we can change

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.030 
little micro drift what do we can change
this<00:01:56.430> change<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:58.079> start<00:01:58.409> figuring<00:01:58.649> out

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
this change that you start figuring out

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.360 
this change that you start figuring out
all<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.729> different

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
all these different

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.710 
all these different
ways<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.840> get<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.170> fish<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:02.590> respond<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:04.660> to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
ways to get the fish to respond and to

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.810 
ways to get the fish to respond and to
me<00:02:04.900> that's<00:02:05.140> what<00:02:05.380> it's<00:02:05.500> all<00:02:05.620> about<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.950> mean<00:02:06.100> if

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
me that's what it's all about I mean if

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.910 
me that's what it's all about I mean if
I<00:02:06.970> had<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.240> go<00:02:07.360> out<00:02:07.480> and<00:02:07.510> just<00:02:07.840> throw<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.170> dry<00:02:08.560> fly

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
I had to go out and just throw a dry fly

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.670 
I had to go out and just throw a dry fly
