00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
best further for a woman to take before

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.310 
best further for a woman to take before
you<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.620> trying<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.489> pregnant<00:00:47.700> before

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
you know trying to get pregnant before

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
you know trying to get pregnant before
going<00:00:49.320> through<00:00:49.680> any<00:00:50.309> treatments<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.149> was

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
going through any treatments but I was

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.340 
going through any treatments but I was
not<00:00:51.600> taking<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.320> vitamin<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.270> thought<00:00:55.050> why

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
not taking the vitamin so I thought why

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.729 
not taking the vitamin so I thought why
not<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.539> about<00:00:57.780> time<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.289> start<00:00:58.590> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
not and it's just about time to start it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.340 
not and it's just about time to start it
because<00:00:58.940> aprox<00:00:59.940> my<00:01:00.180> if'<00:01:00.840> cycle<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
because aprox my if' cycle is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.860 
because aprox my if' cycle is
approximately<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.399> start<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.420> less

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
approximately going to start in less

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.800 
approximately going to start in less
than<00:01:04.110> three<00:01:04.470> months<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
than three months so it's about the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.200 
than three months so it's about the
right<00:01:07.020> time<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.530> take<00:01:07.740> those<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> went<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
right time to take those so I went to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.590 
right time to take those so I went to
the<00:01:09.360> pharmacy<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.740> bought<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:12.000> vitamins

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the pharmacy and I bought some vitamins

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740 
the pharmacy and I bought some vitamins
and<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> bought<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.380> prenatal<00:01:13.740> vitamin<00:01:14.750> it's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and I bought a prenatal vitamin it's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810 
and I bought a prenatal vitamin it's
called<00:01:16.020> fit<00:01:16.259> romper<00:01:16.650> natal<00:01:17.009> forte<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
called fit romper natal forte and it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.940 
called fit romper natal forte and it
looks<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:20.900> but<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.409> problem<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
looks like this but the the problem is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.350 
looks like this but the the problem is
that<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> couple<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.939> questions

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that I have a couple of questions

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.399 
that I have a couple of questions
regarding<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.729> says<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
regarding this because it says that it

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.520 
regarding this because it says that it
has<00:01:29.570> 30<00:01:30.570> milligrams<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.439> vitamin<00:01:31.650> e<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:33.530> so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
has 30 milligrams of vitamin e in it so

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.890 
has 30 milligrams of vitamin e in it so
my<00:01:34.680> question<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.119> why<00:01:36.509> does<00:01:36.780> it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.280 
my question was not that it why does it
have<00:01:37.700> vitamin<00:01:38.700> e<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.540> question<00:01:39.750> was<00:01:42.290> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
the fact that I also bought omega-3

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.770 
the fact that I also bought omega-3
fatty<00:01:47.790> acid<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:50.700> didn't<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.450> but

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
