00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.440
 here we are 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.599
 today I present two very important cubes from the melotti collection 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.929
 are two ducati scrambler second series 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.240
 they are 75-76 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.099
 two pieces the museum improbability 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.349
 a 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.349
 black and yellow 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.349
 it's a formidable blue 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.109
 obviously restored 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.840
 as only the engineer cut and gross cut knew and wanted 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 pokemon guide dark type 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.650
 they are fully functional 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 made a great shot it is impeccable in every detail 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.330
 a fillet of the 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.370
 Black 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.310
 it is not aggressive but since it has been completely restored it has been done 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.470
 by a freehand artisan 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.430
 then the adhesive to the touch 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.390
 you can't hear it obviously because the fillet 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.930
 perfect cmq hours 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.760
 the original 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.760
 while as regards the durability the painting 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.740
 preserved 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.140
 I would like to point out the kilometers alone 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.320
 that I sleep only 200 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 24 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.740
 needless to say that they speak at first sight 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.740
 Needless to say, they are not for sale 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.990
 obviously even these paolo tremonti does not have it
