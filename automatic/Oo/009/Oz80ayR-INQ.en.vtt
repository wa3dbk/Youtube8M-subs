down
before<00:00:41.810> you<00:00:41.960> begin<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.440> backwards<00:00:42.920> motion

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
before you begin the backwards motion

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.580 
before you begin the backwards motion
you<00:00:43.670> don't<00:00:43.910> want<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.270> buy<00:00:44.450> cleaning<00:00:44.990> to<00:00:45.380> any

you don't want to buy cleaning to any
size<00:00:45.950> that<00:00:46.400> fit<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:47.660> want<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:47.990> start<00:00:48.230> up

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
size that fit you want to start up

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.680 
size that fit you want to start up
inside<00:00:48.920> straight<00:00:49.370> up<00:00:49.580> and<00:00:49.760> down<00:00:49.820> this<00:00:50.480> will

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
inside straight up and down this will

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.750 
inside straight up and down this will
give<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.020> advantage<00:00:51.500> as<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:51.950> start<00:00:52.610> your

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
give you the advantage as you start your

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.590 
give you the advantage as you start your
motion<00:00:53.180> back<00:00:53.390> room

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
motion back room

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
motion back room
thought<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> motion<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.399> kick

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
thought the motion back would just kick

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
thought the motion back would just kick
backwards<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:59.370> goal<00:00:59.640> here<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.269> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
backwards like this the goal here is to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.750 
backwards like this the goal here is to
keep<00:01:01.379> your<00:01:01.589> feet<00:01:01.829> off<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> ground<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.670> as

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
keep your feet off the ground for as

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.620 
keep your feet off the ground for as
long<00:01:02.909> as<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.970> might<00:01:06.210> take<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
long as you can this might take you a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.240 
long as you can this might take you a
while<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.560> comfortable<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.159> learning

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
while to get comfortable with learning

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.340 
while to get comfortable with learning
the<00:01:09.520> backwards<00:01:10.120> motion<00:01:10.330> in<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.200> beginning

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
the backwards motion in the beginning

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.800 
the backwards motion in the beginning
does<00:01:11.950> feel<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.490> little<00:01:12.520> uncomfortable<00:01:13.090> it

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
does feel a little uncomfortable it

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.940 
does feel a little uncomfortable it
feels<00:01:14.140> strange<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:16.180> just<00:01:16.930> do<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.380> over<00:01:17.860> and

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
feels strange so just do this over and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.400 
feels strange so just do this over and
over<00:01:18.070> make<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.880> game<00:01:19.210> out<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.660> trying<00:01:20.350> to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
over make a game out of it trying to

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.930 
over make a game out of it trying to
keep<00:01:20.560> your<00:01:20.710> feet<00:01:20.920> off<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.160> ground<00:01:21.340> for<00:01:21.760> as

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
keep your feet off the ground for as

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.490 
keep your feet off the ground for as
long<00:01:22.090> as<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.390> can<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.720> little<00:01:25.869> faster

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
long as you can going a little faster

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.090 
long as you can going a little faster
than<00:01:26.530> normal<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:27.580> best<00:01:28.570> because<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.650> helps<00:01:29.979> you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
than normal is best because it helps you

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.490 
than normal is best because it helps you
maintain<00:01:30.280> your<00:01:30.550> balance<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.990> when<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.290> get

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
maintain your balance so when you get

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.910 
maintain your balance so when you get
pretty<00:01:32.800> tough<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.160> go<00:01:33.310> with<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.640> speed<00:01:33.940> both

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
pretty tough to go with the speed both

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.770 
pretty tough to go with the speed both
go<00:01:35.920> at<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.160> little<00:01:36.490> faster<00:01:36.880> rate<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.570> will

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
go at a little faster rate this will

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.000 
go at a little faster rate this will
help<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:38.020> keep<00:01:38.170> your<00:01:38.380> feet<00:01:38.619> off<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.830> ground

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
help you keep your feet off the ground

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.180 
help you keep your feet off the ground
longer<00:01:39.610> like<00:01:39.790> such<00:01:40.500> when<00:01:41.500> you're<00:01:41.649> comfortable

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
longer like such when you're comfortable

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.180 
longer like such when you're comfortable
keeping<00:01:42.490> your<00:01:42.759> feet<00:01:43.000> off<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.270> ground<00:01:44.190> start

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
keeping your feet off the ground start

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.460 
keeping your feet off the ground start
trying<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.550> place<00:01:45.759> your<00:01:45.970> feet<00:01:46.300> onto<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.990> pedal

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
trying to place your feet onto the pedal

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.800 
trying to place your feet onto the pedal
while<00:01:48.280> you're<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.910> macarons<00:01:49.390> value<00:01:49.690> in

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
while you're in the macarons value in

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.440 
while you're in the macarons value in
the<00:01:49.899> backward<00:01:50.229> motion<00:01:50.470> like<00:01:51.130> this

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.520 

just<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.259> that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
just like that

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.649 
just like that
until<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.460> can<00:01:57.610> ride<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.820> pretty<00:01:58.330> straight

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
until you can ride a pretty straight

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.840 
until you can ride a pretty straight
line<00:01:58.869> for<00:01:59.260> quite<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> distance<00:02:00.250> or<00:02:00.549> at<00:02:00.670> least

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
line for quite a distance or at least

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.609 
line for quite a distance or at least
till<00:02:01.030> you're<00:02:01.090> comfortable<00:02:01.600> with<00:02:01.659> it<00:02:01.960> and

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
till you're comfortable with it and
