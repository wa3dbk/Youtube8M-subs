what about weg de Bob Dana for the
second<00:00:36.210> level<00:00:36.360> structure<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.469> pretty

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
second level structure it was pretty

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.069 
second level structure it was pretty
simple<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.450> built<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.629> second<00:00:39.930> level

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
simple I just built the second level

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.479 
simple I just built the second level
with<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> grids<00:00:40.739> used<00:00:41.280> cable<00:00:41.910> ties<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.489> those

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
with the grids used cable ties and those

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.590 
with the grids used cable ties and those
I<00:00:44.820> don't<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.239> know<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.450> these<00:00:45.539> are

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
I don't really know what these are

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.110 
I don't really know what these are
called<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.020> those<00:00:46.680> things<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.280> then<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
called but those things and then for the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.680 
called but those things and then for the
structure<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.950> used<00:00:49.950> two<00:00:50.820> grids<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.480> just

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
structure I used two grids and I just

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.160 
structure I used two grids and I just
fold<00:00:51.930> them<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.230> half<00:00:52.260> so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.570 

so<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.290> flooring<00:00:59.710> for<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.070> second-level

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
so the flooring for the second-level

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.350 
so the flooring for the second-level
cage<00:01:00.940> is<00:01:01.270> this<00:01:02.170> recycled<00:01:03.160> paper<00:01:03.460> bedding

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
cage is this recycled paper bedding

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.400 
cage is this recycled paper bedding
which<00:01:04.480> I<00:01:04.600> really<00:01:04.839> like<00:01:05.019> because<00:01:05.050> it's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
which I really like because it's

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.490 
which I really like because it's
eco-friendly<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.490> it's<00:01:07.180> dust<00:01:07.420> greens<00:01:07.780> I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
eco-friendly and it's dust greens I

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.780 
eco-friendly and it's dust greens I
really<00:01:09.220> like<00:01:09.400> it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
really like it

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.920 
really like it
so<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.780> package<00:01:11.170> looks<00:01:11.350> like<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.240> for<00:01:13.810> the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
so the package looks like and for the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.890 
so the package looks like and for the
bottom<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.560> lined<00:01:14.950> everything<00:01:15.430> with<00:01:16.090> newspaper

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
bottom I lined everything with newspaper

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.980 
bottom I lined everything with newspaper
first<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.740> then<00:01:18.550> I<00:01:18.580> put<00:01:19.030> fleece<00:01:19.270> over<00:01:19.510> top<00:01:19.750> and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
first and then I put fleece over top and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.680 
first and then I put fleece over top and
for<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.650> extension<00:01:21.100> here<00:01:21.729> I<00:01:21.940> put<00:01:22.450> foam

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
for the extension here I put foam

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.070 
for the extension here I put foam
padding<00:01:23.140> underneath<00:01:23.320> for<00:01:23.680> extra<00:01:23.979> company<00:01:28.080> so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
padding underneath for extra company so

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.840 
padding underneath for extra company so
I<00:01:29.110> used<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.440> have<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.590> single<00:01:30.070> ramp<00:01:30.340> but<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.640> made

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
I used to have a single ramp but I made

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.120 
I used to have a single ramp but I made
it<00:01:30.880> less<00:01:31.090> steep<00:01:31.450> by<00:01:31.750> plugging<00:01:32.080> into<00:01:32.350> two<00:01:32.649> parts

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
it less steep by plugging into two parts

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.280 
it less steep by plugging into two parts
and<00:01:33.340> so<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:33.910> just<00:01:34.210> use<00:01:34.390> coroplast<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:35.200> the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
and so I just use coroplast in the

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.020 
and so I just use coroplast in the
bottom<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:35.770> I<00:01:35.830> cut<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.160> to<00:01:36.280> get<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.490> shape<00:01:36.700> I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
bottom and I cut it to get the shape I

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.200 
bottom and I cut it to get the shape I
use<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.660> grid<00:01:38.020> for<00:01:38.350> support<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.130> then<00:01:39.790> an<00:01:39.940> old

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
use a grid for support and then an old

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.070 
use a grid for support and then an old
sort<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.899> wheel<00:01:41.140> thing<00:01:41.470> there<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:42.070> then<00:01:42.700> I<00:01:43.080> got

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
sort of wheel thing there and then I got

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.520 
sort of wheel thing there and then I got
this<00:01:44.470> nonstick<00:01:45.280> stuff<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:47.050> use<00:01:47.259> kind

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
this nonstick stuff that you use kind

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.160 
this nonstick stuff that you use kind
under<00:01:47.740> carpets<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.430> everything<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.000> I<00:01:49.060> just

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
under carpets and everything and I just

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.600 
under carpets and everything and I just
steeple<00:01:50.170> done<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.500> all<00:01:50.710> along<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.160> side<00:01:51.369> there

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
steeple done it all along the side there

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.850 
steeple done it all along the side there
so<00:01:51.789> it<00:01:52.090> doesn't<00:01:52.300> fall<00:01:52.450> down<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:52.960> then<00:01:53.080> I<00:01:53.200> put

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
so it doesn't fall down and then I put

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.039 
so it doesn't fall down and then I put
f√ºssen<00:01:54.280> on<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.550> side<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.420> looks<00:01:55.660> nice

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.440 

and<00:02:02.049> lastly<00:02:02.409> for<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.950> little<00:02:03.159> hidey<00:02:03.400> places

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450
