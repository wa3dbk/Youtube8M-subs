00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.470
 scientists have produced the first films showing the 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.740
 global distribution of the most important greenhouse gases the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.629
 carbon dioxide and methane 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.279
 that contribute to global warming 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.480
 have been based for three years on observations made 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.109
 by a spectrometer on board the envisat satellite of the space agency 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.390
 European 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.259
 The absorption spectrometer scan images for cartography 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.200
 atmospheric is the first spatial center capable of measuring with great 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.220
 sensitivity to the most important greenhouse gases on the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.290
 terrestrial surface by observing the spectrum of sunlight through the 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.540
 atmosphere doctors marc and pau freixas type nor personal without 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.840
 institute of environmental physics of the German University of Bremen 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.220
 they produced the maps 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.180
 based on the observations of the spectrometer between 2003 and 2005 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.400
 although carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.810
 methane molecules trap heat with 20 times higher efficiency 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.580
 arabic a molecule of carbon dioxide 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.940
 in addition methane emissions the second greenhouse gas in importance 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.760
 can increase significantly 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.300
 due to global warming if the waves of the currently frozen permafrost 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.260
 they start releasing methane 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.080
 the new data on methane 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.030
 They also confirm the findings of another study conducted in 2005 according to 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.700
 which methane emissions were higher than those expected in the forests 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.670
 tropical species other than the simulation models obtained in the same 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.310
 period bobés and his colleagues used the spectrometer data the same 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.170
 period for information on carbon dioxide columns 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.090
 originated both naturally and as a result of human activities such as 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.950
 burn fossil fuels just like methane there are important 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.070
 gaps in knowledge regarding carbon dioxide sources such as 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.310
 fires volcanic activity and breathing living organisms as well as 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.260
 of the area be a natural partner such as the soils and the ocean 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.440
 by knowing better all the different parameters to the carbon cycle the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.520
 scientists can better predict climate change and control the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.479
 compliance with international treaties intended 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.779
 reduce greenhouse gas emissions like the kioto protocol 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:16.979
 you have to propose 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.299
