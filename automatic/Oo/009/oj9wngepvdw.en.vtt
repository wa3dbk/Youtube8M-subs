source would not be a good one to you so
basically<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:48.010> student<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.489> is<00:03:48.700> evaluating

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
basically the student is is evaluating

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.509 
basically the student is is evaluating
the<00:03:49.630> source<00:03:49.870> saying<00:03:50.680> what's<00:03:50.890> good<00:03:51.070> about<00:03:51.160> it

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
the source saying what's good about it

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.940 
the source saying what's good about it
what's<00:03:51.820> not<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.299> good<00:03:52.600> about<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:53.019> in<00:03:53.739> that

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
what's not so good about it in that

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.190 
what's not so good about it in that
section<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.519> annotation<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.810> basically

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
section of the annotation so basically

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.140 
section of the annotation so basically
according<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.040> directions<00:03:57.340> if<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.760> student

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
according to the directions if a student

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.979 
according to the directions if a student
let's<00:03:58.360> say<00:03:58.600> has<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:58.959> do<00:03:59.350> six<00:04:00.310> sources<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:01.750> this

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
let's say has to do six sources for this

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.009 
let's say has to do six sources for this
particular<00:04:02.320> assignment<00:04:02.799> they<00:04:03.549> are<00:04:03.730> doing<00:04:04.150> all

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
particular assignment they are doing all

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.580 
particular assignment they are doing all
this<00:04:05.820> six<00:04:06.820> different<00:04:07.000> times<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.440> would

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
this six different times and that would

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.910 
this six different times and that would
be<00:04:08.830> making<00:04:09.670> up<00:04:09.790> their<00:04:09.970> annotated

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
be making up their annotated

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.590 
be making up their annotated
bibliography<00:04:11.920> so<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.549> citation<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.360> then

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
bibliography so the citation and then

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.310 
bibliography so the citation and then
both<00:04:13.870> parts<00:04:14.320> of<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.739> annotation<00:04:16.200> would<00:04:17.200> be

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
both parts of the annotation would be

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.870 
both parts of the annotation would be
done<00:04:17.500> for<00:04:17.739> each<00:04:17.830> of<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:18.130> sources<00:04:18.580> that<00:04:18.609> they

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
done for each of the sources that they

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.779 
done for each of the sources that they
have<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.239> do<00:04:19.359> for<00:04:19.630> this<00:04:19.989> assignment<00:04:20.320> now<00:04:21.280> to

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
have to do for this assignment now to

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.100 
have to do for this assignment now to
get<00:04:21.910> more<00:04:22.090> information<00:04:22.630> as<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.840> what

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
get more information as to what

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.500 
get more information as to what
specifically<00:04:23.770> goes<00:04:24.099> in<00:04:24.370> each<00:04:24.490> part<00:04:24.849> and<00:04:25.060> how

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
specifically goes in each part and how

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.689 
specifically goes in each part and how
to<00:04:25.570> do<00:04:25.780> write<00:04:25.990> out<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.560> actual<00:04:26.860> annotation

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
to do write out the actual annotation

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.100 
to do write out the actual annotation
student<00:04:28.270> could<00:04:28.389> go<00:04:28.509> back<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.960> high<00:04:29.080> school

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110

the reflection paper things like what

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.510 
the reflection paper things like what
did<00:06:19.780> they<00:06:19.900> learn<00:06:20.139> what<00:06:20.830> did<00:06:20.919> that<00:06:20.949> what<00:06:21.460> did

surprised them about their research or
what<00:06:56.840> they<00:06:56.960> found<00:06:57.170> that<00:06:57.950> would<00:06:58.100> go<00:06:58.250> in<00:06:58.400> that

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
what they found that would go in that

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.940 
what they found that would go in that
section<00:06:58.910> as<00:06:59.030> well<00:06:59.320> if<00:07:00.320> they<00:07:00.530> had<00:07:00.680> more<00:07:00.890> time

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
section as well if they had more time

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.730 
section as well if they had more time
what<00:07:01.550> direction<00:07:01.850> would<00:07:02.120> they<00:07:02.270> go<00:07:02.390> in<00:07:02.570> next<00:07:02.810> if

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
what direction would they go in next if

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.200 
what direction would they go in next if
they<00:07:03.890> were<00:07:03.950> curious<00:07:04.280> to<00:07:04.400> find<00:07:04.550> out<00:07:04.880> more<00:07:04.940> about

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
they were curious to find out more about

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.270 
they were curious to find out more about
capital<00:07:05.810> punishment<00:07:05.840> so<00:07:06.740> all<00:07:06.890> those<00:07:07.100> things

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
capital punishment so all those things

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.730 
capital punishment so all those things
are<00:07:07.550> fair<00:07:07.790> game<00:07:08.060> in<00:07:08.600> the<00:07:09.050> reflection<00:07:09.440> paper

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
are fair game in the reflection paper

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.580 
are fair game in the reflection paper
how<00:07:10.040> long<00:07:10.280> the<00:07:10.430> paper<00:07:10.610> would<00:07:10.910> be<00:07:11.120> is<00:07:11.590> explained

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
how long the paper would be is explained

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.110 
how long the paper would be is explained
in<00:07:12.830> the<00:07:13.010> directions<00:07:13.340> and<00:07:13.790> that<00:07:13.880> would<00:07:14.000> be

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
in the directions and that would be

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.300 
in the directions and that would be
different<00:07:14.480> based<00:07:14.630> on<00:07:14.870> the<00:07:15.140> class<00:07:15.380> that

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
different based on the class that

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.640 
different based on the class that
they're<00:07:16.520> in<00:07:16.670> there<00:07:16.880> so<00:07:17.660> that<00:07:17.930> pretty<00:07:18.350> much<00:07:18.440> is

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
they're in there so that pretty much is

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.680 
they're in there so that pretty much is
going<00:07:18.800> to<00:07:18.860> do<00:07:18.980> it<00:07:19.130> the<00:07:19.490> paper<00:07:19.670> involves<00:07:20.270> or<00:07:20.570> the

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
going to do it the paper involves or the
