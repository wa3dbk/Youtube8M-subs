00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
first well I as if I divide my hair so I

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.910 
first well I as if I divide my hair so I
pick<00:01:49.460> up<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.790> frayed<00:01:50.030> French<00:01:50.780> pick<00:01:51.530> out<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
pick up the frayed French pick out the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.620 
pick up the frayed French pick out the
fringe<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.780> then<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:54.049> start<00:01:56.020> twisting<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.110> and

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
fringe and then I start twisting it and

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.279 
fringe and then I start twisting it and
my<00:01:59.630> hair<00:01:59.899> is<00:02:00.020> not<00:02:00.229> really<00:02:00.770> cooperating<00:02:00.979> today

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
my hair is not really cooperating today

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:11.680 
my hair is not really cooperating today
because<00:02:03.289> it's<00:02:03.500> nearly<00:02:03.799> washed<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.360> take

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
because it's nearly washed so you take

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:22.970 
because it's nearly washed so you take
your<00:02:11.959> hair<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.280> start<00:02:14.769> twisting<00:02:15.769> it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.880 

and<00:02:23.489> now<00:02:23.970> I'm<00:02:24.420> going<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.959> turn<00:02:25.110> around<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.650> you

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and now I'm going to turn around so you

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.420 
and now I'm going to turn around so you
can<00:02:26.129> see<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> back

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:40.330 

as<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.730> see<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.620> keep<00:02:34.150> twisting<00:02:35.150> it

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.420 

and<00:02:41.570> here<00:02:42.570> is<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.020> tricky<00:02:43.350> part<00:02:43.380> because<00:02:44.160> now

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and here is the tricky part because now

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.940 
and here is the tricky part because now
you<00:02:44.490> don't<00:02:44.940> want<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.450> like<00:02:45.690> yes<00:02:45.990> twist<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.650> you

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you don't want to like yes twist and you
