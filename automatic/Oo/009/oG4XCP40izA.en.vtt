00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.000
 hello to all these mini fiction 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.980
 we meet today for my 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.130
 second video then show you 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.140
 how to create your own video game 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.470
 very simply and very quickly too 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.019
 I'm sure scratch so this patch is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.480
 software to create your own games 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.840
 video and also to put them online 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.030
 as you can see here there are some 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.629
 video games and games created by 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.860
 amateur people uploading then 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.920
 you can first of all like proves it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.690
 the profit of someone else and she 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.590
 is enhanced for example accurate flower 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.710
 of lens the side and I show to 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.710
 interior 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.780
 so here you can see how works 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.240
 this project or improve it if you want 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.570
 so for example I will start the game 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.570
 so 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.270
 for me 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.680
 there you can see everything that is 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.690
 unfolds then it's pretty complicated for 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.550
 start but that's it allows 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.780
 to learn very easily how 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:35.000
 walk the proof develop my own 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:39.590
 little game I'll show it to you 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.930
 it's called for gervais scrabble 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.030
 the goal of my little I can realize in 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.330
 less than a quarter of an hour and that the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 diver finally the most obvious of 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.000
 touch the crab and up there I have my 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.869
 score should try to arrive a score 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.619
 of 10 points also tempers the three 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.400
 visuals saturday at 0 well i lost 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.540
 for example ah ah I have a life 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.670
 here I have zero life of which I lost 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.070
 so now I propose you to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.010
 understand how the scratch works and 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.160
 its different features 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.050
 so now I propose you to 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:27.450
 duty while the script all 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.350
 inside my project to drink 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.560
 inside then as I tell you 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:39.230
 said it's a very simple project the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.300
 hardly much worked on then 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.400
 this is for example the shows you the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.230
 different actions that you can 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 realize on scratch you can do 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.010
 advance your object with movement or 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.209
 move it from a xy position to a 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.570
 other xy position 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.150
 so after could make him say 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.850
 foot mouscron sentences you had to do 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:08.640
 play sounds you can also do 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:11.400
 to draw shapes with the pen when 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.370
 you want is actually created variables such 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.260
 age and creates two variables a score 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.790
 and a life you can do some 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:27.600
 events which corresponds to the beginning 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.750
 an action gold that's what I know 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.560
 when I started or when it 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.230
 receives we receive a message you have 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.030
 controls so very important you 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.580
 done you can do it again 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.290
 indefinitely in shares have been told 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:52.350
 fair repeated so here they go 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:55.650
 wait here but also some 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:00.630
 examples you click on the object and 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.030
 well we want you to win a point the 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.110
 operators which means that by 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.840
 example me that I put a lessor 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.239
 technique if the position was there more 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.350
 great that without then one had to give 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:23.700
 the value - 170 in peak 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:26.010
 go up and down again here we see his 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.930
 position in his position is larger 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.960
 feel good he will give the value - 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.970
 170 and give the value to a number 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.630
 random ie my crab is going 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.340
 arise a little unexpectedly 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.650
 so now the diver's script 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:49.230
 so here I have public when he advanced a 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:55.290
 time it was dawn or there at 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:57.540
 imposition x l the 240 and well there 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.140
 back to the beginning and I also said that 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.910
 if he touched the bass then 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.270
 added notice - that is, to do 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.060
 a life and civil is equal to zero and 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.310
 well sent all the message end and the 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:17.400
 here and we switch to the lost script 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.620
 here you can also suggest your 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.360
 scratch project ideas in the 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:27.300
 comments but you can create your 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.080
 videos simply scratch you have 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.830
 the link in the destruction and do not hesitate 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.880
 not to go see my project hachey 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.750
 chapel good players vs crabs 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.000
 we find ourselves for new 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.810
 videos and put a little drink and 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.810
