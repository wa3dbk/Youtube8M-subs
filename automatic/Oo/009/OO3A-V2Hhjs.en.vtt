be called duty and as I you know as as
I've<00:01:00.210> noticed<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:01.890> black<00:01:02.219> ops

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I've noticed that you know if black ops

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.399 
I've noticed that you know if black ops
had<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.239> better<00:01:03.510> hit<00:01:03.690> detection<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
had you know better hit detection and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.679 
had you know better hit detection and
whatnot<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.189> probably<00:01:05.850> would<00:01:06.060> bit<00:01:06.360> would<00:01:06.570> have

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
whatnot it probably would bit would have

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.840 
whatnot it probably would bit would have
been<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.140> much<00:01:07.320> better<00:01:07.890> game<00:01:07.979> than<00:01:08.159> both<00:01:08.610> modern

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
been a much better game than both modern

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.359 
been a much better game than both modern
warefare<00:01:09.000> two<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.570> modern<00:01:09.869> warfare<00:01:10.020> 3<00:01:10.369> that

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
warefare two and modern warfare 3 that

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.560 
warefare two and modern warfare 3 that
being<00:01:11.610> said<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> hit<00:01:12.479> detection

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
being said you know the hit detection

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.469 
being said you know the hit detection
was<00:01:12.930> crap<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.090> something<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> coding

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
was crap and something in the coding

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.890 
was crap and something in the coding
made<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> lag<00:01:16.110> really<00:01:16.680> bad<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.150> game<00:01:18.390> just

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
made the lag really bad so the game just

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.450 
made the lag really bad so the game just
isn't<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:21.060> par<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:23.130> modern<00:01:23.310> warfare

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
isn't up to par with the modern warfare

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.270 
isn't up to par with the modern warfare
series<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.520> though<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
series that also you know though the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.810 
series that also you know though the
treyarch<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:29.970> opinion<00:01:30.240> has<00:01:30.479> done<00:01:30.900> is

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
treyarch in in my opinion has done is

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.789 
treyarch in in my opinion has done is
it's<00:01:32.820> better<00:01:33.119> than<00:01:33.869> infinity<00:01:34.380> ward

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it's better than infinity ward

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.710 
it's better than infinity ward
sledgehammer<00:01:35.670> gaming<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.329> whatever<00:01:36.570> it's

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.350 
warfare 2 and so far they really have
fixed<00:02:29.190> anything<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.460> modern<00:02:29.640> warfare<00:02:29.790> 3<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:32.360> feel

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
fixed anything a modern warfare 3 I feel

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.500 
fixed anything a modern warfare 3 I feel
that<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.020> game<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.290> going<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.680> better

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
that this game is going to be better

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.820 
that this game is going to be better
it's<00:02:36.510> gonna<00:02:36.660> be<00:02:36.810> better<00:02:36.960> than<00:02:37.050> 10<00:02:37.320> warfare<00:02:37.620> 3

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
it's gonna be better than 10 warfare 3

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.010 
it's gonna be better than 10 warfare 3
well<00:02:38.070> i<00:02:38.310> mean<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.300> it's<00:02:39.630> kind<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.840> hard<00:02:39.990> not

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
well i mean it's it's kind of hard not

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.930 
well i mean it's it's kind of hard not
to<00:02:40.350> be<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:40.830> i<00:02:41.100> think<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:41.700> gonna<00:02:41.790> be

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
to be but i think it's gonna be

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.380 
to be but i think it's gonna be
significantly<00:02:42.480> better<00:02:42.690> uh<00:02:44.150> because<00:02:45.150> just

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
significantly better uh because just

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.430 
significantly better uh because just
because<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.660> trailer<00:02:45.900> shows<00:02:46.200> this

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
because the trailer shows this

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.400 
because the trailer shows this

mean<00:04:05.010> it's<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.160> same<00:04:05.310> concept<00:04:05.790> as<00:04:05.910> if<00:04:06.090> you

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
mean it's the same concept as if you

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.930 
mean it's the same concept as if you
know<00:04:06.959> someone<00:04:07.350> hacked<00:04:07.680> into<00:04:07.860> our<00:04:08.100> computers

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
know someone hacked into our computers

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.240 
know someone hacked into our computers
and<00:04:09.120> took<00:04:09.450> control<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.780> our<00:04:10.019> nukes<00:04:10.260> as<00:04:10.590> we<00:04:11.100> had

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
and took control of our nukes as we had

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.990 
and took control of our nukes as we had
it<00:04:11.370> today<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:13.230> know<00:04:13.350> so<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.220> think<00:04:14.550> it's<00:04:14.880> going

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
it today you know so I think it's going

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.259 
it today you know so I think it's going
to<00:04:15.060> be<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.209> good<00:04:15.420> game<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.840> think<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.440> the

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
to be a good game and I think that the

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.270 
to be a good game and I think that the
that<00:04:18.269> hopefully<00:04:19.019> Treyarch<00:04:19.440> has<00:04:19.530> learned<00:04:19.919> from

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
that hopefully Treyarch has learned from

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.090 
that hopefully Treyarch has learned from
what<00:04:20.519> Infinity<00:04:21.180> Ward<00:04:21.419> has<00:04:21.600> made<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:22.169> mistakes

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
what Infinity Ward has made in mistakes

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.020 
what Infinity Ward has made in mistakes
and<00:04:23.400> will<00:04:24.240> fix<00:04:24.479> them<00:04:24.660> because<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:25.740> know<00:04:25.950> that

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
and will fix them because we know that

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.120 
and will fix them because we know that
games<00:04:27.389> well<00:04:28.110> obviously<00:04:28.530> no<00:04:28.710> game<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:28.950> going<00:04:29.040> to

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
games well obviously no game is going to

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.500 
games well obviously no game is going to
be<00:04:29.190> perfect<00:04:29.340> especially<00:04:29.670> when<00:04:30.270> first

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
be perfect especially when first

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.920 
be perfect especially when first
released<00:04:30.690> but<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.240> think<00:04:33.420> it'll<00:04:33.660> be<00:04:33.750> better

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
released but so I think it'll be better

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.120 
released but so I think it'll be better
