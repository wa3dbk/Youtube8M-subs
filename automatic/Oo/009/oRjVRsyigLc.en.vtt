after the synchros you gotta be kind of
careful<00:03:14.020> because<00:03:14.380> with<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.590> build<00:03:14.770> I'm<00:03:14.920> using

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
careful because with the build I'm using

careful because with the build I'm using
I'm<00:03:16.360> only<00:03:16.540> able<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.930> make<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.530> many

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
synchros like I got to be real careful

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.630 
synchros like I got to be real careful
about<00:03:20.530> which<00:03:20.709> levels<00:03:21.070> I<00:03:21.160> have<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.430> here

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
about which levels I have in here

about which levels I have in here
because<00:03:22.120> with<00:03:22.900> all<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.080> combinations<00:03:23.740> of

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
because with all the combinations of

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.280 
because with all the combinations of
dragons<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.610> have<00:03:24.820> there's<00:03:25.510> no<00:03:25.750> way<00:03:25.930> for<00:03:25.959> me<00:03:26.200> to

make a level eight for example or even a
level<00:03:30.700> six<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.770> is<00:03:32.890> what<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.070> have<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:33.340> here
