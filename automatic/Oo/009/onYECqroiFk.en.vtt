00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.219 
swatch on that would be very good very
smart<00:02:09.239> okay

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
smart okay

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.380 
smart okay
so<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> other<00:02:11.879> one<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.239> I've

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
so this this is the other one that I've

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.360 
so this this is the other one that I've
used<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.750> few<00:02:12.930> times<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.739> think<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.129> one's

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
used a few times and I think this one's

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.699 
used a few times and I think this one's
okay<00:02:14.489> for<00:02:14.970> placing<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.080> product<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.220> lid

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
okay for placing the product on the lid

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.920 
okay for placing the product on the lid
I'm<00:02:19.709> not<00:02:19.890> blown<00:02:20.129> away<00:02:20.400> by<00:02:20.580> these<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.299> far<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:21.900> I

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
I'm not blown away by these so far but I

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.350 
I'm not blown away by these so far but I
think<00:02:22.319> for<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.680> price<00:02:22.709> they<00:02:23.340> are<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.849> good<00:02:24.150> deal

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
think for the price they are a good deal

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.990 
think for the price they are a good deal
so<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:25.950> need<00:02:26.129> brushes<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:26.610> think<00:02:26.819> those<00:02:26.970> are

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
so if you need brushes I think those are

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.619 
so if you need brushes I think those are
good<00:02:27.330> way<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.110> get<00:02:28.440> your<00:02:28.590> collection<00:02:29.040> going

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
good way to get your collection going

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.030 
good way to get your collection going
and<00:02:30.629> I<00:02:30.750> know<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> got<00:02:31.110> more<00:02:31.290> samples<00:02:31.709> than<00:02:31.890> this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and I know I got more samples than this

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.670 
and I know I got more samples than this
but<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.280> got<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.640> coats<00:02:33.110> face<00:02:34.110> healthier

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
