00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it will take you between just a random

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.170 
it will take you between just a random
choice<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> filters<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.939> you've<00:01:48.060> got

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
choice of the filters that you've got

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.700 
choice of the filters that you've got
selected<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.810> case<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.409> choosing

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
selected in this case it's just choosing

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.560 
selected in this case it's just choosing
between<00:01:49.770> my<00:01:49.979> favourites<00:01:50.579> because<00:01:50.970> I'm<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
between my favourites because I'm on the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.080 
between my favourites because I'm on the
favorites<00:01:51.990> section<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
favorites section and you can see that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.600 
favorites section and you can see that
each<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.869> these<00:01:55.049> filters<00:01:55.799> has<00:01:56.219> got<00:01:56.399> its<00:01:56.549> own

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
each of these filters has got its own

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030 
each of these filters has got its own
sliders<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.290> case<00:01:58.530> we've<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.890> got

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
sliders so in this case we've just got

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.859 
sliders so in this case we've just got
the<00:01:59.130> amount<00:01:59.430> slider<00:01:59.759> for<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.090> cool-blue<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the amount slider for the cool-blue and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.679 
the amount slider for the cool-blue and
I<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.439> change<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> amount<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.540> go

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
I can change the amount of that if I go

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.740 
I can change the amount of that if I go
to<00:02:03.750> vivid<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.770> glow<00:02:05.100> vivid<00:02:05.460> color<00:02:05.700> I've<00:02:06.509> got<00:02:06.719> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
to vivid a glow vivid color I've got a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.290 
to vivid a glow vivid color I've got a
brightness<00:02:07.229> slider<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.950> I've<00:02:08.789> also<00:02:08.940> got<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
brightness slider and I've also got a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.150 
brightness slider and I've also got a
glow<00:02:09.599> amount<00:02:09.899> slider<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.830> put<00:02:11.039> less

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
glow amount slider so I can put less

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.740 
glow amount slider so I can put less
glow<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:12.000> glow<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.480> I

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
glow in or more glow in if I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.750 
glow in or more glow in if I
so<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:13.860> case<00:02:14.070> I'm<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.490> keep<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so in this case I'm going to keep the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.510 
so in this case I'm going to keep the
glow<00:02:14.940> nice<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.390> high<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.900> I'm<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.100> let

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
glow nice and high and I'm going to let

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.670 
glow nice and high and I'm going to let
the<00:02:17.640> brightness<00:02:18.060> go<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:18.990> little<00:02:19.440> bit<00:02:19.530> brighter

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the brightness go a little bit brighter

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.400 
the brightness go a little bit brighter
than<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.450> fact<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.900> think<00:02:22.140> I'm<00:02:22.260> going

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
than that and in fact I think I'm going

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.530 
than that and in fact I think I'm going
to<00:02:22.500> work<00:02:22.800> with<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.160> particular<00:02:23.370> style<00:02:24.030> but

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
to work with this particular style but

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.820 
to work with this particular style but
maybe<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:24.990> want<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.500> before<00:02:25.800> and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
maybe I just want to see the before and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.010 
maybe I just want to see the before and
after<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.430> particular<00:02:26.700> effect<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> can

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
after of this particular effect so I can

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.720 
after of this particular effect so I can
use<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.380> compare<00:02:28.890> button<00:02:28.920> up<00:02:29.340> here<00:02:29.490> at<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
use the compare button up here at the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.910 
use the compare button up here at the
top<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.180> lets<00:02:30.720> me<00:02:30.870> see<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.200> image<00:02:31.440> before

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
top that lets me see the image before

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.190 
top that lets me see the image before
the<00:02:32.490> effect<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.030> after<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.600> effect<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.080> we

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
the effect and after the effect and we

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.050 
the effect and after the effect and we
can<00:02:34.320> see<00:02:34.500> that's<00:02:34.950> making<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.520> really<00:02:35.760> big

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
can see that's making a really big

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.270 
can see that's making a really big
difference<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.570> this<00:02:36.690> image<00:02:36.990> so<00:02:37.680> let's<00:02:37.890> apply

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
difference to this image so let's apply

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.300 
difference to this image so let's apply
that<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:40.200> what<00:02:40.440> that's<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.860> do<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.160> it's

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
that and what that's going to do is it's

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.250 
that and what that's going to do is it's
going<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.610> apply<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.210> effect<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.810> our<00:02:42.840> image

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
going to apply that effect to our image

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.740 
going to apply that effect to our image
and<00:02:43.500> let<00:02:44.040> us<00:02:44.190> carry<00:02:44.550> on<00:02:44.790> editing<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.570> can

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
and let us carry on editing so we can

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.020 
and let us carry on editing so we can
now<00:02:45.870> go<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.200> do<00:02:46.380> another<00:02:47.070> effect<00:02:47.520> if<00:02:47.670> we<00:02:47.700> want

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
now go and do another effect if we want

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.270 
now go and do another effect if we want
to<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.870> think<00:02:49.110> what<00:02:49.260> I'd<00:02:49.380> like<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.920> here

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
to and I think what I'd like to do here

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.460 
to and I think what I'd like to do here
is<00:02:50.430> actually<00:02:51.300> do<00:02:51.480> some<00:02:51.690> work<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.200> car

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
is actually do some work on that car

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.860 
is actually do some work on that car
because<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.940> blue<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.540> kind<00:02:54.840> of

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
because it's it's blue but I kind of

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.930 
because it's it's blue but I kind of
want<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.380> red<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:55.800> let's<00:02:55.980> go<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.820> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
want it to be red so let's go to the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.690 
want it to be red so let's go to the
effects<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.070> now<00:02:59.190> back<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.670> of

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
effects and this is now back to all of

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.030 
effects and this is now back to all of
the<00:02:59.910> effects<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.450> we<00:03:00.959> can<00:03:01.200> turn<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.560> car<00:03:01.830> red

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
the effects and we can turn that car red

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.520 
the effects and we can turn that car red
with<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> Alien<00:03:02.760> Skin<00:03:02.970> effect<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.290> can

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
with the Alien Skin effect but you can

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.920 
with the Alien Skin effect but you can
see<00:03:04.770> that's<00:03:05.040> also<00:03:05.670> changing<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.750> background

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
see that's also changing the background

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.170 
see that's also changing the background
and<00:03:07.380> everything<00:03:07.410> else<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.580> want<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.910> red

and everything else I just want that red
effect<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.900> go<00:03:10.020> on<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.470> car<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.580> do

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
effect to go on the car and we can do

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.940 
effect to go on the car and we can do
that<00:03:11.850> using<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.180> masking<00:03:12.600> feature<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:13.230> FX

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
masking Studio mode and the first thing

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.270 
masking Studio mode and the first thing
you'll<00:03:21.239> notice<00:03:21.330> is<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.530> alien<00:03:22.980> skin

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
you'll notice is that that alien skin

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.710 
you'll notice is that that alien skin
effect<00:03:23.580> no<00:03:23.760> longer<00:03:24.030> seems<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.480> applied

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
effect no longer seems to be applied

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.320 
effect no longer seems to be applied
that's<00:03:25.290> because<00:03:25.650> we're<00:03:25.980> now<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.000> masking

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
that's because we're now in the masking

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.699 
that's because we're now in the masking
mode<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.660> we<00:03:27.720> haven't<00:03:27.959> painted<00:03:28.110> anything<00:03:28.500> on

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
mode and we haven't painted anything on

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.360 
mode and we haven't painted anything on
the<00:03:28.769> mask<00:03:28.950> yet<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.820> let's<00:03:30.030> choose<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.900> soft<00:03:31.769> edge

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the mask yet so let's choose a soft edge

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.759 
the mask yet so let's choose a soft edge
brush<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:33.209> I'm<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.720> gonna<00:03:34.050> start<00:03:34.200> painting

brush and I'm just gonna start painting
in<00:03:35.160> our<00:03:35.310> mask<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.019> see<00:03:37.170> that

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
in our mask and you can see that

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.759 
in our mask and you can see that
wherever<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.739> paint<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.750> effect<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.410> being

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
wherever I paint the effect is being

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.670

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.340 
painted in on the image and in this case
I'm<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.010> going<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.459> paint<00:03:44.790> on<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:46.110> blue

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
I'm just going to paint on the blue

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.009 
I'm just going to paint on the blue
parts<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> car<00:03:47.190> because<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.580> just<00:03:47.820> want<00:03:48.120> to
