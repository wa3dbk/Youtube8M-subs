follicle<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:05.190> as<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.940> see<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.720> flag<00:02:06.990> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
follicle so as you can see the flag of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.380 
follicle so as you can see the flag of
the<00:02:07.200> circle<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.010> curly<00:02:08.399> or<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.640> hair<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.360> a
