00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
the young challenger who plays a little

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.250 
the young challenger who plays a little
bit<00:02:45.770> like<00:02:45.980> him<00:02:46.480> he<00:02:47.480> just<00:02:47.510> was<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.989> better<00:02:48.170> man

in every phase of the play today and I

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.270 
in every phase of the play today and I
just<00:02:50.840> feel<00:02:50.989> like<00:02:51.050> Nishikori<00:02:51.739> isn't<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> hundred

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
just feel like Nishikori isn't a hundred

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.830 
just feel like Nishikori isn't a hundred
percent<00:02:52.400> physically<00:02:53.000> because<00:02:53.180> he<00:02:53.300> struggled

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
percent physically because he struggled

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.199 
percent physically because he struggled
he<00:02:53.959> labored<00:02:54.380> today<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:54.950> freer<00:02:55.640> really<00:02:56.030> took

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
he labored today and freer really took

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.300 
he labored today and freer really took
advantage<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.870> he<00:02:57.080> was<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.230> step<00:02:57.530> faster<00:02:58.100> a

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
advantage of that he was a step faster a

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.150 
advantage of that he was a step faster a
little<00:02:58.880> more<00:02:59.000> gas<00:02:59.209> on<00:02:59.510> his<00:02:59.660> groundstrokes

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
little more gas on his groundstrokes

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.800 
little more gas on his groundstrokes
he's<00:03:01.160> going<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.430> be<00:03:01.519> dangerous<00:03:02.030> as<00:03:02.209> we<00:03:02.390> head

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
he's going to be dangerous as we head

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.000 
he's going to be dangerous as we head
into<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.049> finish<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:04.209> Miami<00:03:05.209> event<00:03:09.010> yeah
