million just from flipping Zelda scales

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.179 
million just from flipping Zelda scales
now<00:01:51.509> because<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.960> got<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.290> lazy<00:01:52.530> flipping<00:01:53.070> those

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
now because I got so lazy flipping those

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.850 
now because I got so lazy flipping those
Zelda<00:01:53.520> scales<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.270> did<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.689> actually<00:01:54.960> flip<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
Zelda scales I did not actually flip to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.940 
Zelda scales I did not actually flip to
many<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.369> other<00:01:56.670> items<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.479> found<00:01:58.140> by<00:01:58.380> accident

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
price and it actually sold for 1 GP only

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.660 
price and it actually sold for 1 GP only
I<00:02:05.729> thought<00:02:06.659> ok<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.259> must<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.649> some<00:02:07.979> throwaway

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
I thought ok that must be some throwaway

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.150 
I thought ok that must be some throwaway
item<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.360> no<00:02:09.539> one<00:02:09.690> wants<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.709> few<00:02:10.890> minutes

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
item that no one wants and a few minutes

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.270 
item that no one wants and a few minutes
later<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.580> put<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.970> into<00:02:12.360> grand<00:02:12.599> exchange

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
later I put it into grand exchange

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.730 
later I put it into grand exchange
it<00:02:13.400> sold<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.150> double<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.720> price<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:15.290> medium

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
it sold for double the price of medium

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.020 
it sold for double the price of medium
price<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.120> made<00:02:18.010> 160,000<00:02:19.010> GP<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.880> like

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
price so I made 160,000 GP just like

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.180 
price so I made 160,000 GP just like
that<00:02:20.270> out<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.200> blue<00:02:21.350> just<00:02:21.830> by<00:02:21.950> finding

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
that out of the blue just by finding

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.910 
that out of the blue just by finding
some<00:02:22.580> very<00:02:22.760> odd<00:02:23.180> item<00:02:23.720> at<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.440> same<00:02:24.650> time<00:02:24.890> I

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
some very odd item at the same time I

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.699 
some very odd item at the same time I
found<00:02:25.310> some<00:02:25.520> other<00:02:25.670> odd<00:02:26.030> items<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:27.110> sacred

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
found some other odd items like sacred

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.729 
found some other odd items like sacred
oil<00:02:27.830> which<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.700> used<00:02:29.000> on<00:02:29.270> logs<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.260> make<00:02:30.290> some

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
oil which is used on logs to make some

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.309 
oil which is used on logs to make some
pie<00:02:30.920> logs<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.880> can<00:02:32.060> use<00:02:32.270> those<00:02:32.480> logs<00:02:32.900> to

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
pie logs and you can use those logs to

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.229 
pie logs and you can use those logs to
get<00:02:33.800> some<00:02:34.040> keys<00:02:34.280> basically<00:02:34.819> it's<00:02:34.970> for<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
get some keys basically it's for the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.360 
get some keys basically it's for the
mini-game<00:02:35.720> again<00:02:36.410> they<00:02:36.590> are<00:02:36.620> not<00:02:36.830> traded<00:02:37.250> that

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
mini-game again they are not traded that

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.160 
mini-game again they are not traded that
much<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.000> someone<00:02:38.300> needs<00:02:38.510> them<00:02:38.780> they<00:02:38.989> will

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
much so if someone needs them they will

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.440 
much so if someone needs them they will
pay<00:02:39.410> over<00:02:39.680> pay<00:02:40.069> if<00:02:40.340> someone<00:02:40.940> wants<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.270> dump

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
pay over pay if someone wants to dump

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.229 
pay over pay if someone wants to dump
them<00:02:41.750> they<00:02:41.959> will<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.650> know<00:02:42.770> sell<00:02:43.040> for<00:02:43.220> less<00:02:43.430> so

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
them they will you know sell for less so

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.090 
them they will you know sell for less so
I<00:02:44.270> flipped<00:02:44.780> these<00:02:45.020> a<00:02:45.050> little<00:02:45.380> bit<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.800> did<00:02:45.860> not

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
I flipped these a little bit I did not

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.820 
I flipped these a little bit I did not
make<00:02:46.280> too<00:02:46.459> much<00:02:46.610> money<00:02:47.060> maybe<00:02:47.410> five<00:02:48.410> hundred

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
make too much money maybe five hundred

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.509 
make too much money maybe five hundred
thousand<00:02:49.310> gold<00:02:49.489> maximum<00:02:50.330> combined<00:02:51.140> with

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
thousand gold maximum combined with

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.460 
thousand gold maximum combined with
magic<00:02:52.519> pine<00:02:52.730> logs<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.420> sacra

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
magic pine logs and sacra

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.130 
magic pine logs and sacra
and<00:02:54.860> if<00:02:55.430> we<00:02:55.610> go<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.850> my<00:02:56.090> history<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.750> can<00:02:56.930> see

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
and if we go to my history you can see

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.680 
and if we go to my history you can see
that<00:02:57.320> I<00:02:57.350> traded<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:58.220> lot<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.430> Zelda<00:02:58.880> scales<00:02:59.300> I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
that I traded a lot of Zelda scales I

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.490 
that I traded a lot of Zelda scales I
sold<00:03:00.200> them<00:03:00.350> for<00:03:00.590> 89<00:03:01.069> for<00:03:01.400> 88<00:03:01.940> bought<00:03:02.360> for<00:03:02.600> 82<00:03:03.230> so

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
sold them for 89 for 88 bought for 82 so

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.699 
sold them for 89 for 88 bought for 82 so
that's<00:03:03.680> like<00:03:03.890> six<00:03:04.340> seven<00:03:05.209> GP<00:03:05.630> profit<00:03:06.170> then

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
that's like six seven GP profit then

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.850 
that's like six seven GP profit then
some<00:03:07.160> pine<00:03:07.550> logs<00:03:07.970> did<00:03:08.269> not<00:03:08.420> work<00:03:08.690> too<00:03:08.930> too<00:03:09.560> good

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
some pine logs did not work too too good

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.070 
some pine logs did not work too too good
with<00:03:10.069> those<00:03:10.220> but<00:03:10.550> some<00:03:10.850> sacred<00:03:11.269> oil<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.840> was

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
with those but some sacred oil that was

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.110 
with those but some sacred oil that was
quite<00:03:12.319> fine<00:03:12.650> that's<00:03:13.190> like<00:03:13.400> 80<00:03:13.640> thousand

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
quite fine that's like 80 thousand

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.870 
quite fine that's like 80 thousand
profit<00:03:14.540> from<00:03:15.019> one<00:03:15.590> flip<00:03:15.920> overnight<00:03:16.550> I'm

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
profit from one flip overnight I'm

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.759 
profit from one flip overnight I'm
actually<00:03:17.450> wondering<00:03:17.959> how<00:03:18.230> much<00:03:18.380> money<00:03:18.650> I

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
actually wondering how much money I

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.130 
actually wondering how much money I
would<00:03:19.010> make<00:03:19.190> from<00:03:19.370> solar<00:03:19.730> as<00:03:19.940> scales<00:03:20.269> so<00:03:20.930> let's

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
would make from solar as scales so let's

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.800 
would make from solar as scales so let's
enter<00:03:21.980> 50<00:03:22.489> thousand<00:03:22.910> if<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.150> would<00:03:23.299> buy<00:03:23.420> fifty

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
enter 50 thousand if I would buy fifty

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.220 
enter 50 thousand if I would buy fifty
thousand<00:03:24.260> 482<00:03:24.980> GP<00:03:25.340> that<00:03:25.820> is<00:03:26.030> 4.1<00:03:26.870> million

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
thousand 482 GP that is 4.1 million

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.220 
thousand 482 GP that is 4.1 million
exactly<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.340> would<00:03:28.489> sell<00:03:28.670> for<00:03:28.700> 89<00:03:29.360> GP<00:03:29.750> just

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
exactly if I would sell for 89 GP just

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.569 
exactly if I would sell for 89 GP just
like<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.410> did<00:03:30.680> in<00:03:30.799> this<00:03:30.920> video

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
like I did in this video

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.380 
like I did in this video
that<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.320> 4.4<00:03:33.320> 50<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.519> even<00:03:34.820> though<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.060> may

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
that is 4.4 50 so even though you may

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.170 
that is 4.4 50 so even though you may
think<00:03:35.420> that<00:03:35.750> it's<00:03:36.079> only<00:03:36.290> 5<00:03:36.650> GP<00:03:36.920> difference<00:03:37.489> six

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
think that it's only 5 GP difference six

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.920 
think that it's only 5 GP difference six
GP<00:03:38.600> difference<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.620> is<00:03:39.799> a<00:03:39.829> lot<00:03:40.160> I<00:03:40.600> buy<00:03:41.600> more

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
GP difference that is a lot I buy more

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.289 
GP difference that is a lot I buy more
of<00:03:41.989> these<00:03:42.260> scales<00:03:42.739> more<00:03:43.400> than<00:03:43.549> fifty<00:03:43.880> thousand

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
of these scales more than fifty thousand

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.270 
of these scales more than fifty thousand
a<00:03:44.359> day<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:45.049> means<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:45.470> make<00:03:45.650> approximately

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
a day so that means I make approximately

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.000 
a day so that means I make approximately
five<00:03:46.970> hundred<00:03:47.000> thousand<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.989> day<00:03:48.350> by<00:03:48.980> just

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
five hundred thousand a day by just

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.340 
five hundred thousand a day by just
flipping<00:03:49.430> Zalora<00:03:49.910> scales<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.720> nothing<00:03:51.140> else

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
flipping Zalora scales and nothing else

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.400 
flipping Zalora scales and nothing else
that's<00:03:51.980> why<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.280> got<00:03:52.609> so<00:03:52.640> lazy<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.359> traded<00:03:54.109> only

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
that's why I got so lazy and traded only

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.800 
that's why I got so lazy and traded only
these<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.920> think<00:03:55.579> after<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:55.910> make<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.269> video<00:03:56.630> it

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
these I think after I make this video it

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.380 
these I think after I make this video it
may<00:03:57.019> not<00:03:57.260> be<00:03:57.470> as<00:03:57.650> good<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.579> I'll<00:03:58.880> have<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.239> move

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
may not be as good so I'll have to move

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.440 
may not be as good so I'll have to move
on<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.750> different<00:04:00.170> items<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.940> I'll<00:04:01.940> have<00:04:02.269> to

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
on to different items and I'll have to

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.539 
on to different items and I'll have to
use<00:04:02.510> my<00:04:02.570> own<00:04:02.900> imagination<00:04:03.230> after<00:04:04.070> this<00:04:04.310> anyway

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
use my own imagination after this anyway

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.210 
use my own imagination after this anyway
I<00:04:05.120> hope<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.750> for<00:04:05.959> my<00:04:06.170> next<00:04:06.200> video<00:04:06.859> I'm<00:04:07.070> going

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
I hope that for my next video I'm going

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.670 
I hope that for my next video I'm going
to<00:04:07.310> have<00:04:07.489> some<00:04:07.760> variety<00:04:07.910> in<00:04:08.420> items<00:04:09.109> not<00:04:09.440> just

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
to have some variety in items not just

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.699 
to have some variety in items not just
other<00:04:10.040> scales<00:04:10.459> so<00:04:11.420> thanks<00:04:11.870> for<00:04:11.989> watching<00:04:12.470> and

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
other scales so thanks for watching and

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.250
