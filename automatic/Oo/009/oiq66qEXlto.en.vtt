00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.670
 2 

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.670
 Lord 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.910
 Dr. Reimu is a big success on this channel 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:16.910
 Put a number of goals to Ma broadcast the lab to go 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:22.779
 We are practicing the newest way of playing Micra now 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.779
 Let me show you a little bit of what a doctor is playing with 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.539
 Doctor's summer easy 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:43.370
 One day in August, Dr. found a beautiful seedling that sparkles 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:47.720
 Let's put an observation diary as a free research on summer vacation 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.170
 I planted a mysterious nursery in August 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.530
 I gave a lot of water with water 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.130
 What kind of tree grows up ? 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.690
 Na large early Re 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.690
 And the next day 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.750
 The party was covered in darkness 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:22.140
 Ramie Yeah eh bran Do not Do What 's Koryaa 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 I'm too nervous 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.310
 It is too loud 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.659
 I don't think I grew up from a single sapling This is yeah 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.470
 By the way if you check on the map like this 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.860
 This is the map of the largest size This feeling when checked with the map mod 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.590
 Marimo Kana 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:50.619
 The thickness of the trunk is 24m 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:54.780
 The diameter of the branch that has spread is in I and the center of the tree is more than 500 meters is open a big hole 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:58.770
 There is a tree with a lot of pavement in the middle of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:04.610
 I somehow scary too cormorant Hiii Deca 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:10.619
 The tree that Dr. grew up will be added in mfr 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:15.550
 But one of the largest in my class world as not grown from seedlings 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:20.200
 Do you think we are thinking, if everyone's lab love kid to go 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:24.280
 What happens if I buy a lumberjack and cut this tree 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.030
 Let's try it right now It's no good to imitate a good girl 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.180
 Soyerser 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.380
 ｰｰｰｰ that Wow I wood have been breaking-out 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.380
 And hardenedｰｰｰ 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.430
 Had 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.180
 One person mod was not good, but I wonder how many pieces of wood can be taken from this counter 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.360
 Ne 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:52.650
 I think that I will cut down this tree using the power of science instead of free research on summer vacation 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.240
 Use the mod to take on such a foolish challenge that no one has ever seen 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.790
 Because it 's the best part of the lab that goes 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.750
 Over example N'at why 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:07.110
 We have installed 500 harvesters that will cut trees with a saw 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:12.210
 I'm going to cut this tree by fully rotating the harvester 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.240
 You can store up to 2 billion items of this raw wood or something you got 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.340
 I'll keep it in my deep storage unit 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.790
 Let's go 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.850
 Switch oo tree ice for kita 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.660
 It will be harvested with tremendous force 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:33.580
 Uwaa I wonder how strange feeling a little Kimoi 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:37.860
 If you leave this as it is, you will be able to root and cut large trees. 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.860
 It's really Ne'm Mad Science 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.190
 Glitter Egreter 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.540
 There is not so much reduction 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:55.049
 Wind wave has added 200 units to over harvester See 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.049
 It has also been cut down thin trees remaining on the last after 20 hours 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:04.230
 The narrow branch part could not be harvested by the harvester 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.230
 It's too bothersome to remove manually 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:14.100
 So in safely logging has ended 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:18.290
 There are still many leaves left, but please forgive it for removing it 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.800
 It looks like this if you check on the map 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.800
 Let's check how many logs we got 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:33.730
 1,335 ten thousand 2351 this wood is for sale directly belowｰｰｰ 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:37.240
 It's tremendous Nante so raw wood can be taken from only one of the seedlings 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:44.880
 Free research of Dr. sister us by this 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.880
 If you want to see more of Dr.'s research announcements, please take a look at the main part of the lab, 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.420
 Please push your favorite button and subscribe 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.580
 Good too there is a malicious position of the button
