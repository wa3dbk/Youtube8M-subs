seven years covering the Sewell can you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.340 
seven years covering the Sewell can you
remember<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.520> team<00:02:37.940> with<00:02:38.840> greater

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
remember a team with greater

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.830 
remember a team with greater
expectations<00:02:40.280> than<00:02:40.490> this<00:02:40.610> one<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.720> know

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
expectations than this one you know

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.250 
expectations than this one you know
maybe<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:43.030> was<00:02:44.030> looking<00:02:44.360> back<00:02:44.600> at<00:02:44.840> one<00:02:44.990> of<00:02:45.110> my

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
maybe I was looking back at one of my

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.280 
maybe I was looking back at one of my
favorite<00:02:46.390> unappreciated<00:02:47.390> statistics<00:02:48.080> which

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
favorite unappreciated statistics which

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.020 
favorite unappreciated statistics which
is<00:02:48.790> scoring<00:02:49.790> margin<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.500> back<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:52.580> old<00:02:52.700> 30

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
is scoring margin and back in the old 30

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.510 
is scoring margin and back in the old 30
for<00:02:53.480> su<00:02:53.840> they<00:02:54.470> actually<00:02:54.890> ended<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.250> season

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
for su they actually ended the season

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.220 
for su they actually ended the season
with<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.850> scoring<00:02:56.270> margin<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.900> thought<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.170> was

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
with a scoring margin I thought it was

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.810 
with a scoring margin I thought it was
better<00:02:57.500> than<00:02:57.620> two<00:02:57.980> goals<00:02:58.010> per<00:02:58.490> game<00:02:58.520> which

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
better than two goals per game which

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.880 
better than two goals per game which
means<00:02:59.120> that's<00:02:59.720> your<00:02:59.990> average<00:03:00.320> margin<00:03:00.650> of

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
means that's your average margin of

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.970 
means that's your average margin of
victory<00:03:00.950> by<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.459> game<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:03.290> team<00:03:03.590> had<00:03:03.770> some

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
victory by a game and that team had some

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.370 
victory by a game and that team had some
high<00:03:04.130> expectations<00:03:04.520> as<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.240> know<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.630> got<00:03:06.080> to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
high expectations as you know and got to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.949 
high expectations as you know and got to
shut<00:03:06.770> out<00:03:06.920> one<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.280> nothing<00:03:07.459> why<00:03:08.360> Denver<00:03:08.630> that

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
shut out one to nothing why Denver that

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.540 
shut out one to nothing why Denver that
went<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.380> win<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.620> national<00:03:09.980> championship

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
went on to win the national championship

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.979 
went on to win the national championship
but<00:03:10.700> yeah<00:03:10.850> when<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.209> look<00:03:11.390> at<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.630> level<00:03:11.930> of

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
but yeah when you look at the level of

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.680 
but yeah when you look at the level of
talent<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:12.830> team<00:03:13.000> certainly<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
talent on this team certainly the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.350 
talent on this team certainly the
expectations<00:03:15.470> are<00:03:15.620> quite<00:03:16.280> high<00:03:16.519> they're

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
expectations are quite high they're

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.380 
expectations are quite high they're
scoring<00:03:17.720> margin<00:03:17.930> right<00:03:18.230> now<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.590> about<00:03:18.790> 1.7<00:03:19.790> so

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
scoring margin right now is about 1.7 so

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.360 
scoring margin right now is about 1.7 so
which<00:03:20.720> is<00:03:20.750> actually<00:03:21.200> quite<00:03:21.620> good<00:03:21.709> but<00:03:22.220> it

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
which is actually quite good but it

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.280 
which is actually quite good but it
seems<00:03:22.940> like<00:03:23.030> we<00:03:23.330> have<00:03:23.360> these<00:03:23.690> games<00:03:24.019> where

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
seems like we have these games where

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.470 
seems like we have these games where
either<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.709> win<00:03:24.890> by<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.130> lot<00:03:25.430> or<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.000> lose<00:03:26.150> by<00:03:26.450> a

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
either you win by a lot or you lose by a

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.290 
either you win by a lot or you lose by a
little<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.320> so<00:03:27.560> you're<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:28.850> get<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.030> good

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
little and so you're you get a good

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.940 
little and so you're you get a good
scoring<00:03:29.660> margin<00:03:29.989> in<00:03:30.290> those<00:03:30.440> kinds<00:03:30.860> of<00:03:30.890> games

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
scoring margin in those kinds of games

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.699 
scoring margin in those kinds of games
but<00:03:31.459> I'm<00:03:32.330> sure<00:03:32.540> Dave<00:03:32.750> hakstol<00:03:33.050> would<00:03:33.530> rather

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
but I'm sure Dave hakstol would rather

I think it a lot of it has to do with

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.000 
I think it a lot of it has to do with
chemistry<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.049> can<00:03:51.200> see<00:03:51.410> that<00:03:51.440> tonight

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
chemistry and you can see that tonight

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.640 
chemistry and you can see that tonight
that<00:03:52.340> they're<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:53.239> know<00:03:53.269> they're<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:54.470> not

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
that they're you know they're just not

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.160 
that they're you know they're just not
quite<00:03:55.040> off<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.180> seems<00:03:56.450> we're<00:03:56.720> not<00:03:56.900> quite

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
quite off and it seems we're not quite

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.370 
quite off and it seems we're not quite
on<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.680> seems<00:03:57.890> like<00:03:58.040> when<00:03:58.760> they<00:03:58.940> are<00:03:59.090> on

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
on and it seems like when they are on

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.410 
on and it seems like when they are on
they're<00:04:00.380> really<00:04:00.739> on<00:04:00.769> but<00:04:01.760> when<00:04:02.090> they're<00:04:02.209> not

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
they're really on but when they're not

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.020 
they're really on but when they're not
on<00:04:02.450> it's<00:04:03.140> like<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.920> know<00:04:04.010> it's<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:04.580> they

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
on it's like you know it's just they

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.680 
on it's like you know it's just they
can't<00:04:05.299> buy<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.540> goal<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:08.000> know<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.269> I<00:04:08.360> also

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
can't buy a goal and you know and I also

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.530 
can't buy a goal and you know and I also
you<00:04:09.530> also<00:04:09.590> get<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.430> you're<00:04:10.610> kind<00:04:10.850> of<00:04:10.940> dread<00:04:11.239> lit

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
you also get so you're kind of dread lit

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.420 
you also get so you're kind of dread lit
games<00:04:11.989> like<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.350> had<00:04:12.500> last<00:04:12.769> night<00:04:13.040> where<00:04:13.310> it

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
games like you had last night where it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.949 
games like you had last night where it
seems<00:04:13.670> like<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.000> goals<00:04:14.209> come<00:04:14.540> too<00:04:14.750> easy

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
seems like the goals come too easy

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:15.920 
seems like the goals come too easy
because<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.440> seems

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
because it seems

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.590 
because it seems
that's<00:04:16.139> been<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.470> pattern<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:17.130> they<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.329> one

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
that's been the pattern is they have one

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.539 
that's been the pattern is they have one
game<00:04:18.810> where<00:04:19.079> they<00:04:19.229> score<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> lot<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.829> goals<00:04:20.190> and

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
game where they score a lot of goals and

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.100 
game where they score a lot of goals and
then<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.479> next<00:04:21.509> game<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.830> very<00:04:23.610> few<00:04:23.970> if<00:04:24.660> any

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
then the next game it's very few if any

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.370 
then the next game it's very few if any
so<00:04:26.000> I'm<00:04:27.000> sure<00:04:27.210> what<00:04:27.419> Dave<00:04:27.780> would<00:04:27.960> like<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.229> see

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
so I'm sure what Dave would like to see

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.230 
so I'm sure what Dave would like to see
some<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.710> those<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:29.610> know<00:04:29.639> goals<00:04:29.910> spread

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
some of those you know goals spread

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.760 
some of those you know goals spread
around<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.600> little<00:04:30.720> more<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.229> not<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:31.620> many

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
around a little more and not so many

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.629 
around a little more and not so many
highs<00:04:31.979> and<00:04:32.580> lows<00:04:32.850> but<00:04:33.229> more<00:04:34.229> of<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.639> steady

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
highs and lows but more of a steady

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.999 
highs and lows but more of a steady
consistent<00:04:36.479> effort<00:04:37.259> throughout<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.889> whole

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
consistent effort throughout the whole

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.930 
consistent effort throughout the whole
game<00:04:38.449> any<00:04:39.449> predictions<00:04:40.490> for<00:04:41.490> how<00:04:41.639> they<00:04:41.789> will

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
game any predictions for how they will

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.890 
game any predictions for how they will
wind<00:04:42.150> up<00:04:42.270> this<00:04:42.479> year<00:04:43.250> well<00:04:44.449> of<00:04:45.449> course<00:04:45.539> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
wind up this year well of course the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.960 
wind up this year well of course the
coach<00:04:46.080> has<00:04:46.350> picked<00:04:47.130> them<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.310> finish<00:04:47.729> first

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
coach has picked them to finish first

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.909 
coach has picked them to finish first
and<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.509> you<00:04:49.169> know<00:04:49.199> I<00:04:49.320> don't<00:04:49.440> think<00:04:49.770> that's

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
and and you know I don't think that's

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.240 
and and you know I don't think that's
unrealistic<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:51.080> I'd<00:04:52.080> see<00:04:52.349> them<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.590> as<00:04:52.919> a<00:04:52.949> top

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
unrealistic I I'd see them in as a top

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.640 
unrealistic I I'd see them in as a top
three<00:04:53.639> team<00:04:53.880> but<00:04:54.539> you<00:04:54.660> know<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:54.960> it's<00:04:55.349> like

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
three team but you know it's it's like

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.560 
three team but you know it's it's like
tonight<00:04:56.099> you<00:04:56.400> know<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.759> this<00:04:56.910> is<00:04:57.090> game<00:04:57.360> they

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
tonight you know that this is game they

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.120 
tonight you know that this is game they
have<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.990> win<00:04:58.139> if<00:04:58.349> they<00:04:58.470> win<00:04:58.500> this<00:04:58.830> game<00:04:58.949> they

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
have to win if they win this game they

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.129 
have to win if they win this game they
leap<00:04:59.550> frog<00:04:59.880> Michigan<00:05:00.389> Tech<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.810> they<00:05:00.900> leap

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
leap frog Michigan Tech and they leap

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.710 
leap frog Michigan Tech and they leap
frog<00:05:01.849> Lewis<00:05:02.849> and<00:05:03.000> they're<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.270> third<00:05:03.479> place

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
frog Lewis and they're in third place

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.290 
frog Lewis and they're in third place
and<00:05:04.110> if<00:05:04.310> Denver<00:05:05.310> loses<00:05:05.639> again<00:05:05.880> denied<00:05:06.180> that

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
and if Denver loses again denied that

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.999 
and if Denver loses again denied that
are<00:05:06.479> tied<00:05:06.750> for<00:05:06.780> second<00:05:07.349> place<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:07.710> this<00:05:07.860> is

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
are tied for second place so this is

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.659 
are tied for second place so this is
really<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.460> game<00:05:08.669> that<00:05:08.849> they<00:05:09.030> they<00:05:09.570> need<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.169> win

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
really a game that they they need to win

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.570 
really a game that they they need to win
but<00:05:11.669> we've<00:05:12.210> seen<00:05:12.419> that<00:05:12.599> pattern<00:05:13.160> back<00:05:14.160> up<00:05:14.370> for

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
but we've seen that pattern back up for

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.730 
but we've seen that pattern back up for
a<00:05:14.610> running<00:05:14.910> start<00:05:15.180> honey<00:05:15.660> they<00:05:16.199> finish<00:05:16.530> like

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
a running start honey they finish like

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
a running start honey they finish like
gangbusters<00:05:17.220> so<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:19.800> know<00:05:19.919> let's<00:05:20.070> let's<00:05:20.370> hope

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
gangbusters so you know let's let's hope

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.189 
gangbusters so you know let's let's hope
that<00:05:20.789> they<00:05:21.330> can<00:05:21.510> come<00:05:21.690> through<00:05:21.900> here<00:05:22.080> in<00:05:22.169> the
