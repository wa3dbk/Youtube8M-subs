00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
I'm so bummed a new 7200 rpm hard drive

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.410 
I'm so bummed a new 7200 rpm hard drive
is<00:00:09.389> gonna<00:00:09.570> cost<00:00:09.780> me<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> fortune

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.050 

but<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.869> need<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> performance<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.670> I'm<00:00:17.970> gonna

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
but I need the performance so I'm gonna

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.870 
but I need the performance so I'm gonna
have<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> bite<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.660> bullet<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:20.189> seem

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
have to bite the bullet on this you seem

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.239 
have to bite the bullet on this you seem
frustrated<00:00:21.119> hey<00:00:21.869> yeah<00:00:22.320> I'm<00:00:22.769> trying<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.070> buy<00:00:23.220> a

three-year old hard drive it's dying on
me<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.289> 7200<00:00:29.279> rpm<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.329> need<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.839> get<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
me but it's 7200 rpm so I need to get a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.500 
me but it's 7200 rpm so I need to get a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
new 7200 rpm hard drive I got a surprise

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.430 
new 7200 rpm hard drive I got a surprise
for<00:00:33.750> you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
for you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.180 
for you
what's<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:36.200> before<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.530> discuss<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
what's that before I can discuss it

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.400 
what's that before I can discuss it
though<00:00:38.310> let's<00:00:38.550> talk<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:39.060> a<00:00:39.180> hard<00:00:39.720> drive<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
though let's talk about a hard drive and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.320 
though let's talk about a hard drive and
how<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.430> made<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
how it really is made up and what the

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.230 
how it really is made up and what the
format<00:00:42.810> is<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.320> how<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.710> works<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.580> sense<00:00:45.060> that

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
format is and how it works I sense that

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.110 
format is and how it works I sense that
you're<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.630> to<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.900> very<00:00:46.080> technical<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:47.070> me

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
you're about to get very technical on me

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.430 
you're about to get very technical on me
just<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.510> bit<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:49.200> hard<00:00:50.130> drive<00:00:50.490> has<00:00:51.440> rotating

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
just a bit a hard drive has rotating

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.610 
just a bit a hard drive has rotating
discs<00:00:52.740> with<00:00:52.980> many<00:00:53.190> tracks<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:53.820> OD<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.420> ID<00:00:54.690> we

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
discs with many tracks from OD to ID we

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.540 
discs with many tracks from OD to ID we
refer<00:00:56.040> to<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.670> tracks<00:00:57.210> per<00:00:57.630> inch<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.080> TPI

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
refer to that as tracks per inch or TPI

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.850 
refer to that as tracks per inch or TPI
we<00:00:59.550> also<00:00:59.790> have<00:01:00.270> bits<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.170> around<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
we also have bits that go around the

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.100 
we also have bits that go around the
disk<00:01:02.130> which<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.640> refer<00:01:03.060> as<00:01:03.090> BPI

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
disk which we refer as BPI

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.310 
disk which we refer as BPI
bits<00:01:04.890> per<00:01:05.460> inch<00:01:05.909> exactly

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
bits per inch exactly

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.160 
bits per inch exactly
so<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:07.859> tracks<00:01:08.249> per<00:01:08.549> inch<00:01:08.789> and<00:01:09.060> bits<00:01:09.869> per

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so with tracks per inch and bits per

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.410 
so with tracks per inch and bits per
inch<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.679> could<00:01:10.890> describe<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.640> format<00:01:12.210> which

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
inch we could describe the format which

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.639 
inch we could describe the format which
a<00:01:12.570> drive<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:14.340> let's<00:01:14.670> talk<00:01:14.909> about

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
a drive will have now let's talk about

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.630 
a drive will have now let's talk about
5400<00:01:16.649> verses<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.469> 7200<00:01:19.469> rpm<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.490> not

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
5400 verses the 7200 rpm you're not

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.499 
5400 verses the 7200 rpm you're not
listening<00:01:21.179> to<00:01:21.210> me<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> don't<00:01:21.810> want<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.999> 5400<00:01:23.999> rpm

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
listening to me I don't want a 5400 rpm

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.200 
listening to me I don't want a 5400 rpm
hard<00:01:24.719> drive<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:25.200> replacing<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.799> 7200<00:01:26.729> rpm<00:01:27.090> hard

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
hard drive I'm replacing a 7200 rpm hard

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.389 
hard drive I'm replacing a 7200 rpm hard
drive<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.259> speed<00:01:28.619> cat<00:01:29.039> I<00:01:29.340> need

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
drive it's about the speed cat I need

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.379 
drive it's about the speed cat I need
the<00:01:29.850> speed<00:01:30.289> give<00:01:31.289> me<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.469> minute<00:01:31.939> to<00:01:32.939> prove<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:33.389 
the speed give me a minute to prove you

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:37.219 
the speed give me a minute to prove you
wrong<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.960> right<00:01:34.229> you're<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> clock<00:01:36.229> 5400

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
wrong all right you're on the clock 5400

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.319 
wrong all right you're on the clock 5400
revolutions<00:01:37.950> per<00:01:38.219> minute<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:40.130> 7200<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.329> 7200

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
revolutions per minute and 7200 is 7200

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.749 
revolutions per minute and 7200 is 7200
revolutions<00:01:42.960> per<00:01:43.020> minute<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.490> were<00:01:44.639> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
revolutions per minute so if we were to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.469 
revolutions per minute so if we were to
say<00:01:44.969> all<00:01:45.240> things<00:01:45.780> being<00:01:46.020> equal<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:47.329> 7200<00:01:48.329> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
say all things being equal the 7200 is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.209 
say all things being equal the 7200 is
going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.959> pop<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.409> data<00:01:49.649> off<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> disk

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
going to pop that data off the disk

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.389 
going to pop that data off the disk
faster<00:01:50.939> that's<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.630> I'm<00:01:51.780> saying<00:01:52.139> hold<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
faster that's what I'm saying hold on I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.239 
faster that's what I'm saying hold on I
have<00:01:53.520> some<00:01:53.700> time<00:01:53.909> left<00:01:54.179> it's<00:01:55.109> very<00:01:55.829> dependent

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
have some time left it's very dependent

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.539 
have some time left it's very dependent
on<00:01:56.579> how<00:01:56.819> many<00:01:57.060> bits<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.840> are<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.350> each<00:01:59.009> track

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
on how many bits there are on each track

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.239 
on how many bits there are on each track
also<00:02:00.450> how<00:02:00.689> many<00:02:00.899> tracks<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:01.740> if<00:02:01.920> we're<00:02:02.100> going

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
also how many tracks so if we're going

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.429 
also how many tracks so if we're going
to<00:02:02.310> talk<00:02:02.549> about<00:02:02.850> performance<00:02:03.329> we're<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
to talk about performance we're going to

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.319 
to talk about performance we're going to
have<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.770> talk<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.549> only<00:02:05.579> spindle

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
have to talk about not only spindle

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.730 
have to talk about not only spindle
speed<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:06.899> we're<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.139> to<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.529> talk

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
speed but we're going to have to talk

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.669 
speed but we're going to have to talk
about<00:02:07.920> bitrate<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.090> throughput<00:02:09.690> which<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
about bitrate and throughput which is

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.979 
about bitrate and throughput which is
how<00:02:10.830> fast<00:02:11.069> data<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.610> coming<00:02:11.849> off<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.720> disk

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
how fast data is coming off of the disk

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.940 
how fast data is coming off of the disk
and<00:02:13.260> getting<00:02:13.530> delivered

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950

an analogy you have a sports car I do is

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.569 
an analogy you have a sports car I do is
it<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.599> convertible<00:02:27.700> okay<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.989> convertible<00:02:29.989> and

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
it a convertible okay a convertible and

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.869 
it a convertible okay a convertible and
you<00:02:31.579> have<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.879> truck<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.870> can<00:02:33.739> carry<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.159> lot<00:02:34.250> of

you have a truck that can carry a lot of

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.849 
you have a truck that can carry a lot of
data<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.389> have<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.599> whole<00:02:35.989> bunch<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.379> data<00:02:36.560> that

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
data you have a whole bunch of data that

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.569 
data you have a whole bunch of data that
you<00:02:37.040> need<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.459> move<00:02:37.639> from<00:02:38.120> point<00:02:38.359> A<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.629> point<00:02:38.870> B

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
you need to move from point A to point B

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.860 
you need to move from point A to point B
the<00:02:40.579> race<00:02:40.909> car<00:02:41.389> will<00:02:41.900> take<00:02:43.060> multiple<00:02:44.060> trips<00:02:44.389> to

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
the race car will take multiple trips to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.869 
the race car will take multiple trips to
get<00:02:45.019> that<00:02:45.260> data<00:02:45.499> but<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:46.010> truck<00:02:46.400> will<00:02:46.639> be<00:02:46.669> able

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
get that data but the truck will be able

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.240 
get that data but the truck will be able
to<00:02:47.000> carry<00:02:47.209> all<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.959> data<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:49.010> your

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
to carry all the data to your

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.129 
to carry all the data to your
destination<00:02:50.889> so<00:02:51.889> we're<00:02:52.699> relation<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.780> disk

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
destination so we're relation to a disk

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.550 
destination so we're relation to a disk
drive<00:02:54.879> think<00:02:55.879> about<00:02:56.180> one<00:02:56.629> rotation<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.439> the

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
drive think about one rotation of the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.330 
drive think about one rotation of the
disk<00:02:57.859> we'll<00:02:58.189> be<00:02:58.310> able<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.609> carry<00:02:58.909> all<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.689> data

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
disk we'll be able to carry all the data

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.459 
disk we'll be able to carry all the data
to<00:03:01.340> your<00:03:01.519> destination<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:02.810> you're<00:03:03.109> saying

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
to your destination so you're saying

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.610 
to your destination so you're saying
that<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:04.219> about<00:03:04.609> the<00:03:05.090> number<00:03:05.659> of<00:03:05.900> bits<00:03:06.439> that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
that it's about the number of bits that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.490 
that it's about the number of bits that
can<00:03:07.010> come<00:03:07.250> off<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.699> disk<00:03:07.969> in<00:03:08.299> one<00:03:08.810> rotation

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
can come off the disk in one rotation

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.949 
can come off the disk in one rotation
that<00:03:09.769> delivers<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.430> performance<00:03:10.849> it's<00:03:11.359> not

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
that delivers the performance it's not

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.220 
that delivers the performance it's not
just<00:03:12.199> about<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.500> speed<00:03:12.699> very<00:03:13.699> good<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.989> there

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
just about the speed very good so there

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.289 
just about the speed very good so there
are<00:03:15.409> two<00:03:15.769> things<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:16.459> increase<00:03:16.879> your

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
are two things to increase your

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.559 
are two things to increase your
throughput<00:03:18.009> one<00:03:19.009> you<00:03:19.790> can<00:03:20.000> increase<00:03:20.269> the

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
throughput one you can increase the

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.679 
throughput one you can increase the
spindle<00:03:20.959> speed<00:03:21.229> or<00:03:21.799> two<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:23.180> lower<00:03:23.449> the

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:23.689 
spindle speed or two you lower the

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.449 
spindle speed or two you lower the
spindle<00:03:24.109> speed<00:03:24.349> but<00:03:24.590> increase<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.280> bit

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
spindle speed but increase the bit

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.240 
spindle speed but increase the bit
density<00:03:26.239> if<00:03:26.479> the<00:03:27.019> density<00:03:27.530> were<00:03:27.680> increased<00:03:28.069> by

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
density if the density were increased by

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.849 
density if the density were increased by
two<00:03:28.310> times<00:03:28.939> for<00:03:29.419> just<00:03:29.689> one<00:03:29.930> rotation<00:03:30.439> and

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
two times for just one rotation and

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.289 
two times for just one rotation and
leave<00:03:31.069> all<00:03:31.340> other<00:03:31.729> factors<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.599> same<00:03:32.900> then<00:03:33.769> a

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
leave all other factors the same then a

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.229 
leave all other factors the same then a
7200<00:03:35.299> rpm<00:03:35.720> hard<00:03:35.930> drive<00:03:36.079> could<00:03:37.009> spin<00:03:37.310> at<00:03:37.430> 3600

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
7200 rpm hard drive could spin at 3600

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.199 
7200 rpm hard drive could spin at 3600
rpms<00:03:38.689> and<00:03:39.019> deliver<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.769> same<00:03:39.919> performance

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
rpms and deliver the same performance

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.499 
rpms and deliver the same performance
which<00:03:41.209> means<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:42.019> my<00:03:42.439> new<00:03:43.000> 5400<00:03:44.000> rpm<00:03:44.359> hard

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:44.509 
which means that my new 5400 rpm hard

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.929 
which means that my new 5400 rpm hard
drive<00:03:44.629> is<00:03:45.109> going<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.829> deliver<00:03:46.159> better<00:03:46.489> than<00:03:46.819> my

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:46.939 
drive is going to deliver better than my

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:52.509 
drive is going to deliver better than my
old<00:03:47.290> 7200<00:03:48.290> rpm<00:03:48.590> hour<00:03:48.739> drive<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.859> advantage

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
old 7200 rpm hour drive so the advantage

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.839 
old 7200 rpm hour drive so the advantage
now<00:03:52.819> of<00:03:53.409> 5400<00:03:54.409> rpm<00:03:54.949> is<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.400> drive<00:03:55.669> will

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
now of 5400 rpm is the drive will

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.559 
now of 5400 rpm is the drive will
generate<00:03:56.239> much<00:03:56.720> less<00:03:57.049> heat<00:03:57.409> less<00:03:58.189> power<00:03:58.579> will

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
generate much less heat less power will

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.390 
generate much less heat less power will
have<00:03:59.810> better<00:04:00.139> wear<00:04:00.439> and<00:04:00.650> tear<00:04:00.859> on<00:04:01.009> the<00:04:01.159> heads

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
have better wear and tear on the heads

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.629 
have better wear and tear on the heads
