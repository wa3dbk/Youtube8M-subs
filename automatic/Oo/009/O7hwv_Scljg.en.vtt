 comp-mall certainly has orders 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.339
 as a stooge to fulfill and then this 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.019
 as telephone booths one would say Germany 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.660
 and he accepts orders and has to, for example, cart a fever 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.730
 or to 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.040
 Taxis percent of all kinds as well as the quarrels in which dubious garage 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.070
 drive so 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.700
 yes the ambiance is but 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.010
 at GTA ajar so the orders you have to lead from it 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.600
 how about I give her that limo around with a certain 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.459
 with time to drive from one end of the city to the other 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.050
 It's not a decent job, if you say so 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.270
 So you do not behave around in the city 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.870
 the problem of nice circumstance so you can get around with the car 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 Ask how you want to bump on board as you want 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.340
 you can behave a bit rude the school bus Car Porn 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.340
 the boarding and borders were the area 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.040
 that is very brave 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.409

 though from all over the atmosphere the animals man 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.220
 around those 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.960
 the pedestrian crossed others 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.660
 it was not after that 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.370
 There are more skeletons glistening in a couple of training missions 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.270
 For example, you learn how to shoot a job like that and it worked out a lot 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.910
 important for such a job or how to throw the hand grenade 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.510

 Entering at around 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.339
 the player count as given then run Amiga 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.509
 this practical implementation which he has free of charge 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.829
 the Seelzer has succeeded relatively well 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.629
 in order to automatically save in the weapons variety that fits everything 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.629

 the kicker of the iphone percent a bit shot image you have to first 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.919
 come up and a fan party does not close very easy
