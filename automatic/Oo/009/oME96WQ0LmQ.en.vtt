00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
unfortunately which is in 2014 not 2013

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.449 
unfortunately which is in 2014 not 2013
I<00:02:20.580> believe<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:24.350> 2013<00:02:25.350> date<00:02:25.620> would<00:02:26.010> have<00:02:26.220> been

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
I believe the 2013 date would have been

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.180 
I believe the 2013 date would have been
Boxing<00:02:27.209> Day<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.600> based<00:02:30.840> off

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190

don't have any facts to back it up and I

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.550 
don't have any facts to back it up and I
though<00:02:53.100> reasoning<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.239> believe<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.320> was

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
though reasoning that I believe it was

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.370 
though reasoning that I believe it was
from<00:02:56.430> what<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.610> read<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.780> was<00:02:57.989> because

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
from what I read is that it was because

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.250 
from what I read is that it was because
they<00:02:59.220> were<00:02:59.280> unable<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.730> get<00:03:00.150> day<00:03:00.420> one<00:03:00.660> digital

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
they were unable to get day one digital

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.039 
they were unable to get day one digital
on<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:03.480> Xbox<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.580> what<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.480> believe

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
on the Xbox so that is what I believe

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.949 
on the Xbox so that is what I believe
and<00:03:07.350> while<00:03:07.590> I'm<00:03:07.890> talking<00:03:07.920> I'm<00:03:08.519> on<00:03:08.750> 27<00:03:09.750> at<00:03:09.840> the

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
now yes it would be interesting to see

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.129 
now yes it would be interesting to see
if<00:05:16.669> they<00:05:16.849> had<00:05:17.000> like<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.180> fielding<00:05:17.750> sort<00:05:18.080> of

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
if they had like a fielding sort of

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.820 
if they had like a fielding sort of
frame<00:05:18.379> Center<00:05:19.240> because<00:05:20.470> building<00:05:21.470> like<00:05:21.800> a

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
frame Center because building like a

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.189 
frame Center because building like a
whole<00:05:22.039> this<00:05:22.400> game<00:05:22.639> is<00:05:22.849> so<00:05:23.240> different<00:05:23.629> to<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.139> lot

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
whole this game is so different to a lot

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.600 
whole this game is so different to a lot
any<00:05:27.199> other<00:05:27.530> cricket<00:05:27.860> game<00:05:28.009> we've<00:05:28.190> ever<00:05:28.280> seen

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
any other cricket game we've ever seen

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.210 
any other cricket game we've ever seen
before<00:05:28.990> even<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.289> bat<00:05:30.470> like<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:30.949> batting

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
before even the bat like the batting

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.180 
before even the bat like the batting
controls<00:05:31.520> are<00:05:31.610> very<00:05:31.759> similar<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.500> cricket<00:05:33.500> 207

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
controls are very similar to cricket 207

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.210 
controls are very similar to cricket 207
whereas<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.120> use<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.780> right<00:05:36.199> stick<00:05:36.680> to

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
whereas you use the right stick to

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.330 
whereas you use the right stick to
maneuver<00:05:37.699> the<00:05:37.879> ball<00:05:38.680> and<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.770> lipstick<00:05:40.129> to

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
maneuver the ball and the lipstick to

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.980 
maneuver the ball and the lipstick to
move<00:05:40.729> away<00:05:40.849> we're<00:05:41.180> standing<00:05:41.539> on<00:05:41.659> the<00:05:41.750> crease

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
move away we're standing on the crease

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.809 
move away we're standing on the crease
and<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:45.069> know<00:05:46.069> I'm<00:05:46.159> your<00:05:46.280> screw<00:05:46.520> up

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:46.819 
and I know I'm your screw up

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.240 
and I know I'm your screw up
I'm<00:05:46.940> gonna<00:05:47.060> go<00:05:47.210> feel<00:05:47.389> stupid<00:05:47.659> shot<00:05:47.990> now<00:05:48.979> we<00:05:49.039> got

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
I'm gonna go feel stupid shot now we got

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.309 
I'm gonna go feel stupid shot now we got
it<00:05:49.340> anyway<00:05:49.639> so<00:05:50.629> it's<00:05:50.750> very<00:05:50.930> similar<00:05:51.139> to<00:05:51.289> a

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
it anyway so it's very similar to a

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.999 
it anyway so it's very similar to a
cricket<00:05:51.650> 207<00:05:53.259> in<00:05:54.259> the<00:05:54.379> way<00:05:54.500> that<00:05:54.680> you<00:05:54.800> use

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
cricket 207 in the way that you use

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.830 
cricket 207 in the way that you use
these<00:05:55.250> sticks<00:05:55.610> to<00:05:56.090> control<00:05:56.449> the<00:05:56.599> ball<00:05:57.430> and

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
these sticks to control the ball and

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.800 
these sticks to control the ball and
then<00:05:59.840> there<00:06:00.710> is<00:06:01.090> it's<00:06:02.090> actually<00:06:02.180> quite<00:06:02.569> a<00:06:02.599> lot

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
then there is it's actually quite a lot

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.450 
then there is it's actually quite a lot
of<00:06:02.900> shot<00:06:03.169> modifiers<00:06:03.590> and<00:06:03.889> I<00:06:04.009> think<00:06:04.219> I<00:06:04.280> put<00:06:04.430> that

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
of shot modifiers and I think I put that

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:12.070 
of shot modifiers and I think I put that
on<00:06:04.639> the<00:06:04.729> pads<00:06:08.620> anyway<00:06:10.360> 51<00:06:11.360> is<00:06:11.630> the<00:06:11.840> pace

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
on the pads anyway 51 is the pace

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.159 
on the pads anyway 51 is the pace
challenge<00:06:12.620> to<00:06:12.830> beat<00:06:13.039> I<00:06:13.340> will<00:06:13.880> now<00:06:14.029> do<00:06:14.090> the<00:06:14.479> spin

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
challenge to beat I will now do the spin

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.920 
challenge to beat I will now do the spin
challenge<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:16.150> I'll<00:06:17.150> see<00:06:17.330> how<00:06:17.630> many<00:06:17.810> I<00:06:17.840> can

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
challenge and I'll see how many I can

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.749 
challenge and I'll see how many I can
