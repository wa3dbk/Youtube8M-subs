Skyfall and Avengers they were only shot
at<00:02:17.470> 2.8<00:02:18.160> K<00:02:18.400> with<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.880> Ares<00:02:19.240> Alexa<00:02:19.690> which<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.960> a

at 2.8 K with the Ares Alexa which is a

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.350 
at 2.8 K with the Ares Alexa which is a
very<00:02:20.200> great<00:02:20.440> cinema<00:02:20.920> camera<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:22.060> doesn't

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
very great cinema camera but it doesn't

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.150 
very great cinema camera but it doesn't
have<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.630> resolution<00:02:22.930> needed<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:24.010> these

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
have the resolution needed for these

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.340 
have the resolution needed for these
high<00:02:24.430> resolution<00:02:24.670> monitors<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.960> course<00:02:26.230> there

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
high resolution monitors of course there

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.050 
high resolution monitors of course there
are<00:02:26.380> digital<00:02:26.650> cameras<00:02:27.280> like<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.520> red<00:02:27.700> epic

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
are digital cameras like the red epic

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.390 
are digital cameras like the red epic
that<00:02:28.240> will<00:02:28.360> shoot<00:02:28.540> up<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.750> 5k<00:02:29.410> but<00:02:30.070> they<00:02:30.190> don't

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
that will shoot up to 5k but they don't

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.310 
that will shoot up to 5k but they don't
really<00:02:30.700> typically<00:02:31.120> finish<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.750> movie<00:02:32.110> in

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
really typically finish the movie in

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.800 
really typically finish the movie in
that<00:02:32.620> high<00:02:32.890> resolution<00:02:33.640> because<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.150> CGI

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
that high resolution because of CGI

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.860 
that high resolution because of CGI
whatever<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.710> funny<00:02:36.490> enough<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.060> movie

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
whatever and funny enough the movie

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.960 
whatever and funny enough the movie
theaters<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.860> see<00:02:39.190> them<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.610> if<00:02:39.790> you're

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
theaters that you see them in if you're

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.420 
theaters that you see them in if you're
seeing<00:02:40.240> them<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.630> digital<00:02:41.430> presentation

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
seeing them in a digital presentation

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.810 
seeing them in a digital presentation
they're<00:02:43.060> usually<00:02:43.600> about<00:02:43.980> 2k<00:02:44.980> add<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.760> bit

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
they're usually about 2k add just a bit

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.420 
they're usually about 2k add just a bit
higher<00:02:46.660> resolution<00:02:47.530> than<00:02:47.710> what<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.310> would

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
higher resolution than what you would

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.060 
higher resolution than what you would
typically<00:02:48.730> find<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.390> blu-ray<00:02:49.630> disc<00:02:50.110> at<00:02:50.830> home

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
typically find in a blu-ray disc at home

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.430 
typically find in a blu-ray disc at home
so<00:02:51.400> they're<00:02:52.000> really<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.690> super

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
so they're really just a super

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.880 
so they're really just a super
uncompressed<00:02:54.280> digital<00:02:54.880> format<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.380> blu-ray

uncompressed digital format of a blu-ray

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.220 
uncompressed digital format of a blu-ray
disc<00:02:57.160> that's<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.670> little<00:02:57.910> bit<00:02:58.090> above<00:02:58.390> 1920<00:02:59.110> by

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
disc that's a little bit above 1920 by

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.360 
disc that's a little bit above 1920 by
1080<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.970> within<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.450> 2k<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.080> 3<00:03:02.740> cake<00:03:03.010> and

1080 and within the the 2k to 3 cake and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.220 
1080 and within the the 2k to 3 cake and
a<00:03:03.430> vicinity<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.510> even<00:03:04.810> in<00:03:04.900> your<00:03:04.960> movie

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
a vicinity so even in your movie

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.890 
a vicinity so even in your movie
theaters<00:03:05.560> you've<00:03:05.770> never<00:03:06.100> seen<00:03:06.490> most<00:03:07.450> likely<00:03:07.870> a

theaters you've never seen most likely a
4k<00:03:08.880> presentation<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.120> movie<00:03:10.420> now<00:03:11.230> one<00:03:11.380> of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
4k presentation of a movie now one of

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.040 
4k presentation of a movie now one of
the<00:03:11.560> things<00:03:11.740> that<00:03:11.920> 4k<00:03:12.400> will<00:03:12.610> do<00:03:12.880> is<00:03:13.210> definitely

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
the things that 4k will do is definitely

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.610 
the things that 4k will do is definitely
drive<00:03:14.500> competition<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.580> drive<00:03:15.850> technology

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
drive competition and drive technology

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.500 
drive competition and drive technology
towards<00:03:17.620> extremely<00:03:18.340> high<00:03:18.520> resolution<00:03:19.270> and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
towards extremely high resolution and

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.140 
towards extremely high resolution and
extremely<00:03:20.020> high<00:03:20.350> finishing<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.460> lot<00:03:22.120> of

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
extremely high finishing so a lot of

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.030 
extremely high finishing so a lot of
movie<00:03:22.660> studios<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.440> lot<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.740> movie

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
movie studios and a lot of movie

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.730 
movie studios and a lot of movie
creators<00:03:24.700> will<00:03:25.360> have<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.870> basically<00:03:26.110> push<00:03:26.590> the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
and and distribute the movie in 4k now

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.630 
and and distribute the movie in 4k now
of<00:03:32.530> course<00:03:32.740> this<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:33.040> not<00:03:33.220> going<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.460> happen

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
of course this is not going to happen

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.610 
of course this is not going to happen
right<00:03:34.000> away<00:03:34.360> you're<00:03:34.600> gonna<00:03:34.690> have<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:34.960> gradual

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
right away you're gonna have a gradual

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.730 
right away you're gonna have a gradual
progression<00:03:35.860> of<00:03:36.750> resolutions<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.170> standards

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
progression of resolutions and standards

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.850 
progression of resolutions and standards
coming<00:03:39.130> out<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.520> are<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.850> bit<00:03:40.360> higher<00:03:40.660> than

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
coming out that are a bit higher than

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.600 
coming out that are a bit higher than
1920<00:03:41.860> by<00:03:42.010> 1080

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.990 
1920 by 1080
maybe<00:03:43.090> we're<00:03:43.540> not<00:03:43.690> gonna<00:03:43.810> see<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:45.000> immediate

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
maybe we're not gonna see a immediate

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.110 
maybe we're not gonna see a immediate
jump<00:03:46.300> up<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.230> quad<00:03:47.530> HD<00:03:47.800> resolution

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
jump up to the the quad HD resolution

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.040 
jump up to the the quad HD resolution
you're<00:03:49.120> gonna<00:03:49.270> probably<00:03:49.540> find<00:03:49.870> some

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
you're gonna probably find some

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.110 
you're gonna probably find some
resolutions<00:03:50.590> in<00:03:50.770> between<00:03:51.160> but<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.700> never

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
resolutions in between but you never

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.110 
resolutions in between but you never
know<00:03:52.360> maybe<00:03:53.080> we<00:03:53.380> can<00:03:53.830> jump<00:03:54.220> up<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.700> 4k

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
know maybe we can jump up to the 4k

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.850 
know maybe we can jump up to the 4k
resolution<00:03:55.720> one<00:03:56.050> of<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.230> nice<00:03:56.410> things<00:03:56.650> is

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
resolution one of the nice things is

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.420 
resolution one of the nice things is
movies<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.550> were<00:03:57.700> shot<00:03:57.940> on<00:03:58.150> celluloid<00:03:58.750> film

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
movies that were shot on celluloid film

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.090 
movies that were shot on celluloid film
can<00:04:00.430> be<00:04:00.610> actually<00:04:01.380> increased<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:02.680> blown<00:04:02.920> up

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
can be actually increased and blown up

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.850 
can be actually increased and blown up
to<00:04:03.430> 4k<00:04:03.970> resolutions<00:04:04.630> because<00:04:04.990> film<00:04:05.290> has<00:04:05.530> no

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
to 4k resolutions because film has no

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.370 
to 4k resolutions because film has no
real<00:04:06.730> physical<00:04:07.060> resolution<00:04:07.990> it<00:04:08.170> can<00:04:08.290> be

it's<00:04:16.510> actually<00:04:16.930> probably<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.650> optimal<00:04:18.340> way

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
it's actually probably the optimal way

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.050 
it's actually probably the optimal way
to<00:04:19.239> watch<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.930> 35-millimeter<00:04:20.739> movie<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.580> a<00:04:21.760> lot

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
to watch a 35-millimeter movie so a lot

incredible<00:04:44.830> new<00:04:44.979> life<00:04:45.190> because<00:04:45.550> they<00:04:45.789> have<00:04:46.360> an

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
incredible new life because they have an

probably be blown up to 8k or even

probably be blown up to 8k or even
higher<00:04:54.039> of<00:04:54.310> course

and the more you can potentially do so

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.089 
and the more you can potentially do so
the<00:05:37.090> nice<00:05:37.479> thing<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.990> when<00:05:38.710> they<00:05:38.919> actually

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
the nice thing is when they actually

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.760 
the nice thing is when they actually
come<00:05:39.340> out<00:05:39.430> with<00:05:39.639> these<00:05:39.760> 4k<00:05:40.389> computer<00:05:41.320> monitor

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
come out with these 4k computer monitor

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.350 
come out with these 4k computer monitor
displays<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.400> think<00:05:42.610> will<00:05:42.699> be<00:05:42.820> very<00:05:43.090> popular

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.629 
displays I think will be very popular
and<00:05:43.840> sell<00:05:44.050> pretty<00:05:44.440> well<00:05:44.770> because<00:05:45.010> they

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
and sell pretty well because they

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.680 
and sell pretty well because they
actually<00:05:45.880> have<00:05:46.830> content<00:05:47.830> that<00:05:48.010> they<00:05:48.159> can<00:05:48.190> use

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
actually have content that they can use

to<00:06:03.849> these<00:06:03.970> super<00:06:04.690> high<00:06:04.900> Ultra<00:06:05.889> HD<00:06:06.030> resolutions

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
to these super high Ultra HD resolutions

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.779 
to these super high Ultra HD resolutions
because<00:06:07.599> the<00:06:08.289> graphics<00:06:08.680> card<00:06:08.979> can<00:06:09.370> handle

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
because the graphics card can handle

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.510 
because the graphics card can handle
that<00:06:10.000> kind<00:06:10.479> of<00:06:10.570> crazy<00:06:11.229> data<00:06:11.770> and<00:06:12.070> throughput

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
that kind of crazy data and throughput

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.850 
that kind of crazy data and throughput
and<00:06:12.699> everything<00:06:13.060> like<00:06:13.150> that<00:06:13.210> so<00:06:13.659> a<00:06:13.690> 4k<00:06:14.199> monitor

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
and everything like that so a 4k monitor

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.610 
and everything like that so a 4k monitor
for<00:06:15.220> computers<00:06:15.849> will<00:06:16.060> be<00:06:16.210> a<00:06:16.449> great<00:06:16.990> thing<00:06:17.229> when

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
for computers will be a great thing when

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.189 
for computers will be a great thing when
they<00:06:18.220> actually<00:06:18.430> start<00:06:19.120> to<00:06:19.180> come<00:06:19.539> out<00:06:19.690> and<00:06:19.900> be

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
they actually start to come out and be

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.170 
they actually start to come out and be
available<00:06:20.740> but<00:06:21.370> I<00:06:21.400> don't<00:06:21.580> like<00:06:21.669> guys<00:06:21.880> I<00:06:22.030> know<00:06:22.090> I

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
available but I don't like guys I know I

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.810 
available but I don't like guys I know I
talked<00:06:22.509> a<00:06:22.659> lot<00:06:22.930> about<00:06:23.169> 4k<00:06:23.979> and<00:06:24.159> what<00:06:24.310> it<00:06:24.430> means

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
talked a lot about 4k and what it means

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.779 
talked a lot about 4k and what it means
to<00:06:25.630> the<00:06:25.720> industry<00:06:26.470> and<00:06:26.830> what<00:06:27.099> it<00:06:27.190> means<00:06:27.310> to<00:06:27.580> you

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
to the industry and what it means to you

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:29.730 
to the industry and what it means to you
as<00:06:27.940> a<00:06:27.970> consumer<00:06:28.389> I<00:06:28.690> think<00:06:29.349> it's<00:06:29.440> a<00:06:29.530> great

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
as a consumer I think it's a great

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.129 
as a consumer I think it's a great
technology<00:06:30.220> that<00:06:30.909> eventually<00:06:31.570> will<00:06:32.020> be

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
technology that eventually will be

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.360 
technology that eventually will be
adopted<00:06:32.740> as<00:06:32.889> a<00:06:33.219> mainstream<00:06:33.690> standard

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
adopted as a mainstream standard

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.520 
adopted as a mainstream standard
probably<00:06:35.970> within<00:06:36.180> the<00:06:36.330> next<00:06:36.449> ten<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.290> five

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
probably within the next ten to five

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.500
