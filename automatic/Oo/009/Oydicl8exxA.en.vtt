00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
think these are speakers or fans I'm not

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.810 
think these are speakers or fans I'm not
sure<00:01:21.619> there's<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> fan<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> side<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
sure there's a fan on the side which is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.359 
sure there's a fan on the side which is
not<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.390> stock<00:01:24.659> Saturn<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.290> guess<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
not there on a stock Saturn I guess the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.800 
not there on a stock Saturn I guess the
idea<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> supposed<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> be

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
idea was that this is supposed to be

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.569 
idea was that this is supposed to be
kind<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.470> portable<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.189> came<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.549> a

kind of portable because I came with a
tone<00:01:29.850> screen<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.450> funny<00:01:30.689> cuz<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> disc

a nine volt power supply now that was
kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.159> funny<00:01:56.540> funny<00:01:57.540> thing

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
kind of a really funny funny thing

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.620 
kind of a really funny funny thing
probably<00:01:58.439> doesn't<00:01:59.009> use<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.399> stock<00:01:59.700> power

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
probably doesn't use the stock power

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.330 
probably doesn't use the stock power
supply<00:02:00.990> that's<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> Saturn<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.100> can

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
supply that's in the Saturn so it can

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.270 
supply that's in the Saturn so it can
accept<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.939> regular

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
accept the regular

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.940 
accept the regular
our<00:02:04.340> core<00:02:04.670> input<00:02:05.229> there's<00:02:06.229> not<00:02:06.380> much<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.920> it

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
our core input there's not much to it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.529 
our core input there's not much to it
other<00:02:07.250> than<00:02:07.460> it's<00:02:07.640> made<00:02:07.880> out<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.060> wood<00:02:08.330> and

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
other than it's made out of wood and

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.050 
other than it's made out of wood and
that<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.740> appears<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.580> innards

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
that it appears the innards

that it appears the innards
appeared<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.569> be<00:02:11.810> I<00:02:12.310> don't<00:02:13.310> know<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.400> didn't

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
appeared to be I don't know I didn't

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.100 
appeared to be I don't know I didn't
take<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.940> support<00:02:14.240> but<00:02:14.450> I'm<00:02:14.540> guessing<00:02:14.900> by<00:02:15.080> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
take the support but I'm guessing by the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.710 
take the support but I'm guessing by the
round<00:02:15.980> buttons<00:02:16.400> here<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.240> front<00:02:17.450> that

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
round buttons here on the front that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.470 
round buttons here on the front that
this<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> model<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.010> Saturn<00:02:19.370> probably<00:02:20.209> North

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
this is a model to Saturn probably North

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.670 
this is a model to Saturn probably North
American<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:20.989> turned<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.350> on

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
American I turned it on

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.979 
American I turned it on
everything<00:02:22.250> was<00:02:22.370> displayed<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.790> English<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
everything was displayed in English the

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.229 
everything was displayed in English the
battery<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.680> course<00:02:24.830> but<00:02:25.130> our<00:02:25.970> place

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
battery is that of course but our place

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.850 
battery is that of course but our place
that<00:02:26.420> eventually<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:27.050> guess<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.470> next<00:02:27.650> part

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
that eventually I guess the next part

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.520 
that eventually I guess the next part
just<00:02:28.100> for<00:02:28.160> kind<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.819> size<00:02:29.090> comparison<00:02:29.840> I'm<00:02:30.410> a

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
just for kind of size comparison I'm a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.559 
just for kind of size comparison I'm a
few<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.860> my<00:02:30.890> other<00:02:31.280> Saturn's<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.330> sitting

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
few of my other Saturn's just sitting

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.229 
few of my other Saturn's just sitting
around<00:02:32.630> here<00:02:33.050> just<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.680> give<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.890> an<00:02:33.980> idea<00:02:34.239> of

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
around here just to give you an idea of

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.600 
around here just to give you an idea of
the<00:02:35.450> size<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.440> thing<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:37.220> know<00:02:37.250> it's

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
the size of this thing you know it's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.030 
the size of this thing you know it's
just<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:38.030> touch<00:02:38.840> smaller<00:02:39.290> than<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.830> regular

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
just a touch smaller than a regular

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.120 
just a touch smaller than a regular
model<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.970> Saturn<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.989> my<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:43.040> is

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
model to Saturn so this is my this is

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.520 
model to Saturn so this is my this is
actually<00:02:43.340> my<00:02:43.459> Derby<00:02:43.700> edition<00:02:44.390> second<00:02:45.260> Saturn

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
actually my Derby edition second Saturn

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.610 
actually my Derby edition second Saturn
but<00:02:45.820> it's<00:02:46.820> pretty<00:02:47.390> much<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.930> same<00:02:48.110> size<00:02:48.320> as<00:02:48.560> a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
but it's pretty much the same size as a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.180 
but it's pretty much the same size as a
model<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:48.950> Sega<00:02:49.280> Saturn<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.920> can<00:02:52.010> see

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
model to Sega Saturn so you can see

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.690 
model to Sega Saturn so you can see
there's<00:02:52.370> not<00:02:52.489> much<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:53.739> don't<00:02:54.739> know<00:02:54.980> sidewise

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
there's not much I don't know sidewise

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.790 
there's not much I don't know sidewise
there<00:02:55.910> there<00:02:56.330> press<00:02:56.510> basically<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.530> same

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
there there press basically the same

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.309 
there there press basically the same
it's<00:02:58.069> like<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.580> touch<00:02:59.170> shorter

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
it's like a touch shorter

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.509 
it's like a touch shorter
I<00:03:00.350> think<00:03:00.650> width<00:03:00.860> wise<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:03.830> is<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:04.190> little

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
I think width wise it is a little

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.699 
I think width wise it is a little
shorter<00:03:04.940> than<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.150> regular<00:03:05.360> Sega<00:03:06.110> Saturn<00:03:06.319> you

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
shorter than a regular Sega Saturn you

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.140 
shorter than a regular Sega Saturn you
can<00:03:06.830> see<00:03:07.010> there's<00:03:07.220> kind<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.610> space<00:03:07.880> on<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
can see there's kind of a space on the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.170 
can see there's kind of a space on the
edge<00:03:08.269> here<00:03:08.570> when<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.829> can<00:03:10.310> compare<00:03:11.030> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
edge here when I and you can compare the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.270 
edge here when I and you can compare the
sizes<00:03:11.390> there<00:03:11.750> doesn't<00:03:12.230> have<00:03:12.380> as<00:03:12.650> much<00:03:12.829> depth

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
sizes there doesn't have as much depth

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.670 
sizes there doesn't have as much depth
but<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.790> does<00:03:13.970> have<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.360> little<00:03:14.570> bit<00:03:14.810> more

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
but it does have a little bit more

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.440 
but it does have a little bit more
height<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:16.250> because<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.760> screens<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.299> up

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
height just because the screens right up

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.350 
height just because the screens right up
on<00:03:17.570> there<00:03:17.750> haven't<00:03:18.170> really<00:03:18.519> tested<00:03:19.519> this<00:03:20.060> very

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
on there haven't really tested this very

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.479 
on there haven't really tested this very
much<00:03:20.570> but<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.170> figure<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.680> might<00:03:22.010> as<00:03:22.070> well<00:03:22.160> show

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
much but I figure I might as well show

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.229 
much but I figure I might as well show
you<00:03:22.549> what<00:03:23.390> it's<00:03:23.540> like<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:24.820> turn<00:03:25.820> this<00:03:26.000> sucker

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
you what it's like to turn this sucker

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.780 
you what it's like to turn this sucker
on<00:03:26.329> I<00:03:26.750> don't<00:03:26.959> know<00:03:27.170> anything<00:03:27.590> about<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.250> how

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.970 
on I don't know anything about the how
this<00:03:29.060> was<00:03:29.269> made<00:03:29.299> or<00:03:29.750> anything<00:03:29.959> like<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.230> but

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
this was made or anything like that but

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.830 
this was made or anything like that but
I<00:03:31.310> can<00:03:31.640> definitely<00:03:31.820> tell<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.299> this<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.810> a

nothing<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.720> mess<00:03:44.870> around<00:03:45.019> with<00:03:45.260> no<00:03:45.560> funny<00:03:45.940> LCD

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
nothing to mess around with no funny LCD

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.539 
nothing to mess around with no funny LCD
controllers<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.690> junk<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:49.370> the

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
controllers and junk like that so the

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.009 
controllers and junk like that so the
input<00:03:49.940> is<00:03:49.970> pretty<00:03:50.299> straight<00:03:50.570> forward<00:03:50.600> which

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
input is pretty straight forward which

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.830 
input is pretty straight forward which
is<00:03:51.049> why<00:03:51.350> it's<00:03:51.500> probably<00:03:51.920> used<00:03:52.130> for<00:03:52.750> so<00:03:53.750> many

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
is why it's probably used for so many

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.900 
is why it's probably used for so many
