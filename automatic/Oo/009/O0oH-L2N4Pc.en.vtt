being collected by the dust collection

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.160 
being collected by the dust collection
what<00:01:21.180> happens<00:01:21.690> now

it<00:01:36.750> starts<00:01:37.170> shaking<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.800> filters<00:01:38.570> at

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
it starts shaking as filters at

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.860 
it starts shaking as filters at
lunchtime<00:01:40.230> and<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:41.460> before<00:01:41.820> they<00:01:41.940> come<00:01:42.210> back

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
lunchtime and just before they come back

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.840 
lunchtime and just before they come back

maintenance will come through grab the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.450 
maintenance will come through grab the
filters<00:01:45.330> roll<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.380> grit<00:01:46.620> back<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.160> with<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
filters roll the grit back in with the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.970 
filters roll the grit back in with the
metal<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.000> back<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> mill<00:01:48.750> put<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.830> back

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
metal going back to the mill put it back

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.600 
metal going back to the mill put it back
in<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:50.220> there's<00:01:50.610> no<00:01:50.820> downside<00:01:52.100> it's<00:01:53.100> proper

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
in so there's no downside it's proper

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490 
in so there's no downside it's proper
stages<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.230> a<00:01:55.260> lot<00:01:55.470> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
stages you can see we do a lot of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
stages you can see we do a lot of
stainless<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.180> another<00:01:57.420> process

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
stainless this will get another process

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.370 
stainless this will get another process

even<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.220> welding<00:02:05.229> every<00:02:06.229> welder<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.009> know

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
even in welding every welder you know

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.760 
even in welding every welder you know
what<00:02:08.030> he's<00:02:08.179> doing<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.869> how<00:02:08.959> long<00:02:09.170> it's<00:02:09.380> taking

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
what he's doing and how long it's taking

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.790

them to weld each section has welding

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.729 
them to weld each section has welding
tables<00:02:13.220> these<00:02:13.310> tables<00:02:13.760> are<00:02:13.850> solid<00:02:14.530> castings

now<00:02:16.370> what<00:02:16.610> we<00:02:16.760> do<00:02:17.030> because<00:02:17.330> we<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.750> big<00:02:17.959> lean

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
now what we do because we have big lean

the<00:02:25.310> crane<00:02:25.610> dropped<00:02:26.569> onto<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.989> CNC<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.920> we

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
the crane dropped onto the CNC and we

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.640 
the crane dropped onto the CNC and we
will<00:02:28.970> actually<00:02:29.150> machine<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.870> perfectly<00:02:30.290> flat

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
will actually machine it perfectly flat

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.340 
will actually machine it perfectly flat
I<00:02:31.040> don't<00:02:31.640> want<00:02:31.819> my<00:02:31.970> welders<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.569> have<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.080> be<00:02:33.260> in

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
I don't want my welders to have to be in

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.370 
I don't want my welders to have to be in
here<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.920> use<00:02:34.160> spaces<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:35.510> square<00:02:35.840> things<00:02:36.080> up

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
here and use spaces to square things up

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.710 
here and use spaces to square things up
so<00:02:37.280> he<00:02:37.489> doesn't<00:02:37.790> have<00:02:37.940> any<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.480> because

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
so he doesn't have any of that because

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.460 
so he doesn't have any of that because
if<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:38.959> look<00:02:39.019> here<00:02:40.750> you'll<00:02:41.750> see<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.110> machine

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
if you look here you'll see the machine

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.470 
if you look here you'll see the machine
marks<00:02:42.880> this<00:02:43.880> one<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.480> think<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.170> was<00:02:45.350> November

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
marks this one I think it was November

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.170 
marks this one I think it was November
went<00:02:47.480> through<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.780> CNC<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.430> it's<00:02:49.610> perfectly

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
went through the CNC so it's perfectly

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.290 
went through the CNC so it's perfectly
flat<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:51.500> one<00:02:51.769> is<00:02:51.890> scheduled<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.670> go<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.970> next

flat this one is scheduled to go in next

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.190 
flat this one is scheduled to go in next
month<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:54.350> you'll<00:02:55.280> see<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.569> wear<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.780> tear

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
month and you'll see the wear and tear

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.380 
month and you'll see the wear and tear
from<00:02:57.620> grinding<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.400> dropping<00:02:58.610> steel<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.269> it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
from grinding and dropping steel on it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.039 
from grinding and dropping steel on it
all<00:02:59.480> this<00:02:59.769> but<00:03:00.769> it's<00:03:00.920> scheduled<00:03:01.370> accordingly

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
all this but it's scheduled accordingly
