00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.970
 [Music] 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.760
 a few weeks ago I went out with the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.860
 my friend years and if we went to the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.990
 mall to play you if 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.700
 you do n't know what a rhythm game is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.410
 where you have to step on arrows 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.360
 platform in correspondence with those 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.370
 on the screen determined by song 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.630
 choice and difficulty the center 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.640
 commercial we went to is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.770
 probably the most Asian of all 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 the city and if you live in toronto you know 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:37.289
 for sure which one I'm talking about 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.999
 just like that I can still like 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.589
 we enter the games room what I am 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:42.600
 look to find is an asian 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.670
 cazzutissimo dancing a song 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.659
 cazzutissima because it always happens 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.879
 when i go to play 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.920
 in short, me and damage and if we get to the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.329
 game room and although the game was in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.460
 back to the room 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.979
 I could already peer into the distance 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.659
 a big crowd and I just think oh 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.829
 shit 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.569
 who will certainly be an Asian 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.370
 cazzutissimo a song go 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.060
 cazzutissima with others who shit themselves 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.409
 on our astonishment we approached and 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.210
 look admire an Asian 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.329
 cazzutissimo I dance the song 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.079
 cazzutissima but don't tell me then 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:19.500
 I expect these people are not a 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:23.939
 audience are all here to play wow 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.340
 wow damn bitch and I knew it because if 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.259
 you don't know the etiquette of dear 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.880
 because yes there is an etiquette of the areas 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.719
 I know because in a great nerd al 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.399
 high school 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.619
 there is a small ledge below it 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.719
 screen and if you want to line up for 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.630
 play then you have to put yours 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:43.170
 coin token card or whatever it is e 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.000
 put it on the ledge here I gave 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.090
 a look at that ledge and it was 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.920
 full of papers ie it looked like the wall 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.770
 of the bedroom of a student of the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.390
 medium and who the cards covered 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.500
 practically the screen because this 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.649
 Troy's son probably had it 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.659
 there were about 15 memorized steps 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.969
 people surrounding the game 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.429
 many of them were sweating or breaking 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.289
 they died of heat or even saw a 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.179
 boy go up to the counter and steal 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.230
 a chair so you can sit and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.599
 resting a minute is people 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.299
 a club that is like a crew of of dear 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.129
 because more and more time passed and more 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.780
 came people who greeted each other like 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.870
 it was a family reunion of the type 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420
 hey what in short are a bit 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.549
 intimidated, but who cares ? 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.120
 well to dear so these people don't 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.430
 it scares me though they were all men 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.349
 and in the moment in which I and I annie them 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.879
 we all entered their field of vision 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.590
 they began to stare at her even if she was one 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.079
 goddess descended to earth to put an end to 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.030
 that sausage festival then these 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.670
 two guys start playing and when 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.030
 I say they were bad guys I mean granitics 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.799
 to nuclear fusion choir up were 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.540
 making one of the most complicated songs 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.609
 to the maximum difficulty by taking a 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.359
 perfect ea lot were completing 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:01.120
 as of the rigid you mean as of the hard ones to 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.650
 at one point one of the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.599
 two also took off his shirt in 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.459
 middle of the song and then turn to 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.250
 agnes as if expecting some 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.410
 reaction from her is even though it was turned and 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.290
 so he didn't watch the screen continue 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.639
 to take anyway perfect so I will 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.430
 approaches and agnese whispers them 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.169
 in the ear you win you surprise which 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.090
 made her blush smile when the 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.579
 guy turned his face to light up 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.680
 happiness of the type you have 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.540
 got the impression easily one 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.190
 girl with video games and jumped from 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.940
 platform on people to be then 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.470
 transported in triumph to heaven 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.720
 but we never played 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.060
 we waited for it but too much dinner 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.000
 no one looked like a siege 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.709
 allowed others to advance if 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.540
 you are watching this video and you were 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.280
 among those guys I would like to tell you that you are 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.810
 some ass faces because I never have 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.500
 could prove my skill and 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.500
 impress agnes by playing dear's 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.500
 already
