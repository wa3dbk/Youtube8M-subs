00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
together based as I said before it's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.190 
together based as I said before it's
pretty<00:03:40.370> easy<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:41.270> again<00:03:41.480> we've<00:03:41.810> got<00:03:41.960> that<00:03:42.080> on

pretty easy and again we've got that on
there<00:03:43.360> which<00:03:44.360> is<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:45.380> bit<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.560> attaches<00:03:45.920> to

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
there which is the bit that attaches to

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.890 
there which is the bit that attaches to
the<00:03:46.250> plate<00:03:46.460> and<00:03:46.640> then<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.090> flash<00:03:47.420> gun<00:03:47.600> goes<00:03:47.780> on

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
the plate and then the flash gun goes on

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.720 
the plate and then the flash gun goes on
there<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.500> back<00:03:48.710> so<00:03:49.250> I'm<00:03:49.580> just

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
there and on to the back so I'm just

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.880 
there and on to the back so I'm just
going<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:49.910> put<00:03:50.090> this<00:03:50.120> together<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.770> see<00:03:51.770> how

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
going to put this together and see how

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.080 
going to put this together and see how
it<00:03:52.010> goes<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.310> we'll<00:03:52.430> compare<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:52.940> with<00:03:52.970> the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
it goes and we'll compare it with the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.650 
it goes and we'll compare it with the
other<00:03:53.270> one<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:54.370> but<00:03:55.370> at<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.760> moment<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:56.300> seems

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
other one and but at the moment it seems

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.180 
other one and but at the moment it seems
exactly<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.110> same<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:57.530> let's<00:03:57.800> get<00:03:57.890> this<00:03:58.010> put

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
exactly the same so let's get this put

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.540 
exactly the same so let's get this put
together<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.670> I'll<00:03:59.030> see<00:03:59.180> you<00:03:59.270> in<00:03:59.360> a<00:03:59.420> second

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
together and I'll see you in a second

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.090 
together and I'll see you in a second
okay<00:04:01.550> so<00:04:02.330> there<00:04:02.510> we<00:04:02.540> are<00:04:05.620> all<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.650> need<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:06.920> do

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
okay so there we are all I need to do

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.960 
okay so there we are all I need to do
now<00:04:07.280> is<00:04:07.310> put<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:09.280> flash<00:04:10.280> gun<00:04:10.490> and<00:04:10.820> the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
now is put the flash gun and the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.850 
now is put the flash gun and the
pocketwizard<00:04:11.270> on<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.660> back<00:04:11.810> like<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:15.650> just

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
pocketwizard on the back like so it just

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.800 
pocketwizard on the back like so it just
slots<00:04:16.100> in<00:04:16.340> there<00:04:19.000> poke<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.180> down<00:04:20.390> fire<00:04:20.690> it

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
slots in there poke that down fire it

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.170 
slots in there poke that down fire it
through<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:22.340> can<00:04:22.460> obviously<00:04:22.550> adjust<00:04:22.820> this

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
through you can obviously adjust this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.520 
through you can obviously adjust this
but<00:04:23.390> I<00:04:23.450> think<00:04:23.630> I've<00:04:23.690> got<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:23.960> almost<00:04:24.260> right

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
but I think I've got that almost right

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.150 
but I think I've got that almost right
just<00:04:24.919> bring<00:04:25.070> this<00:04:25.160> down<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.460> little<00:04:25.580> bit<00:04:27.160> out

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
just bring this down a little bit out

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:38.740 
just bring this down a little bit out
there<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:33.760> we<00:04:34.760> are<00:04:35.590> good<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:37.190> go<00:04:37.540> just<00:04:38.540> tighten

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
there and we are good to go just tighten

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.480 
there and we are good to go just tighten
up<00:04:38.930> all<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.140> retaining<00:04:39.440> screws<00:04:39.590> just<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.370> keep

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
up all the retaining screws just to keep

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.730 
up all the retaining screws just to keep
it<00:04:40.610> all<00:04:40.730> in<00:04:40.850> place<00:04:41.320> make<00:04:42.320> sure<00:04:42.380> everything's

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
it all in place make sure everything's

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.360 
it all in place make sure everything's
tight<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.810> proper<00:04:44.810> position<00:04:45.230> and<00:04:45.380> there

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
tight and in proper position and there

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.010 
tight and in proper position and there
you<00:04:46.430> go<00:04:46.610> we<00:04:46.820> now<00:04:47.000> got<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.270> second<00:04:47.570> one<00:04:47.600> set<00:04:47.870> up

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
you go we now got the second one set up

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.640 
you go we now got the second one set up
and<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:48.770> was<00:04:48.830> just<00:04:49.070> as<00:04:49.190> easy<00:04:49.370> as<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:49.910> 24<00:04:50.570> inch

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
and it was just as easy as the 24 inch

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.070 
and it was just as easy as the 24 inch
but<00:04:51.650> let's<00:04:52.040> put<00:04:52.220> them<00:04:52.280> side<00:04:52.490> by<00:04:52.520> side<00:04:53.020> so<00:04:54.020> you

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
but let's put them side by side so you

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.830 
but let's put them side by side so you
can<00:04:54.230> see<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.470> difference<00:04:54.770> in<00:04:54.890> size<00:04:58.690> so<00:04:59.690> there

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
can see the difference in size so there

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.219 
can see the difference in size so there
we<00:04:59.900> go<00:05:00.729> that's<00:05:01.729> the<00:05:01.790> 24<00:05:02.210> inch<00:05:02.240> that's<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.020> 30

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
we go that's the 24 inch that's the 30

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.070 
we go that's the 24 inch that's the 30
inch<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:04.340> now<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.820> think<00:05:05.660> we've<00:05:05.780> got<00:05:05.870> full

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
inch so now I think we've got full

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.710 
inch so now I think we've got full
flexibility<00:05:06.729> we've<00:05:07.729> got<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:07.880> very<00:05:08.419> good

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
flexibility we've got a very good

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.409 
flexibility we've got a very good
portable<00:05:09.590> studio<00:05:09.860> set<00:05:10.280> up<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.700> you<00:05:11.690> can<00:05:11.810> see

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.670 
portable studio set up and you can see
once<00:05:14.419> they're<00:05:14.630> set<00:05:14.780> up<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:15.229> good<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.470> go

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
once they're set up and good to go

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.200 
once they're set up and good to go
