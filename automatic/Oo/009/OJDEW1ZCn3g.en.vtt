00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.709
 and so here when 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.179
 one more update video thinks 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.720
 for you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:25.140
 since the GPS of the thousand 'tá' indyu olga o 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.380
 His model is oc 230 tá is a device 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 3.5 inches and baby 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.020
 we were 8 with four maps of the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.480
 brazil updated 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.129
 okay I'll be here doing the simulation that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.850
 two simulations back to go 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.020
 defeats for you, you see how 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 The program operates on this unit in the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.560
 in case I have already left the pre- 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.329
 registered and now by house simulation 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.360
 what on the avenue paulista in são paulo 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.780
 as you can see the whole 3D look has 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.180
 some buildings here left to right 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.750
 also do not have the points of interest the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.640
 I do not even have the buildings here. 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:26.280
 May I be Bradesco Bank of Brazil 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:28.710
 who also quickly the ypiranga nifty 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 great here and go around talking points 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.070
 radar the light just right're it 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280
 go analyzing everything for you to see 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.650
 now I'll do a defeat simulation 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.650
 This time in rio de janeiro 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.990
 for you to see that basically the same 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.580
 thing 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.140
 subsequently return the function 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:56.220
 of maps for you it's function to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.570
 four maps in the program that is the most 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.850
 important of all that left the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.310
 more effective match here on the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.759
 the left side has the buildings where it has 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 the highest rank is the points of interest 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.239
 the prizes that are appearing in the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.239
 high buildings 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.500
 the destination on the right 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.519
 Good people, I'll tell everyone. 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.569
 I want to pass on to you today. 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:45.470
 people update the gps and they put the 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.750
 a partner on the map that will not only okay 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.549
 never solve your problem 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.190
 then people then bind me spoke 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.349
 so here's the problem here that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.510
 are located in the streets etc. 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.780
 I was going to show you why it's 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.269
 because there is no system here is the one that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.170
 There are four maps. 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.269
 you 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.909
 You go there in good and do the simulation 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.209
 for you guys because the cool thing is this 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:16.129
 we do and prove and show that 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:22.359
 It works really campinas in são paulo 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:25.579
 which has one that has a good example 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:28.370
 next to one another is the 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:34.870
 show you guys in campinas 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:37.849
 a street street street judo street exists 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:43.910
 here is the navteq map rotated time 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:47.319
 now there is a neighborhood 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.319
 there are several streets here 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.579
 You'll see better seeing this thump. 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:56.419
 there is the aek has a right avenue to 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.910
 you your name 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:03.919
 she denounced her name and here is a neighborhood 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.290
 which has a right train track then 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:10.609
 here is a neighborhood has a train rail 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.599
 she denounced the man and the neighborhood that 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:18.549
 wheel helped 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:18.549
 here everybody is there 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.760
 here there is a neighborhood too but he 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.280
 is not mapped on this map there is a 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.199
 neighborhood here he was not near this map 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.260
 is switching the map to 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:46.390
 show you guys right? 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:49.000
 hence the tone of navteq 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.040
 click on yes it automatically goes 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.110
 make the exchange 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.030
 this menu here guys is the law because 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.340
 because the program does not fit in memory 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.720
 device can still rotate 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.730
 correctly 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.830
 I installed this menu here in the 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.930
 internal memory and the program on the 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.380
 memory to make it easier to 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.380
 navigation 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.950
 even because you will have to play 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.660
 the better his work because he goes 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.070
 use the memory card Neitiznot 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.580
 appliance 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.140
 I'm here to put the night here on 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.960
 day 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:30.330
 Now we go there we go game 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.330
 People were going to talk about the odor it is one in Campinas 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.789
 campinas sao paulo was the 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.139
 road blocked by pneumonia 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:49.119
 which according to her has the street gift of judo 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.860
 're seeing this map you no longer have 

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:52.959
 brain guys 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.490
 that head girl tote bag 

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:56.580
 that this bread to stay to make a 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:04.569
 reference to you to understand that the 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:08.559
 aladino denounce certain center of the street 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:14.409
 so come on, remember to process the 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:15.789
 train rail here that mud and here 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.749
 I said that neighborhood I did not have 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:20.979
 map 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:23.169
 the anac already has another to enter here 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:27.999
 she denounced and now we go there where 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:30.039
 It was the right that space that judo 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:33.069
 it's here he was not a joke in this 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:34.689
 map you still see the people then it is 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:35.740
 what we are trying to show 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.929
 you 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.599
 the guys put the last update there 

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:42.669
 he said so my device ah is 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.099
 best of all is the last of the last 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:48.580
 update there will dictate qena 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:50.379
 you can not find it right if you can 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.800
 do a test on yours for you to see 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:56.259
 also that not even a little is 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.430
 updating studying in other maps but 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.129
 you may be auditioning for 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.099
 to find out ne and between several other streets 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.689
 that exist and you will see what I am 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.879
 speaking is true 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:09.550
 The right thing to do is show the 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:12.309
 that is being done right in the service us and 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.039
 It does not work for us and besides all that 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:17.499
 everybody who has a four maps have león 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:22.180
 more more map options here nor 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:26.079
 the going to have will have options that is type one 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:28.749
 map of tomtom to the street as here is street to 

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:32.669
 street joseph car so he understood then 

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:37.029
 I also tried it also has the option of 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:41.110
 changing the carts is also here 

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:43.509
 if you want, it's more interesting to the maps 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.729
 for today it's just the guys until the next 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:46.899
 Thank you again for having seen 

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:50.459
 our videos 

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:50.459
 Thank you to go to the next
