00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.960
 we go out to all so it's the smartwatch 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.060
 from whom is announced yesterday and some 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.800
 days and we have the chance to test the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.050
 today conferring on it at the conference 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.250
 sony 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.349
 good it's going to be a very quick test because 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.699
 it's really a model prototype 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.649
 of test pattern it's not bad of 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.050
 things when when we do this is displayed 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.719
 So what test what is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.730
 different compared to the smart switch 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.910
 first name we find the design 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.680
 neat with the power buttons that 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.170
 existing on the z on the table and at all 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.980
 on the ultra z has the big advantage it's 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.870
 we left there was a catch 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.940
 owner with a usb cable on the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.640
 first smartwatch the cdu micro usb 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.000
 classic with a hatch 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.980
 b 57 or 58 or you know more which one 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.410
 of both so she is waterproof to a 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.079
 underwater meter and my thirty minutes 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.780
 we find ourselves the three buttons 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.850
 classic android ink button home 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.869
 a no back button back is to 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.490
 your best option after that is the screen is 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.439
 a little better that of sportwatch 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.319
 first it's still it's still 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.939
 it's not a lightning of war in terms 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.950
 quality and with the possibility 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.549
 to add apps like the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.859
 first smart one the smartphone 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.110
 last detail on the first smart 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.400
 watch 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.050
 poland was the brave you are 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.910
 original plastic plus a small 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.290
 metal ring which allowed for 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.150
 hang on any bracelet 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.980
 shows there actually is directly 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.540
 integrated I do not know if you see well 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.680
 on the video but it's the bracelet 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.500
 classic so if you want to put a 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.920
 leather crocodile leather strap 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.320
 snake additionally it's possible is the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.450
 last thing presence of the nfc for the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.680
 connect enough to put your xp 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.930
 rased or any smartphone 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.390
 android on it and will be connected to your 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.390
 smart have passed the allies could 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.899
 to go as fine as there that the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.899
 first smartwatch that sony had released 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.620
 for a woman it's a bit broad like 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.090
 me it remains my parent little less broad 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.750
 that most smartphones 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.240
 existing 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.490
 and after that it's more about being the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.960
 bracelet that will date and sion according to your 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.690
 wrists that's still a good it's a little 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.140
 sports event that is virtually 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.640
 what about more especially refectory yes 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.230
 roughly at the screen level 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.720
 maybe the quality of the low shots 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.970
 it's a little disappointing when you go 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.460
 when we see the son peri z z 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.690
 ultra beside but it remains largely 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.880
 sufficient for small applications 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:59.030
 to play sports to check his 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.530
 tweets these texts his emails to and lo and behold 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.690
 after the advantage is that if you 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.650
 know the smart car first 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.880
 generation there is still a lot 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.040
 of application and a lot of 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.830
 developers working on it for 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.220
 bring a lot of two novelties to the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.220
 smart phone
