this is going to be how to play the

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.990 
this is going to be how to play the
engineer<00:00:06.839> part<00:00:07.170> 1<00:00:07.560> now<00:00:08.220> you'll<00:00:08.519> see<00:00:08.700> me<00:00:08.820> right

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
engineer part 1 now you'll see me right

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.410 
engineer part 1 now you'll see me right
here<00:00:09.179> spot<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.900> UAV<00:00:11.030> I've<00:00:12.030> said<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.360> many

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
here spot a UAV I've said this many

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.600 
here spot a UAV I've said this many
times<00:00:12.690> before<00:00:12.929> spotting<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.070> really<00:00:14.460> really

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
times before spotting is really really

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.029 
times before spotting is really really
important<00:00:15.059> aspect<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.870> especially<00:00:16.590> true<00:00:16.830> as

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
important aspect is especially true as

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.640 
important aspect is especially true as
an<00:00:17.250> engineer<00:00:17.640> because<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.750> some

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
an engineer because you have some

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.109 
an engineer because you have some
machine<00:00:19.920> gun<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.220> most<00:00:20.430> submachine<00:00:20.910> guns

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
machine gun and most submachine guns

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.599 
machine gun and most submachine guns
only<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:21.539> 20<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.199> 25<00:00:22.470> bullets<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.189> think

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
only have about 20 to 25 bullets I think

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.150 
only have about 20 to 25 bullets I think
one<00:00:23.820> or<00:00:23.939> two<00:00:24.060> has<00:00:24.269> 30<00:00:24.689> bolt<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.859> point<00:00:26.039> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
one or two has 30 bolt but the point is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.290 
one or two has 30 bolt but the point is
you<00:00:26.310> don't<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.699> many<00:00:26.849> bullets<00:00:27.240> you

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
you don't have that many bullets you

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.839 
you don't have that many bullets you
can't<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.660> take<00:00:27.930> down<00:00:27.960> infantry<00:00:28.830> from<00:00:29.580> far

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
can't really take down infantry from far

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.910 
can't really take down infantry from far
away<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.090> what<00:00:30.359> your<00:00:30.720> best<00:00:30.900> bet<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.470> spot

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
away so what your best bet is to spot

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.819 
away so what your best bet is to spot
things<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:33.540> think<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.320> video<00:00:34.590> you'll

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
things and I think in this video you'll

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.380 
things and I think in this video you'll
see<00:00:34.920> me<00:00:35.130> spot<00:00:35.399> pretty<00:00:35.670> much<00:00:35.790> everything<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
see me spot pretty much everything and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.180 
see me spot pretty much everything and
right<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> guy<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.469> spot<00:00:37.800> him<00:00:37.920> before

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
right here I see a guy I spot him before

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.680 
right here I see a guy I spot him before
I<00:00:38.219> take<00:00:38.430> him<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.670> while<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> spot<00:00:39.390> him<00:00:39.480> while

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I take him out while I spot him while

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.290 
I take him out while I spot him while
I've<00:00:39.840> been<00:00:39.870> taking<00:00:40.230> him<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.180> spotting<00:00:42.180> was

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
I've been taking him out so spotting was

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.430 
I've been taking him out so spotting was
actually<00:00:42.570> kind<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> useless<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
actually kind of useless here because I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.380 
actually kind of useless here because I
did<00:00:43.620> take<00:00:43.800> him<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.969> didn't<00:00:45.300> take

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
did take him out but if I didn't take

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.740 
did take him out but if I didn't take
him<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:46.500> would<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.890> been<00:00:47.510> well<00:00:48.510> well

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
him out it would have been well well

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.720 
him out it would have been well well
teammate<00:00:49.110> would<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.350> taken<00:00:49.559> him<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:49.950> but

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
teammate would have taken him out but

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.970 
teammate would have taken him out but
you'll<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.780> me<00:00:51.809> super<00:00:52.199> fast<00:00:52.379> mode<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> bit<00:00:52.739> here

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you'll see me super fast mode a bit here

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
you'll see me super fast mode a bit here
but<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.550> an<00:00:53.670> engineer<00:00:53.969> should<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.360> doing<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
but what an engineer should be doing is

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
but what an engineer should be doing is
for<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:55.710> thing<00:00:55.890> spotting<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:57.090> should<00:00:57.300> be

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
for one thing spotting you should be

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.049 
for one thing spotting you should be
repairing<00:00:58.020> vehicles<00:00:58.980> should<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.760> tank

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
repairing vehicles should be tank

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.209 
repairing vehicles should be tank
whoring<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.600> taking<00:01:01.379> down<00:01:01.500> enemy<00:01:01.859> tanks<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
whoring and taking down enemy tanks and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.399 
whoring and taking down enemy tanks and
now<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.460> into<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.239> later<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.780> but

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
now go into a bit more later on but

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.109 
now go into a bit more later on but
right<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.769> you'll<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.010> alpha<00:01:05.790> getting<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
right here you'll see alpha getting the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
right here you'll see alpha getting the
street<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> first<00:01:06.900> base<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.640> think

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
street and on the first base I think

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640 
street and on the first base I think
this<00:01:08.700> map<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:08.909> called<00:01:09.180> Adam<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.689> automatic<00:01:10.500> at

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
this map is called Adam at automatic at

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.390 
this map is called Adam at automatic at
Harbor<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.869> two<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.710> first<00:01:13.830> base<00:01:14.220> as

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
Harbor you have two in the first base as

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.590 
Harbor you have two in the first base as
you're<00:01:14.729> defending<00:01:15.150> there's<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.140> B<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:17.330> if<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you're defending there's a and B if if a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.810 
you're defending there's a and B if if a
destroyed<00:01:19.170> don't<00:01:19.650> worry<00:01:19.860> about<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
destroyed don't worry about it because a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.330 
destroyed don't worry about it because a
is<00:01:21.420> probably<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> easiest<00:01:22.409> bomb<00:01:22.740> site<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.159> get

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is probably the easiest bomb site to get

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.950 
is probably the easiest bomb site to get
because<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.330> map<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.540> really<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
because this this map is really a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.920 
because this this map is really a
vehicle<00:01:25.950> dependent<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.509> first<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
vehicle dependent and the first a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510 
vehicle dependent and the first a
building<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.070> open<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
building is really out in the open and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.340 
building is really out in the open and
you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.210> take<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> walls

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you can really just take down the walls

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.810 
you can really just take down the walls
is<00:01:31.560> attacked<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> tank<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> it's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
is attacked with the tank and it's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.969 
is attacked with the tank and it's
really<00:01:33.119> easy<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.509> take<00:01:33.720> down<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.619> goes

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
really easy to take down so if a goes

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.340 
really easy to take down so if a goes
down<00:01:35.220> don't<00:01:35.579> worry<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.810> always

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
down don't worry it's just it's always

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.719 
down don't worry it's just it's always
going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> happen<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:39.619> it's<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.100> rare<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
going to happen but it's kind of rare to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.420 
going to happen but it's kind of rare to
really<00:01:42.090> stop<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.450> attackers<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:44.009> base

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
really stop the attackers on this base

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
really stop the attackers on this base
on<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> first<00:01:45.270> base<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.840> map<00:01:46.079> because

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
on the first base of this map because

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.050 
on the first base of this map because
you<00:01:48.450> know<00:01:48.570> people<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.560> tend<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.100> use<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you know people just tend to use the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.960 
you know people just tend to use the
tanks<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.600> much<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:53.189> kind<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.430> abuse<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
tanks so much and they kind of abuse the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.330 
tanks so much and they kind of abuse the
tanks<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.259> rape<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.619> first<00:01:56.070> base

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
tanks and just just rape the first base

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.810 
tanks and just just rape the first base
and<00:01:56.610> as<00:01:57.450> defenders<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.200> pretty<00:01:58.380> much<00:01:58.500> almost

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
and as defenders it's pretty much almost

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.010 
and as defenders it's pretty much almost
impossible<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.479> video<00:02:00.750> you'll<00:02:00.960> see

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
impossible but in this video you'll see

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.850 
impossible but in this video you'll see
us<00:02:01.549> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:03.049> pretty<00:02:04.049> much<00:02:04.259> repel<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
us kind of pretty much repel the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.649 
us kind of pretty much repel the
attackers<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.430> they<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.729> never<00:02:06.060> get<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
attackers and they kind of never get the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.600 
attackers and they kind of never get the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
couple of times we and we always end up

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.490 
couple of times we and we always end up
diffusing<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:11.970> anyways<00:02:12.270> how<00:02:12.480> do<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.319> play

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
diffusing it but anyways how do we play

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.120

you're able to take down those vehicles

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.030 
you're able to take down those vehicles
that<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.420> enemy<00:02:33.600> kind<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.990> just<00:02:34.140> keeps

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
bringing along you basically cut their

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.500 
bringing along you basically cut their
supply<00:02:37.980> short<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.430> they<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.730> they<00:02:39.300> can't

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
supply short and they just they can't

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.290

really<00:02:39.720> get<00:02:40.200> into<00:02:40.530> our<00:02:40.620> base<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:41.700> such<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> big

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
really get into our base it's such a big

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.640 
really get into our base it's such a big
battle<00:02:42.600> field<00:02:43.430> who<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.460> mentioned<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.210> name<00:02:45.650> it's

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
battle field who I mentioned a name it's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.310 
battle field who I mentioned a name it's
such<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.830> big<00:02:47.100> map<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:48.000> wide<00:02:48.630> open<00:02:48.900> map<00:02:49.080> that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
such a big map that wide open map that

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.050 
such a big map that wide open map that
you<00:02:49.500> know<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.860> can<00:02:50.070> pretty<00:02:50.430> much<00:02:50.520> get<00:02:50.760> shot

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
you know you can pretty much get shot

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.150 
you know you can pretty much get shot
from<00:02:51.240> anywhere<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.590> vehicles<00:02:53.040> are

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
from anywhere and the vehicles are

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.760 
from anywhere and the vehicles are
pretty<00:02:53.490> much<00:02:53.580> your<00:02:53.790> best<00:02:54.090> bet<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.590> moving<00:02:55.590> up

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
pretty much your best bet of moving up

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.920 
pretty much your best bet of moving up
but<00:02:56.400> if<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.850> have<00:02:57.000> an<00:02:57.120> engineer<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.570> your<00:02:57.750> team

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
but if you have an engineer on your team

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.480 
but if you have an engineer on your team
and<00:02:58.200> i<00:02:58.320> really<00:02:58.590> suggest<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.070> have<00:02:59.160> at<00:02:59.280> least

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
and i really suggest you have at least

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.450 
and i really suggest you have at least
two<00:02:59.910> on<00:03:00.240> your<00:03:00.750> squad<00:03:00.990> in<00:03:01.320> this<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.190> map

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
two on your squad in this in on this map

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.460 
two on your squad in this in on this map
you<00:03:02.940> can<00:03:03.060> take<00:03:03.240> down<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> vehicles<00:03:04.350> that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
you can take down all the vehicles that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.620 
you can take down all the vehicles that
they<00:03:04.590> bring<00:03:04.800> up<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.730> really<00:03:05.940> easily<00:03:06.240> and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
they bring up really really easily and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.900 
they bring up really really easily and
they'll<00:03:07.410> never<00:03:07.560> have<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.860> chat<00:03:08.130> will<00:03:08.550> they<00:03:08.670> will

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
they'll never have a chat will they will

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.120 
they'll never have a chat will they will
have<00:03:09.120> chance<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.660> go<00:03:09.990> up<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:10.380> it's<00:03:10.830> kind<00:03:11.070> of

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
have chance to go up but it's kind of

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.540 
have chance to go up but it's kind of
rare<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:12.050> squad<00:03:13.050> move<00:03:13.290> up<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.680> bomb<00:03:14.280> site

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
rare to see a squad move up to bomb site

going<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.170> plant<00:03:28.440> some<00:03:28.620> c4<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> hopped<00:03:29.460> out<00:03:29.900> I

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
going to plant some c4 so I hopped out I

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.350 
going to plant some c4 so I hopped out I
kind<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.650> anticipate<00:03:32.190> where<00:03:32.340> he<00:03:32.400> goes<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.880> you

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
kind of anticipate where he goes and you

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.450 
kind of anticipate where he goes and you
see<00:03:33.540> his<00:03:33.960> little<00:03:34.170> shadow<00:03:34.920> thing<00:03:35.250> right<00:03:35.430> here

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
see his little shadow thing right here

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.790 
see his little shadow thing right here
and<00:03:35.760> his<00:03:36.540> teammates<00:03:36.930> start<00:03:37.080> spawning<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:37.680> him

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
and his teammates start spawning on him

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.830 
and his teammates start spawning on him
so<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:37.950> start<00:03:38.250> spraying<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.880> right<00:03:39.630> here

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
so I start spraying and right here

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.470 
so I start spraying and right here
you'll<00:03:40.020> see<00:03:40.080> as<00:03:40.380> his<00:03:40.740> teammate<00:03:41.130> sees<00:03:41.370> me<00:03:41.550> I<00:03:41.730> can

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
you'll see as his teammate sees me I can

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.090 
you'll see as his teammate sees me I can
I'm<00:03:42.750> hoping<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:43.110> he's<00:03:43.350> an<00:03:43.470> engineer<00:03:43.800> he<00:03:43.920> is

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
I'm hoping that he's an engineer he is

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.340 
I'm hoping that he's an engineer he is
so<00:03:44.670> when<00:03:45.120> he<00:03:45.209> was<00:03:45.330> shooting<00:03:45.480> at<00:03:45.720> me<00:03:45.870> he<00:03:46.050> had<00:03:46.200> to

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
so when he was shooting at me he had to

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.930 
so when he was shooting at me he had to
reload<00:03:46.680> at<00:03:46.830> some<00:03:47.040> point<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.610> just<00:03:47.790> take

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
reload at some point so I just take

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.670 
reload at some point so I just take
cover<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.390> pop<00:03:48.690> out<00:03:48.900> whenever<00:03:49.140> he<00:03:49.350> stopped

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
cover and pop out whenever he stopped

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.550 
cover and pop out whenever he stopped
reloading<00:03:50.220> that's<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.790> good<00:03:50.940> tip<00:03:51.380> just<00:03:52.380> take

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
reloading that's a good tip just take

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.190 
reloading that's a good tip just take
cover<00:03:52.770> until<00:03:53.340> he<00:03:53.940> runs<00:03:54.480> out<00:03:54.630> of<00:03:54.660> ammo<00:03:54.870> and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
cover until he runs out of ammo and

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.870 
cover until he runs out of ammo and
right<00:03:55.350> here<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.530> was<00:03:55.650> going<00:03:55.890> AFK<00:03:56.310> answering<00:03:56.820> a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
right here I was going AFK answering a

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.750 
right here I was going AFK answering a
text<00:03:56.910> message<00:03:57.390> or<00:03:57.510> something<00:03:57.660> something<00:03:58.020> but

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
in the next a little bit you'll see me

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.220 
in the next a little bit you'll see me
tank<00:04:01.709> or<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.220> lot<00:04:02.640> just<00:04:03.120> straight<00:04:03.780> up<00:04:03.810> tanker

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
tank or a lot just straight up tanker

tank or a lot just straight up tanker
I'm<00:04:04.410> staying<00:04:04.709> in<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.890> tank<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.280> shoot

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
I'm staying in the tank I shoot

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
I'm staying in the tank I shoot
everything<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.570> see<00:04:07.940> that's<00:04:08.940> pretty<00:04:09.209> much<00:04:09.390> a

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
everything I see that's pretty much a

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.170 
everything I see that's pretty much a
noise<00:04:09.930> sense<00:04:10.230> or<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.430> threat<00:04:11.790> basically

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
noise sense or just a threat basically

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.880 
noise sense or just a threat basically
like<00:04:12.330> that<00:04:12.480> tank<00:04:12.690> right<00:04:12.930> there<00:04:12.959> I'm<00:04:13.590> not<00:04:13.709> sure

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
like that tank right there I'm not sure

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.680 
like that tank right there I'm not sure
if<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.040> killed<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.430> or<00:04:14.520> not<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.910> previous<00:04:15.330> unit

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
if I killed it or not the previous unit

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.539 
if I killed it or not the previous unit
preview<00:04:16.410> screen<00:04:16.770> is<00:04:16.920> just<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.190> little<00:04:17.400> too

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
preview screen is just a little too

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.500 
preview screen is just a little too
small<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.830> as<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:20.070> can<00:04:20.190> see<00:04:20.400> I'm<00:04:21.090> tank

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
small but as you can see I'm tank

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.630 
small but as you can see I'm tank
whoring<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.900> lot<00:04:22.109> but<00:04:22.410> at<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.740> same<00:04:22.919> time<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.370> am

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
whoring a lot but at the same time I am

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.410 
whoring a lot but at the same time I am
spotting<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:25.229> moment<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.590> see<00:04:25.800> something

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
spotting the moment I see something

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.140 
spotting the moment I see something
I<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.890> not<00:04:27.890> only<00:04:28.070> do<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.310> move<00:04:28.550> my<00:04:28.730> cursor<00:04:28.790> is

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
I just not only do I move my cursor is

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.690 
I just not only do I move my cursor is
over<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.600> also<00:04:29.750> spot<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.710> make<00:04:30.950> sure<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.490> dies

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
over I also spot and I make sure it dies

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.880 
over I also spot and I make sure it dies
like<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.300> don't<00:04:32.630> get<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.050> my<00:04:33.290> friends<00:04:33.620> will<00:04:33.710> get

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
like I don't get it my friends will get

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.220 
like I don't get it my friends will get
it<00:04:34.040> so<00:04:34.520> that's<00:04:34.910> really<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.240> main<00:04:35.270> thing<00:04:35.420> an

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
it so that's really the main thing an

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.890 
it so that's really the main thing an
engineer<00:04:36.590> should<00:04:36.770> be<00:04:36.950> old<00:04:37.460> tank<00:04:37.760> whoring<00:04:38.120> and

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
engineer should be old tank whoring and

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.330 
engineer should be old tank whoring and
repairing<00:04:39.710> when<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:39.890> get<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.100> opportunity

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
repairing when you get the opportunity

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.630 
repairing when you get the opportunity
to<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:42.500> should<00:04:42.650> be<00:04:42.740> able<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.980> take<00:04:43.100> down<00:04:43.250> enemy

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640
