impressive<00:01:32.790> i<00:01:33.180> think<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.020> reason<00:01:34.259> why<00:01:34.890> people

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
impressive i think the reason why people

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.770 
impressive i think the reason why people
don't<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.060> much<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.329> because<00:01:36.450> they

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
don't like it as much just because they

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.390 
don't like it as much just because they
had<00:01:36.930> such<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> high<00:01:37.619> pop<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.280> like

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
had such a high pop about it like

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.740 
had such a high pop about it like
everyone<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.790> getting<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.119> hyper<00:01:39.390> talk<00:01:39.540> about

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
everyone was getting so hyper talk about

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.390 
everyone was getting so hyper talk about
like<00:01:39.900> oh<00:01:39.990> yeah<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.470> gonna<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.770> awesome<00:01:40.920> ah

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
like oh yeah it's gonna be awesome ah

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.899 
like oh yeah it's gonna be awesome ah
and<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.750> wasn't<00:01:43.079> what<00:01:43.890> people<00:01:43.950> expected

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and it just wasn't what people expected

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.109 
and it just wasn't what people expected
it<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.290> that's<00:01:46.290> why<00:01:46.500> i<00:01:46.860> think<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.729> lot<00:01:47.820> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it to be that's why i think a lot of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.410 
it to be that's why i think a lot of
people<00:01:48.210> don't<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.220> not<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> fun

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
people don't like I is not really a fun

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.280 
people don't like I is not really a fun
game<00:01:51.720> either<00:01:52.610> but<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.140> that's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
game either but you know I think that's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.870 
game either but you know I think that's
pretty<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> main<00:01:56.009> reasons<00:01:56.399> why<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:56.820> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
pretty one the main reasons why a lot of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.100 
pretty one the main reasons why a lot of
people<00:01:56.969> don't<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
people don't like it because of the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.399 
people don't like it because of the

last down and they made it even worse
well<00:02:17.799> done<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.930> I'm<00:02:20.010> really<00:02:21.010> hoping<00:02:21.549> that

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
well done but I'm really hoping that

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.530

modern<00:02:22.689> warfare<00:02:22.870> 3<00:02:23.939> from<00:02:24.939> what<00:02:25.150> I've<00:02:25.269> seen<00:02:25.299> I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
modern warfare 3 from what I've seen I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.630 
modern warfare 3 from what I've seen I
haven't<00:02:25.840> looked<00:02:26.290> into<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.920> much<00:02:26.950> because

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
haven't looked into it that much because

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.039 
haven't looked into it that much because
I<00:02:27.849> said<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.060> don't<00:02:28.209> really<00:02:28.299> wanna<00:02:28.480> get<00:02:28.599> hyped<00:02:28.870> up

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
I said I don't really wanna get hyped up

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.170 
I said I don't really wanna get hyped up
that<00:02:29.349> I<00:02:29.379> hyped<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.739> about<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.310> what<00:02:31.150> I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
that I hyped up about it but what I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.410 
that I hyped up about it but what I
think<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.569> gonna<00:02:31.750> be<00:02:31.959> like<00:02:32.140> cuz<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.760> guns<00:02:34.060> like

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
think is gonna be like cuz the guns like

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.330 
think is gonna be like cuz the guns like
pictures<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.900> guns<00:02:35.109> I've<00:02:35.290> seen<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.859> looks

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
pictures of the guns I've seen it looks

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.839 
pictures of the guns I've seen it looks
a<00:02:36.670> lot<00:02:37.239> like<00:02:37.540> modern<00:02:38.319> warfare<00:02:38.500> 2<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.069> cod4<00:02:39.579> put

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
a lot like modern warfare 2 and cod4 put

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.619 
a lot like modern warfare 2 and cod4 put
together<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:41.409> I'm<00:02:42.280> hoping<00:02:43.209> it's<00:02:43.359> going<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.540> be

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
together so I'm hoping it's going to be

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.539 
together so I'm hoping it's going to be
something<00:02:44.079> along<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.650> lines<00:02:44.829> of<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.670> I

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.039 
something along the lines of that I
haven't<00:02:48.549> really<00:02:48.849> looked<00:02:49.239> any<00:02:49.480> videos<00:02:49.870> I've
