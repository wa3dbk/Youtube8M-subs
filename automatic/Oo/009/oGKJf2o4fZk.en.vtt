 hi thank you for watching this video what 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.899
 let's do now is prepare a 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:12.210
 special consumption 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:17.560
 with very popular garlic and feinted with his 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.109
 garlic for parents in some rolls and 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.680
 some special things like the tuna 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:26.000
 Tataki is used a lot 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.250
 what we are going to do here is put 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.590
 We have two cups of punch 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.050
 that in my channel is how to do the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:40.660
 consul in yes what we are going to use 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:43.870
 here is that we have to liquefy two 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.530
 spoonfuls of chopped white onion two 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:52.030
 spoonfuls of ginger already peeled and 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.079
 chopped four cloves garlic and a half 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.760
 teaspoonful 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.699
 of ground black pepper and here we have 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.369
 a quarter cup of sesame oil 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.090
 we 're going to grind all that oil 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.700
 we're going to put it in the blender 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.240
 as he goes and when we are putting him 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.580
 little by little the oil to make our 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.480
 sauce 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.480
 Let's avoid the noise of the blender 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.210
 and because it is very annoying 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.580
 here already ready well liquefied 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:37.370
 and it 's ready as you can see this creamy 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.460
 when not in use one is separated but not 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.250
 will beat it again and ready before 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.300

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.580
 Here we have a delicious sashimi salmon 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.850
 what's going to stay with this sauce 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.850

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.620
 so they call him 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.710
