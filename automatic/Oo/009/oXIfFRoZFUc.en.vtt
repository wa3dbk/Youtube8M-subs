really<00:01:40.119> going<00:01:40.750> in-depth<00:01:41.650> with<00:01:41.920> trailers

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
really going in-depth with trailers

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.719 
really going in-depth with trailers
because<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:44.560> our<00:01:44.680> trailers<00:01:45.070> designed<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.550> do

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
because what our trailers designed to do

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.400 
because what our trailers designed to do
they're<00:01:46.540> designed<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:48.000> accentuate<00:01:49.410> whatever

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
they're designed to accentuate whatever

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.160 
they're designed to accentuate whatever
it<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:50.770> they're<00:01:51.670> trying<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:52.240> advertise<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
it is they're trying to advertise the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.240 
it is they're trying to advertise the
given<00:01:53.530> feature<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:55.080> whatnot<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.590> in<00:01:56.979> the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
given feature and whatnot that is in the

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.060 
given feature and whatnot that is in the
game<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:59.369> you<00:02:00.369> know<00:02:00.399> elicit<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.090> reaction

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
game and to you know elicit a reaction

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.279 
game and to you know elicit a reaction
so<00:02:03.070> they're<00:02:03.940> certainly<00:02:04.330> good<00:02:04.690> as<00:02:04.869> far<00:02:05.140> as

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
so they're certainly good as far as

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.430 
so they're certainly good as far as
doing<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:07.090> as<00:02:07.210> far<00:02:07.300> as<00:02:08.070> what<00:02:09.070> we<00:02:09.250> know<00:02:09.489> as

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
doing that but as far as what we know as

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.949 
doing that but as far as what we know as
to<00:02:11.440> how<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.190> all<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.970> mesh<00:02:13.750> together

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
to how it's all going to mesh together

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.960 
to how it's all going to mesh together
is<00:02:14.860> really<00:02:15.070> pretty<00:02:15.310> much<00:02:15.489> up<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:15.880> air

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
is really pretty much up in the air

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.229 
is really pretty much up in the air
right<00:02:16.090> now<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:18.430> game<00:02:18.640> changers<00:02:19.120> have

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
actually done a pretty good job in

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.620 
actually done a pretty good job in
keeping<00:02:20.769> us<00:02:21.130> informed<00:02:21.489> as<00:02:22.239> far<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:24.360> what<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.480> in

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
keeping us informed as far as what is in
