00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
you get pulled into one usually it's

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.719 
you get pulled into one usually it's
death<00:01:56.409> for<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.740> some<00:01:57.189> reason<00:01:57.490> I'm<00:01:57.580> having

really<00:01:58.060> good<00:01:58.180> luck<00:01:58.830> actually<00:01:59.830> it's<00:02:00.159> starting

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
really good luck actually it's starting

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.580 
really good luck actually it's starting
to<00:02:00.520> disappear<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.990> here<00:02:02.200> comes<00:02:02.380> all<00:02:02.500> the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
to disappear and here comes all the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.380 
to disappear and here comes all the
blocks<00:02:02.830> coming<00:02:03.670> back<00:02:03.909> down<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.299> ground

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
blocks coming back down to the ground

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.639 
blocks coming back down to the ground
watch<00:02:05.110> your<00:02:05.320> head

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
but this thing destroyed the ground I

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.699 
but this thing destroyed the ground I
mean<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:09.729> made<00:02:09.970> an<00:02:10.179> amazing<00:02:10.660> path<00:02:11.230> across<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
mean it made an amazing path across the

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.070 
mean it made an amazing path across the
land<00:02:12.160> as<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:13.270> mentioned<00:02:13.600> guys<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.959> was<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
land as I mentioned guys that was the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.050 
land as I mentioned guys that was the
smallest<00:02:14.470> tornado<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> spawned<00:02:15.880> in<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
smallest tornado so I spawned in a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.729 
smallest tornado so I spawned in a
couple<00:02:16.360> spiders<00:02:16.840> see<00:02:17.110> if<00:02:17.200> they<00:02:17.319> get<00:02:17.440> sucked

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
couple spiders see if they get sucked

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.110 
couple spiders see if they get sucked
into<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.160> we'll<00:02:19.090> see<00:02:19.239> what<00:02:19.360> happens<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:21.090> /wm

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
into this we'll see what happens so /wm

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.309 
into this we'll see what happens so /wm
spawn<00:02:23.130> tornado<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:25.150> we're<00:02:25.269> gonna<00:02:25.360> try<00:02:25.750> level

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
spawn tornado and we're gonna try level

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.890 
spawn tornado and we're gonna try level
3<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.160> one<00:02:27.310> right<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.790> middle<00:02:27.970> and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
3 so this one right in the middle and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.620 
3 so this one right in the middle and
extremely<00:02:29.260> powerful<00:02:29.470> oh<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.090> really<00:02:31.420> far

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
extremely powerful oh that is really far

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.120 
extremely powerful oh that is really far
away<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:32.440> was<00:02:32.620> mean

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
away that was mean

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.880 
away that was mean
but<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.360> very<00:02:34.650> freaking<00:02:35.650> large

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
but that is a very freaking large

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.280 
but that is a very freaking large
tornado<00:02:36.510> honestly<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.690> might<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.140> most

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
tornado honestly this might be the most

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.990 
tornado honestly this might be the most
amazing<00:02:38.530> mod<00:02:38.890> I've<00:02:39.040> ever<00:02:39.160> seen<00:02:39.400> before

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
amazing mod I've ever seen before

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.570 
amazing mod I've ever seen before
who<00:02:40.720> couldn't<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.049> ground<00:02:41.470> it's<00:02:42.250> really

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
who couldn't the ground it's really

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.330 
who couldn't the ground it's really
tearing<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:42.940> up<00:02:43.030> now<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.830> crazy

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
tearing it up now so this is a crazy

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.100 
tearing it up now so this is a crazy
tornado<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.239> they<00:02:46.360> can't<00:02:46.630> spawn<00:02:46.900> naturally

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
tornado and they can't spawn naturally

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.370 
tornado and they can't spawn naturally
like<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.769> too<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.630> beware<00:02:49.630> we<00:02:50.019> don't<00:02:50.200> have<00:02:50.319> a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
like this too so beware we don't have a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.680 
like this too so beware we don't have a
pretty<00:02:50.709> good<00:02:50.980> computer<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:51.940> will<00:02:52.299> lag

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
pretty good computer this will lag

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.600 
pretty good computer this will lag
especially<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:53.890> spawn<00:02:54.160> in<00:02:54.280> multiple

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
especially if you spawn in multiple

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.000 
especially if you spawn in multiple
tornadoes<00:02:54.790> which<00:02:55.239> we're<00:02:55.420> about<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.900> do<00:02:56.079> level

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
tornadoes which we're about to do level

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.670 
tornadoes which we're about to do level
5<00:02:57.329> here<00:02:58.329> we<00:02:58.359> go<00:02:58.630> level<00:02:59.109> 5<00:02:59.350> I<00:03:00.299> can<00:03:01.299> see<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:02.440> wind

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
5 here we go level 5 I can see the wind

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.710 
5 here we go level 5 I can see the wind
coming<00:03:03.010> ok<00:03:03.489> hold<00:03:03.609> on<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.390> tell<00:03:04.570> this

thing is just massive we're in the
middle<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.540> actually<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:08.680> one<00:03:08.950> doesn't

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
middle of it actually this one doesn't

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.060 
middle of it actually this one doesn't
look<00:03:09.549> as<00:03:09.760> cool<00:03:09.790> it's<00:03:10.480> something<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.840> noticed
