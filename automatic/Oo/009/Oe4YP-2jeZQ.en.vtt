00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
one we did the a-plus wait a minute

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.799 
one we did the a-plus wait a minute
that's<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:58.190> no<00:00:59.190> no<00:00:59.309> no<00:00:59.460> then<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> 770

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that's it no no no then we have the 770

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.280 
that's it no no no then we have the 770
I<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.440> plus<00:01:02.719> again<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> don't<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.140> the

won't<00:01:11.970> work<00:01:12.890> maybe<00:01:13.890> eventually<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.460> we're

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
won't work maybe eventually so we're

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.420 
won't work maybe eventually so we're
going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.820> ahead<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.090> back<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.570> this

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
going to go ahead and back out of this

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.210 
going to go ahead and back out of this
and<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.759> next<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.509> 770<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.070> got

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and the next one is the 770 I so we got

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.990 
and the next one is the 770 I so we got
to<00:01:20.340> go<00:01:20.430> from<00:01:20.580> M<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:23.400> plus<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.909> we
