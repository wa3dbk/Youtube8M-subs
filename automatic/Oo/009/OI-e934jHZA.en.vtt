maintenance we have not yet found out

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.900 
maintenance we have not yet found out
what<00:01:49.850> they<00:01:50.090> bar<00:01:50.390> wait<00:01:51.050> so<00:01:51.229> not<00:01:51.410> even<00:01:51.560> the

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
what they bar wait so not even the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.219 
what they bar wait so not even the
administration<00:01:52.910> knows<00:01:53.180> what<00:01:53.420> those<00:01:53.660> are<00:01:53.960> I

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
administration knows what those are I

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.630 
administration knows what those are I
thought<00:01:54.650> they<00:01:54.800> were<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.950> ones<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.430> place

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
thought they were the ones that place

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.600 
thought they were the ones that place
the<00:01:55.820> protection<00:01:56.300> on<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.720> first<00:01:56.990> place

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
the protection on it in the first place

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.790 
the protection on it in the first place
however<00:01:58.610> we<00:01:59.450> already<00:01:59.720> know<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.560> your

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
however we already know that your

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.310 
however we already know that your
illegal<00:02:01.369> powers<00:02:01.880> can<00:02:02.240> break<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:02.810> protection

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
illegal powers can break that protection

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.219 
illegal powers can break that protection
so<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.400> protected<00:02:05.030> areas<00:02:05.390> are<00:02:05.420> placed<00:02:05.930> there

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
so the protected areas are placed there

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.380 
so the protected areas are placed there
by<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.470> game<00:02:06.800> itself<00:02:07.430> outside<00:02:08.209> the

need<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.310> or<00:02:13.820> gate<00:02:14.120> hacking

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.970 

this<00:02:20.599> is<00:02:20.780> nothing<00:02:21.109> to<00:02:21.260> be<00:02:21.379> surprised<00:02:21.799> about

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
this is nothing to be surprised about

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.020 
this is nothing to be surprised about
this<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:23.030> result<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.629> a<00:02:23.950> successful

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
this is the result of a successful

protected area we're on the board to

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.390 
protected area we're on the board to
check<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.959> board<00:02:36.200> then

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
check the board then

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.460 
check the board then
they're<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.209> how<00:02:38.420> much<00:02:38.629> of<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:38.930> game<00:02:39.230> is

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
they're just how much of this game is

Nia<00:06:16.950> taught<00:06:17.280> you<00:06:17.430> how<00:06:17.580> to<00:06:17.640> hack<00:06:17.850> the<00:06:18.000> gates<00:06:18.240> so

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
Nia taught you how to hack the gates so

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.899 
Nia taught you how to hack the gates so
she<00:06:18.720> has<00:06:19.020> a<00:06:19.050> right<00:06:19.350> to<00:06:19.380> go<00:06:19.620> right<00:06:19.980> I<00:06:20.490> guess

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.850 

so<00:06:26.909> we<00:06:27.210> have<00:06:27.360> a<00:06:27.389> lot<00:06:27.780> of<00:06:27.810> things<00:06:28.199> we<00:06:28.470> can<00:06:28.650> do

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
so we have a lot of things we can do

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.580 
so we have a lot of things we can do
then<00:06:31.190> five<00:06:32.190> areas<00:06:32.669> we<00:06:32.849> can<00:06:33.030> go<00:06:33.240> to<00:06:33.349> and<00:06:34.349> go<00:06:34.530> to

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
then five areas we can go to and go to

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.619 
then five areas we can go to and go to
this<00:06:34.770> one<00:06:34.919> to<00:06:35.069> advance<00:06:35.370> the<00:06:35.550> storyline<00:06:35.940> we<00:06:36.479> can

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:36.629 
this one to advance the storyline we can

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.920 
this one to advance the storyline we can
do<00:06:36.750> goblin<00:06:37.289> tag<00:06:37.560> we<00:06:38.400> have<00:06:38.479> Mistral's<00:06:39.479> not

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
do goblin tag we have Mistral's not

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.490 
do goblin tag we have Mistral's not
Mistral<00:06:40.440> gardenias<00:06:41.250> area<00:06:41.699> we<00:06:42.360> have<00:06:42.629> the<00:06:42.870> new

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
Mistral gardenias area we have the new

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.189 
Mistral gardenias area we have the new
Kawasaki<00:06:44.220> Maru<00:06:44.430> show<00:06:44.789> and<00:06:45.180> we<00:06:45.449> have<00:06:45.659> Rachel's

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
Kawasaki Maru show and we have Rachel's

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.189 
Kawasaki Maru show and we have Rachel's
treating<00:06:46.770> convention<00:06:47.509> so<00:06:48.509> let's<00:06:48.810> see<00:06:48.990> how

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
treating convention so let's see how

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.260 
treating convention so let's see how
many<00:06:49.470> of<00:06:49.620> these<00:06:49.770> I<00:06:50.009> can<00:06:50.220> figure<00:06:50.550> out<00:06:50.789> what<00:06:51.150> to

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
many of these I can figure out what to

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.499 
many of these I can figure out what to
do<00:06:51.419> with<00:06:51.629> next<00:06:52.050> time<00:06:52.229> until<00:06:52.620> then<00:06:53.580> so<00:06:54.300> long

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:54.509 
do with next time until then so long

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:56.870 
do with next time until then so long
everyone
