00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.790
 hello so today I would like to talk to you about wearing gloves 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.790
 attitude at blackrock 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.769
 so quantities of colored cement 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 military and law 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.489
 so 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.029
 with also materials a little bit different from one series to another there 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.140
 I took her to the series which is art so I'm 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.779
 White 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.440
 micro-cuts only at the fingertips so as to have a maximum 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.210
 of sensitivity so very very fine cuts 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.350
 for maximum sensations 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.350
 a lining to reinforce at the level of the palm of the hand 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.440
 all that is slower 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.290
 abrasion 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.090
 so really very important 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.840
 reinforcements on the top of the palm 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.890
 and at the point 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.890
 6h of centering for the shot above the hand 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.460
 for the wrist 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.930
 when you choose a body forward for the field 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.120
 it really has to be like a second skin 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.250
 must not be too cowardly 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.570
 yet not to make too much rain 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.550
 must not be too tight necessarily for all movements 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.940
 when you shake your fist for tonight it's fine 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.360
 you take more hair at the waist knowing that his costs are leather 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.960
 of the fabric of the clip the rise of the materials which with the time we have 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.520
 a king move slightly to fit the shape of your hand 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.100
 so if there is already play when you choose a glove 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.900
 that we offered you as you use the wind will relax from 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.960
 more and more 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.960
 so the saw her logo is perfectly adjusted 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.450
 it will stay throughout the use so I do not know at all 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.610
 to make sure it serves what gives the big cisse in the press 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.570
 I just had a year so I hated a bit with 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.010
 activities that is to say that I am big games used for 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.160
 percent couple cases when I did my theses cutting with some 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.109
 knives when playing 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:10.649
 the camp of the most the same 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.069
 m the clip extracts the camp kapla is hot in the heart kent also 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.260
 helped to make some of the sambre for for some pieces who who 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.449
 warm up a bit fast 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:23.059
 so I guess in all ways less good like that% 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:27.709
 it is paris marc as important as the alsace tactile coast so really for 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.059
 the terrain for the military so we had a lot on the 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:34.069
 military but also strongly despite a fairly significant resistance 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.699
 it's conti with the hard test and that will hold the shock so here is 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.699
 more with their linings and worry-free art
