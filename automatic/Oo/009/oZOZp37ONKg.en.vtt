that<00:01:45.270> modified<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:45.990> tip<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.320> there

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that modified little tip on there

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
that modified little tip on there
because<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.460> supposed<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because the it's supposed to be like a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
because the it's supposed to be like a
zero<00:01:48.770> number<00:01:49.770> zero<00:01:50.040> Phillips<00:01:50.490> screwdriver

something<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.409> -2<00:01:53.009> was

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
something like that but I think -2 was

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.789 
something like that but I think -2 was
actually<00:01:53.579> too<00:01:53.700> sharp<00:01:54.200> or<00:01:55.200> wouldn't<00:01:55.500> work<00:01:55.619> on

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
actually too sharp or wouldn't work on

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.880 
actually too sharp or wouldn't work on
the<00:01:55.920> inside<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.579> anyway<00:01:57.439> usual<00:01:58.439> screwdriver

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the inside so anyway usual screwdriver

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.370

exactly what I'm talking about

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.980 
exactly what I'm talking about
here<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.690> say<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.870> can<00:02:12.050> set<00:02:12.200> this<00:02:12.320> camera<00:02:12.590> down

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.130 

the<00:02:17.990> first<00:02:18.230> thing<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:19.870> first<00:02:20.870> thing<00:02:21.020> is<00:02:21.110> just

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
the first thing is first thing is just

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.620 
the first thing is first thing is just
to<00:02:21.290> open<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:22.210> little<00:02:23.210> chassis<00:02:23.780> there

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
to open the little chassis there

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.970 
to open the little chassis there
front<00:02:26.630> cover<00:02:26.840> comes<00:02:27.110> off<00:02:27.260> with<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.560> suction<00:02:27.800> cup

front cover comes off with a suction cup
this<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.430> actually<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.730> pretty<00:02:28.880> powerful

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
this is actually a pretty powerful

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.550 
this is actually a pretty powerful
suction<00:02:29.570> because<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.900> find<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.410> just

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
suction because I find that if you just

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.320 
suction because I find that if you just
use<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.770> little<00:02:30.920> bit<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.190> oil<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.060> metal

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
use a little bit of oil to the metal

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.060 
use a little bit of oil to the metal
kind

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
kind

basically it's not hard to see in this
video<00:03:04.550> but<00:03:04.670> what<00:03:04.910> you're<00:03:05.030> looking<00:03:05.270> at<00:03:05.360> these

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
video but what you're looking at these

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.650 
video but what you're looking at these
contacts<00:03:06.140> right<00:03:06.410> there<00:03:06.740> okay

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
contacts right there okay

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.530 
contacts right there okay
now<00:03:08.660> I'm<00:03:08.720> going<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.930> try<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.110> splice<00:03:09.890> in<00:03:10.100> a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
now I'm going to try to splice in a

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.700 
now I'm going to try to splice in a
photo<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.810> these<00:03:11.960> things<00:03:12.230> because<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.500> don't

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
photo of these things because I don't

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.250 
photo of these things because I don't
think<00:03:12.740> my<00:03:12.920> camera<00:03:13.190> can<00:03:13.460> macro<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.120> small<00:03:14.540> but

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
think my camera can macro that small but

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.230 
think my camera can macro that small but
what<00:03:15.440> you're<00:03:15.590> basically<00:03:16.010> doing<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.610> you're

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
what you're basically doing is you're

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.860 
what you're basically doing is you're
taking<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.750> outside<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.710> these<00:03:18.980> leads<00:03:19.870> taking

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
taking the outside of these leads taking

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.390 
taking the outside of these leads taking
your<00:03:20.960> little<00:03:21.170> screwdriver<00:03:21.620> your<00:03:21.890> sponge<00:03:22.250> or

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
your little screwdriver your sponge or

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.400 
your little screwdriver your sponge or
two<00:03:22.550> or<00:03:22.730> what-have-you<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.420> just<00:03:24.020> bending

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
two or what-have-you and just bending

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.200 
two or what-have-you and just bending
them<00:03:24.530> up<00:03:24.710> a<00:03:24.950> little<00:03:25.070> bit<00:03:25.310> okay<00:03:25.700> just<00:03:25.910> bending

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
them up a little bit okay just bending

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.460 
them up a little bit okay just bending
them<00:03:26.330> so<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.570> they<00:03:26.690> engage<00:03:27.370> essentially<00:03:29.470> so

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
them so that they engage essentially so

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.590 
them so that they engage essentially so
they<00:03:30.650> can<00:03:30.800> engage<00:03:30.920> these<00:03:31.310> sensors<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:33.500> the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
they can engage these sensors on the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.110 
they can engage these sensors on the
logic<00:03:35.600> works<00:03:35.930> out<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.230> lot<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.500> fun<00:03:37.060> should<00:03:38.060> be

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
logic works out a lot of fun should be

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.260 
logic works out a lot of fun should be
here<00:03:39.190> they<00:03:40.190> basically<00:03:40.580> engage<00:03:40.700> those<00:03:41.060> little

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
here they basically engage those little

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.250 
here they basically engage those little
sensors<00:03:41.600> right<00:03:41.750> there

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
sensors right there

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.320 
sensors right there
and<00:03:42.350> over<00:03:42.950> time<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.430> suppose<00:03:43.700> what<00:03:43.880> happens<00:03:44.210> is

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
and over time I suppose what happens is

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.900 
and over time I suppose what happens is
they<00:03:44.480> get<00:03:45.370> they<00:03:46.370> get<00:03:46.460> a<00:03:46.520> little<00:03:46.580> bent<00:03:46.790> out<00:03:46.880> of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
they get they get a little bent out of

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.000 
they get they get a little bent out of

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
those little leads were basically bent

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.910 
those little leads were basically bent
all<00:03:51.680> hill<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.610> so<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:53.390> prop<00:03:54.230> them<00:03:54.410> up<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.740> put

all hill and so I prop them up and I put
them<00:03:55.010> back<00:03:55.130> on<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:56.090> you'll<00:03:56.240> see<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.570> if<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.500> do

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
them back on and you'll see that if I do

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.240 
them back on and you'll see that if I do
that<00:03:59.410> by<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.500> way<00:04:00.590> they're<00:04:00.740> all<00:04:00.980> reason<00:04:01.190> I'm

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
that by the way they're all reason I'm

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.200 
that by the way they're all reason I'm
doing<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:01.430> videos<00:04:01.790> because<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.120> actually

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
doing this videos because I actually

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.730 
doing this videos because I actually
forgot<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.660> put<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.930> electrical<00:04:03.320> tape<00:04:03.530> back

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
forgot to put the electrical tape back

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.880 
forgot to put the electrical tape back
now<00:04:03.920> back<00:04:04.490> side<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:05.200> home<00:04:06.200> button<00:04:06.590> I

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
now back side of that home button I

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.580 
now back side of that home button I
didn't<00:04:07.340> want<00:04:07.459> to<00:04:07.520> leave<00:04:07.640> it<00:04:07.730> out<00:04:08.440> never<00:04:09.440> know

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
didn't want to leave it out never know

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.479 
didn't want to leave it out never know
that<00:04:12.519> they're<00:04:14.220> close<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:16.540> shut<00:04:16.930> wait

that they're close this shut wait

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.420 
that they're close this shut wait
probably<00:04:19.590> make<00:04:20.590> sure<00:04:20.739> it's<00:04:20.889> a<00:04:20.919> good<00:04:21.040> idea<00:04:21.190> to

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
probably make sure it's a good idea to

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.370 
probably make sure it's a good idea to
make<00:04:21.579> sure<00:04:21.699> all<00:04:21.850> of<00:04:21.880> your<00:04:22.060> number<00:04:22.960> one<00:04:23.169> and

number two cables are plugged in

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.100 
number two cables are plugged in
properly<00:04:24.790> my<00:04:25.150> number<00:04:25.360> one<00:04:25.510> always<00:04:25.600> pops<00:04:25.930> off

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
properly my number one always pops off

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
board side and just kind of let me give

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.500 
board side and just kind of let me give
it

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
it

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
it
press<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.870> down<00:04:34.900> in<00:04:35.139> there<00:04:37.229> not<00:04:38.229> everything

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
press it down in there not everything

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.299

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:42.309 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:44.069 

and<00:04:42.459> it<00:04:42.939> basically<00:04:43.239> just<00:04:43.329> works<00:04:43.689> like<00:04:43.869> new

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:44.079 
and it basically just works like new

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:48.119 
and it basically just works like new
this<00:04:44.319> works<00:04:44.499> like<00:04:44.619> magic<00:04:44.679> and<00:04:45.399> it's<00:04:45.669> a<00:04:47.129> fairly

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
this works like magic and it's a fairly

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.179 
this works like magic and it's a fairly
quick<00:04:48.849> fix<00:04:49.269> for<00:04:49.539> that<00:04:49.569> stuck<00:04:49.959> home<00:04:50.199> button<00:04:50.559> I

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
quick fix for that stuck home button I

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.609 
quick fix for that stuck home button I
did<00:04:51.639> do<00:04:51.819> all<00:04:51.969> the<00:04:52.089> other<00:04:52.569> in<00:04:53.199> to<00:04:53.409> begin

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:53.619 
did do all the other in to begin

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:58.049 
did do all the other in to begin
with<00:04:53.769> the<00:04:54.479> shop<00:04:55.479> air<00:04:55.719> and<00:04:55.989> other<00:04:56.199> crap<00:04:56.879> to<00:04:57.879> try

00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:58.059 
with the shop air and other crap to try

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.699 
with the shop air and other crap to try
and<00:04:58.209> get<00:04:58.299> it<00:04:58.389> out<00:04:58.479> the<00:04:58.719> air<00:04:58.899> in<00:04:58.929> a<00:04:59.079> can<00:04:59.289> just<00:04:59.619> to

00:04:59.699 --> 00:04:59.709 
and get it out the air in a can just to

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:01.949 
and get it out the air in a can just to
clear<00:05:00.039> out<00:05:00.159> that<00:05:00.309> lint<00:05:00.609> but<00:05:01.539> to<00:05:01.629> be<00:05:01.719> honest

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:01.959 
clear out that lint but to be honest

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:03.269 
clear out that lint but to be honest
with<00:05:02.049> you<00:05:02.169> there<00:05:02.319> wasn't<00:05:02.529> any<00:05:02.649> lint<00:05:02.919> in<00:05:03.039> there

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 
with you there wasn't any lint in there

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
with you there wasn't any lint in there
my<00:05:04.149> sister<00:05:04.449> had<00:05:04.569> probably<00:05:04.899> used<00:05:05.139> a<00:05:05.259> lot<00:05:05.439> of

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:06.299 
my sister had probably used a lot of

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:08.339 
my sister had probably used a lot of
cases<00:05:07.299> over<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.749> year<00:05:07.899> I<00:05:07.929> don't<00:05:08.139> think<00:05:08.289> she

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
cases over the year I don't think she

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.349 
cases over the year I don't think she
actually<00:05:08.379> used<00:05:08.709> many<00:05:08.889> cases<00:05:09.219> actually<00:05:09.549> on<00:05:09.729> the

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:10.359 
actually used many cases actually on the

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:12.599 
actually used many cases actually on the
years<00:05:10.569> she<00:05:10.749> had<00:05:10.869> these<00:05:11.049> this<00:05:11.319> iPhone<00:05:11.709> so<00:05:11.949> if

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:12.609 
years she had these this iPhone so if

00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:13.919 
years she had these this iPhone so if
people<00:05:12.879> say<00:05:13.029> you<00:05:13.089> know<00:05:13.269> if<00:05:13.389> you<00:05:13.479> use<00:05:13.629> your<00:05:13.779> home

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:13.929 
people say you know if you use your home

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:15.209 
people say you know if you use your home
button<00:05:14.169> a<00:05:14.199> lot<00:05:14.349> you<00:05:14.649> know<00:05:14.679> you're<00:05:15.009> probably

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
button a lot you know you're probably

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:16.769 
button a lot you know you're probably
just<00:05:15.519> compressing<00:05:16.029> it<00:05:16.149> and<00:05:16.179> stuff<00:05:16.479> like<00:05:16.599> that

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
just compressing it and stuff like that

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:20.149 
just compressing it and stuff like that
but<00:05:17.489> my<00:05:18.489> opinion<00:05:18.669> they're<00:05:19.269> doles<00:05:19.509> man

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
but my opinion they're doles man

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.189 
but my opinion they're doles man
probably<00:05:21.159> not<00:05:21.459> fix<00:05:22.209> this<00:05:22.509> to<00:05:22.599> begin<00:05:22.839> with

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
probably not fix this to begin with

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.589 
probably not fix this to begin with
probably<00:05:23.919> still<00:05:24.069> having<00:05:24.399> a<00:05:24.489> problem<00:05:24.729> fixing

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
probably still having a problem fixing

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.299 
probably still having a problem fixing
that's<00:05:25.809> stupid<00:05:26.079> or<00:05:26.349> replacing<00:05:27.069> the<00:05:27.159> actual

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:27.309

button but as you can see I mean barely

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:34.019 
button but as you can see I mean barely
pressing<00:05:31.089> it<00:05:31.209> comes<00:05:31.809> on<00:05:32.579> it's<00:05:33.579> good<00:05:33.759> to<00:05:33.849> go

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
pressing it comes on it's good to go

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:37.199 
pressing it comes on it's good to go
