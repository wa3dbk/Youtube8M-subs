00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.710
 hi to all with that of tests 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.349
 mobile.fr chaussée us 2015 on the stand 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.209
 darcos who presents his little little sound 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.589
 newcomer rather high-end 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.749
 then a small price of course as 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.869
 usually at archos it's 50 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:21.570
 diamond diamond that rests on a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.820
 snapdragon 615 duhayot octo cores sorry 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.200
 11.5 giguère there is a 5 inch eee screen 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.550
 ps full hd 4g lte and e dual sim is 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.219
 In-house ghanem ability to put 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.059
 a micro sd 2 gigas of ram 2007 100 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.620
 millions we lose at the level of the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.269
 battery is not bad at all 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.829
 appears to me that will arrive current of 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.800
 the year where God appears very very 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.199
 soon to 199 euros 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.429
 so it's 599 euros these rooms is 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.749
 arrived a little in quotation marks 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.460
 high at archos but it's true that 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:48.960
 often we come to have products 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.089
 interesting for not too expensive 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.429
 then the jelly comes in two 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.719
 versions I have this version there that like 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.089
 you can see it from and in a 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.280
 pretty original color so here it is 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.539
 yellow it's pretty fluo it goes 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.069
 maybe a little less fluo to 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.780
 the camera and then next to that I have the 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:04.769
 black version we will linger on the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.210
 fluo version because simply 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.540
 it is more convenient to manipulate 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.649
 apal to the apal to security next to that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.060
 there is something else to know is that 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.430
 it is a priori the version that will be 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.710
 proposed for sale is a bit of a test 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.049
 who goes for it and he knows he gets up a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.729
 little challenge it's a challenge it's 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.799
 to propose for sale occurs in 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.479
 a rather original color so it's 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.860
 dare to have after ben tell me you 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.509
 by the way what do you think 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.740
 of this color we will look a little 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.640
 details of course the design you 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.350
 do not worry so we do not see very much 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.570
 good because it's black on a black background 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.689
 and that's it but we have the audio output 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.070
 optical allki the front camera 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.159
 just here and there notification led 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.979
 when we access the interface we have enough 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.979
 key that appears 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.500
 that's all these posters 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.270
 with welcome menu and back we have the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.979
 little arrco logo on this area 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.609
 quite characteristic a darcos this kind 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.729
 of design 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.530
 below we have the micro usb port / 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.600
 right we have absolutely nothing we can 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.799
 remove no on that there normally he 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.350
 seemed to me that we could not remove the 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.490
 hull but so if we can remove the 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.230
 shell but what I was told is that the 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.319
 battery was not removable I think 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.780
 that's what's wrong with me 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.180
 volume 1 to lock unlock the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.870
 jack on the top on the back 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.670
 the camera so 16 16 megapixels 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.799
 rather nice and 8 megapixel front 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.799
 so a lot of megapixels in 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.730
 stock on this on this 50 dimon and hop on 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.889
 will go into the interface 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.900
 so beware of tafas that I am going to 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.250
 show its lollipop and it's a product 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.900
 which will go under the pop bed 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.909
 it will not be offered normally under the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.379
 hip hop at its release this game I have not the 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.019
 100% confirmation but in any case 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.430
 as you can see it's in 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.739
 works and they're doing it 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.060
 however, as you can see, that's 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.799
 not the basic interface of the building 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.209
 they have not then integrate yet all 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.730
 the elements of lollipop 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.829
 but we have for example this element that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.329
 you probably know if you 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.049
 have already watched my videos on hip 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.689
 hello here I show you quickly 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.329
 the lolly pop interface interface that 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.530
 you may know to rebate a 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.199
 little bit the brightness that is 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.319
 rather high to the maximum 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:20.870
 I put a little bit here also toc 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.879
 composition of numbers multitasking 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.439
 so here I feel like there was 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.370
 a little I do not know I think it's 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.959
 because it's a prototype version 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.400
 that multitasking that looks like that the 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.889
 menu that looks that looks like that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.199
 but who should a priori change from here 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.659
 there the camera so that's a 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.579
 interface that was a priori so I 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.579
 am filming who was a 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.019
 altered priorities do not quite 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.609
 not quite but we did not 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.099
 not the mode of you know the mode 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.900
 smartfocus what's his name is here 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.370
 where we can do the focus with an effect 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.569
 of depth of field I do not know 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.549
 why it is not there it is 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.069
 intriguing maybe he will arrive his 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.930
 official release but has for 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.870
 the moment there is apparently it is not 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.340
 proposed the keyboard we will see what it 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.129
 give is what we see it there we did not 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.419
 not the hardware interface design and you 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.489
 do not worry when you have 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.560
 the definitive interface you'll have it without 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.659
 worry this a beautiful screen anyway I 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.729
 found with a good pixel density 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.989
 good after for the rest not need 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.969
 necessarily to linger is a 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.019
 interface very very very very classic 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.280
 that you know in addition she is 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.770
 especially not definitive 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.969
 so here it is, but if not like that it has 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.960
 seem to work quite a bit to see 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.950
 then of course, of course 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.940
 definitive on this 50 diamond 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.870
 if you have questions of course 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.010
 do not hesitate what do you think 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.080
 of this version is what you 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.450
 would prefer the black version 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.350
 that looks like that or the yellow version 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.380
 a little fluo 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.580
 tell me in the comments vaz this 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.570
 that you simply think about it and 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.570
 then I tell you next time
