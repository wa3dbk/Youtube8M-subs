00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
great this is a critical part because we

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
great this is a critical part because we
really<00:01:56.219> want<00:01:56.460> them<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:56.969> into<00:01:57.180> homes<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
really want them to get into homes and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.660 
really want them to get into homes and
if<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.930> don't<00:01:58.049> get<00:01:58.259> them<00:01:58.350> socialized<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.250> this

if we don't get them socialized at this

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.240 
if we don't get them socialized at this
point<00:01:59.969> that's<00:02:00.210> real<00:02:00.540> tough<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.500> I'm<00:02:01.799> think

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
point that's real tough so I'm think

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.859 
point that's real tough so I'm think
this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.700> most<00:02:02.850> fun<00:02:03.149> part<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> entire
