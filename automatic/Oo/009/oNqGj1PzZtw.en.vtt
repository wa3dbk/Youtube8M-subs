 apparently still needed here 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.860
 I spontaneously decided a few 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.900
 days to stay longer 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.970

 Sebastian from now to us what do you notice 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.060

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 we browse not play 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.509
 maybe the fall will make you 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.939
 a little bit to create 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.400
 I think it's better for me though 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:16.170
 why it was not yours? 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.519
 guilty that I fell down 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.140
 I let her alone all alone 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.060
 Still, she could never get upset for long 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.129
 be your mobile and soon you will 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.319
 understand as well as before 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.599
 I'm sure I did not know how 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.980
 I laugh again bring as 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.989
 we are still missing something 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.310
 and who if not you should know how 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.780
 make a smile on your face 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:03:05.910
 conjures up a few things in the sense 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:03:08.020
