00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:09.300
 I will be in front of ace from a pair 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.540
 I use a long card 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.470
 Long card is long for everyone 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.000
 This long card is not 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.910
 It's a 100% cando card lamp, but it's also fine 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.070
 Depending on the dick 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.070

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.920
 Hallway card like that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.670
 Dozens of face-down cards 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.790
 What 's club, which was ostensibly 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.790

 And on top 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.600
 Is it a bad 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.940
 Cut about 1/3 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.839
 You can make a break by replacing éš¼ é·¹

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.839

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.690
 Bottom car 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.040
 The card I got in Pokeran 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.640
 Between tables 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.170
 Ace Long Card 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.170
 The chartered student of the club 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.060
 is 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.060
 It is only a dozen 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.370
 It has become in order 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.750
 From about 1/3 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.750
 To create a bloop 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:06.869
 Also it is Mercer in a clockwise direction in the chicks of a day 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.869

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.940
 Drop to left tee 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.810
 On the contrary 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.319
 Opposite to the clock 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.420
 Talk with thumb 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.420
 To the right of the thumb as a fulcrum 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.000
 I 'm doing this on the left 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.860
 The right mountain 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.200

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.860
 Geiå‚™ is not 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.860
 If you pull out only one after 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.250
 It will also be shoddy even the naturally if me to Arukeido 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.040
 next 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.909
