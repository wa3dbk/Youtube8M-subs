00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
and on the back you're going to be

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.970 
and on the back you're going to be
getting<00:02:24.360> these<00:02:24.480> antenna<00:02:24.959> bands<00:02:25.200> as<00:02:25.470> well<00:02:25.770> as

it yes it does have a protruding camera
and<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.880> does<00:02:42.060> bother<00:02:42.270> me<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> little<00:02:42.750> bit<00:02:42.900> but

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
and it does bother me a little bit but

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.900 
and it does bother me a little bit but
honestly<00:02:43.380> if<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.709> are<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:44.100> average<00:02:44.459> consumer

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
honestly if you are the average consumer

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.670 
honestly if you are the average consumer
it's<00:02:45.300> probably<00:02:45.720> not<00:02:45.870> gonna<00:02:46.050> bother<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.500> all

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
it's probably not gonna bother you all

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.170 
it's probably not gonna bother you all
that<00:02:46.860> much<00:02:47.100> chances<00:02:47.730> are<00:02:47.850> you're<00:02:48.030> probably

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
that much chances are you're probably

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.059 
that much chances are you're probably
gonna<00:02:48.390> put<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.630> case<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.110> or<00:02:49.319> something<00:02:49.500> or

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
gonna put a case on it or something or

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.229 
gonna put a case on it or something or
you're<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.370> not<00:02:50.519> really<00:02:50.849> going<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> notice

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
you're just not really going to notice

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.789 
you're just not really going to notice
that<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.720> wobbles<00:02:52.110> when<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.319> put<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.650> phone

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
that it wobbles when you put the phone

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.100 
that it wobbles when you put the phone
down<00:02:52.860> now<00:02:53.790> as<00:02:54.000> far<00:02:54.269> as<00:02:54.330> hardware

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
down now as far as hardware

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.900 
down now as far as hardware
this<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.560> probably<00:02:55.980> one<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.340> best<00:02:56.520> feeling

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
this is probably one of the best feeling

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.120 
this is probably one of the best feeling
phones<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.360> held<00:02:57.690> I'm<00:02:58.440> definitely<00:02:58.800> liking<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
phones I held I'm definitely liking the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.100 
phones I held I'm definitely liking the
4.7<00:02:59.760> inch<00:02:59.880> screen<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.150> another<00:03:00.600> thing<00:03:00.870> is

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
4.7 inch screen but another thing is

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.990 
4.7 inch screen but another thing is
just<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.890> quality<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.580> goes<00:03:02.820> into

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
just that the quality that goes into

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.060 
just that the quality that goes into
Apple<00:03:03.330> products<00:03:03.720> now<00:03:03.960> I<00:03:04.230> had<00:03:04.590> never<00:03:04.770> owned<00:03:04.950> an

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
Apple products now I had never owned an

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.950 
Apple products now I had never owned an
iPhone<00:03:05.400> before<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.090> haven't<00:03:06.360> really<00:03:06.780> gotten

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
iPhone before so I haven't really gotten

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.390 
iPhone before so I haven't really gotten
the<00:03:07.080> chance<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.440> use<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:07.740> for<00:03:08.190> extended

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
the chance to use it for extended

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.160 
the chance to use it for extended
periods<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.000> time<00:03:09.180> but<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.420> will<00:03:09.600> be<00:03:09.720> using<00:03:09.750> it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
periods of time but I will be using it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.680 
periods of time but I will be using it
with<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.680> one<00:03:10.890> but<00:03:11.100> overall<00:03:11.550> just<00:03:12.450> for<00:03:12.600> my

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
with this one but overall just for my

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.080 
with this one but overall just for my
first<00:03:12.930> impressions<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> very<00:03:14.580> very

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
first impressions this is a very very

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.570 
first impressions this is a very very
nice<00:03:15.420> device<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.110> hold<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.590> really<00:03:17.010> do<00:03:17.160> like<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
nice device to hold I really do like the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.770 
nice device to hold I really do like the
curved<00:03:17.790> edges<00:03:18.000> because<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.480> makes<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.720> a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
curved edges because it makes it a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.210 
curved edges because it makes it a
little<00:03:18.900> bit<00:03:19.050> easier<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.410> grip<00:03:19.710> in<00:03:19.830> your<00:03:19.860> hand

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
little bit easier to grip in your hand

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.620 
little bit easier to grip in your hand
even<00:03:20.610> though<00:03:20.760> some<00:03:21.000> people<00:03:21.209> might<00:03:21.360> think<00:03:21.390> it's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
even though some people might think it's

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.810 
even though some people might think it's
a<00:03:21.750> little<00:03:21.959> slippery<00:03:22.230> but<00:03:22.350> overall<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:23.370> the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
a little slippery but overall just the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.220 
a little slippery but overall just the
experience<00:03:24.510> when<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.720> really<00:03:24.930> hold<00:03:25.110> this

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
experience when you really hold this

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.380 
experience when you really hold this
phone<00:03:25.500> it's<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.070> really<00:03:26.280> good<00:03:26.400> one<00:03:26.610> now<00:03:27.090> on<00:03:27.270> the
