00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:10.960
 I'll leave as soon as I think 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:12.760
 As it is this late cousin has a gun 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.870
 Own head near 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.870
 I have an idea 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.240
 They should get stolen 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.830
 If so , there is no doubt a major in this neighborhood 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.060
 Don't ambush ahead 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.140
 If there is no horse ahead, it is possible 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.140
 If you penetrate Morio 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.030
 w 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.200
 The road after the forest is divided into two 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.960
 One is De' road that leads to the remains Oder 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.960
 We won't win if we get in there 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.430
 it's here 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.150
 No earth 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.150
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.000
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.950
 As it went well 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.260
 Which place is Christa and Ritter mobile equipment placed in? 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.870
 How to judge 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.870
 It will be manageable if you hear the sound of the load 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.590
 One place before the device 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.420
 Something behind 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.420
 It does not become both of the participants 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.980
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.330
 Fancy 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.769
 me 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.769
 I'm late for it 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:10.769
 ana
