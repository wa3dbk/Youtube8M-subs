00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
yeah and it's it's a pretty odd couple

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.079

in<00:00:46.679> my<00:00:46.829> opinion<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.280> mean<00:00:47.309> I'm<00:00:47.550> sure<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:47.879> have

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
in my opinion I mean I'm sure they have

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.180 
in my opinion I mean I'm sure they have
different<00:00:48.629> reasons<00:00:48.839> for<00:00:49.199> doing<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.679> but

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
different reasons for doing this but

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
different reasons for doing this but
yeah<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.760> said<00:00:50.839> this<00:00:51.839> is<00:00:51.989> really

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
yeah like you said this is really

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.450 
yeah like you said this is really
significant<00:00:52.859> and<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.039> interesting<00:00:53.280> because

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
significant and it's interesting because

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.209 
significant and it's interesting because
Saudi<00:00:54.059> Arabia<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> long<00:00:54.870> time<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.379> pretty

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
Saudi Arabia for a long time is pretty

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.520 
Saudi Arabia for a long time is pretty
well<00:00:56.579> known<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.059> being<00:00:57.089> very<00:00:57.570> anti<00:00:58.350> nuclear

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
well known for being very anti nuclear

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
well known for being very anti nuclear
weapon<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.579> don't<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.999> nuclear

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
weapon and they don't have nuclear

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
weapon and they don't have nuclear

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
weapons they never started a program and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
weapons they never started a program and
