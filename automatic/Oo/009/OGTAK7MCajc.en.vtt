00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.169
 5 days in a whole week 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.329
 we are on the wolf's footsteps in 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.770
 the mercantour massif last year 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.849
 the animal caused the death of two thousand 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.439
 five hundred sheep in the only 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.789
 department of alpes-maritimes the most 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.619
 concerned by these attacks 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.359
 to be compensated the breeders do 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.519
 call to the state agents who come 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.769
 then notice the damage reportage 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.239
 Sebastian Baer These are the crows who 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.280
 guided jacques morel to the place of 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.110
 carnage 48 hours earlier the shepherd has 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.180
 discovered four sheep carcasses 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.320
 scattered over a hundred meters 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.760
 it's the wolf because the dogs 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.379
 wandering here on the mountain one in 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.000
 bring it ten days ago that we have them 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.719
 beasts of gold and that's it you know that the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.410
 Wolf is around 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.850
 oh yes yes to the tracks in the snow I 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.039
 do not know if you used them so not 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.660
 still at least on the tr min tray 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.519
 them are there so you want you can see them 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.840
 to reach the first corpse of 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.600
 ewe you have to take a path 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.670
 stony with deep ruts then 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.239
 left the track and climb up a slope 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.210
 steep 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.700
 we're going to get the melee killed sheep are 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.410
 they are there behind them have been 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.539
 killed on the left of the big rocks of the 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.759
 wool hanging in a grove testifies 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.560
 of the struggle delivered by the sheep for 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.780
 have the tacc record the agent's 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.819
 park jacques the shepherd has placed the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.069
 shedding in a tree is 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.289
 to prevent the fox or wild boar 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.789
 they learn it and it takes more 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.709
 far like that at least when the guardian 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.270
 to make the observation is there too much to go 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.310
 eat completely managed to the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.959
 consumption is almost total I see 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.690
 the rib cage totally 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.739
 open the ecotron will manage singing of 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.250
 do this yes we can call it a 

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.660
 autopsy 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.880
 it still allows to raise the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.709
 indices of predation of bites 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.640
 hematomas of consumption that 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.649
 come into play for 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.670
 the future compensation the age was of a 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.060
 little open anyway this paw 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.209
 back 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.890
 I feel like she was a world 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:59.599
 u20 0.53 and the exploitation number 130 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.360
 157 hockey when I'm going to brand you and 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.580
 of a bombshell 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.100
 in his little kit gerard millet 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.140
 Agent Constateur has slipped 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.390
 plastic gloves and a scalpel in 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.340
 period of strong attack the man can 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.900
 achieve up to three findings per day 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.370
 we are in a room where we are in the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.230
 territory of a me which is installed there 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.390
 for a good number of years 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.770
 the parade is to return the beasts 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.490
 every night at the sheepfold but it's 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.200
 impossible 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.580
 and again and if if we get them all 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.560
 in the evening the sheepfold and after it comes 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.090
 after noon so last there were some 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.590
 day attacks at night it's too much 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.180
 cold which he comes the day a little 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.760
 higher up on the mountain an eagle 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.770
 flies away the remains of a 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.470
 other sheep there is no picture there is a 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.640
 big hole there a big hole there the crew there 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.410
 went into the skin he did his 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.020
 hole moïse bite enough classic 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.950
 we're still holes here look at that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.320
 does 1 2 3 4 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.600
 the wolf's signature is a big one 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.560
 canide safely but it's not me 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.030
 who will say that it is the wolf who has 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.370
 do that it's not my role it's 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.780
 find out the decision she's made by 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.730
 the authorities that will decide and 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.840
 decide on compensation or not but 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.239
 I'm not hiding that in a case like 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.970
 it seems obvious what the main 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.769
 it's all about finding them because 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.299
 the problem is that if you are too 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.200
 port is not compensated first well 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.190
 we find it because it is too much 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.930
 heavy but there we are too violent 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.900
 because he takes her and we do not find him 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.660
 that's really the dry loss that makes 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.769
 how many amended a cac to 4 killed and 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.470
 two wounded 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.299
 if he believes the carcasses are left 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.790
 on the spot abandoned to scavengers 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.590
 the shepherd will receive from 100 to 200 euros 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.730
 allowances per sheep according to their 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.950
 category 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.510
 last year the state to pay 2 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.340
 millions of euros to compensate 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.290
