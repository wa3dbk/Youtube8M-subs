Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.200
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the Surface Element Terminal Block Kit on

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
your range.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.871
Really easy job; all we’re going to need
is a quarter inch nut driver, pair of wire

00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:15.900
cutters, pair of needle nose pliers, and a
roll of electrical tape.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.949
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.970
Now before we begin this repair the first
thing that we’re going to want to do is

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.580
disconnect the power to the range.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.179
If it has a cord on it simply disconnect that
from the receptacle; if it’s a hard-wired

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.750
range we’ll need to locate the breakers
and turn those off.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.440
Next we’ll want to pull the range our far
enough that you can access the side of the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.890
terminal block that you’re going to replace.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.200
It’s a little easier if you have access
from the side.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:55.570
Next we’ll remove the element, set that
aside; and the drip bowl.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.539
Then we’ll remove the one quarter inch hex
head screw that secures the terminal block

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.270
to the main top.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.500
Then we’re ready to lift the main top.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:27.760
Remove anything that is on the top, set them
aside.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:38.530
Let the hood props lock in place, and with
a pair of wire cutters we’re just going

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.610
to snip two wires to the terminal block as
close to the block as possible.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.550
Discard the old terminal block.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:56.180
Now for the front burner we’ll need to pull
the wire out of the channel that runs along

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.680
the side to give ourselves a little bit of
play there.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:13.400
Next we’ll take our new terminal block,
just lay it in place.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:25.220
Then we’ll cut about six inches of electrical
tape there; we’re going to tape the two

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.250
wires from the new terminal to the two wires
from the old one.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:45.020
Make sure you adequately tape up the leading
edge where the terminals are.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.000
Next we’ll remove some screws from the back
panel and we’ll pull that wire through;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.380
make sure to pull both of the wire channel
holders so it has room to slide freely.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:08.600
We’ll remove six screws from the upper portion
of the back panel: three along each side,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:16.900
and there is one remaining one on the top
through a little mounting bracket.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:31.280
Just tilt the little mounting bracket out.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.640
And now we have access to the control.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.860
Next we’ll locate the two wires where they
come into the control panel, there’s a hole

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.010
there about three quarters of an inch in diameter.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:54.760
We’re slowly going to pull those through
that opening.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:04.040
We’ll remove the tape we put on it.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.060
And then we’ll remove those two wires from
the terminal block from the appropriate switch,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.940
exchanging one wire for wire.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.910
If they’re a little snug you can use a pair
of needle nose pliers to pull those terminals

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.130
off.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.080
Discard the old wires.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:40.521
Next we’ll make sure that the wires to the
new terminal block are fastened to the wire

00:04:40.521 --> 00:04:43.510
holders along the side channel.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.650
Make sure to give yourself enough slack.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:05:01.830
Then we’ll mount the new terminal block
to the main top with the single screw.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:14.510
Before we lower the top just double check
and make sure no wires have become pinched.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:43.870
Release the prop rods, and replace both the
drip bowl and the element.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:50.070
And next we’ll replace the back panel.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:06:07.490
We’ll start with the top screw and mounting
bracket.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.340
Take caution that you don’t over tighten
the screws in the back panel; you don’t

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:20.370
want to strip any of these screw openings.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:27.240
Now we’re ready to reconnect the power,
check the control make sure the element heats

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.760
properly, and our repair is complete.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.770
Told you it was an easy job.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.330
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
