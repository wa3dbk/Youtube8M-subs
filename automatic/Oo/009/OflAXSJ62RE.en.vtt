keep pouring it in all of it gives a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.850 
keep pouring it in all of it gives a
nice<00:02:41.600> soft<00:02:42.600> mix<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.080> don't<00:02:43.260> want<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.530> beat<00:02:43.830> it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
just strain this into some sort of jug

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.250 
just strain this into some sort of jug
now<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.150> want<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.450> get<00:02:54.540> rid<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.690> these<00:02:54.870> bubbles

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
now we want to get rid of these bubbles

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.610 
now we want to get rid of these bubbles
so<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:59.790> will<00:02:59.940> work<00:03:00.060> beautifully<00:03:00.470> if<00:03:01.470> you've

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
now get some sort of tray that can go in

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.660 
now get some sort of tray that can go in
the<00:03:10.080> oven<00:03:10.370> get<00:03:11.370> some<00:03:11.580> ramekins<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:13.250> then<00:03:14.250> pour

this<00:03:15.180> straight<00:03:15.960> into<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.500> ramekins<00:03:19.550> almost

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
this straight into the ramekins almost

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.810 
this straight into the ramekins almost
to<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.820> top<00:03:21.000> not<00:03:21.540> quite<00:03:22.220> just<00:03:23.220> about<00:03:23.550> there

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
to the top not quite just about there

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.300

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.249 

that's<00:05:29.050> enough<00:05:29.289> to<00:05:29.470> start<00:05:29.710> for<00:05:29.949> that<00:05:30.069> one<00:05:31.259> want

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
that's enough to start for that one want

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.409 
that's enough to start for that one want
to<00:05:32.319> do<00:05:32.439> it<00:05:32.560> so<00:05:32.770> it's<00:05:32.919> just<00:05:33.159> slightly<00:05:33.909> stained

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
to do it so it's just slightly stained

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.709 
to do it so it's just slightly stained
to<00:05:34.569> caramelize<00:05:35.050> so<00:05:35.349> it<00:05:35.620> will<00:05:35.770> just<00:05:36.539> harden<00:05:37.539> a

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
to caramelize so it will just harden a

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:43.100 
to caramelize so it will just harden a
little<00:05:38.199> bit<00:05:40.800> there<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.949> go

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
little bit there you go

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.230

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
now leave that like that for about 20 to

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.450 
now leave that like that for about 20 to
30<00:05:46.479> seconds<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.199> then<00:05:48.129> we'll<00:05:48.250> give<00:05:48.430> it

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
30 seconds and then we'll give it

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.429 
30 seconds and then we'll give it
