00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.730 
you'll see that when it comes out but
I'm<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.220> actually<00:01:29.369> upload<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
I'm going to actually upload I think a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.819 
I'm going to actually upload I think a
tester<00:01:32.030> was<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> good<00:01:33.270> quality<00:01:33.570> test<00:01:33.840> cuz<00:01:34.770> i

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
tester was a good quality test cuz i

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.289 
tester was a good quality test cuz i
have<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> capture<00:01:35.280> card<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.700> pretty<00:01:36.060> bad

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
have a capture card but it's pretty bad

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.510 
have a capture card but it's pretty bad
i<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.799> i'll<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.130> some<00:01:38.280> random

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
i think so i'll just do some random

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.679 
i think so i'll just do some random
black<00:01:38.640> ops<00:01:38.850> clip<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:41.299> i'll<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.600> how

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
black ops clip and i'll just see how

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.760 
black ops clip and i'll just see how
isn't<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.259> it'll<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.649> 30

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
isn't what you know it'll be like 30

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.620 
isn't what you know it'll be like 30
seconds<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.250> something<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.390> would<00:01:45.479> be

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
seconds or something and that would be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.469 
seconds or something and that would be
for<00:01:45.840> quality<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.369> if<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.759> really

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
for quality and if it's really really

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.319 
for quality and if it's really really
bad<00:01:48.890> which<00:01:49.890> i'm<00:01:50.720> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.899> assume<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
bad which i'm going to assume it is I
