00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
important to remember that a plane will

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.809 
important to remember that a plane will
stall<00:03:00.659> when<00:03:01.260> gliding<00:03:01.799> just<00:03:02.129> as<00:03:02.340> easily<00:03:02.549> as

as<00:04:35.789> we<00:04:35.940> call<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.419> absent

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.630 

so<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.410> rush<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.740> air<00:04:41.950> past<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.460> control

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
so the rush of air past the control

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.700 
so the rush of air past the control
surfaces<00:04:43.360> is<00:04:43.570> less<00:04:43.870> than<00:04:44.050> in<00:04:44.200> power<00:04:44.440> flight

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
surfaces is less than in power flight

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.460 
surfaces is less than in power flight
that<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.640> why<00:04:46.000> in<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.330> glide<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.930> takes<00:04:47.230> more

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
that is why in a glide it takes more

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.710 
that is why in a glide it takes more
motion<00:04:47.890> of<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.130> stick<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.580> pedals<00:04:49.210> to

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
motion of the stick and pedals to

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.540 
motion of the stick and pedals to
produce<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.260> same<00:04:50.470> effect<00:04:50.860> as<00:04:51.010> in<00:04:51.310> power

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
produce the same effect as in power

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:03.820 
produce the same effect as in power
flight

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.100 

as<00:05:04.310> we<00:05:04.580> said<00:05:04.790> earlier<00:05:05.000> when<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.600> plane<00:05:05.810> is<00:05:05.990> at

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
as we said earlier when the plane is at

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.230

the proper height above ground the pilot

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.270 
the proper height above ground the pilot
must<00:05:08.450> begin<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:08.900> lift<00:05:09.230> the<00:05:09.320> nose<00:05:09.560> so<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:09.920> plane

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
must begin to lift the nose so the plane

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.100 
must begin to lift the nose so the plane
will<00:05:10.460> be<00:05:10.490> flying<00:05:10.820> level<00:05:11.240> when<00:05:11.390> slightly<00:05:11.810> above

three-point landing of course we have to

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.730 
three-point landing of course we have to
learn<00:05:53.000> just<00:05:53.450> when<00:05:53.660> to<00:05:53.810> start<00:05:54.170> leveling<00:05:54.620> the

the landing gear this causes the plane

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.220 
the landing gear this causes the plane
to<00:06:04.220> bounce<00:06:04.490> and<00:06:04.820> it<00:06:05.210> is<00:06:05.360> then<00:06:05.570> difficult<00:06:06.110> to

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
to bounce and it is then difficult to

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.110 
to bounce and it is then difficult to
control<00:06:08.590> if<00:06:09.590> we<00:06:09.890> start<00:06:10.190> leveling<00:06:10.610> too<00:06:10.820> soon

the<00:06:19.040> plane<00:06:19.250> properly<00:06:19.730> takes<00:06:20.000> much<00:06:20.270> practice

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
the plane properly takes much practice

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.780 
the plane properly takes much practice
and<00:06:20.990> even<00:06:21.290> then<00:06:21.620> we<00:06:21.800> must<00:06:21.980> give<00:06:22.190> our<00:06:22.370> entire

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
and even then we must give our entire

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.320 
and even then we must give our entire
attention<00:06:23.150> to<00:06:23.420> it<00:06:27.490> here<00:06:28.490> is<00:06:28.640> a<00:06:28.670> student<00:06:28.970> pilot

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
attention to it here is a student pilot

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.930 
attention to it here is a student pilot
about<00:06:29.690> to<00:06:29.870> land<00:06:30.080> he<00:06:30.770> does<00:06:30.980> not<00:06:31.160> level<00:06:31.520> off<00:06:31.670> soon

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
about to land he does not level off soon

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.970 
about to land he does not level off soon
enough<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:32.900> front<00:06:33.170> wheels<00:06:33.410> strike<00:06:33.800> the

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
enough the front wheels strike the

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.400 
enough the front wheels strike the
ground<00:06:34.220> too<00:06:34.610> early<00:06:35.000> and<00:06:35.270> the<00:06:35.570> plane<00:06:35.810> bounces

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
ground too early and the plane bounces

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.960 
ground too early and the plane bounces
making<00:06:36.800> it<00:06:36.920> difficult<00:06:37.100> for<00:06:37.430> the<00:06:37.610> pilot<00:06:37.940> to

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
making it difficult for the pilot to

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:44.749 
making it difficult for the pilot to
regain<00:06:38.330> control

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.279 

another<00:06:45.759> thing<00:06:46.029> to<00:06:46.180> remember<00:06:46.210> about<00:06:46.629> landing

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
another thing to remember about landing

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:48.929 
another thing to remember about landing
is<00:06:47.439> that<00:06:47.619> when<00:06:47.830> the<00:06:47.979> plane<00:06:48.219> has<00:06:48.490> finally

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:48.939 
is that when the plane has finally

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:50.399 
is that when the plane has finally
settled<00:06:49.180> to<00:06:49.360> the<00:06:49.419> ground<00:06:49.719> you<00:06:50.289> must

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409 
settled to the ground you must

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.200 
settled to the ground you must
immediately<00:06:50.710> pull<00:06:51.249> the<00:06:51.399> stick<00:06:51.669> all<00:06:51.879> the<00:06:52.089> way

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
immediately pull the stick all the way

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.629 
immediately pull the stick all the way
back<00:06:52.449> and<00:06:52.689> hold<00:06:52.899> it<00:06:53.050> back<00:06:53.259> this<00:06:54.069> holds<00:06:54.520> the

back and hold it back this holds the

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.850 
back and hold it back this holds the
tail<00:06:54.849> down<00:06:55.180> and<00:06:55.240> avoids<00:06:55.809> any<00:06:56.110> tendency<00:06:56.529> of<00:06:56.710> the
