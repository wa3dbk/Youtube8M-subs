00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
like Sonic Colors with Islamic hat I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.560 
like Sonic Colors with Islamic hat I
mean<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.880> stuff<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.450> this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570

awesome

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.639 
awesome
so<00:02:01.670> what<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.790> gave<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.450> banana<00:02:04.079> pouch<00:02:04.290> for

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
so what they gave is a banana pouch for

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.889 
so what they gave is a banana pouch for
the<00:02:04.890> Wiimote<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.729> I'm<00:02:06.360> talking<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.630> Country

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the Wiimote and I'm talking on Country

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.510 
the Wiimote and I'm talking on Country
Returns<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.560> it

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
Returns on it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.570 
Returns on it
which<00:02:09.120> is<00:02:09.240> pretty<00:02:09.360> cool<00:02:09.480> so<00:02:09.870> you<00:02:09.930> basically

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
which is pretty cool so you basically

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.140 
which is pretty cool so you basically
unzip<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.730> here<00:02:11.940> oops<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.780> there<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.590> go

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
unzip it here oops it's the there you go

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.090 
unzip it here oops it's the there you go
and<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.170> big<00:02:16.320> question<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.830> does<00:02:17.070> it

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
and I think the big question is does it

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.810 
and I think the big question is does it
fit<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.700> wiimote<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.560> grip<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
fit a wiimote with the grip on it the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.480 
fit a wiimote with the grip on it the
answer<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.960> yes<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.470> does<00:02:22.650> as<00:02:22.950> a

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
answer to that is yes it does as a

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.390 
answer to that is yes it does as a
matter<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.760> fact<00:02:24.000> if<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.900> see<00:02:25.310> ok<00:02:26.310> I'll

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
matter of fact if you can see ok I'll

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800 
matter of fact if you can see ok I'll
close<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.910> as<00:02:27.090> much<00:02:27.180> as<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.420> can

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
close it up as much as I can

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.230 
close it up as much as I can
first<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.580> if<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.760> push<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.060> down

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
first as you can see if I push it down

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.450 
first as you can see if I push it down
as<00:02:30.510> far<00:02:30.660> as<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.840> can<00:02:30.900> there's<00:02:31.590> actually<00:02:32.070> room

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
as far as I can there's actually room

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.180 
as far as I can there's actually room
here<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:33.140> Wii<00:02:34.140> MotionPlus<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.980> don't

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
here for Wii MotionPlus if you don't

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.640 
here for Wii MotionPlus if you don't
have<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.460> Wii<00:02:35.580> Motion<00:02:35.880> Plus<00:02:36.540> remote<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.620> you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
have the Wii Motion Plus remote so you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.960 
have the Wii Motion Plus remote so you
could<00:02:37.950> probably<00:02:38.070> fit<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.430> with<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.580> normal<00:02:38.940> one

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
could probably fit it with a normal one

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.850 
could probably fit it with a normal one
seal<00:02:39.180> which<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.420> pretty<00:02:39.540> cool<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.680> if<00:02:40.740> you're

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
seal which is pretty cool so if you're

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.380 
seal which is pretty cool so if you're
ever<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.220> know<00:02:41.340> if<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.790> ever<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.300> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
like to bring your stats you can bring

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.210

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.470 
it over with a friend's house and pack
it<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.490> this<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.820> attach<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.270> keychain

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
it like this and attach it to a keychain

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.270 
it like this and attach it to a keychain
so<00:02:49.410> that's<00:02:49.560> pretty<00:02:49.710> much<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.920> for<00:02:50.190> this

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
so that's pretty much it for this
