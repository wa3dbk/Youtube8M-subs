00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
paintings by having people do to do well

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
paintings by having people do to do well
I<00:00:51.480> think<00:00:51.600> anybody<00:00:52.050> who<00:00:52.230> creates<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.829> photograph

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
I think anybody who creates a photograph

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.520 
I think anybody who creates a photograph
rather<00:00:53.489> than<00:00:53.699> takes<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.239> photograph<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
rather than takes a photograph is a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.920 
rather than takes a photograph is a
director<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.730> some<00:00:56.969> people<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.420> more

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
director and just some people are more

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.779 
director and just some people are more
animated<00:00:58.379> than<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> direction<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> others

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
animated than the direction and others

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
animated than the direction and others
are<00:00:59.969> less<00:01:00.180> animated<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.020> tend<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.590> fall<00:01:01.800> more<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
are less animated I tend to fall more in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.889 
are less animated I tend to fall more in
the<00:01:02.160> animated<00:01:02.489> side<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> things<00:01:03.090> John<00:01:03.719> any

day's worth of charge out of the seven
bees<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> next<00:01:25.920> six<00:01:26.070> days<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> deal

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
bees in the next six days I had a deal

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.539 
bees in the next six days I had a deal
with<00:01:27.110> existing<00:01:28.110> light<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:28.799> my<00:01:28.979> shots<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
with existing light for all my shots and

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
with existing light for all my shots and
so<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> first<00:01:30.600> thing<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> comes<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> mind<00:01:31.290> is

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so the first thing that comes to mind is

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.130 
so the first thing that comes to mind is
that<00:01:32.150> supplemental<00:01:33.150> lighting<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.810> me<00:01:33.930> is

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that supplemental lighting for me is

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.390
