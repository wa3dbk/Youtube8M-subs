tutorial that I just did and basically I

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.029 
tutorial that I just did and basically I

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.279 
just use a cotton swab or like a q-tip
and<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.849> get<00:00:23.029> it<00:00:23.240> in<00:00:23.449> some<00:00:23.689> nail<00:00:23.960> polish<00:00:24.140> remover

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
and I get it in some nail polish remover

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.499 
and I get it in some nail polish remover
and<00:00:26.439> I<00:00:27.439> just<00:00:27.650> wipe<00:00:28.070> it<00:00:28.189> off<00:00:28.310> it's<00:00:29.090> kind<00:00:29.240> of<00:00:29.359> it

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
and I just wipe it off it's kind of it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.439 
and I just wipe it off it's kind of it
for<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.470> plates<00:00:30.740> if<00:00:31.070> I<00:00:31.279> have<00:00:31.490> a<00:00:31.759> circular

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
for the plates if I have a circular

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.079 
for the plates if I have a circular
cotton<00:00:33.019> pad<00:00:33.199> handy<00:00:33.470> or<00:00:33.860> like<00:00:34.309> a<00:00:34.339> square<00:00:34.850> one

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:35.089 
cotton pad handy or like a square one

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:37.270 
cotton pad handy or like a square one
whatever<00:00:35.420> one<00:00:36.019> of<00:00:36.140> those<00:00:36.260> instead<00:00:36.620> i'll<00:00:36.920> use

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
whatever one of those instead i'll use

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.530 
whatever one of those instead i'll use
that<00:00:37.309> because<00:00:37.699> it's<00:00:37.790> a<00:00:37.850> little<00:00:38.030> easier<00:00:38.210> just

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
that because it's a little easier just

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:47.259 
that because it's a little easier just
because<00:00:38.750> it<00:00:38.870> covers<00:00:38.989> more<00:00:39.260> area<00:00:39.850> but<00:00:46.089> and<00:00:47.089> then

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
because it covers more area but and then

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:48.340 
because it covers more area but and then
hopefully<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:47.690> don't<00:00:47.750> have<00:00:47.900> to<00:00:47.989> do<00:00:48.049> it<00:00:48.170> twice

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
hopefully you don't have to do it twice

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.020 
hopefully you don't have to do it twice
like<00:00:48.830> I<00:00:48.979> am<00:00:49.100> right<00:00:49.129> now<00:00:49.400> because<00:00:49.670> it's<00:00:49.790> kind<00:00:49.940> of

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
like I am right now because it's kind of

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.430 
like I am right now because it's kind of
just<00:00:50.180> spreading<00:00:50.659> all<00:00:50.900> over<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.229> place

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
just spreading all over the place

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:03.610 
just spreading all over the place
instead<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:51.949> actually<00:00:52.489> cleaning<00:00:56.379> all<00:00:57.379> right

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.770

it starts to pile up really bad then

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.350 
it starts to pile up really bad then
I'll<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:46.160> know<00:01:46.220> try<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.610> clean<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.789> up<00:01:47.000> but

I'll you know try and clean it up but
for<00:01:48.020> now<00:01:48.140> it's<00:01:48.350> fine<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.880> same<00:01:50.060> thing<00:01:50.270> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
for now it's fine and the same thing and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.090 
for now it's fine and the same thing and
when<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.810> have<00:01:51.020> lots<00:01:51.200> of<00:01:51.320> goopy<00:01:51.679> stuff<00:01:51.710> there<00:01:52.070> I

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
when I have lots of goopy stuff there I

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.330 
when I have lots of goopy stuff there I
try<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:52.460> pull<00:01:52.700> my<00:01:53.210> q-tip<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:55.100> direction
