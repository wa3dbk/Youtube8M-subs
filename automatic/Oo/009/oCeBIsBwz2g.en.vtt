00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
what I didn't like so also I did a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.140 
what I didn't like so also I did a
limited<00:02:10.860> amount<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.220> research<00:02:11.519> behind<00:02:11.849> this

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
limited amount of research behind this

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.059 
limited amount of research behind this

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.000 
of this movie from how it aired in Japan

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.369 
and apparently there's some people who
were<00:02:20.069> really<00:02:20.220> ticked<00:02:20.670> off<00:02:20.849> about<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.720> it

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
were really ticked off about this but it

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.080 
were really ticked off about this but it
was<00:02:22.470> from<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.129> understand<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.849> was<00:02:23.939> all

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
was from what I understand it was all

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.210 
was from what I understand it was all
set<00:02:24.450> up<00:02:24.480> stuff<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.349> didn't<00:02:25.709> really<00:02:25.950> know

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
set up stuff and I didn't really know

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.920 
set up stuff and I didn't really know
sit<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:26.640> much<00:02:26.850> yeah<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.360> film<00:02:27.570> kind<00:02:27.810> of

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
sit that much yeah the film kind of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.220 
sit that much yeah the film kind of
jumped<00:02:28.320> right<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.950> stuff<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.510> I'd<00:02:30.930> kind<00:02:31.200> of

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
jumped right in to stuff but I'd kind of

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.740 
jumped right in to stuff but I'd kind of
like<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.680> didn't<00:02:32.040> think<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.480> was

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
like that I didn't think that it was

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.750 
like that I didn't think that it was
missing<00:02:34.170> much<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.890> they<00:02:35.040> chopped<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.580> out

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
missing much that they chopped that out

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.940 
missing much that they chopped that out
but<00:02:36.570> just<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.110> know<00:02:37.230> there's<00:02:37.680> some<00:02:37.830> people

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
but just so you know there's some people

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.000 
but just so you know there's some people
who<00:02:38.190> are<00:02:38.250> upset<00:02:38.400> about<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:39.440> it's<00:02:40.440> okay

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
who are upset about that it's okay

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.160 
who are upset about that it's okay
so<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.400> movie<00:02:41.670> starts<00:02:42.090> out<00:02:42.270> as<00:02:42.510> always<00:02:43.020> with

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
so the movie starts out as always with

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.840 
so the movie starts out as always with
our<00:02:43.200> heroes<00:02:43.680> they're<00:02:44.310> trying<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> get<00:02:44.790> to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
of like ditto it used illusion so it

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.500

there's a fight the group tries to stop
would<00:06:53.520> I<00:06:53.640> there's<00:06:54.360> this<00:06:54.540> big<00:06:54.810> tease<00:06:55.170> where<00:06:55.620> it

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
would I there's this big tease where it

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.040 
would I there's this big tease where it
looks<00:06:55.980> like<00:06:56.130> code<00:06:56.580> I<00:06:56.760> was<00:06:57.090> one<00:06:57.390> but<00:06:57.720> it's<00:06:57.900> all

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
looks like code I was one but it's all

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.310 
looks like code I was one but it's all
just<00:06:58.560> an<00:06:58.710> illusion<00:06:58.980> created<00:06:59.400> by<00:06:59.670> zoroark<00:07:00.390> then

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
just an illusion created by zoroark then

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.500 
just an illusion created by zoroark then
for<00:07:01.620> some<00:07:01.830> reason<00:07:02.250> instead<00:07:02.400> of<00:07:02.700> code<00:07:02.910> I<00:07:03.030> trying

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510 
for some reason instead of code I trying

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.360 
for some reason instead of code I trying
again<00:07:03.720> to<00:07:04.050> touch<00:07:04.260> the<00:07:04.500> time<00:07:04.710> ripple<00:07:05.070> which<00:07:05.220> is

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
again to touch the time ripple which is

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.400 
again to touch the time ripple which is
still<00:07:05.640> just<00:07:05.820> like<00:07:06.030> a<00:07:06.060> few<00:07:06.300> yards<00:07:06.660> away<00:07:06.780> he

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 
still just like a few yards away he

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.310 
still just like a few yards away he
flips<00:07:07.770> out<00:07:07.980> and<00:07:08.040> goes<00:07:08.400> after<00:07:08.640> zoroark<00:07:09.420> you

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
flips out and goes after zoroark you

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.350 
flips out and goes after zoroark you
know<00:07:10.410> and<00:07:10.680> it's<00:07:10.830> clearly<00:07:11.250> not<00:07:11.580> you<00:07:11.970> know<00:07:12.090> at

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
know and it's clearly not you know at

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.120 
know and it's clearly not you know at
the<00:07:12.570> peak<00:07:12.810> of<00:07:12.960> health<00:07:13.200> it's<00:07:13.470> clearly<00:07:13.740> not<00:07:13.980> at

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
the peak of health it's clearly not at

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.990 
the peak of health it's clearly not at
100%<00:07:14.580> so<00:07:15.540> I<00:07:15.570> didn't<00:07:15.930> get<00:07:16.080> that<00:07:16.260> but<00:07:17.000> stuff

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
100% so I didn't get that but stuff

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.040 
100% so I didn't get that but stuff
happens<00:07:18.030> code<00:07:18.840> I<00:07:18.960> goes<00:07:19.230> down<00:07:19.530> roll<00:07:20.520> curtains

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
happens code I goes down roll curtains

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.400 
happens code I goes down roll curtains
that's<00:07:22.050> basically<00:07:22.740> the<00:07:22.920> plot<00:07:23.130> of<00:07:23.280> this<00:07:23.340> movie
