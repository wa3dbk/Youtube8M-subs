00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 and then the story of blu ray plus dvd 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.000
 of the new robocop by josé padilha is a 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.799
 bit like this until the end you go 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.049
 know dead or alive account 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.480
 You come with me but I think a poor one. 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.730
 They're back with one more thing today. 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.140
 we launch the DVD release and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.210
 robocop blu ray and robocop make 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.140
 directed by the Brazilian josé padilha 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.529
 that arrives at the stores today 25 of June 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.600
 is already available for you to have your 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.070
 robocop inversion of the king and law for 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.170
 have that movie at home 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.020
 here we have a very cool collection 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.750
 what is the robocop quadrilogy the trilogy 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 original plus the remake all together 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.570
 will also be available in stores 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.820
 You're going to talk a little bit about what? 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.579
 made with these versions here first 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.170
 soon there are original robocop and much 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.030
 very very much 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 robocop became the classic movie 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.250
 The action movie that says a lot 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.199
 well what it was the filmmaker's vision 80 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.449
 And there's a lot of cool stuff here. 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.189
 the one that was already in the old dvd version 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.320
 You probably already know you. 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.090
 have a dvd but have some extras in 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.619
 highlight a chat between production 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.360
 the writers 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.670
 the director paul verhoeven and even a 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.500
 tire she did the robocop 1 and 2 are 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.420
 this chat is very interesting 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.100
 very fun to watch because it 's a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.110
 today's vision of how the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.090
 robocop with the influence of the new pop 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.890
 can be seen today as interesting for 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.689
 you see the original movie now in high 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.460
 definition is interesting but myself 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.530
 that some special effects begin to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.360
 be very upset because that time 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.549
 we had digital scene effects 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.900
 are all painted was to use the technique of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.509
 stop motion that was an articulated doll 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.220
 where you frame the picture via him 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.110
 make the illusion of movement and even 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.790
 the makeup or behind the robocop that are 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.290
 fantastic timing can be 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.360
 seen as something done by her 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.759
 does it and metal but in HD do you get to see 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.490
 that putin plans to drunk but nothing that 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.990
 I made a spectacular film conical film and 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.520
 that made the head of many people this 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.820
 here on this blog you too 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 find robocop 2 and 143 go to 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.969
 few 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.549
 unfortunately robocop 2 and 3 versions 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.619
 include no extras for the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.840
 you will find is the movie trailer 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.950
 that there is nothing more and we have the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.330
 voiceovers too 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.040
 remembering the bases are the various 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.260
 Classics did not reheat any clouds 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.760
 which is good on one hand and bad for good 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.470
 because you have that feeling of 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.500
 to watch again in the afternoon session 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.260
 bad because the gop two have an error 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.630
 dubbing which is inadmissible and has 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.040
 perpetuated in the selection of cope people 2 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.140
 villains are villain 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.239
 It 's a serious problem for me because I 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.099
 child is asking to screw the movie only 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.870
 Spielberg manages to put the child in 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.510
 movie good and a boy robocop 2 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.640
 he changes his voice twice during the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.410
 he has three players and that is 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.069
 very aggressive if you see the movie 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.780
 dubbed 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.760
 How does the brat change his voice three? 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.010
 sometimes takes a look can not take away 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.010
 a child who tim k 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.180
 Unfortunately it has not been fixed. 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.030
 simply transposed the audio from a 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.640
 film for the other of the dvd and blu ray e 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.220
 this proves more and more robocop 2 and a 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.500
 top three are on low it simply 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.360
 do not consider an important film 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.610
 because there are none there is no 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.380
 trying to do is a different thing 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.060
 to promote a coup two and three in the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.970
 Blu-ray version including the menus are 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.260
 between each other was then made 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.150
 one thing no hurry in the rush 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.040
 to launch in bancoc two have very 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.139
 specials but will drop a bit of 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.530
 exaggeration that goes beyond what the people 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.420
 thought of the exaggeration is brutal glory of 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.959
 robocop and at first I do not exaggerate my 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.670
 too much comedy and the safe in the 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.380
 bottles child knows the robocop beyond 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.299
 little thing that will arrive at 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.400
 Robocop limit 3o canso to say this 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.290
 here on channel 3 is an excuse to 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.670
 sell the nec me in this interview that has 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.200
 robocop 1 extra in 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.959
 the people say something very interesting 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.540
 that we make a cup had three 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.400
 grenades three rules of a robocop wii 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.230
 I could not move the robocop girl. 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.730
 I could talk on the phone and a glass or not 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.250
 could fly and he said that unfortunately 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.260
 laws things are done in block 3 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.030
 just remembering that whoever heard the idea 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.829
 of frank miller but the flexibilization of 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.959
 production after the coup 2 and complained 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.060
 who stole a lot of ideas 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.280
 him in the film and even makes the tip and 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.079
 robocop 2 93 for her but the exchange of 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.239
 ideas and an attempt to leave the 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.280
 robocop censorship free to sell on 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.289
 fifth child ended up being that movie 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.130
 that we would not want it done 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.290
 that way 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.450
 but you also have a fourth movie 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.090
 robocop series and half josé padilha that I 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.180
 had already done or saw 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.220
 I found it very cool and reviewing the movie I 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.410
 I just have to say that it really is a 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.360
 very cool very cool movie by 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.940
 all those reasons will not be for the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.560
 current generation that was in 1987 by 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.050
 several reasons explaining my 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.180
 critical but does not filter the 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.650
 extras too cool too 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.930
 interesting how a movie was made 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.720
 how did the digital question come as 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.130
 they bent machines to guns 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.330
 so there's a lot that explained 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.790
 some doubts I had in my 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.470
 critic also marks the quinton he speaks 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.850
 a very cool thing in the extras that 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.200
 marks the fifth to be another year of a 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.970
 charisma that was also using a 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.680
 black clothes a black armor 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.240
 similar to the one he used when he 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.130
 Batman made just want it made of 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.870
 Batman did not have all the technology 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.880
 have today they say that they had a vest 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.860
 cooler under body clothing 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.480
 not to dehydrate much and the case 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.460
 majority had none of this is their 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.830
 tree inside it and what was then 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.260
 year robocop to you do not know what it is 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.600
 I went through the kitchen 90 he arrived 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.010
 to be boring and also interview with 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.300
 josé padilha saying that he came to 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.530
 The idea of the film is that he 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.100
 studios to put ideas into 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.900
 practice 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.210
 so its a cool tip if you like 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.770
 the robocop trilogy if you like 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.600
