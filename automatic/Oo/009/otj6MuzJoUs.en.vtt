ever seen on a high grade gundam set of

what's<00:01:43.009> great<00:01:43.190> about<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.580> is<00:01:43.819> that<00:01:44.030> of

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
what's great about this is that of

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.150 
what's great about this is that of
course<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.509> O<00:01:44.539> Gundam<00:01:44.899> only<00:01:45.080> uses<00:01:45.380> one<00:01:45.590> but

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
course the O Gundam only uses one but

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.340 
course the O Gundam only uses one but
you<00:01:46.280> can<00:01:46.429> give<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.729> other<00:01:46.910> one<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.959> Exia

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
you can give the other one to the Exia

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.520

r2<00:01:49.179> for<00:01:50.179> stickers<00:01:50.630> are<00:01:50.840> going<00:01:50.959> to<00:01:51.020> get<00:01:51.170> just<00:01:51.410> a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
r2 for stickers are going to get just a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.010 
r2 for stickers are going to get just a
simple<00:01:51.860> set<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.130> eyes<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.300> goes<00:01:53.569> in<00:01:53.869> the

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
simple set of eyes and this goes in the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.690 
simple set of eyes and this goes in the
middle<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.470> green<00:01:54.740> section<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.429> chest

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
middle of the green section on the chest

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.699 
middle of the green section on the chest
but<00:01:56.270> if<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.479> paint<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:56.869> then<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:57.470> can<00:01:57.619> get

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
but if you paint that then you can get

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.499 
but if you paint that then you can get
away<00:01:57.800> with<00:01:58.039> that<00:01:58.190> as<00:01:58.910> far<00:01:59.090> as<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.270> manual

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
away with that as far as the manual

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.749 
away with that as far as the manual
itself<00:01:59.869> it's<00:02:00.350> basically<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.039> redo<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
itself it's basically a redo of the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.020 
itself it's basically a redo of the
cover<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.300> I<00:02:03.050> really<00:02:03.950> like<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.310> old<00:02:04.580> style

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
cover and I really like this old style

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.020 
cover and I really like this old style
line<00:02:05.420> art<00:02:05.660> it<00:02:05.899> looks<00:02:05.959> very<00:02:06.590> very<00:02:07.030> original

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
line art it looks very very original

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
this front armor it's not independent

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.539 
this front armor it's not independent
the<00:03:55.349> left<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.769> right<00:03:55.949> you<00:03:56.099> have<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.400> move

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
the left and the right you have to move

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.039 
the left and the right you have to move
them<00:03:56.699> together<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.239> if<00:03:57.359> you<00:03:57.449> have<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.689> one<00:03:57.840> leg

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
them together so if you have the one leg

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.719 
them together so if you have the one leg
forward<00:03:58.349> you<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.979> pull<00:03:59.099> up<00:03:59.129> this<00:03:59.430> skirt

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
forward you have to pull up this skirt

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.809 
forward you have to pull up this skirt
armor<00:04:00.060> as<00:04:00.239> well<00:04:00.629> the<00:04:01.439> back<00:04:01.620> over<00:04:01.859> here<00:04:02.159> nothing

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
armor as well the back over here nothing

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.550 
armor as well the back over here nothing
too<00:04:02.849> much<00:04:03.239> but<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.780> yellow<00:04:04.049> stands<00:04:04.319> out

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
too much but the yellow stands out

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.189 
too much but the yellow stands out
pretty<00:04:04.949> well<00:04:05.209> as<00:04:06.209> far<00:04:06.269> as<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.689> chest<00:04:06.930> goes

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
pretty well as far as the chest goes

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.929 
pretty well as far as the chest goes
it's<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.859> nice<00:04:08.069> start<00:04:08.310> at<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.639> bottom<00:04:08.759> that

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
it's a nice start at the bottom that

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.999 
it's a nice start at the bottom that
this<00:04:09.359> red<00:04:09.659> piece<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.290> doesn't<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.769> lot<00:04:10.979> of

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:11.009 
this red piece it doesn't have a lot of

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.429 
this red piece it doesn't have a lot of
flexibility<00:04:11.609> but<00:04:12.269> you<00:04:12.449> can<00:04:12.629> still<00:04:12.870> move<00:04:13.049> it<00:04:13.259> so

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
flexibility but you can still move it so

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.780 
flexibility but you can still move it so
you<00:04:13.469> can<00:04:13.739> get<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:14.009> chest<00:04:14.189> to<00:04:14.340> move<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.639> little

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
you can get the chest to move a little

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.789 
you can get the chest to move a little
bit<00:04:14.969> on<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.180> top<00:04:15.359> in<00:04:15.959> here<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.469> should<00:04:16.680> be

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
bit on the top in here you should be

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.589 
bit on the top in here you should be
putting<00:04:17.039> in<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.190> seal<00:04:17.549> but<00:04:17.880> as<00:04:18.060> anybody<00:04:18.329> who's

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
putting in a seal but as anybody who's

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.319 
putting in a seal but as anybody who's
seen<00:04:18.810> my<00:04:18.930> 1/100<00:04:19.650> reviews<00:04:19.979> knows<00:04:20.310> if<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:21.090> buy<00:04:21.299> a

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
seen my 1/100 reviews knows if you buy a

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.050 
seen my 1/100 reviews knows if you buy a
green<00:04:21.810> blue<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.199> red<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.919> can<00:04:23.099> add<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.280> pane<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
green blue and red you can add a pane to

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.120 
green blue and red you can add a pane to
pretty<00:04:24.419> much<00:04:24.570> all<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> double-o<00:04:25.169> kits<00:04:25.469> so<00:04:26.099> I

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
pretty much all the double-o kits so I

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.439 
pretty much all the double-o kits so I
just<00:04:26.520> left<00:04:26.729> some<00:04:26.880> green<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.120> there<00:04:27.240> and

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
just left some green in there and

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.670 
just left some green in there and
because<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:27.810> on<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:27.930> white<00:04:28.139> background<00:04:28.590> I

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
because it's on a white background I

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.249 
because it's on a white background I
think<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:28.949> looks<00:04:29.099> pretty<00:04:29.219> good<00:04:30.080> through<00:04:31.080> some

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
think it looks pretty good through some

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.050 
think it looks pretty good through some
black<00:04:31.440> lining<00:04:31.680> in<00:04:31.919> there<00:04:32.159> and<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.820> little<00:04:32.940> bit

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
black lining in there and a little bit

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.580 
black lining in there and a little bit
of<00:04:33.180> black<00:04:33.300> lining<00:04:33.599> around<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.050> yellow<00:04:34.169> there

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
of black lining around the yellow there

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.620 
of black lining around the yellow there
these<00:04:35.310> white<00:04:35.580> parts<00:04:35.909> are<00:04:36.030> very<00:04:36.060> unique<00:04:36.449> when

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
these white parts are very unique when

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.149 
these white parts are very unique when
you<00:04:36.719> take<00:04:36.870> them<00:04:37.020> off<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.259> sprue<00:04:37.500> but<00:04:37.800> they

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
you take them off the sprue but they

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.870 
you take them off the sprue but they
look<00:04:38.340> good<00:04:38.520> once<00:04:38.729> they're<00:04:38.909> put<00:04:39.150> in

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
look good once they're put in

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.880 
look good once they're put in
and<00:04:39.970> something<00:04:40.630> that's<00:04:40.750> unusual<00:04:41.290> as<00:04:41.440> well<00:04:41.680> is

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
and something that's unusual as well is

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.380 
and something that's unusual as well is
the<00:04:42.010> way<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.250> arm<00:04:42.430> is<00:04:42.550> attached<00:04:42.850> you<00:04:43.090> put<00:04:43.270> it

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
the way the arm is attached you put it

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.120 
the way the arm is attached you put it
into<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.810> ball<00:04:44.050> joint<00:04:44.320> here<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.710> you'll<00:04:44.980> see

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
into a ball joint here and you'll see

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.150 
into a ball joint here and you'll see
later<00:04:45.280> tons<00:04:46.060> of<00:04:46.300> flexibility<00:04:46.870> options<00:04:47.160> gaping

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
later tons of flexibility options gaping

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.980 
later tons of flexibility options gaping
a<00:04:48.220> hole<00:04:48.370> here<00:04:48.670> because<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.210> head<00:04:49.450> you'll<00:04:49.810> put

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
a hole here because the head you'll put

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.770 
a hole here because the head you'll put
in<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.170> joint<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.620> at<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.430> back<00:04:51.580> is<00:04:51.940> GN<00:04:52.450> drive

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
in a joint and at the back is GN drive

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.810 
in a joint and at the back is GN drive
you<00:04:53.410> can<00:04:53.620> snap<00:04:53.980> it<00:04:54.190> off<00:04:54.810> from<00:04:55.810> what<00:04:56.050> and

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
you can snap it off from what and

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.450 
you can snap it off from what and
instead<00:04:57.820> of<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.450> can<00:04:59.020> put<00:04:59.230> on<00:04:59.410> this<00:05:00.190> one

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
instead of that you can put on this one

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.190 
instead of that you can put on this one
if<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:01.450> prefer

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200

laisse<00:05:02.920> to<00:05:02.980> ribbons<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:04.240> guess<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:05.620> arms<00:05:05.860> have

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
laisse to ribbons I guess the arms have

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.340 
laisse to ribbons I guess the arms have
a<00:05:06.100> very<00:05:06.400> very<00:05:06.730> clean<00:05:07.090> look<00:05:07.390> again<00:05:07.900> with<00:05:08.110> hardly

a very very clean look again with hardly

a very very clean look again with hardly
any<00:05:08.650> lining<00:05:09.040> I<00:05:09.100> just<00:05:09.280> put<00:05:09.430> some<00:05:09.580> around<00:05:09.760> the

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
any lining I just put some around the

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.880 
any lining I just put some around the
elbows<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.810> ball<00:05:11.050> joint<00:05:11.350> sticks<00:05:11.620> out<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:11.770> the

elbows the ball joint sticks out of the

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.670 
elbows the ball joint sticks out of the
shoulder<00:05:12.250> you<00:05:12.820> can<00:05:12.970> spin<00:05:13.270> this<00:05:13.390> around<00:05:13.600> and<00:05:14.050> as

shoulder you can spin this around and as

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.550 
shoulder you can spin this around and as
far<00:05:14.860> as<00:05:14.920> flexibility<00:05:15.640> goes<00:05:15.850> not<00:05:16.660> bad<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.530> can

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
far as flexibility goes not bad you can

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.310 
far as flexibility goes not bad you can
bend<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:17.920> up<00:05:18.040> about<00:05:18.280> this<00:05:18.730> far<00:05:19.150> nothing<00:05:20.140> fancy

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
bend it up about this far nothing fancy

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.940 
bend it up about this far nothing fancy
down<00:05:20.740> below<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.340> just<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.510> regular<00:05:22.900> hand<00:05:23.560> on

down below and just a regular hand on
the<00:05:24.490> wrist<00:05:24.700> so<00:05:25.180> this<00:05:25.330> weapon<00:05:25.660> is<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.780> beam<00:05:25.990> gun

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
the wrist so this weapon is a beam gun

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.860 
the wrist so this weapon is a beam gun
and<00:05:26.590> it's<00:05:27.280> very<00:05:27.520> simple<00:05:27.940> but<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:28.450> know<00:05:28.540> sort

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
and it's very simple but you know sort

and it's very simple but you know sort
of<00:05:28.900> reminds<00:05:29.350> me<00:05:29.470> of<00:05:29.620> something<00:05:29.800> that<00:05:29.980> Jim

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
of reminds me of something that Jim

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.330 
of reminds me of something that Jim
would<00:05:30.580> use<00:05:30.820> in<00:05:31.090> first<00:05:32.050> Gundam<00:05:32.410> but<00:05:32.950> it's<00:05:33.130> very

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
would use in first Gundam but it's very

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.510 
would use in first Gundam but it's very
simple<00:05:33.700> and<00:05:33.940> it<00:05:34.510> sets<00:05:34.810> off<00:05:34.990> well<00:05:35.320> with<00:05:35.980> the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
simple and it sets off well with the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.240 
simple and it sets off well with the
beam<00:05:37.120> saver<00:05:37.450> and<00:05:37.780> what<00:05:38.320> I<00:05:38.350> like<00:05:38.560> about<00:05:38.590> the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
beam saver and what I like about the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.610 
beam saver and what I like about the
beam<00:05:39.400> saber<00:05:39.670> is<00:05:39.940> bad<00:05:40.150> it's<00:05:40.510> skinny<00:05:41.320> on<00:05:41.470> one

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
beam saber is bad it's skinny on one

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.230 
beam saber is bad it's skinny on one
side<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:41.980> a<00:05:42.010> little<00:05:42.100> bit<00:05:42.250> fat<00:05:42.580> in<00:05:42.790> flight<00:05:43.090> out

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
side and a little bit fat in flight out

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.530 
side and a little bit fat in flight out
and<00:05:43.390> so<00:05:44.080> on<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.620> back<00:05:44.830> of<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.850> chest<00:05:46.120> unit

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
and so on the back of the chest unit

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.930 
and so on the back of the chest unit
there<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.230> a<00:05:47.260> single<00:05:47.710> mount<00:05:47.920> here<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:48.610> you<00:05:48.760> can

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
there is a single mount here and you can

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.660 
there is a single mount here and you can
pivot<00:05:49.090> that<00:05:49.300> around<00:05:49.660> and<00:05:50.040> pull<00:05:51.040> that<00:05:51.160> out<00:05:51.220> and

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
pivot that around and pull that out and

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.870 
pivot that around and pull that out and
you<00:05:52.540> can<00:05:52.570> put<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:53.320> beam<00:05:53.530> saber<00:05:53.830> in<00:05:54.070> only<00:05:54.610> in

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
you can put the beam saber in only in

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.810 
you can put the beam saber in only in
one<00:05:55.120> way<00:05:55.150> because<00:05:55.930> it's<00:05:56.320> got<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.860> cut<00:05:57.340> in<00:05:57.610> there

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
one way because it's got a cut in there

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.510 
one way because it's got a cut in there
accordingly<00:05:58.300> but<00:05:59.200> this<00:05:59.410> beam<00:05:59.650> saber<00:05:59.920> I<00:06:00.220> like

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
accordingly but this beam saber I like

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.830 
accordingly but this beam saber I like
it<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.670> lot<00:06:00.790> more<00:06:01.000> than<00:06:01.120> a<00:06:01.150> regular<00:06:01.360> one<00:06:01.570> and

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
it a lot more than a regular one and

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.780 
it a lot more than a regular one and
like<00:06:02.350> I<00:06:02.470> said<00:06:02.650> you<00:06:02.770> can<00:06:02.890> also<00:06:03.040> use<00:06:03.310> this<00:06:03.580> for

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
like I said you can also use this for

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.680 
like I said you can also use this for
Exia<00:06:04.480> are<00:06:04.720> -<00:06:05.700> the<00:06:06.700> shield<00:06:06.940> is<00:06:07.120> a<00:06:07.180> nice<00:06:07.360> take<00:06:07.600> on

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
Exia are - the shield is a nice take on

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.510 
Exia are - the shield is a nice take on
the<00:06:07.840> classic<00:06:08.290> design<00:06:08.590> without<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:09.160> big

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
the classic design without the big

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.850 
the classic design without the big
yellow<00:06:09.760> Crusader<00:06:10.270> cross<00:06:10.600> but<00:06:11.410> now<00:06:11.650> that's

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
yellow Crusader cross but now that's

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.380 
yellow Crusader cross but now that's
something<00:06:12.130> that<00:06:12.280> it's<00:06:12.520> a<00:06:12.640> small<00:06:12.940> complaint

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
something that it's a small complaint

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.850 
something that it's a small complaint
but<00:06:13.600> when<00:06:13.780> you<00:06:13.870> put<00:06:14.080> this<00:06:14.170> into<00:06:14.350> the<00:06:14.440> hand<00:06:14.710> you

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
but when you put this into the hand you

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.680 
but when you put this into the hand you
plug<00:06:15.070> it<00:06:15.190> in<00:06:15.280> underneath<00:06:15.790> and<00:06:16.090> then<00:06:16.270> this<00:06:16.450> just

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
plug it in underneath and then this just

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.870 
plug it in underneath and then this just
folds<00:06:17.110> in<00:06:17.260> so<00:06:17.830> if<00:06:18.010> you<00:06:18.130> have<00:06:18.340> the<00:06:18.490> hand<00:06:18.670> coming

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
folds in so if you have the hand coming

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.060 
folds in so if you have the hand coming
across<00:06:19.180> it<00:06:19.600> can<00:06:19.870> fall<00:06:20.230> down<00:06:20.260> like<00:06:20.800> this

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
across it can fall down like this

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.490 
across it can fall down like this
sometimes<00:06:21.820> because<00:06:22.480> there's<00:06:22.630> no<00:06:22.780> actual<00:06:23.080> peg

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
sometimes because there's no actual peg

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.290 
sometimes because there's no actual peg
to<00:06:23.770> put<00:06:23.950> that<00:06:24.100> in<00:06:24.280> that's<00:06:24.820> something<00:06:25.150> that's

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
to put that in that's something that's

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.170 
to put that in that's something that's
fixed<00:06:25.510> on<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:25.840> Exia<00:06:26.550> now<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:27.610> size<00:06:27.970> of<00:06:28.120> the

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
fixed on the Exia now the size of the

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.220 
fixed on the Exia now the size of the
head<00:06:28.330> of<00:06:28.450> the<00:06:28.480> high-grade<00:06:28.840> takes<00:06:29.110> some

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
head of the high-grade takes some

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.470 
head of the high-grade takes some
getting<00:06:29.440> used<00:06:29.620> to<00:06:29.710> compared<00:06:30.130> to<00:06:30.220> a<00:06:30.250> 1/100<00:06:31.030> but

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
getting used to compared to a 1/100 but

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.670 
getting used to compared to a 1/100 but
I<00:06:31.510> think<00:06:31.720> they<00:06:31.810> did<00:06:31.900> a<00:06:31.990> really<00:06:32.020> good<00:06:32.350> job<00:06:32.500> of

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
I think they did a really good job of

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.860 
I think they did a really good job of
capturing<00:06:33.040> the<00:06:33.370> original<00:06:33.790> Gundam<00:06:34.150> my<00:06:34.660> only

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
capturing the original Gundam my only

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.890 
capturing the original Gundam my only
complaint<00:06:35.110> is<00:06:35.350> that<00:06:35.560> up<00:06:35.800> at<00:06:36.040> the<00:06:36.130> top<00:06:36.430> I<00:06:37.360> had<00:06:37.810> to

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
complaint is that up at the top I had to

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.840 
complaint is that up at the top I had to
do<00:06:37.990> that<00:06:38.110> with<00:06:38.260> marker<00:06:38.710> there's<00:06:38.920> no<00:06:39.100> seal<00:06:39.460> so

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
do that with marker there's no seal so

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.000 
do that with marker there's no seal so
just<00:06:40.060> put<00:06:40.240> a<00:06:40.270> black<00:06:40.540> pen<00:06:40.810> in<00:06:40.960> there<00:06:41.110> and<00:06:41.320> it'll

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
just put a black pen in there and it'll

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.040 
just put a black pen in there and it'll
work<00:06:42.040> out<00:06:42.370> and<00:06:42.670> add<00:06:43.210> some<00:06:43.480> black<00:06:43.690> lining

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
work out and add some black lining

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.660 
work out and add some black lining
around<00:06:44.140> here<00:06:44.500> but<00:06:44.770> there's<00:06:44.920> pretty<00:06:45.070> deep<00:06:45.370> cuts

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670 
around here but there's pretty deep cuts

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.430 
around here but there's pretty deep cuts
except<00:06:46.270> on<00:06:46.420> the<00:06:46.510> front<00:06:46.750> of<00:06:46.870> the<00:06:46.960> mouth<00:06:47.110> guard

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
except on the front of the mouth guard

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.560 
except on the front of the mouth guard
those<00:06:48.310> were<00:06:48.490> a<00:06:48.520> bit<00:06:48.700> shallow<00:06:49.000> so<00:06:49.330> you're<00:06:49.450> going

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
those were a bit shallow so you're going

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.090 
those were a bit shallow so you're going
to<00:06:49.600> have<00:06:49.780> to<00:06:49.900> do<00:06:50.020> that<00:06:50.229> a<00:06:50.260> couple<00:06:50.380> times<00:06:50.650> to<00:06:50.950> try

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
to have to do that a couple times to try

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.890 
to have to do that a couple times to try
to<00:06:51.130> get<00:06:51.310> it<00:06:51.400> right<00:06:51.580> but<00:06:52.240> what's<00:06:52.450> sort<00:06:52.630> of<00:06:52.720> cool

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
to get it right but what's sort of cool

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.670 
to get it right but what's sort of cool
about<00:06:53.110> this<00:06:53.290> hat<00:06:53.470> is

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
about this hat is

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.860 
about this hat is
this<00:06:53.919> neck<00:06:54.190> piece<00:06:54.220> has<00:06:54.850> a<00:06:54.880> lot<00:06:55.210> of<00:06:55.240> flexibility

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
this neck piece has a lot of flexibility

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.740 
this neck piece has a lot of flexibility
and<00:06:56.370> you<00:06:57.370> can<00:06:57.580> actually<00:06:57.820> pull<00:06:58.210> off<00:06:58.330> a<00:06:58.360> lot<00:06:58.660> of

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
and you can actually pull off a lot of

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.779 
and you can actually pull off a lot of
different<00:06:58.990> poses<00:06:59.350> with<00:06:59.500> the<00:06:59.620> head<00:06:59.800> and<00:07:00.039> just<00:07:00.699> a

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:00.789 
different poses with the head and just a

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:04.409 
different poses with the head and just a
quick<00:07:00.970> note<00:07:02.190> because<00:07:03.190> real<00:07:03.550> life<00:07:03.729> is<00:07:03.970> a<00:07:04.000> little

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:04.419 
quick note because real life is a little
