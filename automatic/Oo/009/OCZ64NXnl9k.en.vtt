I've only had it for a few weeks but I

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.059 
I've only had it for a few weeks but I
know<00:02:27.780> shengshou<00:02:28.290> quality<00:02:28.590> stickers<00:02:28.769> are

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
know shengshou quality stickers are

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.350 
know shengshou quality stickers are
pretty<00:02:29.640> strong<00:02:30.049> good<00:02:31.049> vibrant<00:02:31.410> colors<00:02:32.360> the

pretty strong good vibrant colors the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.850 
pretty strong good vibrant colors the
only<00:02:33.540> reason<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.870> switch<00:02:34.140> out<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> stickers<00:02:34.709> is

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
only reason I switch out the stickers is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.259 
only reason I switch out the stickers is
just<00:02:35.069> because<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.310> want<00:02:35.489> my<00:02:35.549> entire<00:02:35.850> set<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
just because I want my entire set to

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.110 
just because I want my entire set to
look<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:37.410> through<00:02:37.680> 11<00:02:38.040> let's<00:02:39.000> go

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
look like this to through 11 let's go

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.640 
look like this to through 11 let's go
into<00:02:39.330> some<00:02:39.480> more<00:02:39.510> detail<00:02:39.660> with<00:02:40.319> corner

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
into some more detail with corner

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.330 
into some more detail with corner
cutting<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.410> outer<00:02:43.590> layer<00:02:43.799> corner-cutting

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
cutting the outer layer corner-cutting

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.699 
cutting the outer layer corner-cutting
isn't<00:02:44.760> too<00:02:44.910> good<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.540> under<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.440> piece

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
isn't too good it's just under one piece

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.729 
isn't too good it's just under one piece
because<00:02:47.040> if<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.190> try<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.430> go<00:02:47.610> over<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.090> starts<00:02:48.739> to

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
because if I try to go over it starts to

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.289 
because if I try to go over it starts to
bind<00:02:50.069> up<00:02:51.319> yeah<00:02:52.400> but<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.549> inner<00:02:53.730> layer<00:02:53.910> corner

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
bind up yeah but the inner layer corner

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.900 
bind up yeah but the inner layer corner
cutting<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.769> good<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.430> can<00:02:56.580> sort<00:02:56.760> of

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
cutting is really good you can sort of

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.809 
cutting is really good you can sort of
turn<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.299> half<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:58.130> go<00:02:59.130> through<00:02:59.400> one<00:02:59.610> layer

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
turn it in half and go through one layer

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.930 
turn it in half and go through one layer
on<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.450> middle<00:03:00.599> layer<00:03:01.609> now<00:03:02.609> I<00:03:02.640> haven't

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
on the middle layer now I haven't

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.490 
on the middle layer now I haven't
adjusted<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.480> tensions<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.109> puzzle<00:03:04.260> at

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
adjusted the tensions on this puzzle at

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.960 
adjusted the tensions on this puzzle at
all<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.829> haven't<00:03:05.190> actually<00:03:05.310> taken<00:03:05.609> off<00:03:05.850> the

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
center caps yet I just tried to but

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.030 
center caps yet I just tried to but
really<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.510> there<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.530> if<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.739> just<00:03:10.829> mess

really on there so if you just mess
around<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.340> tensions<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.730> little<00:03:11.880> bit<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.090> a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
around the tensions a little bit and a

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.729 
around the tensions a little bit and a
little<00:03:12.150> bit<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:13.019> puzzle<00:03:13.320> will<00:03:13.410> be<00:03:13.500> great

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
little bit this puzzle will be great

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.069 
little bit this puzzle will be great
that<00:03:14.579> already<00:03:14.819> is<00:03:14.910> amazing<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:15.720> whether<00:03:15.870> you

the cubic strength shell seven by seven
I<00:03:19.500> would<00:03:19.829> still<00:03:20.069> recommend<00:03:20.190> buying<00:03:20.670> one<00:03:20.940> of

I would still recommend buying one of
these<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:22.170> v-cube<00:03:22.549> just<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.609> compare

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
these and the v-cube just to compare

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.759 
these and the v-cube just to compare
because<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.600> still<00:03:24.989> love<00:03:25.109> doing<00:03:25.140> solved<00:03:25.680> in

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
because I still love doing solved in

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.039 
because I still love doing solved in
both<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.100> puzzles<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.609> v<00:03:26.730> q7<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.389> amazing<00:03:27.930> to

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
both the puzzles the v q7 is amazing to

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.379 
both the puzzles the v q7 is amazing to
me<00:03:28.079> just<00:03:29.069> how<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.609> don't<00:03:29.910> have<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.120> worry<00:03:30.269> about

me just how I don't have to worry about

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.640 
me just how I don't have to worry about
layer<00:03:30.660> alignment<00:03:31.170> or<00:03:31.200> anything<00:03:31.470> like<00:03:31.500> that

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
layer alignment or anything like that

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.910 
layer alignment or anything like that
and<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.760> puzzle<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.290> hardly<00:03:34.290> has<00:03:34.500> any<00:03:34.530> songs

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
and this puzzle is hardly has any songs

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.470 
and this puzzle is hardly has any songs
on<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.160> that's<00:03:35.760> already<00:03:35.940> doing<00:03:36.180> stuff<00:03:36.420> like

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
on it that's already doing stuff like

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.479 
on it that's already doing stuff like
that<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.980> feeling<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
that and I just like the feeling of the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.309 
that and I just like the feeling of the
cubic<00:03:38.790> if<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.630> decide<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.019> want<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.170> buy<00:03:40.290> one

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
cubic if you decide you want to buy one

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.979 
cubic if you decide you want to buy one
of<00:03:40.470> these<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.370> III<00:03:41.880> cube<00:03:42.150> store<00:03:42.389> com<00:03:42.780> I'll

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
of these go to III cube store com I'll
