00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.730 

while<00:00:12.780> me<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.019> now<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:13.469> gonna<00:00:13.559> go

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
while me to do now is I'm gonna go

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.380 
while me to do now is I'm gonna go
through<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.570> leg<00:00:15.780> loop<00:00:16.470> no<00:00:17.270> and<00:00:18.270> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
through you have the leg loop no and you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.759 
through you have the leg loop no and you
have<00:00:18.630> tie<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.350> loop<00:00:20.390> and<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.960> want<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.380> now<00:00:22.560> is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
have tie in loop and I want to do now is

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.380 
have tie in loop and I want to do now is
to<00:00:22.859> trace<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.220> thing<00:00:23.430> back<00:00:23.640> through<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.269> it's

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to trace the thing back through so it's

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.330 
to trace the thing back through so it's
going<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.539> go<00:00:24.630> through<00:00:24.810> here<00:00:25.189> sets<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.310> down

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
going to go through here sets it down

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.130 
going to go through here sets it down
nice<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.699> close<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> harness<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.720> now

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
nice and close to the harness and now

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.529 
nice and close to the harness and now
it's<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.529> go<00:00:28.650> around<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.970> way

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's going to go around this way

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.990 
it's going to go around this way
a<00:00:30.570> nice<00:00:30.929> little<00:00:31.109> loop<00:00:31.260> right<00:00:31.470> there<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.800> open

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
a nice little loop right there it's open

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.600 
a nice little loop right there it's open
right<00:00:33.000> through<00:00:33.149> there<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.309> then<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.460> go<00:00:35.579> back

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
right through there and then we go back

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.270 
right through there and then we go back
around<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.239> way<00:00:36.559> then<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.649> go<00:00:37.860> back<00:00:37.890> through

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
around this way then I go back through

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.790 
around this way then I go back through
here<00:00:42.050> now<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:44.300> two<00:00:45.300> four<00:00:45.960> six<00:00:46.440> eight<00:00:46.710> ten

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here now you have two four six eight ten

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.670 
here now you have two four six eight ten
and<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:48.210> no<00:00:48.360> less<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.899> dollar<00:00:49.230> bills<00:00:49.469> length

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and then no less a dollar bills length

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
and then no less a dollar bills length
of<00:00:49.860> tail<00:00:50.039> left<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:51.000> that's<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
of tail left over that's it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.930 
of tail left over that's it
what's<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.140> figure<00:00:52.440> eight<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.879> lot<00:00:53.879> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
what's your figure eight a lot of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.600 
what's your figure eight a lot of
different<00:00:54.149> ways<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.300> teach<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
different ways to teach this and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.740 
different ways to teach this and
sometimes<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.059> violence<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
sometimes I think that violence is a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
sometimes I think that violence is a
good<00:00:58.170> way<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.530> things<00:00:58.649> stopping<00:00:59.010> like

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
good way to get things stopping like

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
good way to get things stopping like
those<00:00:59.280> heads<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.329> basically<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.719> start<00:01:00.930> with

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
those heads so basically I start with

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.009 
those heads so basically I start with
this<00:01:01.170> much<00:01:01.430> start<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> loop<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.840> going

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
this much start with a loop so I'm going

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.070 
this much start with a loop so I'm going
to<00:01:04.049> make<00:01:04.229> Bob<00:01:04.729> on<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:05.880> choke<00:01:06.180> Bob<00:01:06.390> I'm<00:01:06.930> gonna

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to make Bob on my choke Bob I'm gonna

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.390 
to make Bob on my choke Bob I'm gonna
come<00:01:07.260> back<00:01:07.409> around<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.680> put<00:01:07.920> Bob<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
come back around and put Bob in the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.510 
come back around and put Bob in the
eyeball<00:01:11.540> that's<00:01:12.540> how<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> started<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.520> we're

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
eyeball that's how you started now we're

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.859 
eyeball that's how you started now we're
going<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> climb<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.180> first<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
going to climb this first so because you

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
going to climb this first so because you
tied<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.310> certain<00:01:17.310> climbing<00:01:17.670> gyms<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:18.030> teach

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
tied in certain climbing gyms will teach

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.660 
tied in certain climbing gyms will teach
this<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:19.380> take<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> carabiner

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
this they take the carabiner

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.910 
this they take the carabiner
and<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.090> through<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.680> through

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and you go through here and then through

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.700 
and you go through here and then through
here<00:01:23.340> that's<00:01:24.180> where<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> Rope<00:01:24.689> goes<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
here that's where the Rope goes not a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.890 
here that's where the Rope goes not a
blade<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> ice<00:01:26.310> where<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.670> am<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.270> carabiner<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
blade of ice where I am a carabiner and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.670 
blade of ice where I am a carabiner and
what<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.920> does<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.610> Orient's<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.409> ATC<00:01:31.409> like

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
what this does is Orient's the ATC like

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.850 
what this does is Orient's the ATC like
this<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.610> causes<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.210> cross<00:01:33.750> load<00:01:34.079> they

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
this and it causes to cross load they

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.160 
this and it causes to cross load they
wanted<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.810> even<00:01:37.079> if

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
wanted to have it like that and even if

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.840 
wanted to have it like that and even if
it's<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.979> could<00:01:38.070> pop<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.670> when

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it's like this it could pop in here when

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060 
it's like this it could pop in here when
you<00:01:38.939> don't<00:01:39.180> even<00:01:39.270> realizing<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.170> your

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
you don't even realizing it and your

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
you don't even realizing it and your
cross<00:01:41.280> letting<00:01:41.610> your<00:01:41.700> carabiner<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
cross letting your carabiner is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.130 
cross letting your carabiner is
significantly<00:01:43.770> weaker<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.790> way<00:01:45.030> also<00:01:45.600> it's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
significantly weaker this way also it's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.539 
significantly weaker this way also it's
going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> happen<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> ropes<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> go

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
going to happen as the ropes going to go

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 
going to happen as the ropes going to go
through<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.030> funky<00:01:48.420> way<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.200> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
through in a funky way it's going to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.010 
through in a funky way it's going to
cause<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> twist<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.250> after<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> while<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.899> will

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
cause a twist and after a while you will

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.960 
cause a twist and after a while you will
permanently<00:01:52.560> ruin<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:53.070> rope<00:01:53.250> you'll

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
permanently ruin your rope you'll

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.190 
permanently ruin your rope you'll
actually<00:01:54.270> twist<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> point<00:01:54.899> where<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
actually twist it to the point where the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.700 
actually twist it to the point where the
sheath<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.040> poor<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.850> separate<00:01:57.360> and

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
sheath and the poor will separate and

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.959 
sheath and the poor will separate and
basically<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> ruined<00:01:59.460> rope<00:01:59.610> it's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
basically you have a ruined rope it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.649 
basically you have a ruined rope it's
done<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.450> trash<00:02:01.070> turn<00:02:02.070> into<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> rug<00:02:02.659> but

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
done it's trash turn into a rug but

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.630 
done it's trash turn into a rug but
Jim's<00:02:04.380> teaching<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.219> incorrect

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640

Jim's teaching this it's incorrect
that's<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.540> right<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
that's just not the right way to

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.590 
that's just not the right way to
and<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:09.039> called<00:02:09.430> a<00:02:09.520> belay<00:02:09.759> loop<00:02:09.789> for

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
and this is called a belay loop for

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.510 
and this is called a belay loop for
reason<00:02:11.020> this<00:02:11.140> triple<00:02:11.500> stitch<00:02:11.770> just<00:02:12.010> got<00:02:12.190> two

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
reason this triple stitch just got two

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.360 
reason this triple stitch just got two
or<00:02:12.730> three<00:02:12.880> different<00:02:13.030> layers<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:15.220> been

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
or three different layers and it's been

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.030 
or three different layers and it's been
only<00:02:15.520> one<00:02:15.630> situation<00:02:16.630> where<00:02:17.530> someone's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
only one situation where someone's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.040 
only one situation where someone's
harness<00:02:18.490> broke<00:02:18.880> where<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.570> blade<00:02:19.780> device

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
harness broke where the blade device

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.420 
harness broke where the blade device
broke<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.680> was<00:02:20.830> because<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.310> was

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
broke and that was because it was

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.000 
broke and that was because it was
incredibly<00:02:22.360> old<00:02:22.600> harness<00:02:22.930> had<00:02:23.320> lots<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.770> use

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
incredibly old harness had lots of use

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.400 
incredibly old harness had lots of use
and<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.400> worn<00:02:24.670> quite<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.060> bit<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:26.260> was

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
and it was worn quite a bit and it was

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.170 
and it was worn quite a bit and it was
sad<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.890> was<00:02:27.010> actually<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.460> very<00:02:27.610> accomplished

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
sad it was actually a very accomplished

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.110 
sad it was actually a very accomplished
rock<00:02:28.390> climber<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:30.130> was<00:02:30.580> something<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.030> was

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
rock climber and it was something it was

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.619 
rock climber and it was something it was
completely<00:02:31.570> avoidable

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.110 

so<00:02:36.019> basically<00:02:36.349> this<00:02:36.769> is<00:02:37.010> your<00:02:37.040> standard<00:02:37.579> ATC

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
so basically this is your standard ATC

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.899 
so basically this is your standard ATC
right<00:02:38.359> here<00:02:38.569> this<00:02:39.319> is<00:02:39.379> on<00:02:39.650> more<00:02:39.889> harnesses<00:02:40.519> on

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
right here this is on more harnesses on

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.339 
right here this is on more harnesses on
the<00:02:41.060> market<00:02:41.389> than<00:02:41.540> any<00:02:41.689> other<00:02:41.870> device<00:02:42.109> out

here you go

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.280 
here you go
and<00:02:51.409> then<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:52.069> have<00:02:52.219> ATC<00:02:52.909> XP<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.810> one<00:02:54.109> that's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
and then you have ATC XP this one that's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.160 
and then you have ATC XP this one that's
right<00:02:54.500> here<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:55.730> XP<00:02:56.090> means<00:02:56.299> extra<00:02:56.659> protection

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
right here the XP means extra protection

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.550 
right here the XP means extra protection

that's your standard two style way
devices<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.449> we<00:03:14.449> have<00:03:14.659> brake<00:03:15.169> assist<00:03:15.620> devices

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
devices and we have brake assist devices

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.659 
devices and we have brake assist devices
brake<00:03:16.639> assist<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.419> pretty<00:03:17.810> much<00:03:18.459> these<00:03:19.459> things

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
brake assist is pretty much these things

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.149 
brake assist is pretty much these things
right<00:03:19.849> here<00:03:19.879> is<00:03:20.329> called<00:03:20.689> a<00:03:20.840> gris-gris<00:03:21.319> there's

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
right here is called a gris-gris there's

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.379 
right here is called a gris-gris there's
a<00:03:22.219> few<00:03:22.400> others<00:03:22.579> on<00:03:22.699> the<00:03:22.790> market<00:03:23.150> but<00:03:23.269> the

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
a few others on the market but the

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.229 
a few others on the market but the
grevioux<00:03:23.599> is<00:03:23.780> by<00:03:23.989> far<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.260> most<00:03:24.469> popular<00:03:25.239> this

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
grevioux is by far the most popular this

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.319 
grevioux is by far the most popular this
is<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.510> first<00:03:26.750> style<00:03:27.079> that<00:03:27.290> came<00:03:27.439> out<00:03:27.709> snows

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
is the first style that came out snows

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.580 
is the first style that came out snows
this<00:03:29.329> design<00:03:29.719> has<00:03:29.840> been<00:03:29.900> around<00:03:30.019> for<00:03:30.379> a<00:03:30.409> long

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
this design has been around for a long

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.220 
this design has been around for a long
long<00:03:30.650> time<00:03:31.299> but<00:03:32.299> it's<00:03:32.449> basically<00:03:32.719> it's<00:03:32.900> got<00:03:33.019> a

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
long time but it's basically it's got a

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.229 
long time but it's basically it's got a
camming<00:03:33.919> device<00:03:33.949> in<00:03:34.430> there<00:03:34.639> if<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:34.909> locks<00:03:35.090> down

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
camming device in there if it locks down

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.490 
camming device in there if it locks down
the<00:03:35.359> Rope<00:03:35.689> automatically<00:03:36.639> so<00:03:37.639> here's<00:03:38.030> that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
the Rope automatically so here's that

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.270 
the Rope automatically so here's that
came<00:03:39.500> out<00:03:39.709> just<00:03:40.009> recently<00:03:40.569> past<00:03:41.569> couple<00:03:41.840> years

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
came out just recently past couple years

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.949 
came out just recently past couple years
they<00:03:43.280> redesigned<00:03:43.909> it<00:03:44.150> they<00:03:44.299> made<00:03:44.449> it<00:03:44.569> smaller

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
they redesigned it they made it smaller

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.210 
they redesigned it they made it smaller
and<00:03:45.319> lighter<00:03:46.239> this<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.419> the<00:03:47.540> Grigri<00:03:47.750> -<00:03:48.139> so<00:03:49.129> you

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
and lighter this is the Grigri - so you

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.210 
and lighter this is the Grigri - so you
can<00:03:49.310> see<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.639> different<00:03:50.030> smooth<00:03:50.479> is<00:03:50.599> smaller

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
can see the different smooth is smaller

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.129 
can see the different smooth is smaller
but<00:03:52.220> this<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.299> great<00:03:53.479> device<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.959> have

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
but this is a great device to have

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.129 
but this is a great device to have
although<00:03:54.620> it's<00:03:55.519> kind<00:03:56.030> of<00:03:56.060> expensive<00:03:56.449> it's

of<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.120> difference<00:04:05.479> in<00:04:05.720> price<00:04:06.470> that's<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:08.109> top

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
of a difference in price that's it top

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.259 
of a difference in price that's it top
roofing<00:04:09.530> is<00:04:09.949> also<00:04:10.310> known<00:04:10.489> as<00:04:10.639> the<00:04:10.729> slingshot

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
roofing is also known as the slingshot

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.559 
roofing is also known as the slingshot
bleh<00:04:11.599> and<00:04:12.729> it's<00:04:13.729> about<00:04:13.909> the<00:04:14.060> safest<00:04:14.389> way<00:04:14.540> to

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
bleh and it's about the safest way to

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.069 
bleh and it's about the safest way to
knock<00:04:14.900> home<00:04:15.820> so<00:04:16.820> he's<00:04:17.299> gonna<00:04:17.449> shoe<00:04:17.720> up<00:04:17.870> right

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
knock home so he's gonna shoe up right

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.550 
knock home so he's gonna shoe up right
now<00:04:18.219> this<00:04:19.219> is<00:04:19.370> how<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.519> load<00:04:19.759> it<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
now this is how you load it and the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.580 
now this is how you load it and the
plate<00:04:21.769> closes<00:04:22.250> over<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:24.050> then<00:04:24.229> you<00:04:24.349> put

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
plate closes over that and then you put

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.100 
plate closes over that and then you put
them<00:04:24.710> in<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.919> carabiner<00:04:25.509> clip<00:04:26.509> it<00:04:26.659> in<00:04:26.780> though

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.250 

like<00:04:30.110> this<00:04:30.500> when<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.400> lock<00:04:31.610> her<00:04:31.760> down<00:04:32.260> now

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
like this when you lock her down now

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.530 
like this when you lock her down now
what<00:04:33.500> this<00:04:33.680> does<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.820> once<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.300> ropes

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
what this does is it once the ropes

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.900 
what this does is it once the ropes
going<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.900> sweep<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.260> like<00:04:36.440> this<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:37.700> when<00:04:37.850> he

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
going to sweep you like this and when he

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.930 
going to sweep you like this and when he
goes<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.060> lower<00:04:38.650> it's<00:04:39.650> going<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:39.950> lock<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.700> cuz

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
goes to lower it's going to lock and cuz

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.610 
goes to lower it's going to lock and cuz
it's<00:04:41.090> broke<00:04:41.330> over<00:04:41.480> like<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:41.930> this<00:04:42.380> is<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
it's broke over like this this is the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.010 
it's broke over like this this is the
friction<00:04:43.010> plate<00:04:43.250> right<00:04:43.430> here<00:04:43.730> and<00:04:44.690> then<00:04:44.870> this

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
friction plate right here and then this

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.290 
friction plate right here and then this
bar<00:04:45.350> pulls<00:04:45.710> back<00:04:45.950> and<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.580> releases<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.120> will

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
bar pulls back and it releases that will

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.620 
bar pulls back and it releases that will
and<00:04:48.020> that's<00:04:48.170> how<00:04:48.290> you<00:04:48.350> lower<00:04:48.560> someone<00:04:49.630> it

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
and that's how you lower someone it

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.030 
and that's how you lower someone it
takes<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.900> little<00:04:51.020> bit<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.320> practice<00:04:51.740> kind<00:04:51.980> of

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
takes a little bit to practice kind of

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.400 
takes a little bit to practice kind of
get<00:04:52.130> used<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.670> but<00:04:53.140> taking<00:04:54.140> up<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.290> slack

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
get used to it but taking up the slack

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.380 
get used to it but taking up the slack
is<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.830> same<00:04:55.010> thing<00:04:55.220> as<00:04:55.340> using<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:55.670> ATC<00:04:56.210> it's

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
is the same thing as using the ATC it's

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.110 
is the same thing as using the ATC it's
no<00:04:56.510> different<00:04:56.930> just<00:04:57.320> time<00:04:57.950> like<00:04:58.700> climbing

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
no different just time like climbing

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.430 
no different just time like climbing
gyms<00:04:59.330> were<00:04:59.480> teaching<00:04:59.840> this<00:04:59.960> method<00:05:00.320> right

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
gyms were teaching this method right

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.290 
gyms were teaching this method right
here<00:05:00.730> you<00:05:01.730> do<00:05:01.880> this<00:05:02.030> one<00:05:03.760> this<00:05:04.760> is<00:05:04.940> actually

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
here you do this one this is actually

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.080 
here you do this one this is actually
incorrect<00:05:05.920> the<00:05:06.920> reason<00:05:07.220> why<00:05:07.340> is<00:05:07.400> because<00:05:07.610> of

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
incorrect the reason why is because of

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.790 
incorrect the reason why is because of
the<00:05:08.180> making<00:05:08.540> seen<00:05:08.810> your<00:05:09.050> hands<00:05:09.290> already<00:05:09.560> up<00:05:09.710> in

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
at the end of the rope this is the wrong

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.630 
at the end of the rope this is the wrong

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
end but the end of the rope over there I

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.940 
end but the end of the rope over there I
have<00:05:45.150> a<00:05:45.180> knot<00:05:45.390> tied<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.960> this<00:05:46.560> is<00:05:46.710> called

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
have a knot tied and this is called

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.270 
have a knot tied and this is called
closing<00:05:47.160> the<00:05:47.430> system<00:05:47.850> so<00:05:48.860> basically<00:05:49.860> just

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
closing the system so basically just

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.360 
closing the system so basically just
wrap<00:05:50.760> around<00:05:51.090> this<00:05:51.240> way<00:05:51.980> it<00:05:52.980> goes<00:05:53.160> back

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
wrap around this way it goes back

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.280 
wrap around this way it goes back
through<00:05:53.580> here<00:05:54.170> this<00:05:55.170> fisherman's<00:05:56.010> knot<00:05:57.290> now

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
through here this fisherman's knot now

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.470 
through here this fisherman's knot now
when<00:05:58.530> you're<00:05:58.650> lower<00:05:58.860> someone<00:05:59.430> this<00:05:59.970> will<00:06:00.180> suck

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
when you're lower someone this will suck

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.180 
when you're lower someone this will suck
into<00:06:00.630> the<00:06:00.810> device<00:06:01.110> just<00:06:01.140> in<00:06:01.650> case<00:06:01.830> that<00:06:02.010> rope

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
into the device just in case that rope

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.460 
into the device just in case that rope
is<00:06:02.310> too<00:06:02.490> short<00:06:02.670> for<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:03.030> rounds<00:06:03.390> this<00:06:04.200> is<00:06:04.350> the

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
is too short for the rounds this is the

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.470 
is too short for the rounds this is the
good<00:06:04.650> habit<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.040> get<00:06:05.220> into<00:06:05.280> is<00:06:05.820> called<00:06:06.150> closing

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480
