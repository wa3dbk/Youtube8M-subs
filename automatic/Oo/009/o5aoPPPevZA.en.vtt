00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.610
 It matters how many nights I think the match is 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.520
 All in all, it turned out quite good only 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:23.970
 what heads and what a lot of deletions 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:31.320
 so there is nothing work but would 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.840
 will this altar I am not everything but after such 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.670
 heavy rides 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.500
 I think not acted in such bad with 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.500
 an old cat which was not beaten 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.370
 Jacques had not received these last 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.320
 matches at home that did not go long 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.219
 the cost of the gate and all ended for 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.000
 the gate in the corners wanted everything in empty 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.629
 the gates to the enemy are simply no gear 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.250
 of things 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:05.100
 that I do not like this but as a colleague 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.790
 said will and it's already now 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.270
 stelmaha 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.869
 bad pieces young there power this puck i 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.520
 I think that if you do not beat off 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:20.780
 rivals watch me zabem but 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.780
 it is already happy from us she is not there 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:34.190
 today bluish hurts but you know it 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.960
 in general it has been for many 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.840
 judges have now begun to monitor this 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.220
 Juice raised stick a lot of very 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.550
 removing otherwise top tires beat 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.380
 so the 10 bar oil is actually very 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.150
 strictly the essence of the years also looks 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.390
 Sometime Moscow 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.720
 all the time guys are warning you need 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.720
 play more carefully 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.160
 if you want 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.800
 villa on shootouts released young as 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.720
 would that he was liberated why others 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.110
 don't beat jars great at workout 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.370
 this shootout rules 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.750
 in fact one hundred percent salt 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.810
 some players of ours are not faith not 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.160
 just try a mind that is not 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:41.390
 to the boss as one of us make warmth 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:45.680
 launch mode musa i told me not 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.110
 we just do not play and do not play 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.050
 simple things just draw me not 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.950
 telling simple things to keep 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.560
 return everything here is some kind of rebound always 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.440
 dad we all sing ricochets but me 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.580
 very fine hockey grata on me her 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.820
 where you can choose beautiful from thanks 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.820
 you are welcome 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.530
 squirrels peacefully 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.140
 although for various issues like what 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.850
 after preparing Omsk youth such 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.310
 as far as Obninsk taught 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.540
 youth in general as far as the quality of the game 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.360
 and and works to satisfy but me 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.660
 young people liked it honestly but if 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.730
 preparation is hard to tell bye 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.440
 because they move two matches afterwards 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.320
 silence a little let go but the poison 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.610
 rejuvenated but talented players here 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.260
 I don't like much Omsk school here 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.100
 Much burning did not see our second 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.400
 the team there was also told that there were people 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:04:00.780
 good but can not put on the ceremony 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:04.080
 I can't run on board 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:08.010
 to the board because i can't take five 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.350
 five young play you never know it yes 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.830
 and show you one motive and said later 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.470
 then enrage and then it's hard for them 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.130
 but that he scored the most beautiful two times 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.060
 the video is scored by sigal came to us and not 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.410
 beat so although this difference is huge 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.930
 Mesa Junior 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.930
 and the main team is a huge difference 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.460
 team for 5 years no man like that 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.789
 kokurin player to keep even state 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.789
 meaning 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:58.780
 until I satisfied with that, and that's Rybakina 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.780
 blacksmiths return and what a blacksmith 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.610
 blacksmiths eat blacksmiths plays fine 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:12.129
 rebecca but on dissociation we get two 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:17.800
 I do not play games 3 even turned out 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:20.469
 and in this series someone's homework 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.919
 informed turn back 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:30.039
 plush goulash but can't see the daw frying that 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.409
 for example, the testicle does not play 2 links as he 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:37.479
 played for played very cool practically 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:40.179
 victory victorious mother made the steering wheel 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.999
 also raise your level with 

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:45.879
 boot too 2 managers beat very cool 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:58.059
 until we see we see crawled I think 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:06:01.149
 Only kulash not so of course kuryanov 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:04.839
 played here in Omsk he played with the pop 

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:07.300
 Perry loved ones can not know I do not know 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:11.379
 reasons i will ask reason because 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.929
 we can be a lucky player but i'm not 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:17.919
 I know last year they did not play 

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:19.919
 bad so his path took but you can 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.719
 not somewhere i'm his team 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:27.069
 the reason this question is seriously can 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:29.249
 say that we think about it but again not 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:34.319
 late mega to which and the other team 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:41.769
 let go again we will rush here 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:43.990
 very very hard to take said well and not 

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:47.589
 cottage score 1 composition I play so I do not 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:51.519
 I know and then we do not think because to us 

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:56.550
 a little bit but on the other hand 

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:58.840
 someone was fired of course because 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.129
 some don't do the task like you 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.240
 should incomprehensible and this is with 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:10.740
 foreigners have already said goodbye 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.740
 right now will come on home 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:24.290
 there is an understanding that you need to take the train 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:26.560
 leaves at all I sit quietly at home we sleep 

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.560
 calmly 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.150
 not sensitive 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.950
 everyone every do what we can every 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:40.010
 encouraged there but the main thing is to 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:43.090
 the guys did the guys did raised 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:48.350
 a task which we already are worried brother 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:50.390
 defense there came three practically 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.780
 players who have not played yet 

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:56.660
 this shows that there is a problem on 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:59.690
 the clearing not attacked like me 

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:02.330
 said complicated things we don't need 

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.980
 serious unnecessary therefore necessary 

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.810
 understand this were clutch 

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.190
 the game will talk again 

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.190
 gaming up clutch
