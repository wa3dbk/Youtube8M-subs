nanny<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.629> training<00:00:55.079> most<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> time

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
nanny will be training most of the time

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.240 
nanny will be training most of the time
outside<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> United<00:00:58.500> States<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
outside of the United States and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.880 
outside of the United States and
therefore<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
therefore they have to have the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.090 
therefore they have to have the
wherewithal<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.239> survey's<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.830> those

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
wherewithal the survey's to do those

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
wherewithal the survey's to do those
fish<00:01:05.600> right<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.140> basically

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
fish right so that's basically

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.280 
fish right so that's basically
eliminates<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> solder<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:10.110> would<00:01:10.260> have

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
eliminates you solder so you would have

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.090 
eliminates you solder so you would have
to<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:12.619> cash<00:01:14.180> prize<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:16.229> does<00:01:16.439> bother

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.270 

me<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.729> don't<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.229> problem<00:01:22.280> just

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
me I don't think that's a problem just

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
me I don't think that's a problem just
