collage came somewhere when I wanted to

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.540 
collage came somewhere when I wanted to
work<00:01:10.510> faster<00:01:11.020> I<00:01:11.050> think<00:01:11.380> started<00:01:12.130> speeding<00:01:12.340> up

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
work faster I think started speeding up

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.359 
work faster I think started speeding up
my<00:01:12.640> process<00:01:13.800> grabbing<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:14.860> full<00:01:15.070> sheet<00:01:15.250> of

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
my process grabbing a full sheet of

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.130 
my process grabbing a full sheet of
paper<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.759> glue<00:01:15.910> it<00:01:16.030> down<00:01:16.180> as<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.450> kind<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:17.050> way

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
paper to glue it down as a kind of a way

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.499 
paper to glue it down as a kind of a way
to<00:01:17.200> cover<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.619> canvas<00:01:17.979> faster<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:18.610> went<00:01:19.420> on

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
to cover the canvas faster and went on

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.680 
to cover the canvas faster and went on
from<00:01:19.690> there<00:01:20.550> here's<00:01:21.550> my<00:01:21.790> first<00:01:22.030> piece<00:01:22.330> in<00:01:22.570> the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
from there here's my first piece in the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.219 
from there here's my first piece in the
show

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
show

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.560 
show
I<00:01:23.259> like<00:01:23.650> how<00:01:23.830> far<00:01:24.220> away<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.940> can<00:01:25.119> see<00:01:25.420> the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
I like how far away you can see the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.749 
I like how far away you can see the
figure<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:25.930> can<00:01:26.320> see<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.619> intensity<00:01:27.520> in

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
figure you can see that intensity in

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.420 
figure you can see that intensity in
there<00:01:27.970> but<00:01:28.330> get<00:01:29.290> up<00:01:29.320> close<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.070> becomes

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
there but get up close and it becomes

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.940 
there but get up close and it becomes
this<00:01:30.640> combination<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.720> crazy<00:01:32.229> patterns<00:01:32.710> we've

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
this combination of crazy patterns we've

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.790 
this combination of crazy patterns we've
got<00:01:33.070> gears<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.880> harsh<00:01:34.119> things<00:01:34.450> but<00:01:35.080> hopefully

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
got gears and harsh things but hopefully

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.710 
got gears and harsh things but hopefully
they<00:01:35.950> add<00:01:36.100> up<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.280> something<00:01:36.820> living<00:01:37.119> and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
they add up to something living and

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.460 
they add up to something living and
breathing<00:01:38.680> my<00:01:39.040> kind<00:01:39.280> of<00:01:39.310> thing<00:01:40.229> usually<00:01:41.229> I'll

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
breathing my kind of thing usually I'll

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.170 
breathing my kind of thing usually I'll
start<00:01:41.710> with<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:41.860> simple<00:01:42.220> line<00:01:42.369> kind<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.940> kind<00:01:43.149> of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
start with a simple line kind of kind of

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.760 
start with a simple line kind of kind of
like<00:01:43.330> this<00:01:43.509> not<00:01:43.750> exactly<00:01:44.110> but<00:01:44.350> just<00:01:44.649> some

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
like this not exactly but just some

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.740 
like this not exactly but just some
simple<00:01:45.280> shapes<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.790> get<00:01:45.909> it<00:01:46.000> started<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.450> once

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
simple shapes to get it started and once

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.719 
simple shapes to get it started and once
I<00:01:46.840> have<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:46.990> picture<00:01:47.320> then<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.650> then<00:01:48.370> I<00:01:48.400> kind<00:01:48.670> of

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
I have a picture then I then I kind of

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.790 
I have a picture then I then I kind of
recreate<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.390> see<00:01:49.900> how<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.170> see<00:01:50.320> how<00:01:50.380> far<00:01:50.620> away

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
recreate it see how it see how far away

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.680 
recreate it see how it see how far away
from<00:01:50.860> reality<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.460> can<00:01:51.700> make<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.090> but<00:01:52.360> using

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
from reality I can make it but using

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.680 
from reality I can make it but using
using<00:01:53.560> my<00:01:53.650> pieces<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.010> paper<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.640> want<00:01:55.630> to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
using my pieces of paper I want to

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.050 
using my pieces of paper I want to
create<00:01:55.870> that<00:01:56.020> living<00:01:56.380> being<00:01:56.590> but<00:01:57.549> I<00:01:57.580> try<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:57.880> do

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
create that living being but I try to do

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.210 
create that living being but I try to do
it<00:01:58.180> out<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.540> things<00:01:59.470> that<00:01:59.530> are<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.799> opposite

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
it out of things that are the opposite

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.680 
it out of things that are the opposite
things<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.580> are<00:02:00.670> designed<00:02:01.030> things<00:02:01.479> that<00:02:01.600> are

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.969 
man-made things that you wouldn't think
of<00:02:03.970> as<00:02:04.090> art<00:02:04.299> maybe<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.810> try<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:04.960> reuse<00:02:05.710> those

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
of as art maybe and try to reuse those

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.880 
of as art maybe and try to reuse those
and<00:02:06.250> create<00:02:06.430> a<00:02:06.460> new<00:02:06.640> context<00:02:07.270> where<00:02:07.420> it

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
and create a new context where it

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.270 
and create a new context where it
conveys<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.920> person<00:02:10.799> opposites<00:02:11.799> I<00:02:11.920> like<00:02:12.070> think

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
conveys a person opposites I like think

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.830

some<00:02:12.459> things<00:02:12.489> that<00:02:12.790> are<00:02:12.850> really<00:02:13.060> close<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.720> you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
some things that are really close to you

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840 
some things that are really close to you
some<00:02:14.200> things<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.530> are<00:02:14.620> far<00:02:14.830> away<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:15.670> it

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
some things that are far away if it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.280 
some things that are far away if it
looks<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.360> would<00:02:16.420> be<00:02:16.480> difficult<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:17.049> use

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
looks like it would be difficult to use

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.289 
looks like it would be difficult to use
then<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.890> grabbed<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.640> wanted<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.150> be

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
then I I grabbed that I wanted to be

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.680 
then I I grabbed that I wanted to be
something<00:02:19.630> as<00:02:20.310> challenging<00:02:21.310> as<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.299> good<00:02:22.510> piece

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
something as challenging as a good piece

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.789 
something as challenging as a good piece
I<00:02:24.330> try<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.390> set<00:02:25.600> myself<00:02:25.750> up<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.350> struggle<00:02:26.769> a

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
I try to set myself up to struggle a

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.740 
I try to set myself up to struggle a
little<00:02:26.890> bit<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.340> don't<00:02:27.519> don't<00:02:28.180> plan<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.540> all

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
little bit you don't don't plan it all

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.610 
little bit you don't don't plan it all
out<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:29.220> if<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.459> try<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:31.690> render<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.140> picture

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
out I if I try to just render a picture

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.170 
out I if I try to just render a picture
I<00:02:32.920> could<00:02:33.100> do<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> pretty<00:02:33.489> good<00:02:33.580> job<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.150> but

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
I could do a pretty good job of it but

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.150 
I could do a pretty good job of it but
it<00:02:34.480> would<00:02:34.600> just<00:02:34.630> be<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:35.830> is<00:02:35.890> like

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
it would just be that so this is like

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.100 
it would just be that so this is like
having<00:02:36.670> collaborators<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.540> help<00:02:37.810> me<00:02:37.900> make<00:02:38.080> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
having collaborators to help me make it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:53.110 
having collaborators to help me make it
better<00:02:38.440> than<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.310> would<00:02:39.489> have<00:02:39.549> been

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.059 

move<00:02:54.120> all<00:02:54.269> around<00:02:54.389> a<00:02:54.810> try<00:02:54.959> go<00:02:55.019> fast<00:02:55.349> when<00:02:55.859> I<00:02:55.889> was

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
move all around a try go fast when I was

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.429 
move all around a try go fast when I was
a<00:02:56.099> kid<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.340> was<00:02:56.549> very<00:02:56.609> tight<00:02:57.090> with<00:02:57.269> my<00:02:57.420> art<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:57.840> I

a kid I was very tight with my art and I

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.550 
a kid I was very tight with my art and I
eventually<00:02:58.590> got<00:02:58.889> turned<00:02:59.129> on<00:02:59.310> to<00:03:00.379> making<00:03:01.379> it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
eventually got turned on to making it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.420 
eventually got turned on to making it

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
aspects of precision and planning but

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.320 
aspects of precision and planning but
then<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.980> know<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.280> thrill<00:03:45.060> of

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
I like it when I see somebody really put

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.570 
I like it when I see somebody really put
together<00:03:59.990> and<00:04:00.440> deliberate<00:04:00.950> who<00:04:01.100> comes<00:04:01.340> into

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
together and deliberate who comes into

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.550 
together and deliberate who comes into
the<00:04:01.670> art<00:04:01.820> gallery<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.900> there<00:04:03.050> you<00:04:03.290> know<00:04:03.410> they

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
the art gallery and there you know they

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.430 
the art gallery and there you know they
compose<00:04:04.400> themselves<00:04:04.640> every<00:04:05.600> day<00:04:05.630> they<00:04:06.230> come

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
compose themselves every day they come

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.290 
compose themselves every day they come
in<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.800> they<00:04:06.950> melt<00:04:07.520> a<00:04:07.730> little<00:04:07.850> bit

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
in and they melt a little bit

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.630 
in and they melt a little bit
seeing<00:04:08.660> this<00:04:08.930> sensory<00:04:09.380> stuff<00:04:09.800> and<00:04:10.100> you<00:04:10.460> can

seeing this sensory stuff and you can

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.370 
seeing this sensory stuff and you can
see<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:11.060> maybe<00:04:11.630> they've<00:04:11.900> thought<00:04:12.260> of

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
see it maybe they've thought of

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.020 
see it maybe they've thought of
something<00:04:12.680> new<00:04:12.800> or<00:04:13.070> thought<00:04:13.580> of<00:04:13.700> something

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
something new or thought of something

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050
