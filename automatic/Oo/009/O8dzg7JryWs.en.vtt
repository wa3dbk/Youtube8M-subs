00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.890 
you're not supposed to because this is
what<00:02:34.480> they<00:02:34.600> call<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.810> low-density<00:02:35.700> concrete

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
what they call a low-density concrete

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.860 
what they call a low-density concrete
it's<00:02:37.900> got<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> lot<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.470> airspace<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.610> there<00:02:39.870> you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
it's got a lot of airspace in there you

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.620 
it's got a lot of airspace in there you
want<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.230> high<00:02:41.410> strength<00:02:41.890> concrete<00:02:42.670> pad

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
want the high strength concrete pad

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:55.230 
want the high strength concrete pad
appears<00:02:51.960> it's<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.140> same<00:02:53.350> thing<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
appears it's the same thing with the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.190 
appears it's the same thing with the
magic<00:02:55.810> yet<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.180> want<00:02:58.360> your<00:02:58.510> peer<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:59.080> your

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
magic yet but you want your peer on your

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.390 
magic yet but you want your peer on your
pads<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.910> be<00:03:01.120> high<00:03:01.990> strength<00:03:02.530> concrete<00:03:03.220> and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
pads to be high strength concrete and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.260 
pads to be high strength concrete and
what<00:03:04.120> they<00:03:04.300> do<00:03:04.710> is<00:03:05.710> they'll<00:03:06.160> have<00:03:06.400> these<00:03:06.640> 16<00:03:07.120> by

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
what they do is they'll have these 16 by

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.760 
what they do is they'll have these 16 by
16<00:03:07.330> pads<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.590> they'll<00:03:08.830> have<00:03:09.010> rebar<00:03:09.520> in<00:03:10.360> there

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
16 pads and they'll have rebar in there

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.590 
16 pads and they'll have rebar in there
so<00:03:11.770> that<00:03:11.800> if<00:03:12.220> for<00:03:12.250> any<00:03:12.520> reason<00:03:12.640> they<00:03:13.090> do<00:03:13.270> crack

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
so that if for any reason they do crack

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.980 
so that if for any reason they do crack
that<00:03:14.140> rebar<00:03:14.650> is<00:03:14.800> gonna<00:03:14.950> hold<00:03:15.160> them<00:03:15.310> together

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
that rebar is gonna hold them together

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.790 
that rebar is gonna hold them together
because<00:03:16.990> if<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.860> get<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.100> pad<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:19.180> breaks

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
because if you get a pad and it breaks

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.140 
because if you get a pad and it breaks
then<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:20.920> period<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.400> sitting<00:03:21.640> in<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.880> middle

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
then you period it sitting in the middle

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.540 
then you period it sitting in the middle
as<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.690> can<00:03:22.810> see<00:03:22.990> what<00:03:23.170> happens<00:03:23.620> if<00:03:24.070> Brian

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
as you can see what happens if Brian

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.170 
as you can see what happens if Brian
sent<00:03:24.880> in<00:03:25.030> your<00:03:25.080> your<00:03:26.080> Peters<00:03:26.530> follow<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:28.030> then

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
sent in your your Peters follow and then

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.930 
sent in your your Peters follow and then
you're<00:03:28.300> back<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.780> same<00:03:29.460> spot<00:03:30.460> that<00:03:30.640> you

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
you're back to the same spot that you

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.370 
you're back to the same spot that you
wear<00:03:31.180> here<00:03:31.390> before<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.900> even<00:03:32.080> have<00:03:32.260> the
