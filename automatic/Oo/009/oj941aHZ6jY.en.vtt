00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.009
 hey ho people and welcome 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.879
 here for another video from moni 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.200
 I wanted to introduce you to my newest 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.210
 invention before and that a little 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.170
 minecraft ufo I have something already 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.660
 some time ago for the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.490
 singleplayer built or he 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.650
 said for the server without 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.600
 comment box and now there is the whole 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 but with commons but next to it 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.630
 to be a bit cool person 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.699
 I will show you shortly 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.480
 looks this shore and here we have 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.880
 the whole part 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.529
 I tried it anyway good as 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.939
 possible to make one remember and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.669
 It actually looks really cool 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.820
 me and of course it's really cool too 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.200
 effects that I will show you soon 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.399
 well i like this part anyway 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.280
 I like it is nice and small 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.510
 compact and can be quite a lot for you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.370
 can do the whole part manually and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.070
 What exactly do I do with it? 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.989
 I will show you mine now 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.110
 For that I will control myself first 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.239
 give items why here we have them with us 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.750
 which i can down my level 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.489
 up through the blocks of course 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.890
 that means this through the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.000
 blocks fly left to right 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.770
 steer forwards and backwards 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.960
 Of course the coolest thing to mention 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.030
 have a bet laser here that is 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.040
 when I activate this 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.720
 You drop down here 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.640
 a ray out home market and the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.890
 Of course kills pug and that's right 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.970
 quick to be honest i would 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.729
 Show whole times briefly 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.810
 for that I would have my mine off and 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.430
 Let me have the beard laser for you 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.000
 it was dead talking 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.650
 it really is within seconds it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.520
 really deadly and if I now the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.350
 coolest show 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.049
 Of course there is one for this 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.500
 dynamic lawyer if I say so 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.390
 can 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.310
 he works here dynamically for the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.829
 mobs that means I would be here one now 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.710
 activate dynamic pack 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.600
 and i would use the ufo on mine 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.650
 dynamic I would fly now 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.720
 Of course you want to have built before 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.760
 and it was just I was receiving the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.520
 is really shit but it would have to 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.590
 Go as you see it on the go 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.180
 dynamic rudder is it lies on the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.570
 dynamically on the dynamic router 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.190
 and forth 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.930
 Here I also have the possibility 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.650
 the height to adjust something that is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.120
 I can fly down a bit 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.210
 but not much because that will be here 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.800
 again at least most cases blocked 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.260
 I thought it would have to go upstairs 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.940
 wee bit can go up 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.110
 you control it a bit more 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.570
 You can also the height a little 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.250
 slightly misrepresent and this partial 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.320
 as long as you depart so far 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.540
 Something is no more lust I want 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.150
 that and where do I do this little one ? 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.490
 just part away now I will be you 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.770
 show something cool and mine 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.570
 dynamic laser is probably already 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.160
 You know that some other videos 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.020
 Of course it also sounds like I'm using it 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.990
 here the guardians there that we have them 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.890
 simply the coolest looks like I think 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.870
 and I'll take mine now 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.610
 dynamic fly on a small 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.920
 If you 're a bit under it 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.440
 it's a bit too perfect too 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.390
 my route and from here i can 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.739
 now, of course , that was still part of it 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.810
 a little further down I give myself 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.670
 now game 0 that means with the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.800
 You can play games with dynamic lasers 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.080
 As you can see, the title match was 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.640
 Of course we do not want to let that happen 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.989
 yes i think 11 know me 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.860
 already a stand such a small 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.220
 damage is said when your gaze comes then 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.300
 it does not work that way but looked 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.220
 You can see that is somewhere but then 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.090
 harms players and that 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.100
 actually a cool thing 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.870
 I'll show you how to do it for a while 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.690
 this dynamic hut programs that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.800
 is not difficult at all 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.640
 Incidentally, if you continued the whole part 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.470
 it stays that way 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.660
 So you can continue from that one 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.150
 Violence that does not matter loud there 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.840
 stand where it turns off so really ne 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.590
 cool thing 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.720
 then I will be able to do everything here 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.140
 It's really very easy to be honest 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.790
 to be 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.110
 to show through the dynamic stage 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.299
 I'll go outside for a while 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.920
 go and look down 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.890
 There you will see that you have one 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.330
 ordered from the best 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.370
 that means I can do this series 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.709
 slopes my route plan 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.209
 that is, I would like to say now 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.750
 The route should not be there forwards 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:21.180
 but once after in here 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:23.070
 and then not back to no 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.390
 down and beautiful forward 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.490
 I can do that, of course 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.690
 remove now is the route 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.780
 broke in that means I can now 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.730
 Continue in the side of the pack 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.000
 I too will work the whole thing 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.760
 just show me by myself 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.710
 a new shore sentences let's go that 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.810
 control panel again with it one 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.950
 looks a bit nicer 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.260
 then, of course, we will open up for now 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.210
 my google fly into a little one 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.490
 bit go down now reads 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.630
 you are there 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.919
 I have my route he's right 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.880
 Maybe it's on 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:01.470
 that would be relatively useful but 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.630
 unfortunately too fast for it as you said 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.860
 just have to play around a bit 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.050
 now you should actually see that 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.460
 this good goes inside and she 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.060
 requires inside to run backwards 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.590
 and forward 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.600
 that is, therefore, the easy one 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.200
 route for families from the shore 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.850
 should fly 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.640
 and it 's really very, very , really 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.570
 It was just that, too 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.919
 already to my invention 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.180
 Of course, now some wet 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.360
 I will be interested in the technique 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.500
 Show whole and just for a short time 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.260
 I fly outside and that was 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.190
 probably the door with us 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.610
 I hope that was not too loud 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.200
 with you but good that here is everything 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.910
 there is more behind it now 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.710
 that's not what it is 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.700
 simply this whole part is here around 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.590
 to stretch the shore 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.650
 everything with different this around too 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.110
 to present effects relatively well 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.390
 then we have our menu here that is 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.380
 pushes us in the hand then we have 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:55.919
 Here is a flow for the coat of arms of the lava 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.510
 particle the godfather just pate me the end 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.370
 this with the name button up and 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.440
 down so that's a better effect 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.640
 shows how exactly this works 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.070
 Now I can explain it to you 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.510
 come show up 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.330
 So he really is not 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.820
 long to be 11 and actually too 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.640
 very simple 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.530
 then we have some special ones here 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.130
 settings like the scores put 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.210
 Call for the award of a particle and so on 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.920
 we have only general here 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.010
 set settings like direction block 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.720
 that it just felt in the ufos that is 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.100
 I have a test blocks for test purposes 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.800
 here and now a little something 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.350
 to test here this little klotz 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.480
 this is here to set the route 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.630
 that is, there is nothing more than this 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.940
 chunk of looking after them and this 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.630
 then just back and forth controls 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.830
 This blog is only here for the sake of the 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.410
 rescue mechanism then again 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.860
 to remove what exactly I mean by that 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.510
 does not matter he applies to everyone 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.150
 case here then an ambos closely with the 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.250
 names damage that's all on again 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:02.540
 a bit tricky then I still have here 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:04.430
 a few test blocks ago the more of the 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.260
 electrical items flottest with the 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.480
 item in it 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.710
 and whichever I am 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.660
 have selected the answering my 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.990
 mainufer in the direction in which I the 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.090
 want 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.790
 actually a simple one 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.290
 But dozens of people are themselves 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.630
 who are familiar with it right 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.700
 complicated I would me earlier what you 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.930
 you can download from it you can download 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.030
 the whole thing it is all in the 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.840
 description and yes to the best video 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.070
 I would be back then
