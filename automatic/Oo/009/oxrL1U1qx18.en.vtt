00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.660 
effect when they're used in sequence
like<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.290> first<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> whip<00:01:44.549> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
like that so first you want to whip it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.160 
like that so first you want to whip it
out<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.430> put<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> back<00:01:48.110> okay<00:01:49.110> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
out and then just put it back okay so

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.510 
out and then just put it back okay so
this<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> last<00:01:49.860> trick<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> show

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
this is the last trick I'm going to show

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
this is the last trick I'm going to show
you<00:01:50.549> for<00:01:50.820> today<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.049> probably<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> most

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you for today and probably the most

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.190 
you for today and probably the most
complex<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.950> too<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.329> has<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.810> same<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.170> E

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
complex one too so it has the same it E

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.109 
complex one too so it has the same it E
as<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.350> first<00:01:55.680> trick<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.950> showed<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.340> except

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
as the first trick I showed you except

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.709 
as the first trick I showed you except
with<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.270> little<00:01:57.479> twist<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:59.540> you'll<00:02:00.540> see

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
with a little twist to it you'll see

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.969 
with a little twist to it you'll see
that<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> moment<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.799> want<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that in the moment so what you want to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
that in the moment so what you want to
do<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.130> grab<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> banana<00:02:02.909> keep<00:02:03.840> your<00:02:03.930> thumb<00:02:04.110> at

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
do is grab the banana keep your thumb at

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
do is grab the banana keep your thumb at
the<00:02:04.290> base<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.740> banana<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.369> which

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the base of the banana like this which

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.609 
the base of the banana like this which
one<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> twist<00:02:07.079> your<00:02:07.170> wrists<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
one is going to twist your wrists and

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.279 
one is going to twist your wrists and
let<00:02:08.429> go<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.759> bit<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.629> your<00:02:09.750> thumb<00:02:09.959> so

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
let go a little bit with your thumb so

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.100 
let go a little bit with your thumb so
just<00:02:10.730> gravity<00:02:11.730> should<00:02:12.030> do<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.660> rest<00:02:12.780> like

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
just gravity should do the rest like

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.370 
just gravity should do the rest like
that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.540 
that
your<00:02:13.560> thumb<00:02:13.740> will<00:02:13.890> end<00:02:14.010> up<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> other<00:02:14.430> side

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
your thumb will end up on the other side

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.630 
your thumb will end up on the other side
of<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> banana<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.310> spin

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
of the banana like that and you can spin

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.940 
of the banana like that and you can spin
it<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.940> reverse<00:02:18.210> direction<00:02:18.770> like<00:02:19.770> that

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
it in the reverse direction like that

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.510 
it in the reverse direction like that
and<00:02:20.690> yeah<00:02:21.690> now<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.560> really<00:02:22.860> cool<00:02:22.980> thing<00:02:23.400> with

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
and yeah now the really cool thing with

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520 
and yeah now the really cool thing with
this<00:02:23.640> trick<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.930> get<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.290> banana

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
this trick is if you can get the banana

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.140 
this trick is if you can get the banana
spinning<00:02:25.770> back<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.160> forth<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:27.030> fast

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
spinning back and forth really fast

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.050 
spinning back and forth really fast
continuously<00:02:28.310> it'll<00:02:29.310> look<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.610> cool<00:02:29.880> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
continuously it'll look really cool and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.290 
just kind of grease it up a bit and then
just<00:03:11.850> spin<00:03:12.180> around<00:03:12.210> oh<00:03:13.580> what<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.610> smooth<00:03:15.090> that

just spin around oh what the smooth that

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.260 
just spin around oh what the smooth that
was<00:03:16.190> okay<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.250> now<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.550> only<00:03:17.880> problem<00:03:18.210> with

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
was okay so now the only problem with

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.300 
was okay so now the only problem with
doing<00:03:18.510> these<00:03:18.750> tricks<00:03:19.080> is<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.440> after<00:03:19.980> doesn't

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
doing these tricks is that after doesn't

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.890 
doing these tricks is that after doesn't
playing<00:03:20.490> with<00:03:20.670> your<00:03:20.820> banana<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:21.360> your<00:03:21.720> hands

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900
