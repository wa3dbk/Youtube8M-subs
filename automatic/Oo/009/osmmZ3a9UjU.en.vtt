00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.570
 I think the user well with a per child 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.620
 adventurous hour I took a guess 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.160
 that this contact was made by a 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.370
 person who is young and who is thinking 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.710
 in the future who is thinking of a planet 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.700
 more sustainable I think he went 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.380
 made just for us to be able to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.050
 discovered how you do not 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.050
 I'll send the car five years from now but the car 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.809
 like every front designer and had a 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.930
 series of style details that were 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.650
 very creative 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.660
 the color is fantastic yellow and so 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.140
 arrive and drown 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.790
 I think the driver is in the middle of it. 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.290
 one person on each side 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.110
 It is a competition that is very attentive because 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.050
 I've never seen those houses side is 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.860
 It's practical to open the inside too. 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:16.000
 very spacious the works hope 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.270
 I really liked someone with a robust self. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.650
 I like him because he's a jeep. 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.660
 robust that gives an impression of being 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.480
 armored gives me security 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:30.700
 I would say that in the northeast region beaches 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.710
 dunes by his model wheel 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.510
 I think this possibility at the time 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.060
 She said drone, I thought to what? 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:43.210
 the drone, but then she told the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:46.120
 benfica tv in front of propose to new 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.700
 ideas and show a daring reign in the 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.800
 I find interesting concept cars that 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:57.119
 following this innovative modern line 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:02.189
 bold spectacle 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:06.580
 fantastic and stripped futuristic 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.960
 relaxed and creative modern practical 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.569
 is dashing 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.569
 I see how the segment a niche 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.760
 market as we say, but I believe 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.260
 that there should be interested in the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.260
 proposal seems very interesting.
