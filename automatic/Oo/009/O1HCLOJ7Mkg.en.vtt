of<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> guide<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> tell<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.280> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
of the guide I want to tell you that I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.729 
of the guide I want to tell you that I
will<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:48.030> marking<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> pistols<00:00:48.930> against<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
will be marking the pistols against the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
will be marking the pistols against the
other<00:00:50.219> weapons<00:00:50.550> I've<00:00:50.730> already<00:00:50.940> covered<00:00:51.300> so

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
other weapons I've already covered so

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.540 
other weapons I've already covered so
that's<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.140> long<00:00:52.350> guns<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.340> power

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that's the long guns and the power

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.910 
that's the long guns and the power
weapons<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.420> probably<00:00:54.989> means<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
weapons this probably means that the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.290 
weapons this probably means that the
pistols<00:00:56.370> won't<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.820> getting<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> highest

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
pistols won't be getting the highest

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.360 
pistols won't be getting the highest
ratings<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.320> don't<00:00:58.530> take<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> bad

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
ratings but don't take that as a bad

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.619 
ratings but don't take that as a bad
thing<00:00:59.399> because<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.329> pistols<00:01:00.750> are<00:01:01.070> still<00:01:02.070> good

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
thing because the pistols are still good

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
thing because the pistols are still good
so<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.049> power<00:01:04.229> 9<00:01:04.559> carries<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.129> total<00:01:05.580> of

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
so the power 9 carries a total of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.580 
so the power 9 carries a total of
fifteen<00:01:06.090> bullets<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> clip<00:01:06.900> whilst<00:01:07.439> you

not too bad at anything the pros and

not too bad at anything the pros and
cons<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> gun<00:02:18.900> well<00:02:19.440> let's<00:02:19.590> start<00:02:19.800> with

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
cons of the gun well let's start with

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.060 
cons of the gun well let's start with
the<00:02:20.040> pros<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.370> pros<00:02:20.850> are<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.500> has<00:02:22.830> an

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
the pros the pros are that it has an

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.740 
the pros the pros are that it has an
incredible<00:02:23.790> rate<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.210> fire<00:02:24.450> for<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
incredible rate of fire for a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.070 
incredible rate of fire for a
semi-automatic<00:02:25.470> gun<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.340> can<00:02:26.520> be<00:02:26.780> fired<00:02:27.780> as

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
semi-automatic gun it can be fired as

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.450 
semi-automatic gun it can be fired as
fast<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.890> pull<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.190> trigger

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
fast as you can pull the trigger

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.340 
fast as you can pull the trigger
basically<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.480> course<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.870> has<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> downside

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
basically of course this has a downside

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.610 
basically of course this has a downside
of<00:02:31.770> making<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> recall<00:02:33.080> spasm<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.170> go<00:02:34.320> wild

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
of making the recall spasm and go wild

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.650 
of making the recall spasm and go wild
out<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> control<00:02:35.130> sometimes<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:36.480> with<00:02:36.630> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
out of control sometimes but with a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.720 
out of control sometimes but with a
little<00:02:36.900> bit<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.200> self-control<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.490> pull

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
little bit of self-control you can pull

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.620 
little bit of self-control you can pull
off<00:02:38.760> really<00:02:39.300> accurate<00:02:39.750> shots<00:02:40.050> with<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.380> gun

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
off really accurate shots with this gun

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.630 
off really accurate shots with this gun
the<00:02:42.630> second<00:02:43.050> biggest<00:02:43.260> Pro<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.160> paranoia

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
the second biggest Pro that the paranoia

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.850 
the second biggest Pro that the paranoia
has<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.720> has<00:02:45.930> an<00:02:46.200> incredible

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
has is that it has an incredible

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.610 
has is that it has an incredible
blindfire<00:02:47.520> if<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.570> mod<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.050> as<00:02:49.200> well<00:02:49.350> this

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
blindfire if you mod this as well this

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.980 
blindfire if you mod this as well this
really<00:02:50.100> complements<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> gun<00:02:51.030> being<00:02:51.540> able<00:02:51.870> to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
really complements the gun being able to

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.320 
really complements the gun being able to
blind<00:02:52.290> fire<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:52.710> disco<00:02:53.010> against<00:02:53.820> someone<00:02:54.180> in

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
blind fire with disco against someone in

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.350 
blind fire with disco against someone in
a<00:02:54.420> close<00:02:54.690> quarter<00:02:55.230> situation<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.090> really<00:02:57.090> good

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
a close quarter situation is really good

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.320 
a close quarter situation is really good
and<00:02:57.600> can<00:02:58.380> pretty<00:02:58.680> much<00:02:58.770> win<00:02:59.280> against<00:03:00.000> most

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and can pretty much win against most

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.540 
and can pretty much win against most
other<00:03:00.720> guns<00:03:00.960> apart<00:03:01.770> from<00:03:01.890> maybe<00:03:02.130> some<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.490> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
other guns apart from maybe some of the

other guns apart from maybe some of the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
guns that specialize at close combat

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.530 
guns that specialize at close combat
situations<00:03:05.100> like<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.400> cow<00:03:05.580> 7<00:03:05.970> or<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.390> arm

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
situations like the cow 7 or the arm

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.690 
situations like the cow 7 or the arm
micro<00:03:07.820> now<00:03:08.820> these<00:03:09.210> are<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.750> two<00:03:09.990> biggest<00:03:10.700> pros

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
micro now these are the two biggest pros

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.470 
micro now these are the two biggest pros
that<00:03:11.940> stand<00:03:12.270> out<00:03:12.450> with<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.840> paradigm<00:03:13.800> for<00:03:14.070> me

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
that stand out with the paradigm for me

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.090 
that stand out with the paradigm for me
everything<00:03:15.480> else<00:03:15.660> seems<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:16.080> be<00:03:16.700> average<00:03:19.100> but

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
everything else seems to be average but

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.030 
everything else seems to be average but
that<00:03:20.280> being<00:03:20.430> said<00:03:20.490> if<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.810> pros<00:03:22.080> aren't<00:03:22.560> that

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
that being said if the pros aren't that

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.010 
that being said if the pros aren't that
many<00:03:23.220> than<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.700> cons<00:03:23.940> aren't<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.450> many<00:03:24.630> I've

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
many than the cons aren't that many I've

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.449 
many than the cons aren't that many I've
pretty<00:03:25.290> much<00:03:25.380> already<00:03:25.650> covered<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.190> only

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
pretty much already covered the only

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.240 
pretty much already covered the only
biggest<00:03:26.760> con<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.360> gun<00:03:27.570> has<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.709> is<00:03:28.890> that

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
biggest con the gun has and that is that

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.390 
biggest con the gun has and that is that
the<00:03:29.370> recall<00:03:29.940> can<00:03:30.270> be<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.540> bit<00:03:30.990> wild<00:03:31.800> especially

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
the recall can be a bit wild especially

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.750 
the recall can be a bit wild especially
if<00:03:32.490> you<00:03:32.610> spam<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.180> fire<00:03:33.390> trigger<00:03:33.780> too<00:03:33.959> fast
