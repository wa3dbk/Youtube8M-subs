00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
whatever if it's in Kodi it's going to

so<00:02:13.750> for<00:02:14.750> example<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.580> some<00:02:16.780> TV<00:02:17.780> shows<00:02:18.019> that

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
so for example I have some TV shows that

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.460 
so for example I have some TV shows that
are<00:02:18.739> on<00:02:19.329> encoding<00:02:20.329> right<00:02:20.540> now<00:02:20.689> so<00:02:20.930> once<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.290> hit

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
are on encoding right now so once I hit

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.860 
are on encoding right now so once I hit
this<00:02:21.650> button<00:02:21.709> here<00:02:22.069> all<00:02:22.790> those<00:02:23.090> TV<00:02:23.420> shows<00:02:23.450> are

this button here all those TV shows are

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.319 
this button here all those TV shows are
going<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.260> be<00:02:24.439> shared<00:02:25.069> out<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.849> every<00:02:26.180> other

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
device that supports UPnP so that could

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.680 
device that supports UPnP so that could
be<00:02:29.659> my<00:02:29.900> xbox<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.739> ps4<00:02:31.730> my<00:02:32.629> Mac<00:02:33.079> through<00:02:33.829> via<00:02:34.690> VLC

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
be my xbox a ps4 my Mac through via VLC

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.280 
be my xbox a ps4 my Mac through via VLC
or<00:02:36.819> me<00:02:37.819> I<00:02:37.849> don't<00:02:38.329> know<00:02:38.390> anything<00:02:38.599> else<00:02:39.140> that

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
or me I don't know anything else that

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.589 
or me I don't know anything else that
has<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.890> PNP<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.459> going<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:40.970> be<00:02:41.090> able<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.329> play

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
has you PNP is going to be able to play

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.890 
has you PNP is going to be able to play
this<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.530> don't<00:02:42.650> necessarily<00:02:43.370> have<00:02:43.549> to<00:02:43.579> have

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
this so I don't necessarily have to have

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.680 
this so I don't necessarily have to have
my<00:02:44.900> Raspberry<00:02:45.470> Pi<00:02:45.500> connected<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.450> whatever<00:02:47.450> I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
my Raspberry Pi connected to whatever I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.170 
my Raspberry Pi connected to whatever I
wanted<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.349> watch<00:02:48.650> these<00:02:49.010> TV<00:02:49.400> shows<00:02:49.430> on<00:02:49.909> it's

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
wanted to watch these TV shows on it's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.420 
wanted to watch these TV shows on it's
pretty<00:02:50.359> cool<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:50.930> we'll<00:02:51.650> set<00:02:51.889> that<00:02:51.920> up<00:02:52.129> right

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
pretty cool so we'll set that up right

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.309 
pretty cool so we'll set that up right
there<00:02:52.489> we'll<00:02:52.879> just<00:02:53.060> click<00:02:53.299> that<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.780> then<00:02:54.170> we

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
there we'll just click that and then we

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.099 
there we'll just click that and then we
can<00:02:54.349> allow<00:02:54.739> remote<00:02:55.280> control<00:02:55.700> via<00:02:55.909> UPnP<00:02:56.900> and

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
can allow remote control via UPnP and

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.490 
can allow remote control via UPnP and
that's<00:02:57.590> going<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.069> allow<00:02:58.370> me<00:02:58.639> to<00:02:58.909> control<00:02:59.629> the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
that's going to allow me to control the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.319 
that's going to allow me to control the
video<00:03:01.540> from<00:03:02.560> wherever<00:03:03.560> I'm<00:03:03.920> watching<00:03:04.549> it<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.299> I

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
video from wherever I'm watching it so I

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.170 
video from wherever I'm watching it so I
don't<00:03:05.599> have<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.959> rely<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.700> controlling<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
don't have to rely on controlling the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.420 
don't have to rely on controlling the
Raspberry<00:03:08.659> Pi<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.379> it's<00:03:09.620> not<00:03:09.799> necessarily

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
Raspberry Pi so it's not necessarily

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.250 
Raspberry Pi so it's not necessarily
just<00:03:10.609> a<00:03:12.790> screen<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.819> I'm<00:03:14.239> watching<00:03:14.599> an<00:03:14.930> art<00:03:15.139> I

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
just a screen that I'm watching an art I

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.369 
just a screen that I'm watching an art I
can<00:03:15.530> watch<00:03:15.889> and<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:17.299> can<00:03:17.540> control<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.109> I<00:03:18.230> can

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
can watch and I can control it I can

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.159 
can watch and I can control it I can
fast<00:03:18.620> forward<00:03:18.829> pause<00:03:19.299> play<00:03:20.299> rewind<00:03:20.629> and

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
fast forward pause play rewind and

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.390 
fast forward pause play rewind and
whatever<00:03:21.379> really<00:03:22.160> cool<00:03:22.459> very<00:03:22.849> easy<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.359> do<00:03:23.480> so

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
whatever really cool very easy to do so

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.789 
whatever really cool very easy to do so
we'll<00:03:25.400> set<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:25.639> up<00:03:25.790> I'll<00:03:26.480> go<00:03:26.599> back<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.290> we're

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
we'll set that up I'll go back and we're

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:28.300 
we'll set that up I'll go back and we're
set

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
set

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.039

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
check out what UPnP or DLNA looks like

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.720 
check out what UPnP or DLNA looks like
on<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.389> Xbox<00:03:38.900> one<00:03:38.989> as<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.739> can<00:03:39.919> see<00:03:40.099> I<00:03:40.370> was

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
long as you have this enabled you can

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.649 
long as you have this enabled you can
watch<00:05:47.159> it<00:05:47.370> from<00:05:47.610> whatever<00:05:47.849> so<00:05:48.300> if<00:05:48.389> you<00:05:48.509> don't

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
watch it from whatever so if you don't

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.540 
watch it from whatever so if you don't
like<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.960> interface<00:05:49.199> and<00:05:49.620> how<00:05:50.159> it<00:05:50.340> works

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
like the interface and how it works

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.700 
like the interface and how it works
there<00:05:50.849> fine<00:05:52.250> just<00:05:53.250> setup<00:05:54.240> UPnP<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.139> you'll<00:05:55.529> be

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
there fine just setup UPnP and you'll be

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.339 
there fine just setup UPnP and you'll be
able<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:56.009> view<00:05:56.190> it<00:05:56.370> on<00:05:56.520> whatever<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:57.539> want<00:05:57.810> as

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
able to view it on whatever you want as

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.100 
able to view it on whatever you want as
long<00:05:58.500> as<00:05:58.650> it<00:05:58.800> supports<00:05:58.949> you<00:05:59.310> PNV<00:05:59.960> so<00:06:00.960> I<00:06:00.990> think

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
long as it supports you PNV so I think

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.730 
long as it supports you PNV so I think
it's<00:06:01.379> a<00:06:01.440> great<00:06:01.830> option<00:06:02.340> a<00:06:02.699> great<00:06:02.940> feature<00:06:03.240> and

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
it's a great option a great feature and

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.219 
it's a great option a great feature and
everyone<00:06:04.740> I<00:06:04.949> believe<00:06:05.039> everyone<00:06:05.969> should

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
everyone I believe everyone should

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.619 
everyone I believe everyone should
enable<00:06:07.229> this<00:06:07.620> so<00:06:08.279> that<00:06:08.490> in<00:06:08.819> the<00:06:09.210> future<00:06:09.330> if

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:09.629 
enable this so that in the future if

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:11.450 
enable this so that in the future if
you're<00:06:09.810> not<00:06:09.930> even<00:06:10.199> using<00:06:10.620> it<00:06:10.889> now<00:06:11.069> in<00:06:11.370> the

you're not even using it now in the
future<00:06:11.789> you<00:06:11.940> can<00:06:12.150> use<00:06:12.360> it<00:06:12.539> it's<00:06:13.349> a<00:06:13.440> great<00:06:13.560> thing
