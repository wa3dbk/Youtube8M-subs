00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
do it myself you wouldn't dug me a

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.030 
do it myself you wouldn't dug me a
ladder<00:03:02.049> out<00:03:02.260> real<00:03:02.470> nice<00:03:02.620> guy<00:03:02.859> really

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
ladder out real nice guy really

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.350 
ladder out real nice guy really
appreciate<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:04.590> yeah

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.410 

so<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.660> first<00:03:12.959> net<00:03:13.500> goes<00:03:13.800> back<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.420> without

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
so the first net goes back on without

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.020 
so the first net goes back on without
any<00:03:15.660> taxpayer<00:03:16.140> funding<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.739> time<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.790> city

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
any taxpayer funding this time the city

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.920 
any taxpayer funding this time the city
probably<00:03:18.209> would've<00:03:18.450> figured<00:03:18.540> out<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> way<00:03:18.840> to

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
probably would've figured out a way to

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.229 
probably would've figured out a way to
spend<00:03:19.230> twenty<00:03:19.650> dollars<00:03:19.980> per<00:03:21.019> per<00:03:22.019> Ned<00:03:22.290> right

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
spend twenty dollars per per Ned right

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.699 
spend twenty dollars per per Ned right
you<00:03:24.239> know<00:03:24.360> once<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.660> add<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.019> labor<00:03:25.230> costs

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
you know once you add up the labor costs

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.960 
you know once you add up the labor costs
sure<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.310> would<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.430> been<00:03:26.549> at<00:03:26.670> least<00:03:26.730> that

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
sure it would have been at least that

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:50.110 
sure it would have been at least that
much

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.250 

No

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.860 

so<00:03:58.549> buckle<00:03:59.549> from<00:03:59.879> Manchester<00:04:00.420> or<00:04:00.540> libertarian

so buckle from Manchester or libertarian

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.489 
so buckle from Manchester or libertarian

upkeep then there's just not much reason
to<00:04:38.370> do<00:04:38.520> upkeep<00:04:40.099> it's<00:04:41.099> not<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.460> city<00:04:41.669> is

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
going to go out of business if they do a

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:53.780 
going to go out of business if they do a

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
but maybe just maybe they will have a

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.189 
but maybe just maybe they will have a
little<00:04:58.240> bit<00:04:58.389> of<00:04:58.419> competition<00:04:58.750> now<00:05:01.020> this<00:05:02.020> is

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199
