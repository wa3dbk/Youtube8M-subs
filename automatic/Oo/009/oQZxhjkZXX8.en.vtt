00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
i think it gives my face a little bit of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.830 
i think it gives my face a little bit of
a<00:01:19.140> shimmery<00:01:19.560> tone<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.030> don't<00:01:21.330> want<00:01:21.630> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
a shimmery tone which I don't want I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.539 
a shimmery tone which I don't want I
don't<00:01:21.869> want<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.470> shimmery<00:01:22.920> look<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.400> i<00:01:23.490> think
