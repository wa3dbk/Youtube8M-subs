00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.180
 thank you all after Aznar has created a subsidiary 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.639
 10 with an excellent defense 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.269
 while the ship sounds 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.639
 in Celtic music 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.230
 Clear 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.460
 caviar substitute smoked salmon or milk liquid cream pepper oil and 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.589
 salt and of course the pasta 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.369
 this time we will make ribbons 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.099
 to start a little oil to soften the pasta to the cooking water 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.540
 we season 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.020
 and that we throw the pasta tapes 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.590
 that grants them moss al dente important 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.970
 look in the box of the pasta the cooking time indicated by the manufacturer 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.060
 and we are going to cut the salmon 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.000
 winged to small pieces this time 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.520
 we use smoked salmon 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.940
 we have the recipe fresh salmon I prefer 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.970
 to be assisted in a fresco 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.190
 because as you will see 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.820
 Now what we will do will be 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.670
 add oil to the pan 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.670
 and sautÃ© not 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.430
 the salmon already ready we are going to measure the liquid cream 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.320
 We were going to soften cabbage 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.570
 a little milk because yes 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.210
 we avoid that we 3 weigh the sauce between excess 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.880
 stir, season, we are a little salt 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.500
 We were going to have to go seeing the fire 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:13.119
 for a period of about ten minutes 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:17.189
 After that time we will add the caviar 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.609
 the roe a quality substitute 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.659
 if it were authentic caviar 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.839
 this is not the best 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:29.109
 to tablespoons like your field with two parts 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.479
 but the official section of this type of their salary they sell in the market 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.399
 we have put the pasta 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.399
 in the theater we have placed in those pasta tapes 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:44.059
 and now we have to pour over 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.959
 think 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.029
 all our 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.269
 casals 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.269
 We could well the pasta with the sauce 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.799
 and now we will have a list 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.749
 to eat 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.799
 let's go over the ingredients and how these recipes are made 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.059
 he said that we have sprinkled last continental 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.039
 that requires more than 150 grams of fresh salmon pasta ribbons birth milk 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.609
 pepper salt oil 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.609
 and quality substitutes 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:28.299
 we cook the pasta at 20 'we cut the salmon small states and we suffer them 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.569
 add the milk and cream and let it boil about ten minutes and 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.029
 Then we add the caviar and put the pasta on a set, season it with 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:42.559
 pepper and salt and decorate throwing the sauce on top and that is the alleged 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.989
 enjoy
