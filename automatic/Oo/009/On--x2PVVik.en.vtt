00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:17.730
 we already did this lock screen 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:24.180
 so let's take more pictures 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.699
 we will continue to leave as several in the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.849
 good product here we are in our 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.279
 third instance since when you 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.710
 we put the screen come as we kill 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.760
 all the brightness that we were 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.770
 bothering both here and here obviously 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.870
 how we continue to maintain the same 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.710
 values and we are blocking what 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.800
 before I entered 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.850
 We are getting a little darker myself 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.850
 I'm going to show you now 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.510
 the three instances again be 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.710
 We started off after we corrected the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.480
 light taken out and now we correct the ones 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.339
 glitters is though 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.010
 I do not particularly like it 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.520
 while the question of taste and criteria 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.299
 of each work 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.439
 will deprive you finally we are putting you 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.259
 a screen 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.259
 I'm going to save the fund to have it 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.740
 and we are doing 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.740
 the January line 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:44.020
 he is doing well 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:48.120
 so let's take pictures we're by 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.120
 life in a sixth 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.620
 still resists being the camera 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.909
 let's take the picture and show him 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:12.899
 now 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.899
 let's take it out of the screen 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.770
 well here we are already in our fourth 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.160
 instance here is 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.710
 in the effect that is what was 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.230
 mentioning just 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.710
 I particularly liked it a lot 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.100
 how was it 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.750
 this 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.110
 along with this 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.970
 it seems like something good 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.640
 and here it was a bit monotonous 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.210
 and good what we lack now is without 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.210
 to correct 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.870
 suppose that the photo with what is 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.129
 lights and screens is correct the one 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.790
 We are looking for 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.860
 what would be missing is point one you have the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.069
 white balance to not have this 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.519
 yellowish tone and after and put on the 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.519
 exposition 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.030
 keeping the f10 that what we were coming 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.209
 driving but so we're going to have to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.280
 change the shutter speed to 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.630
 that has a correct exposure in 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.630
 so many exposed 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.630
 we lack light but we will see it now 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.480
 to us with this light 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.760
 we are in a medium 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.760
 duration for f 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.010
 good 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.010
 Let's do with these values 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.439
 our photo 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.439
 until the final photo 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.050
 as to later be able to put it 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.050
 and how many are 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.500
 well here is what is called the end 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.470
 obviously good without retouching this is the 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.310
 machine to do is an example and that 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:23.120
 see that it is not a question of 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.800
 illuminate or put lights because if we say 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.220
 that you always have to try going 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.220
 seeing 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.509
 I now realized I'm here this is 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.729
 if it had been a photo that has to be 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.670
 present to a client be this that 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.000
 we are seeing here if you 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.889
 robin in a bit of the tutorial they will see 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.390
 that this door to a bathroom that 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.600
 that we have here in the study 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.590
 cast 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.890
 also considered to retouch or what 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.849
 possible to try to correct it 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.669
 previously 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.149
 in the shot is not covering that door or 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.460
 putting a white screen or something that 

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:06.009
 prevent having 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.309
 / reflected 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.309
 then they would also have to clean it 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.129
 and all that 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:23.009
 would have to clean it but good is love 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:28.070
 example serves you here we are going to review 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:30.710
 all the instances and we start here 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.740
 where we had the light that is entering 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.760
 since 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.500
 backlight 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.480
 illuminating the wall and this is 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.020
 breaking the wall we did not like 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.420
 of this then correct it as for 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.490
 make it a little more uniform 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:50.280
 here we annoyed glare these 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.860
 we put the screen and cover 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.370
 them for writing good this one visited 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:59.790
 I do not like this brillito either. 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.500
 it is the light itself 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.700
 it's okay 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.700
 is reflecting 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:12.289
 touch it later in the photoshop 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.349
 then we put a work screen 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.830
 it did not fit anymore it seemed like it gives 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:21.340
 half 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.800
 boring and then we put him 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.590
 a screen that emphasized all this 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:32.590
 part and the project center as we won 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.720
 the volume by putting a screen and 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.660
 it's black 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.310
 I do not know if in the position 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.230
 right I would have to give I've tried 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:45.110
 areas but good that I leave to you 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:49.730
 I liked this as I liked it is 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:51.410
 what finally 12 when we said this 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.660
 is what we like about the 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.210
 positions of the lights and reflections that 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.810
 we carry 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.930
 if we did the balance correction of 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.930
 whites 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.580
 the correct exposure 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.729
 Finally 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.840
 I remember them well now as soon as I think 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:15.570
 that in the video I put it yes no 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.400
 write now at 40 speeds I think 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.280
 means left to us a means 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.970
 second 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.310
 but well this would be our photo 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:27.889
 obviously this has to be touched up what 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.240
 would be the post-production part that 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:32.380
 what can 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.380
 if you notice 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.060
 although having this chromatic range 

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:40.090
 make 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.240
 the truth I did not see there was not this door that 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:46.050
 it was reflecting had it been that 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.479
 great to have seen it as to be able 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.360
 correct and who brings out when I put the 

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:54.420
 screen of this black that if I did 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.170
 run a little more I cover 

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:02.940
 the door directly the black screen 

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:05.220
 with this part of here and it was better 

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:08.169
 well it was long I hope you have them 

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:11.340
 liked and served them 

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:16.050
 and anything can continue to see them 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:20.150
 videos and photos at www.la design 

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.150
 puntocom rate until the next
