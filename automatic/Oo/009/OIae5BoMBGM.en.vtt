00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.289
 video shot at 1080p normal mode 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:33.360
 then 30 frames per second with htc juan 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:36.290
 n 8 let's try a quick cloth let's see in 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.290
 backlight 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:01:00.590
 as you can see the stabilizer does not 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:01:04.120
 there is a walk 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.120
 let us approach a subject 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.860
 this photo 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.860
 now plugged to focus 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.110
 because it seems to be not automatically 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.860
 went very well let's see if you can 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.860
 resumes alone no need to plug 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.619
 and this was the video shot with htc one 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.619
 m8 to 1080p 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.700
 the htc juan n 8 also has a mode of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.329
 720p slow video recording 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.179
 motion 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.740
 therefore the resolution is halved but 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.030
 however the quality remains quite 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.289
 high and as you see 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.289
 the effect is really great 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.290
 the htc one m8 also records at 1080p 60 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.840
 frames per second which is this video clip 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.240
 if we see it and a video clip 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.280
 quite defined quite fast 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.470
 as a movement even if it is not that 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.880
 it moves faster than normal you see 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.830
 but the car is normally wanted 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.870
 see that there are more frames to what 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.980
 you need this mode simply a 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.440
 do what we did we have 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.510
 seen first slow motion ring however a 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.830
 1080p because many people don't know 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.350
 that just take the clip edit it 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.440
 with the re time in this case in final 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.820
 cut pro hicks we put it at 50 per 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:06.730
 one hundred and we always go on modification 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.700
 parity in video quality optical flop if 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.790
 let's see the clip now 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.340
 will be at 1080p and therefore much more 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.480
 defined of that 720p and above all in 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.480
 perfect slow motion 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:40.450
 shooting with htc one m8 at night and there is the 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.430
 auto focus 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.650
 in the clip you saw that of 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.799
 the focus was manual in the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.500
 sense must be corked for 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.810
 focus as you see the setup a 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.470
 automatic fire 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.620
 I'm touching it nothing goes entirely 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.459
 alone and sometimes it loses a little something 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:08.730
 probably because there is so much 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:13.420
 very little light very little light now me 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.849
 I try to plug for plugging changes 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.030
 the exposure we say that in automatic 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.039
 continues to focus continuously 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.870
 forces lose even a little areas a 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.630
 the areas are less well lit. 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.220
 light up where they are and now they can be seen 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.320
 a little bit less but it seems 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.150
 there is this continuous focus that 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.970
 according to me it ruins a little the whole thing maybe it is 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.550
 better to use that manual put 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.479
 in focus towards infinity and at least not 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.120
 we have these continuous changes of fire 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:46.270
 this was the htc juan n 8 in mode 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.970
 auto focus at night 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.130
 conclusions on this htc one m8 this 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.290
 is the front camera conditions of 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.660
 I would say critical lighting because I am 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.330
 in the car at night with the light on 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.520
 then I would say that the videos made by day 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.770
 they are really good 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.580
 excellent slow motion and summer shooting 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:10.570
 sorry out of ballaman we are in 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.980
 machine from the videos or facts at 60 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.050
 frames per second as I showed you 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.030
 via final catto via programs 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.660
 however suitable for the prime minister and so on 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.540
 etc 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.430
 even imovie does it and I would say great videos 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.430
 at night he suffers a little with the mass 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.030
 fire maybe it's better to do video with 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.370
 the focus put in manual then 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.310
 tap to focus has established that and yes 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.240
 shoot the video because I don't think that 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.210
 when filming videos with a mobile phone 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.150
 maybe only in particular cases yes 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.550
 they will have if they need to have to 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.680
 change focus from near to far 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.910
 in case a tap is enough , the 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.750
 problem among other things the focus e 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.760
 also very very fast and nothing so 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.880
 excellent in my opinion and to promote the 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.270
 htc one m8 video department e 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.850
 obviously I launch the appointment for 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.220
 the next coming video focus if ce 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.240
 will be for the final review is 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.640
 because we are more or less the same 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.200
 the review is missing 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.330
 photographic that the thing that requires more 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.270
 time and that requires more work as 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.430
 however you see the wide angle of the 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.610
 front camera is really a lot 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.729
 very large and takes up a large part 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.770
 in short, the scene and the eating 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.349
 I would say that I can go to the end of 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.370
 edit the video and then publish it to 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.370
 next video
