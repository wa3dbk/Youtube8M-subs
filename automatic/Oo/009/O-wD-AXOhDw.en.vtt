the<00:01:57.979> database<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:58.609> maintains<00:01:59.380> so<00:02:00.380> we'll

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:00.499 
the database it maintains so we'll

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:01.599 
the database it maintains so we'll
scroll<00:02:00.740> down<00:02:00.950> we'll<00:02:01.189> set<00:02:01.399> it<00:02:01.429> up<00:02:01.579> for

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
scroll down we'll set it up for

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.149 
scroll down we'll set it up for
automated<00:02:02.479> backups<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.289> this<00:02:03.409> way<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.770> once<00:02:03.979> a

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
automated backups so this way it once a

automated backups so this way it once a
week<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.759> will<00:02:04.969> automatically<00:02:05.659> back<00:02:05.929> up<00:02:05.959> the

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
week it will automatically back up the

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.669

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
and we will so let's see if we follow

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.429 
and we will so let's see if we follow
the<00:02:46.099> directions<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.329> we'll<00:02:47.480> look<00:02:47.750> for<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.019> HT

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
the directions so we'll look for the HT

Access file and WP DB manager and under

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.250 
Access file and WP DB manager and under
plugins<00:02:54.739> WPD<00:02:55.609> be<00:02:55.760> manager<00:02:56.180> let's<00:02:56.930> find<00:02:57.109> that

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
plugins WPD be manager let's find that

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.369 
plugins WPD be manager let's find that
first<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.340> we'll<00:02:58.400> go<00:02:58.549> content<00:02:59.500> plugins

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
first so we'll go content plugins

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:09.339 
first so we'll go content plugins
manager<00:03:03.379> and<00:03:06.909> so<00:03:07.909> here's<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.299> htaccess<00:03:08.810> file

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
manager and so here's the htaccess file

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.709 
manager and so here's the htaccess file
will<00:03:10.159> just<00:03:10.310> copy<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.939> a<00:03:10.969> local<00:03:11.239> folder

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
will just copy that to a local folder

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:17.949 
will just copy that to a local folder
and<00:03:12.349> then<00:03:13.629> we<00:03:14.629> will<00:03:14.810> move<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:16.689> WP<00:03:17.689> test

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
and then we will move it to WP test

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.530 
and then we will move it to WP test
content<00:03:18.819> backup<00:03:19.819> DB<00:03:20.349> so<00:03:21.349> go<00:03:21.560> WP<00:03:22.430> test<00:03:22.699> content

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
content backup DB so go WP test content

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.740 
content backup DB so go WP test content
backup<00:03:24.290> DB<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:26.470> we<00:03:27.470> will<00:03:28.239> move<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.479> into

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
backup DB and we will move that into

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.740 
backup DB and we will move that into
here<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.819> now<00:03:31.819> what<00:03:32.030> we'll<00:03:32.150> need<00:03:32.269> to<00:03:32.329> do<00:03:32.509> is<00:03:32.659> we

our<00:05:49.620> backup<00:05:49.980> directory<00:05:50.130> BTW<00:05:51.440> ewb<00:05:52.440> that's<00:05:52.680> the

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
our backup directory BTW ewb that's the

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.520 
our backup directory BTW ewb that's the
basic<00:05:53.190> one<00:05:53.400> now<00:05:54.240> we<00:05:54.900> will<00:05:55.020> have<00:05:55.200> a<00:05:55.230> look<00:05:55.440> at

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
basic one now we will have a look at

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.200 
basic one now we will have a look at
this<00:05:55.680> just<00:05:56.130> so<00:05:56.310> that<00:05:56.340> we<00:05:56.520> know<00:05:56.640> how<00:05:56.790> to<00:05:56.850> set<00:05:57.120> up

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
this just so that we know how to set up

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.600 
this just so that we know how to set up
our<00:05:57.360> HD<00:05:58.200> access<00:05:58.590> file<00:05:58.830> again<00:05:59.990> so<00:06:00.990> we'll<00:06:01.140> see

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
our HD access file again so we'll see

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.020 
our HD access file again so we'll see
all<00:06:02.610> these<00:06:02.760> should<00:06:02.970> be<00:06:03.000> green<00:06:04.730> so<00:06:05.730> this<00:06:05.880> is<00:06:05.910> the

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
all these should be green so this is the

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.500 
all these should be green so this is the
backup<00:06:06.300> URL<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.860> plug-in<00:06:08.280> directory<00:06:08.510> and

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
backup URL the plug-in directory and

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.180 
backup URL the plug-in directory and
these<00:06:09.810> are<00:06:09.900> all<00:06:09.990> auto-populated<00:06:10.770> so<00:06:11.010> we

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
these are all auto-populated so we

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.540 
these are all auto-populated so we
shouldn't<00:06:11.370> need<00:06:11.490> to<00:06:11.640> make<00:06:11.790> any<00:06:11.940> changes<00:06:12.030> and

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
shouldn't need to make any changes and

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.080 
shouldn't need to make any changes and
hit<00:06:15.230> update<00:06:16.230> backup<00:06:16.770> options<00:06:17.160> and<00:06:17.370> that's<00:06:17.940> it

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
hit update backup options and that's it
