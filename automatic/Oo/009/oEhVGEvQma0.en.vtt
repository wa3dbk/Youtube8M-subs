today<00:00:07.140> we're<00:00:07.379> going<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.890> learn<00:00:08.099> how<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.490> prune

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
today we're going to learn how to prune

read<00:00:09.540> cannas<00:00:10.080> now<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.190> not<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> read<00:00:11.700> canna

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
read cannas now this is not a read canna

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.970 
read cannas now this is not a read canna
so<00:00:12.240> you'll<00:00:12.420> have<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.690> use<00:00:12.719> your<00:00:13.200> imagination

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
so you'll have to use your imagination

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.160 
so you'll have to use your imagination
to<00:00:14.099> make<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.549> read<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> ones<00:00:15.900> across

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to make this read and the ones across

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.900 
to make this read and the ones across
the<00:00:16.320> street<00:00:16.529> are<00:00:16.650> not<00:00:16.800> read<00:00:17.010> either<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.520> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
the street are not read either but you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.400 
the street are not read either but you
prune<00:00:18.150> them<00:00:18.180> all<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.750> same<00:00:18.960> way<00:00:19.199> regardless

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
prune them all the same way regardless

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.849 
prune them all the same way regardless
of<00:00:20.010> what<00:00:20.279> color<00:00:20.520> they<00:00:20.730> are<00:00:20.900> and<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.380> my

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
of what color they are and this is my

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.849 
of what color they are and this is my
neighbor's<00:00:23.340> cannas<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> rhizome<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.710> they

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
neighbor's cannas are a rhizome so they

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.130 
neighbor's cannas are a rhizome so they
spread<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.460> underground<00:00:26.970> stems<00:00:27.300> they've

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
spread like underground stems they've

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.810 
spread like underground stems they've
actually<00:00:28.380> grown<00:00:28.650> through<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.099> fence<00:00:29.490> over

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
actually grown through the fence over

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.060 
actually grown through the fence over
onto<00:00:30.720> my<00:00:30.929> side<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:32.759> fence<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
onto my side of the fence so this is a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.490 
onto my side of the fence so this is a
plant<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.610> needs<00:00:35.760> water<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.020> drought

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
plant that needs water it's not drought

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.920 
plant that needs water it's not drought
tolerant<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.969> looking<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> little<00:00:39.540> dry

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
tolerant so this is looking a little dry

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.010 
tolerant so this is looking a little dry
and<00:00:40.200> burned<00:00:40.610> because<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and burned because of that so what I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.979 
and burned because of that so what I
would<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.129> take<00:00:44.850> off<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.329> unsightly

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
would do is take off these unsightly

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.450 
would do is take off these unsightly
leaves<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.129> would<00:00:47.489> take<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> back<00:00:47.820> expiry

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
leaves here I would take it back expiry

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.630 
leaves here I would take it back expiry
take<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.420> back<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:53.039> not<00:00:53.309> really

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
take this one back here it's not really

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.310 
take this one back here it's not really
the<00:00:53.879> time<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.149> cut<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:55.050> back

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the time to cut it all the way back

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.799 
the time to cut it all the way back
because<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> plant<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:57.449> through

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
because you want the plant to go through

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.430 
because you want the plant to go through
its<00:00:58.050> cycle<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.739> energy<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> gets<00:01:00.030> its

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
its cycle of energy it gets its

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
its cycle of energy it gets its
nutrients<00:01:01.440> through<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> leaves<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.850> then

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
nutrients through the leaves and then

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.990 
nutrients through the leaves and then
they<00:01:03.510> all<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:04.110> down<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.530> stems<00:01:04.799> into<00:01:05.790> those

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
they all go down the stems into those

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.210 
they all go down the stems into those
rhizomes<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.380> store<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.860> their<00:01:08.010> energy

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
rhizomes and they store up their energy

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.450 
rhizomes and they store up their energy
so<00:01:08.670> they<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.900> their<00:01:10.110> thing<00:01:10.170> again<00:01:10.830> next

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so they can do their thing again next

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000 
so they can do their thing again next

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
flowering so i'm going to cut the flower

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.100 
flowering so i'm going to cut the flower
off<00:01:24.810> right<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.650> there's<00:01:26.280> more<00:01:27.240> flower

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
off right there there's more flower

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.499 
off right there there's more flower
coming<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.520> foliage<00:01:29.880> looks<00:01:30.210> fine

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
coming here and the foliage looks fine

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.840 
coming here and the foliage looks fine
this<00:01:31.020> foliage<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.890> plant<00:01:32.189> actually<00:01:32.640> gets

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this foliage this plant actually gets

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.690 
this foliage this plant actually gets
water<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.920> how<00:01:35.040> much<00:01:35.220> better<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
water so you can see how much better the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270 
water so you can see how much better the
foliage<00:01:36.509> looks<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.560> starting<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:37.979> grow

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
foliage looks and it's starting to grow

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
foliage looks and it's starting to grow
and<00:01:38.579> spread<00:01:38.729> my<00:01:39.540> neighbor<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:40.140> planted

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and spread my neighbor just planted

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
and spread my neighbor just planted
these<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> few<00:01:40.979> months<00:01:41.220> ago<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.430> know<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
these a few months ago I know that and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.899 
these a few months ago I know that and
it<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.540> only<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.810> single<00:01:43.140> stalk<00:01:43.670> single<00:01:44.670> stalk

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it was only a single stalk single stalk

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.940 
it was only a single stalk single stalk
over<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.659> single<00:01:45.990> stalk<00:01:46.229> over<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
over here and single stalk over here and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.639 
over here and single stalk over here and
you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.520> see<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:47.880> they've<00:01:48.090> spread<00:01:48.649> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you can see how they've spread so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.490 
you can see how they've spread so
there's<00:01:50.430> more<00:01:50.670> coming<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
there's more coming up here and as I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.580 
there's more coming up here and as I
said<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.189> leave<00:01:53.460> them<00:01:53.820> until<00:01:54.780> they<00:01:55.380> go

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
said you just leave them until they go

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.370 
said you just leave them until they go
through<00:01:55.860> their<00:01:55.979> cycle<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.270> these<00:01:58.049> will

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
through their cycle so these will

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.920 
through their cycle so these will
probably<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.950> cut<00:01:59.790> all<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.360> back<00:02:00.630> in

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
probably get cut all the way back in

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.530 
probably get cut all the way back in
February<00:02:01.549> but<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.670> you're<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> colder

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
February but if you're in a colder

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.929 
February but if you're in a colder
climate<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.560> need<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.009> dig<00:02:05.280> these<00:02:05.460> rubberized

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
climate you need to dig these rubberized

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.459 
climate you need to dig these rubberized
ohms<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.840> they're<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.170> freeze

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
ohms up because they're going to freeze

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.699 
ohms up because they're going to freeze
so<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.759> keep<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.209> mind<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.500> now
