00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.090
 easy way to make edible flowers at home. 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.360
 Required ingredients: carrot, parsley root. 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.760
 chives, apple, long sticks, e.g. for skewers. 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:54.820
 Cut chives leaves. We take the chives and cut off the end. 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:10.820
 Insert a stick into the chives' tube. We have our stalks ready. 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:29.320
 Cut the flakes with parsley and carrots. 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:43.810
 We combine everything together. We put the cereal on prepared stalks. 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:02:15.100
 We have a ready flower. We put flowers eg in an apple. 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.640
 We can use other vegetable or fruit colors. 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:40.540
