the<00:01:26.250> acrx<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.450> had<00:01:28.229> definitely<00:01:28.560> had<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> racer

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
the acrx we had definitely had the racer

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.240 
the acrx we had definitely had the racer
in<00:01:29.340> mind<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.299> started<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.780> safety<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
in mind and we started with safety the

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.050 
roll cage is built to a high level of
strength<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.520> similar<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
strength so it's similar to the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.200 
strength so it's similar to the
