00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.270 
first impressions
so<00:01:57.490> I<00:01:58.000> don't<00:01:58.630> like<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:58.900> guy<00:01:59.080> guys<00:01:59.350> you<00:02:00.160> know

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
so I don't like this guy guys you know

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.940 
so I don't like this guy guys you know
he<00:02:00.460> just<00:02:00.610> never<00:02:00.880> got<00:02:01.030> fun<00:02:01.540> always<00:02:02.260> at<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.800> back

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
he just never got fun always at the back

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.340 
he just never got fun always at the back
I<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:04.660> because<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:05.020> was<00:02:05.110> hired

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
I just think is because it was hired

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.710 
I just think is because it was hired
defensive<00:02:05.800> work<00:02:05.950> quick<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.430> also<00:02:07.300> his<00:02:07.420> medium

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
defensive work quick and also his medium

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.910 
defensive work quick and also his medium
attacking<00:02:08.110> work<00:02:08.259> weight<00:02:08.470> doesn't<00:02:08.649> help

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
attacking work weight doesn't help

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.650 
attacking work weight doesn't help
either<00:02:09.100> but<00:02:09.940> mainly<00:02:10.179> because<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.479> that

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
either but mainly because of that

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.360 
either but mainly because of that
defensive<00:02:11.050> work<00:02:11.230> whether<00:02:11.470> that's<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.130> such

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
defensive work whether that's just such

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.400 
defensive work whether that's just such
a<00:02:12.400> big<00:02:12.520> letdown<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.360> know<00:02:13.450> that's<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.960> really

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
a big letdown you know that's a really

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.590 
a big letdown you know that's a really
does<00:02:14.560> effectively<00:02:15.160> time<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:16.180> when<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.360> did

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
does effectively time but when I did

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.300 
does effectively time but when I did
actually<00:02:16.720> playing<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.890> ball<00:02:18.040> he<00:02:18.190> was

school<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.750> fall<00:02:37.900> maybe<00:02:38.140> he<00:02:38.650> starting<00:02:38.920> to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
school this fall maybe he starting to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.550 
school this fall maybe he starting to
perform<00:02:39.459> now<00:02:39.640> but<00:02:39.910> ever<00:02:40.720> since<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.110> car<00:02:41.440> we

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
they just plain you know not even

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.190 
they just plain you know not even
getting<00:02:45.370> forward<00:02:45.850> that's<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.600> biggest

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
getting forward that's the biggest

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.530 
getting forward that's the biggest
disadvantage<00:02:47.950> for<00:02:48.130> me<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.880> about<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.420> actually

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
disadvantage for me is about it actually

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.330 
disadvantage for me is about it actually

now so I'm squads people have stayed
with<00:03:50.440> him<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.610> lot<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.820> people<00:03:51.910> put<00:03:52.239> him<00:03:52.360> as

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
with him and a lot of people put him as

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.479 
with him and a lot of people put him as
a<00:03:52.480> white<00:03:52.690> back<00:03:52.959> some<00:03:53.230> reason<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:53.799> nothing

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
a white back some reason so nothing

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.560 
a white back some reason so nothing
that's<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.760> reason<00:03:55.060> why<00:03:55.090> because<00:03:55.390> they<00:03:55.480> have

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
that's the reason why because they have

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.539 
that's the reason why because they have
also<00:03:55.900> experienced<00:03:56.470> how<00:03:56.620> bad<00:03:56.890> he<00:03:57.100> is<00:03:57.130> attacking

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
also experienced how bad he is attacking

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.039 
also experienced how bad he is attacking
me<00:03:57.820> so<00:03:58.000> therefore<00:03:58.299> why<00:03:58.450> don't<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.720> just<00:03:58.930> take

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
me so therefore why don't you just take

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.600 
me so therefore why don't you just take
from<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.320> back<00:03:59.470> he<00:03:59.739> has<00:03:59.830> a<00:03:59.860> higher<00:04:00.130> defensive

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
from the back he has a higher defensive

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.490 
from the back he has a higher defensive
work<00:04:00.760> way<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.690> that's<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.930> kind<00:04:02.110> of<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.350> good

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
work way and that's a kind of a good

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.710 
work way and that's a kind of a good
idea<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:03.250> think<00:04:03.519> he<00:04:03.610> might<00:04:03.730> be<00:04:03.760> good<00:04:04.000> enough

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
idea I think he might be good enough

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.840 
idea I think he might be good enough
he's<00:04:04.900> never<00:04:05.170> going<00:04:05.470> forward<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.580> he's<00:04:06.700> always

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
he's never going forward and he's always

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.450 
he's never going forward and he's always
at<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.150> back<00:04:07.270> and<00:04:07.330> also<00:04:07.780> really<00:04:07.960> does<00:04:08.440> try<00:04:09.250> and

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
at the back and also really does try and

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.100 
at the back and also really does try and
defend<00:04:09.700> he's<00:04:10.240> never<00:04:10.480> actually<00:04:10.630> done<00:04:10.960> an

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
defend he's never actually done an

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.500 
defend he's never actually done an
interception<00:04:11.560> at<00:04:11.860> all<00:04:12.040> but<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:13.000> likes<00:04:13.210> of<00:04:13.390> a
