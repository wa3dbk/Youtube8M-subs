00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.610
 hello today I got my hands 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.190
 Here is a copy 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:23.840
 modem company 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:27.140
 aus dem wireless in general such as 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:31.310
 does not work that is, the computer determines 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:37.400
 but on the connection everything else is not 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:43.520
 passes so I watched it and that's how you 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:50.360
 can see there is a used way out somehow 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:55.420
 crookedly standing and moving now we 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.420
 analyze and see what is there middle 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.020
 unscrew the bolts 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 and so what we see here 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:51.140
 so four wires so here 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:55.009
 how from if you see two wires 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.259
 which go to data transfer by 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.959
 Arrival transfer torn off 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.500
 that is, the power as it connects 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.780
 his computer sees 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:12.670
 but he doesn't even work on wiring 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:21.680
 topman and now we solder them and 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:22.989
 everything will be on the sea so I am a little bit 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.019
 pulled out 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.019
 wires ws 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:50.330
 a little bit whores to inflict and we will 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.330
 try to solder and 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.260
 with 1 there is 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:43.720
 and so now looking for these extremely 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.720
 too the booze they held on better 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:04.049
 in principle . and now we will collect one 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:08.349
 side and a little bit 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:13.569
 I think it will be necessary to pour hot melt 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:20.139
 so that it is not torn off 5 instantly 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:24.370
 the same wires are very thin and this 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:30.150
 Pinocchio will repeat 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:37.960
 already a bit of glue here angry 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:59.919
 right now, even known contact shovel 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:05:08.280
 and and close and whose supported kuduro 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:12.630
 but the connector does not move a little bit 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.630
 of course it's crooked here because 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.199
 the same mount 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:25.900
 it doesn't hold on to speed it won't 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:32.409
 influence the main thing that worked merchants 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:34.919
 beat already it does not move at all 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.919
 the main thing 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.970
 you cooler boys 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:06:03.940
 nicknames back all 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:08.670
