00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.190 
it's definitely got a theme going on so
it<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.239> fun<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:48.690> dressed<00:00:48.899> up

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it was really fun to get all dressed up

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
it was really fun to get all dressed up
and<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.739> far<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.160> Annie's<00:00:50.610> concern<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and as far as Annie's concern it's a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
and as far as Annie's concern it's a
little<00:00:51.480> bit<00:00:51.600> more<00:00:51.719> melodrama<00:00:52.440> than<00:00:52.920> usual<00:00:53.340> for

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
little bit more melodrama than usual for

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
little bit more melodrama than usual for
her<00:00:53.670> no<00:00:54.059> drunk<00:00:54.629> hit-and-runs<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.440> anything

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
her no drunk hit-and-runs or anything

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.459 
her no drunk hit-and-runs or anything
like<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.719> it's<00:00:57.719> more<00:00:57.899> low-key<00:00:58.260> than

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
like that so it's more low-key than

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
like that so it's more low-key than
usual<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.399> relieved<00:00:59.699> about<00:00:59.850> now

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
usual which I was relieved about now

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.939 
usual which I was relieved about now
we're<00:01:00.629> seeing<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:00.960> photos<00:01:01.500> from<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we're seeing some photos from the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.349 
we're seeing some photos from the
wedding<00:01:01.980> scene<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.820> seems<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.329> very

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
wedding scene and it seems to be very

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.240 
wedding scene and it seems to be very
like<00:01:03.750> Katy<00:01:03.960> Perry<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.379> Russell<00:01:04.530> Brand's<00:01:05.100> what

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
like Katy Perry and Russell Brand's what

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.580 
like Katy Perry and Russell Brand's what
he's<00:01:05.369> fired<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> Indian<00:01:06.990> theme<00:01:07.320> I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
he's fired right with the Indian theme I

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.480 
he's fired right with the Indian theme I
like<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> elephants

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
like the elephants

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.880 
like the elephants
yeah<00:01:08.729> except<00:01:09.510> she's<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:09.990> marrying<00:01:10.710> an

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
yeah except she's actually marrying an

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460 
yeah except she's actually marrying an
Indian<00:01:11.369> boy<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> difference<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
Indian boy so that's the difference I

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.320 
Indian boy so that's the difference I
guess<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.920> actually<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.490> traditional<00:01:15.150> as

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
guess it's actually just traditional as

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330 
guess it's actually just traditional as
opposed<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.869> kind<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.799> cool<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
opposed to kind of you know cool and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.399 
opposed to kind of you know cool and
