her<00:00:50.890> right<00:00:50.920> off<00:00:51.130> the<00:00:51.430> dock<00:00:51.579> where<00:00:51.969> she<00:00:52.180> will

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
her right off the dock where she will

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.080 
her right off the dock where she will
drown<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:52.899> disappear<00:00:53.530> kind<00:00:54.370> of<00:00:54.489> morbid<00:00:54.879> and

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
drown and disappear kind of morbid and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.389 
drown and disappear kind of morbid and
it's<00:00:55.300> definitely<00:00:55.690> one<00:00:55.840> of<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:55.960> most<00:00:56.250> kind<00:00:57.250> of

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
it's definitely one of the most kind of

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.180 
it's definitely one of the most kind of
depressing<00:00:58.329> glitches<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.440> Dez<00:00:59.590> Ellis<00:00:59.860> series

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
depressing glitches and Dez Ellis series

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.369 
depressing glitches and Dez Ellis series
but<00:01:00.399> I<00:01:00.430> think<00:01:00.789> it's<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.030> lot<00:01:01.180> of<00:01:01.210> fun<00:01:01.539> even

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
but I think it's a lot of fun even

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.279 
but I think it's a lot of fun even
though<00:01:02.469> it<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.829> very<00:01:03.219> repetitive<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:05.140> if

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
though it is very repetitive now if

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.630 
though it is very repetitive now if
you're<00:01:05.410> not<00:01:05.530> catching<00:01:05.740> on<00:01:06.039> what<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.369> have<00:01:06.490> to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
you're not catching on what you have to

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.850 
you're not catching on what you have to
do<00:01:06.789> is<00:01:06.970> I'll<00:01:07.270> target<00:01:07.810> hurt<00:01:07.960> or<00:01:08.200> Z<00:01:08.440> target

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
do is I'll target hurt or Z target

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.190 
do is I'll target hurt or Z target
whatever<00:01:09.039> you<00:01:09.280> prefer<00:01:09.399> to<00:01:09.670> call<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.270> you

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
whatever you prefer to call it and you

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.199 
whatever you prefer to call it and you
just<00:01:11.259> kind<00:01:11.619> of<00:01:11.710> like<00:01:11.890> talk<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.700> her<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.149> then

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:13.209 
just kind of like talk to her and then

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:14.790 
just kind of like talk to her and then
you<00:01:13.300> nudge<00:01:13.690> her<00:01:13.869> a<00:01:13.899> little<00:01:14.259> bit<00:01:14.410> that<00:01:14.560> makes

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
you nudge her a little bit that makes

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.910 
you nudge her a little bit that makes
her<00:01:14.920> back<00:01:15.130> up<00:01:15.429> now<00:01:16.240> usually<00:01:17.080> once<00:01:17.560> you're<00:01:17.740> done

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
her back up now usually once you're done

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.340 
her back up now usually once you're done
talking<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.700> her<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.090> girl<00:01:19.300> will<00:01:19.509> just<00:01:19.899> walk

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
talking to her the girl will just walk

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.790 
talking to her the girl will just walk
back<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.860> your<00:01:21.069> normal<00:01:21.670> spot<00:01:22.209> so<00:01:22.479> before<00:01:22.990> she

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
back to your normal spot so before she

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.740 
back to your normal spot so before she
is<00:01:23.950> able<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.670> do<00:01:24.849> that<00:01:25.030> you<00:01:25.209> have<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.450> talk<00:01:25.720> to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
is able to do that you have to talk to

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.510 
is able to do that you have to talk to
her<00:01:26.080> again<00:01:26.200> which<00:01:26.619> will<00:01:26.800> stop<00:01:27.039> her<00:01:27.280> in<00:01:27.490> her

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
her again which will stop her in her

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.359 
her again which will stop her in her
tracks<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.679> allow<00:01:29.679> you<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.920> restart<00:01:30.220> the

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
tracks and allow you to restart the

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.730 
tracks and allow you to restart the
process<00:01:30.610> so<00:01:31.090> this<00:01:31.539> entire<00:01:32.020> video<00:01:32.440> is

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
process so this entire video is

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.580 
process so this entire video is
essentially<00:01:33.990> talk<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.200> her

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
essentially talk to her

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.880 
essentially talk to her
push<00:01:36.160> her<00:01:36.399> talk<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.330> her<00:01:37.720> push<00:01:38.110> her<00:01:38.319> repeat

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
push her talk to her push her repeat

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.330 
push her talk to her push her repeat
again<00:01:39.819> and<00:01:39.880> again<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.959> is<00:01:40.990> very<00:01:41.619> very

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
again and again and it is very very

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.850 
again and again and it is very very
repetitive<00:01:42.670> I<00:01:43.420> mean<00:01:43.959> that's<00:01:44.140> it's<00:01:44.800> really

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
repetitive I mean that's it's really

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.460 
repetitive I mean that's it's really
simple<00:01:45.369> but<00:01:45.700> we<00:01:46.569> are<00:01:46.690> trying<00:01:46.959> to<00:01:47.020> get<00:01:47.140> her<00:01:47.229> all

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
simple but we are trying to get her all

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.889 
simple but we are trying to get her all
the<00:01:47.740> way<00:01:47.860> over<00:01:48.099> there<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.700> dock<00:01:48.970> so<00:01:49.630> the

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
the way over there to the dock so the

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.100 
the way over there to the dock so the
video<00:01:50.229> will<00:01:50.440> take<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.250> while<00:01:51.489> I<00:01:51.789> apologize<00:01:52.750> for

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
video will take a while I apologize for

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.410 
video will take a while I apologize for
how<00:01:53.349> long<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.739> will<00:01:53.920> take<00:01:53.979> but<00:01:54.849> she<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.239> very

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
how long it will take but she is very

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.080 
how long it will take but she is very
stubborn<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.259> if<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:57.190> mess<00:01:57.459> up<00:01:57.489> she<00:01:57.910> will

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090

character model in the game it's not

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.050 
character model in the game it's not
anything<00:03:39.859> too<00:03:40.219> exciting<00:03:40.519> but<00:03:40.670> it's<00:03:40.849> a<00:03:40.909> little

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060

bit neat to play with and see there's

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.770 
bit neat to play with and see there's
