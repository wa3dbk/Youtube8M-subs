 these cards are two players who 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.449
 played very well throughout the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.359
 season but did not get a report 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.920
 the most consistent teams of gold 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.560
 silver and bronze 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.660
 already been chosen and it is possible to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.120

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.680
 three o'clock here on the canal 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.690
 so stay tuned to not lose yourself 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.070
 without even knowing the release date 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.080
 Would you like to know who the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.490
 players that have been chosen I have 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.040
 Absolutely yes 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 then bora know them starting with there 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.000
 the gold team and also behind the scenes 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.370
 Roberto the Spanish goalkeeper in the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.040
 olympiacos and also the fabianski of 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.920
 siri bids highlighted there for the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.080
 possible attributes of reflections 88 of the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 two have also taken advantage to say that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.550
 these gold numbers and statistics do not 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.050
 they are official, the community that was 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.660
 who chose this team and finished 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.910
 only the players in the positions but the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.920
 numbers are decided by then 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.960
 I basically did go get each 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.930
 player and increase their numbers by five 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.630
 only to have a roberto parameter 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.060
 for example you have 78 gold in your letter 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.070
 so reached the 83 in the letter touches 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.870
 as well as each of the tactics of the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.819
 goalkeeper and also of the other 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.410
 players of this team of gold of the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.420
 consistent weighting we already have 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.000
 See how my partner likes to say 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.890

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.260
 Argentine centenary defender and also the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.860
 vandick dutch celtic quarterback 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.280
 Garay with amazing 88 overall but 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.530
 extremely low rhythm on the sides 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.870
 we count psv minimums 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.660
