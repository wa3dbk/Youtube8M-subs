00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
so again we're at the dish network

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.740 
so again we're at the dish network
system<00:00:15.310> and<00:00:15.700> we're<00:00:15.850> going<00:00:16.000> to<00:00:16.060> program<00:00:16.299> this

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
system and we're going to program this

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.040 
system and we're going to program this
remote<00:00:17.170> to<00:00:17.650> that<00:00:17.860> TV<00:00:18.430> and<00:00:18.720> there<00:00:19.720> are<00:00:19.779> several

that<00:00:23.170> came<00:00:23.410> with<00:00:23.619> the<00:00:23.830> system<00:00:24.340> you<00:00:24.369> can<00:00:24.580> look

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
that came with the system you can look

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.300 
that came with the system you can look
in<00:00:25.029> the<00:00:25.150> back<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.630> it'll<00:00:25.779> give<00:00:26.080> you<00:00:26.290> TV<00:00:27.070> codes

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
in the back and it'll give you TV codes

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.170 
in the back and it'll give you TV codes
VCR<00:00:27.910> codes<00:00:28.240> a<00:00:28.720> V<00:00:28.990> codes<00:00:29.349> it'll<00:00:29.860> give<00:00:30.070> you<00:00:30.250> combo

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
VCR codes a V codes it'll give you combo

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.670 
VCR codes a V codes it'll give you combo
code<00:00:31.419> so<00:00:31.750> you<00:00:31.810> want<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:32.110> make<00:00:32.230> sure<00:00:32.410> you're

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
code so you want to make sure you're

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.470 
code so you want to make sure you're
getting<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.310> sony<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:35.290> this<00:00:35.470> one<00:00:35.710> on<00:00:35.980> TV<00:00:36.970> code

insignia will come up they all lit up

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.369 
insignia will come up they all lit up
here<00:00:52.510> I'll<00:00:53.370> let<00:00:54.370> that<00:00:54.429> go<00:00:54.670> I'll<00:00:55.539> type<00:00:56.079> in<00:00:56.350> the

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
here I'll let that go I'll type in the

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.919 
here I'll let that go I'll type in the
code<00:00:56.800> say<00:00:57.250> it's<00:00:57.399> 500<00:00:58.059> I<00:00:58.179> don't<00:00:58.480> know<00:00:58.600> what<00:00:58.780> it

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
code say it's 500 I don't know what it

00:00:58.929 --> 00:00:59.279 
code say it's 500 I don't know what it
is

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
is

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.250 
is
and<00:00:59.679> then<00:00:59.829> I<00:00:59.859> hit<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.190> pound<00:01:00.579> sign<00:01:01.050> hit<00:01:02.050> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
and then I hit the pound sign hit the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.380 
and then I hit the pound sign hit the
pound<00:01:02.500> sign<00:01:02.769> that<00:01:02.949> flickers<00:01:03.429> three<00:01:03.760> times<00:01:04.059> if

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
pound sign that flickers three times if

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.260 
pound sign that flickers three times if
that<00:01:04.809> code<00:01:05.500> worked<00:01:05.830> I<00:01:06.070> have<00:01:06.190> volume<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:07.240> I

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
that code worked I have volume so I

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.100 
that code worked I have volume so I
guessed<00:01:07.750> it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
guessed it

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.840 
guessed it
I<00:01:08.140> knew<00:01:08.560> Sony<00:01:08.860> goo<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.750> volume<00:01:11.170> worked<00:01:11.470> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I knew Sony goo so the volume worked and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.700 
I knew Sony goo so the volume worked and
it'll<00:01:12.850> go<00:01:13.000> up<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.360> down<00:01:13.510> which<00:01:13.840> means<00:01:14.079> my<00:01:14.320> TV

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
it'll go up and down which means my TV

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.890 
it'll go up and down which means my TV
code<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.579> I<00:01:15.610> want<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.850> switch<00:01:16.119> backed<00:01:16.450> up<00:01:16.689> right

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
code so I want to switch backed up right

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.590 
code so I want to switch backed up right
in<00:01:17.110> my<00:01:17.200> satellite<00:01:17.740> by<00:01:17.950> pushing<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:19.030> satellite

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
in my satellite by pushing the satellite

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.469 
in my satellite by pushing the satellite
button<00:01:19.900> if<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.979> didn't<00:01:21.369> work<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:22.090> have<00:01:22.299> to

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
button if it didn't work you have to

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.450 
button if it didn't work you have to
push<00:01:22.689> and<00:01:22.900> hold<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.110> TV<00:01:23.560> button<00:01:23.829> till<00:01:24.310> they

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
push and hold the TV button till they

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.109 
push and hold the TV button till they
all<00:01:24.579> light<00:01:24.790> up<00:01:25.000> again<00:01:26.159> type<00:01:27.159> in<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.520> next<00:01:27.700> code

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
all light up again type in the next code

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.289 
all light up again type in the next code
hit<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.960> pound<00:01:29.229> sign<00:01:29.560> again<00:01:29.939> flickers<00:01:30.939> three

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
hit the pound sign again flickers three

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:31.859 
hit the pound sign again flickers three
times

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
times

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.789 
times
and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.880> will<00:01:34.299> either<00:01:34.930> work<00:01:35.350> or<00:01:35.649> don't

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
and then it will either work or don't

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.160 
and then it will either work or don't
work<00:01:35.950> with<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.520> volume<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.780> will<00:01:37.930> tell

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
work with the volume and that will tell

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
work with the volume and that will tell
you<00:01:38.790> it'll<00:01:39.790> also<00:01:40.299> turn<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.719> TV<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.439> off

with the red TV button and you got

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.569 
with the red TV button and you got
volume<00:01:46.479> that's<00:01:47.200> what<00:01:47.590> we're<00:01:47.770> looking<00:01:48.100> for<00:01:48.130> so

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
volume that's what we're looking for so

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.590 
volume that's what we're looking for so
