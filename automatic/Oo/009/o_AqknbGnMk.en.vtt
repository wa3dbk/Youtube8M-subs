00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.340
 so good day to all dear 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.860
 friends now I'll show you a review on the game 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.790
 counter strike go counter-strike this 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.590
 standard shooter that was already 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:21.750
 few years recognized as the best shooter and 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.910
 now we will play with him more precisely we 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.880
 already playing it and so the main meaning 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.009
 this game is to kill everything 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.239
 their opponents ie terrorists and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.430
 if you play for counter-terrorists 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.100
 then you need plus to neutralize 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.660
 the bomb that I will try for 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.399
 that's just special that will 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.219
 try to install 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.300
 the terrorists the moment we won this 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.210
 it was very easy we took one frag 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 About of course not shine but nevertheless 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.000
 Now we will fix it so we 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:06.439
 let's go to base b and guard it 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:14.060
 so that the evil terrorists did not seize her 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:14.060
 take a comfortable position and expect 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.830
 if no one appears i think we will go 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.799
 go straight to this scary dark tunnel 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.590
 yes I think the time has gone when 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.130
 it is necessary to do so in the course 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:40.229
 we are lucky with no one need to quickly 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:43.579
 kill the rest u black we just 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.189
 killed sheer Lasko right in the head 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.770
 left to kill 1 more and it will be easy I 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.450
 I think because he Szego ie 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.250
 zigzag he almost killed us took us 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.979
 15p 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:04.110
 angry guy look now we are his shield 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:11.630
 and not read it myself just kill it like this 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:15.500
 attention and who likes it 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.500
 subscribe put likes 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.320
 continue I like to bend over 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:32.190
 the varnish has subsided and now we will try a new one 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:37.200
 the move we go round by the side of the floor 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.380
 what kind of failure killed us and so while we 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.300
 dead I'll explain the rules to you and generally 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.040
 what's the point 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.530
 this standard game is played like 5 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.410
 5 well now of course completely different 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.800
 by the way the right balance and we will do it 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:02.340
 they have not gone for us so Jack 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:04.880
 everything is approximately even and so now we 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.750
 dead so I'll explain the rules 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.190
 play for five to five years not 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.750
 collective deciding here on 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.269
 competitive mode is played 5 on 5 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.799
 that means the main task of the terrorists 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.970
 is to put the bomb and win the round 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:25.850
 the main task of counter-terrorists is not 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:29.730
 allow this oversight the investigator 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.000
 now since the terrorists put a bomb 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.070
 and killed all our allies 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.489
 we lose will continue i play with 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.720
 standard weapon 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.320
 aux and usb gun we have a cutout under 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.910
 dark water 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.489
 Skins can be bought in this game and you can 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.489
 just get them for a good game and for 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.100
 naturally win 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:59.910
 here we are again killed and again this freak 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.660
 the monster is here now the terrorists are trying 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:07.769
 all together go on a zigzag and put 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.950
 the bomb on the point and so they do mostly 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:14.290
 all professional players 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.320
 see our ally surrounded us and he 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.940
 just had no chance now i'll try 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.400
 new weapon which is called a in pvp 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:33.130
 killing the first time now I'm 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:41.320
 show you how it was in the floor 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:43.150
 what a scythe guy forgive guys and yes 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.970
 sorry not yet told here you can 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.960
 talking in the chat here you can humiliate the guys 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.430
 if you just want to have fun but 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.770
 I advise you to play seriously because 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.680
 this is a very interesting game and if it is you 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:02.830
 will interest you never quit 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.720
 your computer now we will 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:10.470
 see how our guys will merge 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:13.540
 they are not professionals i will tell you here 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:19.470
 see that now make it now! 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.470
 I will kill Cao wap and most likely look and 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.560
 look i was right 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:35.700
 and so let's try to play again 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.700
 with our about in 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.090
 Kapets guys so never do on 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.910
 in fact, as I almost drove very 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.940
 wrong the place where I stood she 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.430
 called double doors 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.880
 this is where the place is going now 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.180
 person 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.810
 sheet valer my God who are nicks 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.300
 comes up with a card 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.470
 so that it is more detailed and easier you 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.310
 saw the whole map that represented what 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.720
 it is generally 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:16.180
 green squares are allocated places there 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.280
 where terrorists are born and 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.890
 counter-terrorists and red spots and 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:26.800
 letters a and b pass written squares 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:33.040
 where is inherited plant bombs going on 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:36.190
 where we set the bomb and so now 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.110
 our boyfriend will play again because they 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.960
 look he just has to degrease 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.360
 the bomb the bomb is defused very easily but 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.120
 now it is neutralized without forceps shields 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.790
 add plus 5 seconds and you can 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.580
 divide that is defuse the bomb not 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:58.620
 come together seconds and again it is very 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:07:01.900
 helps and so take our favorite aug and 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.280
 go to the valley length 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.180
 she is called because she is long 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.250
 if it was a long move so this is the length length 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.690
 need to guard because so that people don't 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.130
 came through this door pillow 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.930
 which doesn't come out right away 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.380
 open access to this one 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:19.000
 part and it is very natural not convenient 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.150
 because you can safely kill my 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.080
 opponent will not try to prevent 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:29.560
 of this and since as both as a terrorist 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.270
 they come out we try to order them 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.820
 as if just going forward about nothing not 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.990
 think just kill me now and 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:46.100
 did 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:49.520
 aha -1 ug guys so go ahead us 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.110
 they say they put a bomb on a and we 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.930
 run there through him that is through 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:57.220
 Zigzag is a very convenient place for 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:01.100
 traversal went from here you can easily kill 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.900
 so did i and so guys on this my 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.670
 review ends like 

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.670
 subscribe bye
