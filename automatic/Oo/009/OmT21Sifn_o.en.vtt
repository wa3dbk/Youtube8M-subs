00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 the expectation around that terminal 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.890
 It has been tremendous because there comes a moment 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.180
 where it seems we already have everything 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.490
 on a smartphone and it's hard to surprise 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.260
 samsung bet on a samsung galaxy s 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.910
 5 more powerful and versatile than ever 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.410
 although without splurging on the numbers 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.030
 from South Korea renewed 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 lightly design it with a new and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.460
 glamorous pattern on the back that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.050
 stays in a plant of 142 x 70 and 2.5 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.080
 millimeters leaving its thickness so 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.840
 only 81 millimeters the weight goes up 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.449
 slightly up to 145 grams nor 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.790
 much or little the caracas and s5 arrives with 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.559
 a screen is 5.1 inches 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.960
 usual super amoled technology that 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.930
 uses samsung in its higher ranges and 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 full resolution hd 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.399
 nothing was left that we were commenting 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.930
 in past videos that where they could 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.200
 incorporate new screens 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.239
 resolution 2k or quad hd were the ones that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.829
 they were waiting but in the end they are not going to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.520
 incorporate and this is going to be a relief 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520
 for our batteries 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.730
 inside we find a processor 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.310
 that seems to be the snapdragon 801 of 4 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.620
 nuclei at a maximum frequency of 245 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.350
 that fall to accompany a gpu 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.510
 Adreno 330 something faster than in the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.370
 previous generations is accompanied by a 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.500
 starter stays at 2 gigas and a 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.080
 internal storage in 16 options 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.350
 and 32 gigas that we can expand via 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.550
 microsd cards up to 64 gigas one 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.310
 of the greats added of samson 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.840
 finally it does not incorporate the 64 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.970
 gigas that was something that was rumored in 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.830
 that there would only be versions of 32 and 64 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.430
 gigas but in the end this rumor has 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.110
 nothing left 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.000
 another great improvement comes in the camera that 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.680
 he mounted a 16 megapixel sensor in the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.990
 that we can expect a great improvement in 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.490
 the speed of capturing images 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.200
 samsung boasts of a time of 03 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.420
 seconds for taking photos 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.280
 including in those 0.3 seconds 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.440
 the approach thanks to a chip dedicated to 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.330
 this task that performs the autofocus more 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.009
 fast history of smartphones 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.580
 recording capabilities are added 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.950
 video in ultrah resolution from 4k to 30 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.330
 frames per second 2 pixels 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.470
 was the resolution of the front camera 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.720
 nothing 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.580
 Capture options are also included 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.800
 with a selection of a posteriori approach 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.780
 with selective focus souls by style 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.090
 liter this is an option that for not 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.670
 know we can make a picture worth and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.020
 then edit it focusing on some parts u 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.510
 others in the connectivity section 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.950
 this samsung galaxy s 5 goes completely 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.720
 loaded with 802.11 wifi makes from samsung 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.420
 galaxy s 4 is also added the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.100
 capacity double same antenna 2 x 2 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.650
 that promises a substantial improvement is 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.670
 rare reception of the signal is added the l 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.070
 the cut 4 with 150 megs of download and 50 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.140
 uploads almost as much as the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.970
 fastest fiber optic in Spain ' 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.130
 samsung has included a download mode 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.200
 called download booster that basically 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.860
 what allows us to download files 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.990
 pulling simultaneously from lte 4g and wifi 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.560
 at the same time this allows us maximum of 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.970
 download up to 400 megabytes at least that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.670
 is what samsung has told 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.040
 this section the bluetooth 4.0 looper a 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.959
 3.0 port that allows higher rates in 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.640
 the data transfer an nfc chip 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.590
 Integrated of an infrared port 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.900
 to control other devices like 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.500
 televisions the battery that incorporates the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.030
 new samsung galaxy s 5 this one finally 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.040
 2,800 a great but slightly by 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.300
 above that of the last model although 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.860
 also something below their 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.349
 most direct competitors 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.489
 the battery is something a lower point of 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.140
 what was expected was talked about 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.330
 rumors of a battery of up to 4000 thousand 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.890
 amps includes an ultra saving mode 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.480
 energy to make it last is a wine 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.190
 period yet much more let's be a 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.230
 promises 10 hours of web browsing and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.120
 up to 12 in video playback the 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.739
 samsung galaxy s 5 comes with resistance 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.480
 to the water area to the series dust as 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.269
 We have commented on a previous video with 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.860
 ip67 certification the bad part is that 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.780
 this will come with a lid in the port 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.700
 usb that we will have to lift for 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.140
 load a couple of sensors are added 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.640
 biometric the fingerprint reader 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.989
 including fingerprint button 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.700
 start that we can use to 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.739
 unlock the phone and also to 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.480
 make payments through paypal other 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.610
 sensor is a heart rate monitor that we can use 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.489
 as an accessory for the device 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.290
 samsung the exjefe 3.0 that includes the 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.150
 phone is an assistant 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.190
 personal training that will help us 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.890
 keep us in shape this is 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.960
 next to the phone's flash 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.850
 Of course the phone is compatible 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.580
 both with samsung accessories and 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.739

 samsung galaxy s 5 incorporates the latest 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.419
 Android version with android 4.4 point 2 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.040
 kat kit the phone comes out the most 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.960
 updated possible with the latest 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.520
 support and aesthetic improvements though 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.930
 it also does it including retouching in 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.340
 the usability of the phones of the 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.169
 brand we see that the South Korean manufacturer 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.850
 Little is about to change the 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.860
 Bottom buttons now the button 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.960
 capacitive left represents us the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.280
 menu function but the multitasking that 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.740
 is what we see on phones with android 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.570
 more pure as the nexus with this change 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.400
 It will be a little easier and faster to change 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.660
 from one application to another in our day 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.360
 a day if you have to wait for 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.460
 instants by pressing the start button on 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.960
 samsung galaxy s 5 arrives on April 11 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.150
 to international markets where 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.710
 we hope that Spain is included, 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.210
 know more details about its price 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.130

 700 euros as well we have 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.730
