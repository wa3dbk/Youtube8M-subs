00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.600 
blanks are high so no one is really okay
i<00:00:39.750> mean<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.500> matter<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.550> getting

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
i mean it's just a matter of getting

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.030 
i mean it's just a matter of getting
some<00:00:41.969> nice<00:00:42.180> good<00:00:42.540> course<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.620> that's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
some nice good course now and that's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
some nice good course now and that's
gonna<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.789> everything<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.270> gonna<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.570> go

from<00:00:46.230> there<00:00:46.379> i<00:00:46.410> guess<00:00:46.559> since<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.730> blind<00:00:48.149> seem

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
from there i guess since the blind seem

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.049 
from there i guess since the blind seem
to<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.629> moving<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.079> action<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.850> think

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
to be moving the action do do you think

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.040 
to be moving the action do do you think
that<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> tournament<00:00:51.600> would<00:00:51.660> never<00:00:51.840> end

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that the tournament would never end

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.860 
that the tournament would never end
everyone<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> blinds<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.309> limit<00:00:54.059> no<00:00:54.840> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
everyone for the blinds in limit no I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
everyone for the blinds in limit no I
mean<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> tournament<00:00:55.739> would<00:00:55.860> end<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.399> mean<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
mean the tournament would end I mean it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.689 
mean the tournament would end I mean it
seems<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:58.289> blinds<00:00:58.680> are<00:00:58.800> very<00:00:59.460> big

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
seems as if the blinds are very big

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.939 
seems as if the blinds are very big
right<00:00:59.910> now<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.359> mean<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.410> think<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:01.770> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
right now I mean if you think about it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
right now I mean if you think about it
now<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> play<00:01:03.650> 80,000<00:01:04.650> 160<00:01:05.420> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
now we're going to play 80,000 160 so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.710 
now we're going to play 80,000 160 so
that's<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.780> playing<00:01:07.460> 8160<00:01:08.460> online<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> like

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that's like playing 8160 online and like

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.149

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
list but same time its limit so i mean

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460 
list but same time its limit so i mean
in<00:01:35.700> limit<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.810> play<00:01:36.990> some<00:01:37.259> hands

in limit your have to play some hands

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.039 
in limit your have to play some hands
you<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.650> can't<00:01:38.100> fold<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.180> mean<00:01:39.659> every<00:01:39.900> hand

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you just can't fold I mean every hand

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.539 
you just can't fold I mean every hand
because<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.520> out

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
because then you're going to just go out

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.109 
because then you're going to just go out
so<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.810> uh<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.159> just<00:01:44.159> them<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.729> guess

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
so it's just uh it's just them I guess

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
so it's just uh it's just them I guess
the<00:01:45.329> guy<00:01:45.509> who<00:01:45.570> gets<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.380> nice<00:01:46.590> cards<00:01:47.040> right

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the guy who gets some nice cards right

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.830 
the guy who gets some nice cards right
now<00:01:47.460> he's<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:47.970> situation<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.750> then

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
now he's in a good situation and then

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
now he's in a good situation and then
hopefully<00:01:49.439> hopefully<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.159> play<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
hopefully hopefully it can play the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.149

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
days of play to get to this point were

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.090 
days of play to get to this point were
there<00:01:55.110> any<00:01:55.229> highlights<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> during

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
those four days the first day I I hadn't

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.249 
those four days the first day I I hadn't
slept<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.460> 40<00:02:00.360> hours<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> started

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
slept for like 40 hours when I started

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.310 
slept for like 40 hours when I started
so<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.360> didn't<00:02:03.360> play<00:02:03.479> very<00:02:03.509> good<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.110> mean

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
so I just I didn't play very good I mean

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.069 
so I just I didn't play very good I mean
I'm<00:02:04.439> happy<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.920> survived<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> first<00:02:05.610> day

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
I'm happy I survived the first day

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.620 
I'm happy I survived the first day
basically<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.259> mean<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
basically I mean on the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.160 
basically I mean on the
and<00:02:08.870> then<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.410> mean<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:11.060> always<00:02:11.510> feels<00:02:11.810> as<00:02:12.050> if

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
and then I mean it always feels as if

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.630 
and then I mean it always feels as if
you're<00:02:12.290> playing<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:12.770> good<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.250> mean<00:02:13.460> what

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
you're probably just running very good

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.380 
you're probably just running very good
too<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.740> mean<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.190> that's<00:02:16.760> kind<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.210> how<00:02:17.360> it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
too I mean so that's kind of how it

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.330 
too I mean so that's kind of how it
feels<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.990> mean<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.230> felt<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:18.650> if<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.920> played

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
feels I mean I felt this if I played

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.220 
feels I mean I felt this if I played
fine<00:02:19.670> for<00:02:19.970> three<00:02:20.150> days<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.600> I'm<00:02:20.690> at<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.930> final
