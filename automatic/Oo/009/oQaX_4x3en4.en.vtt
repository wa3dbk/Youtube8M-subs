whatever tuning you'd like to have for
your<00:00:20.740> guitar<00:00:21.070> let's<00:00:21.369> start<00:00:21.580> with<00:00:21.699> standard

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
your guitar let's start with standard

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.830 
your guitar let's start with standard
and<00:00:22.390> it<00:00:23.019> starts<00:00:23.410> always<00:00:23.949> with<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.699> low<00:00:25.000> string

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
and it starts always with the low string

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.359 
and it starts always with the low string
on<00:00:26.109> the<00:00:26.199> guitar<00:00:26.230> because<00:00:27.009> it's<00:00:27.189> going<00:00:27.279> to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
on the guitar because it's going to

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.160 
on the guitar because it's going to
change<00:00:27.429> with<00:00:27.880> the<00:00:27.970> tuning<00:00:28.390> we'll<00:00:28.839> just<00:00:29.019> say

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
change with the tuning we'll just say

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.859 
change with the tuning we'll just say
the<00:00:29.349> low<00:00:29.560> string<00:00:29.890> your<00:00:30.339> thickest<00:00:30.640> string<00:00:31.000> so
