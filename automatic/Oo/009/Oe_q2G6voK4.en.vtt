fresh<00:01:41.909> loquendo<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.600> wasn't<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:42.930> wide<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
fresh loquendo it wasn't as wide as it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.160 
fresh loquendo it wasn't as wide as it
is<00:01:44.159> now<00:01:44.310> obviously<00:01:44.790> because<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:46.020> they

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
is now obviously because you know they

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170 
is now obviously because you know they
only<00:01:46.259> use<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> white<00:01:47.220> strips<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.030> know

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
only use the white strips as you know

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.749 
only use the white strips as you know
previous<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.649> previous<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.250> why<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> time

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
previous not previous to it why the time

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.219 
previous not previous to it why the time
so<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:53.220> looked<00:01:53.909> very<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.180> yellow<00:01:54.570> well<00:01:55.049> not

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
so it looked very very yellow well not

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.560 
so it looked very very yellow well not
very<00:01:55.259> yellow<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.189> looked<00:01:56.820> very<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
very yellow but just looked very like a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.749 
very yellow but just looked very like a
little<00:01:57.810> stained<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:59.369> didn't<00:01:59.640> look

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
little stained and it didn't look

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.929 
little stained and it didn't look
congruent<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.840> terms<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.170> its<00:02:01.290> whiteness

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
congruent in terms of its whiteness

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.280 
congruent in terms of its whiteness
if<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.090> move<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.540> next<00:02:03.689> picture<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
if you move on to the next picture the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.370 
if you move on to the next picture the
next<00:02:04.500> picture<00:02:04.860> shows<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:06.450> transition<00:02:06.719> form

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
next picture shows the transition form

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.830 
next picture shows the transition form
that<00:02:07.979> they<00:02:08.160> when<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> went<00:02:09.330> before<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.599> had<00:02:09.690> them

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that they when I went before I had them

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.880 
that they when I went before I had them
gone<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.259> about<00:02:10.440> two<00:02:11.039> days<00:02:11.190> in

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
gone to about two days in

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.230 
gone to about two days in
and<00:02:12.130> as<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:12.580> can<00:02:12.700> see<00:02:12.880> there<00:02:13.030> wasn't<00:02:13.150> very

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
and as you can see there wasn't very

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.200 
and as you can see there wasn't very
much<00:02:13.480> difference<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.680> motif<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.520> it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
much difference in the motif in that it

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.640 
much difference in the motif in that it
was<00:02:16.330> still<00:02:16.540> fairly<00:02:16.870> yellow<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.470> know<00:02:17.530> it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
was still fairly yellow you know it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.490 
was still fairly yellow you know it
wasn't<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.040> wasn't<00:02:18.190> whitening<00:02:18.700> as<00:02:18.790> much<00:02:19.030> and

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
wasn't it wasn't whitening as much and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.070 
wasn't it wasn't whitening as much and
and<00:02:20.500> he<00:02:20.710> move<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.760> next<00:02:21.910> picture<00:02:22.150> this

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
and he move on to the next picture this

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.560 
and he move on to the next picture this
was<00:02:23.230> about<00:02:23.440> day<00:02:23.800> six<00:02:24.370> or<00:02:24.670> day<00:02:24.790> seven<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.390> was

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
was about day six or day seven so I was

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.200 
was about day six or day seven so I was
about<00:02:25.660> halfway<00:02:25.870> through<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.410> treatment<00:02:27.210> as

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
about halfway through the treatment as

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.610 
about halfway through the treatment as
you<00:02:28.330> can<00:02:28.480> see<00:02:28.660> my<00:02:28.840> teeth<00:02:29.050> were<00:02:29.230> beginning<00:02:29.590> to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
you can see my teeth were beginning to

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.830 
you can see my teeth were beginning to
get<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:30.070> little<00:02:30.340> whiter<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:31.060> wasn't<00:02:31.330> as<00:02:31.540> white

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
get a little whiter it wasn't as white

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.120 
get a little whiter it wasn't as white
as<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.530> now<00:02:32.740> obviously<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:35.040> didn't<00:02:36.040> really

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
as is now obviously but I didn't really

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.160 
as is now obviously but I didn't really
see<00:02:36.220> much<00:02:36.490> improvement<00:02:36.670> even<00:02:37.300> even<00:02:37.660> then<00:02:37.870> even

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
see much improvement even even then even

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.150 
see much improvement even even then even
when<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.410> took<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> picture<00:02:38.620> up<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.040> for

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
when I took the picture up so for

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.380 
when I took the picture up so for
because<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.490> thought<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.760> myself<00:02:39.850> I'll<00:02:40.150> assume

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
because I thought to myself I'll assume

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.640 
because I thought to myself I'll assume
or<00:02:40.570> hang<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> second<00:02:41.260> I've<00:02:41.350> been<00:02:41.500> using

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
or hang on a second I've been using

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.710 
or hang on a second I've been using
these<00:02:41.830> for<00:02:41.890> seven<00:02:42.220> days<00:02:42.370> now<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:43.540> really

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
these for seven days now and I really

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.510 
these for seven days now and I really
see<00:02:43.810> improvement<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.590> actually<00:02:44.890> working<00:02:45.070> I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
see improvement is actually working I

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520 
see improvement is actually working I
mean<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.360> can<00:02:46.480> feel<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.870> results<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.380> know<00:02:47.500> I

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
mean I can feel the results you know I

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.080 
mean I can feel the results you know I
could<00:02:47.680> feel<00:02:47.890> my<00:02:48.040> TF<00:02:48.280> getting<00:02:48.550> sensitive<00:02:48.880> at

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
could feel my TF getting sensitive at

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.120 
could feel my TF getting sensitive at
this<00:02:49.209> point<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.600> mean<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.780> was<00:02:49.900> feeling<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.350> she's

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
this point I mean I was feeling it she's

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.710 
this point I mean I was feeling it she's
just<00:02:51.430> off<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.580> taking<00:02:51.940> them<00:02:52.060> off<00:02:52.209> like<00:02:52.390> odd<00:02:52.600> to

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
just off of taking them off like odd to

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.870 
just off of taking them off like odd to
feel<00:02:52.870> like<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.170> sense<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.590> nice<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.280> say<00:02:54.459> somewhat

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
feel like I sense a nice to say somewhat

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.580 
feel like I sense a nice to say somewhat
safe<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:55.959> knew<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.230> there<00:02:56.320> was<00:02:56.410> something

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
safe so I knew that there was something

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.990 
safe so I knew that there was something
going<00:02:56.800> on<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.130> background<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:57.640> anybody

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
going on in the background but anybody

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.520 
going on in the background but anybody
see<00:02:58.209> it

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
see it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.350 
see it
so<00:02:59.530> if<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.709> look<00:02:59.830> at<00:02:59.920> the<00:02:59.980> next<00:03:00.190> picture<00:03:00.360> this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
so if you look at the next picture this

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.979 
so if you look at the next picture this
was<00:03:01.540> about<00:03:01.780> day<00:03:02.260> 13<00:03:02.920> or<00:03:03.790> night<00:03:04.209> day<00:03:04.570> 10<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.900> think

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
was about day 13 or night day 10 I think

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.190 
was about day 13 or night day 10 I think
yeah<00:03:05.320> day<00:03:05.530> 10<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.630> yeah<00:03:07.630> my<00:03:07.840> teeth<00:03:08.050> were

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
yeah day 10 and yeah my teeth were

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.690 
yeah day 10 and yeah my teeth were
beginning<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.500> look<00:03:08.620> whiter<00:03:08.920> now<00:03:09.220> as<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.580> can

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
beginning to look whiter now as you can

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.310 
beginning to look whiter now as you can
see<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:12.330> yeah<00:03:13.330> look<00:03:13.570> it<00:03:13.750> looks<00:03:13.900> prettier

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
see and yeah look it looks prettier

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.380 
see and yeah look it looks prettier
looks<00:03:14.680> pretty<00:03:14.920> cool<00:03:15.070> at<00:03:15.190> this<00:03:15.310> point<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:16.299> know

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
looks pretty cool at this point you know

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
looks pretty cool at this point you know
I<00:03:16.420> thought<00:03:16.600> there's<00:03:16.750> nobody<00:03:16.989> much<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.260> talk

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
I thought there's nobody much to talk

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.020 
I thought there's nobody much to talk
about<00:03:17.560> really<00:03:17.799> but<00:03:18.040> for<00:03:18.250> me<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.640> just<00:03:18.700> look<00:03:18.910> at

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
about really but for me I just look at
