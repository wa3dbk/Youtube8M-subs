monetary<00:04:28.300> system<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:29.050> have<00:04:29.080> when<00:04:30.040> you

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
monetary system that we have when you

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.360

the middle class gets wiped out so the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.200 
the middle class gets wiped out so the
people<00:04:35.980> who<00:04:36.040> get<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.370> use<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.580> money<00:04:36.910> first

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
people who get to use the money first

help the economy you have to study

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.560 
help the economy you have to study
monetary<00:05:35.140> theory<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:35.860> figure<00:05:36.250> out<00:05:36.280> why<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.090> is

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
monetary theory and figure out why it is
