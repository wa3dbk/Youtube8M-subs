ribbon and paper making an impression so
I'm<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:15.739> going<00:02:15.889> to<00:02:15.920> demonstrate<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.340> few

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.900 

very<00:02:27.360> cool<00:02:29.540> this<00:02:30.540> model<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:32.610> type<00:02:32.880> of

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
very cool this model a this type of

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.270 
very cool this model a this type of
mechanism<00:02:33.420> made<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> typewriter<00:02:34.800> cheaper<00:02:35.100> to

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
mechanism made the typewriter cheaper to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.470 
mechanism made the typewriter cheaper to
produce<00:02:35.430> because<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:35.970> had<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.270> more

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
produce because it had a more

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.590 
produce because it had a more
lightweight<00:02:36.660> because<00:02:36.960> they<00:02:37.230> had<00:02:37.380> less<00:02:37.590> parts

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
lightweight because they had less parts

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.940 
lightweight because they had less parts
now<00:02:39.600> some<00:02:40.230> people<00:02:40.320> might<00:02:40.530> think<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.890> was

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
now some people might think it was

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.790 
now some people might think it was
slower<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.110> there<00:02:43.110> are<00:02:43.230> sources<00:02:43.500> that

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
slower but this there are sources that

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.050 
slower but this there are sources that
indicates<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.400> could<00:02:44.610> actually<00:02:44.640> type

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
indicates that this could actually type

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.750 
indicates that this could actually type
at<00:02:45.650> over<00:02:47.240> 300<00:02:48.320> characters<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.590> minute<00:02:49.950> so

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
at over 300 characters a minute so

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.460 
at over 300 characters a minute so
that's<00:02:50.880> pretty<00:02:51.090> good<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.990> imagine<00:02:52.200> they

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
that's pretty good but I imagine they

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.090 
that's pretty good but I imagine they
were<00:02:52.590> very<00:02:52.830> well<00:02:53.160> trained<00:02:53.489> whoever<00:02:53.850> did<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
were very well trained whoever did that

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100 
were very well trained whoever did that

particular<00:03:03.930> machine<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.770> very<00:03:05.489> unique<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
particular machine is very unique in the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.229 
particular machine is very unique in the
sense<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.959> defective<00:03:07.709> machine<00:03:08.239> but

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
sense that is a defective machine but

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.729 
sense that is a defective machine but
what<00:03:09.330> makes<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.660> really<00:03:09.720> unique<00:03:09.989> is<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.380> this

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
what makes it really unique is that this

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.370 
what makes it really unique is that this
defect<00:03:11.130> was<00:03:11.400> made<00:03:11.580> at<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.150> factory<00:03:12.380> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
defect was made at the factory the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.400 
defect was made at the factory the
problem<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.770> I'm<00:03:13.860> referring<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:15.410> the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
problem that I'm referring to is the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.600 
problem that I'm referring to is the
backspace<00:03:16.830> key<00:03:17.660> now<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.720> notice<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
backspace key now you notice that the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.550 
backspace key now you notice that the
like<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.790> space<00:03:21.030> key<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:22.140> backspace<00:03:22.500> key

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
like the space key the backspace key

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.430 
like the space key the backspace key
also<00:03:22.890> moves<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:24.540> carriage<00:03:24.870> one<00:03:25.260> stays

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
also moves the the carriage one stays

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.920 
also moves the the carriage one stays
forward<00:03:25.739> instead<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.370> one<00:03:26.519> space<00:03:26.700> back<00:03:27.030> no<00:03:27.780> do

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
forward instead of one space back no do

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
forward instead of one space back no do
that<00:03:27.959> again<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:31.230> move<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.590> over<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.920> I

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
that again just move that over so I

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.039 
that again just move that over so I
tried<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.430> take<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.640> this<00:03:35.940> machine<00:03:36.239> apart<00:03:36.330> to

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
tried to take it this machine apart to

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.440 
tried to take it this machine apart to
solve<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.590> problem<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:38.610> turns<00:03:39.120> out<00:03:39.239> that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
solve the problem but turns out that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.750 
solve the problem but turns out that
this<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.350> entire<00:03:40.380> backspace<00:03:41.100> mechanism<00:03:41.610> was

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
this the entire backspace mechanism was

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.830 
this the entire backspace mechanism was
installed<00:03:43.880> backwards<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.150> upside<00:03:45.720> down

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
installed backwards and upside down

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.990 
installed backwards and upside down
partially<00:03:46.580> so<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:49.040> turned<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:50.489> whatever<00:03:50.820> it

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
partially so I turned it so whatever it

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.509 
partially so I turned it so whatever it
is<00:03:51.209> wearing<00:03:51.810> whatever<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.530> just<00:03:52.680> makes<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.010> all

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
is wearing whatever it just makes it all

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.100 
is wearing whatever it just makes it all
the<00:03:53.549> more<00:03:53.730> interesting<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.360> all<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.959> more

going<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.840> do<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.959> quick<00:04:04.230> typing<00:04:04.560> test<00:04:04.829> I'll

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
going to do a quick typing test I'll

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.880 
going to do a quick typing test I'll
type<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.239> quick<00:04:06.450> brown<00:04:06.780> fox<00:04:06.810> jumps<00:04:07.650> over<00:04:07.739> the

lazy<00:04:07.950> dog<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:09.510> tests<00:04:10.049> all<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.910> letters

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
lazy dog and this tests all the letters

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.979 
lazy dog and this tests all the letters
on<00:04:12.750> my<00:04:12.810> cylinder<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:14.579> I'm<00:04:15.540> just<00:04:15.660> going<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.870> do

I'll let you hear the bell and the
ribbon<00:06:06.569> is<00:06:06.720> very<00:06:06.990> faint<00:06:07.849> so<00:06:08.849> instead<00:06:09.300> of<00:06:09.360> a

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
ribbon is very faint so instead of a

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.770 
ribbon is very faint so instead of a
skew<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:09.840> type<00:06:10.050> and<00:06:10.259> with<00:06:10.440> that<00:06:10.979> you<00:06:11.069> see<00:06:11.280> the

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
skew the type and with that you see the

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:21.370 
skew the type and with that you see the
keypad<00:06:12.780> up<00:06:12.930> close<00:06:18.830> so<00:06:19.830> capital<00:06:20.250> letters
