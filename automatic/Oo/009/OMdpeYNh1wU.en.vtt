one<00:05:28.030> he<00:05:28.330> parties<00:05:28.900> I<00:05:28.990> think<00:05:29.020> he's<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.470> biggest

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
one he parties I think he's the biggest

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.270 
one he parties I think he's the biggest
of<00:05:30.010> the<00:05:30.100> two<00:05:30.280> of<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:34.770> 3,000<00:05:35.770> some<00:05:35.920> fool<00:05:36.160> of

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
of the two of the 3,000 some fool of

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.000 
of the two of the 3,000 some fool of
them<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:37.540> foreman<00:05:37.960> was<00:05:38.110> killed<00:05:38.410> by<00:05:38.950> the

them the foreman was killed by the

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.320 
them the foreman was killed by the
neighbor<00:05:39.520> across<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:40.030> alley<00:05:42.300> by<00:05:43.300> the

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
neighbor across the alley by the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.580 
neighbor across the alley by the
three-month<00:05:44.050> was<00:05:44.320> remain<00:05:44.710> here<00:05:44.980> in<00:05:45.070> our<00:05:45.190> yard

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
three-month was remain here in our yard

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.550 
three-month was remain here in our yard
you<00:05:47.590> see<00:05:48.100> police<00:05:48.700> is<00:05:49.030> still<00:05:49.780> standing<00:05:50.260> and

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
you see police is still standing and

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.950 
you see police is still standing and
watching<00:05:50.680> you<00:05:51.190> know<00:05:51.420> just<00:05:52.420> in<00:05:52.540> case<00:05:52.570> if<00:05:52.840> they

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
watching you know just in case if they

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.230 
watching you know just in case if they
do<00:05:53.170> try<00:05:53.440> to<00:05:53.500> get<00:05:53.770> out<00:05:53.920> if<00:05:54.130> they<00:05:54.460> by<00:05:54.640> some<00:05:54.970> chance

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
do try to get out if they by some chance

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.120 
do try to get out if they by some chance
they<00:05:55.450> probably<00:05:55.720> have<00:05:55.960> to<00:05:56.080> shoot<00:05:56.320> them<00:05:56.500> not

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
they probably have to shoot them not

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.060 
they probably have to shoot them not
that<00:05:57.280> I<00:05:57.370> was<00:05:57.550> blaming<00:05:57.820> I<00:05:58.120> assume<00:05:58.690> -<00:05:58.960> okay

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
that I was blaming I assume - okay

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.680 
that I was blaming I assume - okay
I<00:06:01.380> think<00:06:02.380> another<00:06:02.680> Charlie<00:06:03.160> with<00:06:03.480> the<00:06:04.480> most

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
I think another Charlie with the most

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.660 
I think another Charlie with the most
like<00:06:04.900> I<00:06:04.930> know<00:06:05.140> that<00:06:05.170> if<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.710> pits<00:06:06.220> get<00:06:06.520> up

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
like I know that if the pits get up

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.300 
like I know that if the pits get up
probably<00:06:07.120> more<00:06:07.840> likely<00:06:08.170> the<00:06:08.710> police<00:06:09.040> will

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
probably more likely the police will

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.340 
probably more likely the police will
shoot<00:06:09.340> him<00:06:09.730> on<00:06:09.880> sight

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
shoot him on sight

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.130 
shoot him on sight
here<00:06:11.350> she<00:06:11.500> comes<00:06:11.710> again<00:06:12.750> this<00:06:13.750> is<00:06:13.900> the<00:06:13.990> one

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
here she comes again this is the one

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.930 
here she comes again this is the one
that's<00:06:14.260> been<00:06:14.470> frequenting<00:06:15.160> the<00:06:15.190> yard<00:06:15.670> like<00:06:15.910> a

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
that's been frequenting the yard like a

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.220 
that's been frequenting the yard like a
scout<00:06:16.420> trying<00:06:16.810> to<00:06:16.900> figure<00:06:17.140> out<00:06:17.170> a<00:06:17.290> way<00:06:17.500> out

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
scout trying to figure out a way out

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.570 
scout trying to figure out a way out
not<00:06:20.230> ain't<00:06:20.560> think<00:06:20.770> too<00:06:20.950> much<00:06:21.100> about<00:06:21.160> it<00:06:21.460> when

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
not ain't think too much about it when

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.070 
not ain't think too much about it when
they<00:06:21.730> were<00:06:21.760> trying<00:06:22.000> to<00:06:22.120> get<00:06:22.300> in<00:06:22.450> and<00:06:22.810> are<00:06:22.930> they

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
they were trying to get in and are they

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.510 
they were trying to get in and are they
really<00:06:23.410> trying<00:06:23.530> their<00:06:23.770> best<00:06:23.800> to<00:06:24.070> try<00:06:24.130> to<00:06:24.280> go

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
really trying their best to try to go

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.590 
really trying their best to try to go
out<00:06:24.580> but<00:06:24.760> they<00:06:24.910> can't

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
out but they can't

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.860 
out but they can't
these<00:06:26.200> dogs<00:06:26.470> are<00:06:26.620> clearly<00:06:27.420> belong<00:06:28.420> to<00:06:28.630> someone

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
these dogs are clearly belong to someone

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.300 
these dogs are clearly belong to someone
because<00:06:29.170> they<00:06:29.260> each<00:06:29.410> have<00:06:29.680> collars<00:06:30.220> on<00:06:30.430> a

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310

because they each have collars on a
collar<00:06:33.310> and<00:06:33.550> I<00:06:33.640> think<00:06:34.150> all<00:06:34.270> three<00:06:34.510> of<00:06:34.600> them
