00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
there okay and if it squeaks like that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.000 
there okay and if it squeaks like that
that<00:01:03.329> means<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:05.299> there<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
that means it's not in there right so

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:16.580 
that means it's not in there right so
you<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> try<00:01:08.460> again<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:15.590> now

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you have to try again to see it and now

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.179 
you have to try again to see it and now
it<00:01:16.650> started<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> work<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
it started to work if you can do that

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:26.820 
it started to work if you can do that
it's<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.460> squeaky<00:01:21.710> but<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> fell

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.890 

so<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:27.980> is<00:01:28.160> not<00:01:28.520> squeaking<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.840> is<00:01:30.020> working<00:01:31.900> so

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
so it is not squeaking it is working so

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.390 
so it is not squeaking it is working so
then<00:01:33.140> you're<00:01:33.290> going<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.530> want<00:01:33.710> your<00:01:33.980> bubble

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.800 
then you're going to want your bubble
ball<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:35.090> be<00:01:35.300> as<00:01:35.650> big<00:01:36.650> as<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:36.890> gets

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
ball to be as big as it gets

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.620 
ball to be as big as it gets
and<00:01:39.160> you<00:01:40.160> do<00:01:40.400> not<00:01:40.580> have<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.360> have<00:01:41.600> a

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and you do not have to have a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.770 
and you do not have to have a
battery-operated<00:01:42.290> pump<00:01:43.010> and<00:01:43.610> then<00:01:44.390> some

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
battery-operated pump and then some

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.590 
battery-operated pump and then some
things<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.290> happens<00:01:45.770> when<00:01:45.950> you're<00:01:46.130> doing<00:01:46.160> it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
things that happens when you're doing it

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.060 
things that happens when you're doing it
is<00:01:47.600> this<00:01:48.729> thing<00:01:49.729> in<00:01:49.970> there<00:01:50.210> might<00:01:50.479> come<00:01:50.510> out

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
is this thing in there might come out

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.210 
is this thing in there might come out
like<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:53.170> but<00:01:54.170> all<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:54.650> to<00:01:54.740> do<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.010> push

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
like that but all you have to do is push

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.880 
like that but all you have to do is push
it<00:01:55.250> back<00:01:55.490> in<00:01:55.670> there<00:01:55.790> on<00:01:55.940> try<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.390> do<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.890> yeah

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
it back in there on try and do it yeah

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.570 
it back in there on try and do it yeah
that<00:01:58.250> works<00:02:00.970> so<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.150> thing<00:02:02.360> inside<00:02:02.570> here

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
that works so the thing inside here

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.100 
that works so the thing inside here
because<00:02:04.580> it's<00:02:04.759> all<00:02:05.000> dark<00:02:05.330> right<00:02:05.570> here<00:02:05.840> because

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
because it's all dark right here because

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.050 
because it's all dark right here because
there's<00:02:06.380> something<00:02:06.650> in<00:02:07.009> there<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.880> if<00:02:08.030> you

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
there's something in there that if you

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.130 
there's something in there that if you
pull<00:02:08.479> out<00:02:08.509> it's<00:02:08.959> going<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.320> get<00:02:09.770> all<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.130> air

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
pull out it's going to get all the air

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.770 
pull out it's going to get all the air
okay<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.520> comes<00:02:13.790> out<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.390> starts

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
okay so that comes out and it starts

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.840 
okay so that comes out and it starts
blowing<00:02:14.959> on<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.320> air<00:02:15.470> back<00:02:15.739> in<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.040> back<00:02:16.610> out

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
blowing on the air back in it back out

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.390 
blowing on the air back in it back out
just<00:02:17.630> push<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.470> in<00:02:18.620> there<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.010> try<00:02:19.220> and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
just push it in there and try and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.640 
just push it in there and try and
position<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:20.239> right<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.900> if<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.140> squeaks<00:02:27.470> like

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
position it right so if it squeaks like

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.120 
position it right so if it squeaks like
that<00:02:28.209> reposition<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.590> be<00:02:30.590> in<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.830> correct

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
that reposition it be in the correct

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.670
