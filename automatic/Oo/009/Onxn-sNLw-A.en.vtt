00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.599
 hi friends with you avery atelier 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.349
 today's video I shoot for myself 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.179
 this is such a small reminder in order 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.410
 so next time I will 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.699
 knit fur coat 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.660
 I did not reinvent the wheel because 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.769
 every time you start to take a fur coat 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 for example, I make knitted fur and 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.480
 each time you have to bet 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.700
 How wide is the experiment? 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 stripes 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 in what sequence to weave 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 so that they go to bed exactly and I decided everything 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 write to me so 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.640
 reminder for yourself 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.890
 but if it will be useful to you too 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 you can use I'll post on 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.059
 universal review but I do not know you will 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.570
 is it interesting or not and so grid i 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.530
 I cut the patterns 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.430
 I give at start-up more on the seams tuck I 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.430
 I do not cut 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:24.720
 beyond the edge I podzhibayu inside out and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.760
 sew on such a braid 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.590
 because in the process of wearing the product 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.130
 can stretch and so she doesn't 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:39.820
 stretched out i sewed mean bend 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:44.080
 sew the edge of the mesh webbing cut off 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.130
 too much and sew the second edge of the tape then 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.229
 there is this case is me podborta 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.229
 on the bottom of the product is braid 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:02.880
 after i post and make it 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:08.729
 shoulder seams I will lay on the neck and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.470
 then I wrap this one over here and 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.950
 how wide is unread 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:22.239
 strips at the moment I'm sewing from 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:27.040
 dissolution but it does not have the same meaning 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:31.170
 and the width of the strip is the most optimal as I 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.170
 found out in practice 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.349
 4 mm if you cut more then 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.380
 heavy 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:48.510
 a strip of ice through the cell in my cell 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:53.010
 also 4 millimeters because they 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.680
 there are different I measured it 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.540
 empty distance if measured 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:06.900
 report here polosochki stripes then 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:10.519
 It turns out 5 millimeters and how I 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.670
 I cut here such a fur coat which is me 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:18.360
 dissolution 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:22.920
 and has and has a transitional that is 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:28.620
 somewhere dark somewhere light I cut off 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:32.010
 here is one report or rather two reports i 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.519
 I take one report and another report less often 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:40.010
 three strips from one report three 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:43.320
 strips and other rapport and weave 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.680
 when these order strips end i 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.700
 I cut again three strips of one report 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.299
 three strips of another b6 and weaving 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.370
 and so it does not work 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:01.109
 the transition first goes dark then the light 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.890
 we sweat dark then light and since 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.890
 i am whipping 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.819
 So 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.690
 first i whip one way here i 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:23.160
 I lay out the grid and start to lead as 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.640
 to the top I have a bottom product in Odessa 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.870
 I have a pile of stripes naturally 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.120
 look at the bottom of the product 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.830
 here here i sew a needle with thread 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:42.630
 I always hang out here to her 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:46.860
 every time not to sew but I'm here 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:52.120
 there is every strip I sew 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:56.860
 so here is the ponytail and the slab first first 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.280
 striped here and so through the cell then 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:08.320
 there is not in every cell through one here 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:15.160
 to here court through one next row i 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:19.450
 I come here if here I am the first row 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.240
 the second row comes next for me here 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.830
 This is the first string 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.860
 I had a twist of 1 rope 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.530
 the second row I have 2 ropes I 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:38.919
 if its the first I twisted this way 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:42.210
 then 2 I already twist the bottom and so I 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.210
 a pigtail is obtained 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.159
 that is, you can not trail in one direction 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.900
 otherwise they will twist snails like that 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:58.830
 It spreads in one direction and 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:02.729
 and introduces bias on the products so I 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.389
 I make a pigtail yes here's one rope one 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.599
 side 1 rope to the other side 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:11.580
 farther 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:15.479
 I miss one rope and again 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:21.779
 pigtail one way, the other side 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:27.210
 and I skip the series in principle 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:28.819
 not combing looks pretty 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.300
 tightly 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:37.770
 Net not shine in general, I 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:41.819
 This method is arranged and it is not clear that 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:48.330
 here caspit and pigtails look like this 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:55.740
 single weave speed weaving here 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:59.129
 this canvas for two days if you measure it 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:06.899
 ruler then I get a little 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:09.569
 more than 50 meters wide, then there's a 

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:11.870
 canvas to tie, I need two 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:11.870
 of the day 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:23.350
 That's actually all this video I 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:27.380
 filmed for myself 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:31.340
 for reminder but if you had it 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:35.110
 interesting and helpful then please 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.110
 use everything bye
