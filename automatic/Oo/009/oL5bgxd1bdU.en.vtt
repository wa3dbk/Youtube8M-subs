00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
what was the number one objective for

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.440 
what was the number one objective for
you<00:00:11.280> as<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.550> went<00:00:11.759> through<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:11.969> practice

you as you went through this practice
just<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> get<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> feel<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:14.040> know<00:00:14.160> it's<00:00:14.549> quite<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
just to get a feel you know it's quite a

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.939 
just to get a feel you know it's quite a
bit<00:00:15.240> different<00:00:15.360> than<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> ARCIC<00:00:16.109> are<00:00:16.289> these

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
bit different than the ARCIC are these

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.840 
bit different than the ARCIC are these
cars<00:00:17.220> move<00:00:17.460> around<00:00:17.670> much<00:00:18.000> more<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:19.730> you<00:00:20.730> know

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
cars move around much more and you know

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.550 
cars move around much more and you know
we<00:00:21.359> definitely<00:00:21.480> had<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.990> find<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> little<00:00:22.380> bit

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
we definitely had to find a little bit

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.029 
we definitely had to find a little bit
of<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.740> balance<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.660> but<00:00:24.710> everything<00:00:25.710> is

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
of a balance on it but everything is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.339 
of a balance on it but everything is
better<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.420> car<00:00:27.630> saw<00:00:27.840> some<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
better it's like the car saw some of the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.570 
better it's like the car saw some of the
same<00:00:28.560> tendencies<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> did<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> beginning

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
same tendencies I did at the beginning

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.420 
same tendencies I did at the beginning
but<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.090> much<00:00:30.269> better<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:32.099> did<00:00:32.250> make

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
but it's much better so we we did make

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.729 
but it's much better so we we did make

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
just tried to run in the pack every time

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.700 
just tried to run in the pack every time
to<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> car<00:01:34.020> was<00:01:34.050> going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to know what the car was going to do and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.310 
to know what the car was going to do and
it<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> bit<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> handful<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.570> times<00:01:36.600> but

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it was a bit of a handful at times but

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.850 
it was a bit of a handful at times but
like<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.100> said<00:01:38.160> I<00:01:38.340> played<00:01:38.490> my<00:01:38.700> gaps<00:01:39.090> pretty<00:01:39.450> safe

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
like I said I played my gaps pretty safe

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.410 
like I said I played my gaps pretty safe
the<00:01:40.860> car<00:01:41.009> feels<00:01:41.220> pretty<00:01:41.399> fast<00:01:41.700> though<00:01:41.910> I<00:01:42.060> felt

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the car feels pretty fast though I felt

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.760 
the car feels pretty fast though I felt
I<00:01:42.540> feel<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.080> really<00:01:43.200> pull<00:01:43.500> up<00:01:43.620> on

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
I feel like I can really pull up on

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.320 
I feel like I can really pull up on
people<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.370> catch<00:01:44.580> them<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> lot<00:01:44.940> coming<00:01:45.090> out

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
people and I catch them a lot coming out

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.510 
people and I catch them a lot coming out
of<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> corner<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.440> think<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.010> good<00:01:47.190> so<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
of the corner so I think it's good so I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.240 
of the corner so I think it's good so I
think<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.760> I<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:48.659> figure<00:01:48.900> it<00:01:49.110> out<00:01:49.260> I<00:01:49.650> think

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
think if I can figure it out I think

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
think if I can figure it out I think
we'll<00:01:50.400> have<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.580> pretty<00:01:50.850> fast<00:01:51.060> car<00:01:51.390> she's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
we'll have a pretty fast car she's

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.360 
we'll have a pretty fast car she's
figuring<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.440> out<00:01:52.560> i<00:01:52.620> think<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.159> fine<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
figuring it out i think just fine a

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.700 
figuring it out i think just fine a

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
took over I mean she learned the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.770

difference<00:02:07.220> between<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.940> bush<00:02:08.179> cars<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.660> our

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
difference between the bush cars and our

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.540 
difference between the bush cars and our
cars<00:02:09.080> our<00:02:09.200> cars<00:02:09.259> just<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.800> lot<00:02:09.950> more<00:02:09.979> planted

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
cars our cars just a lot more planted

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.650 
cars our cars just a lot more planted

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
and these cars moving around a lot more

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.840

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
so you know it took a little bit for us

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.880 
so you know it took a little bit for us
to<00:02:13.940> get<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.120> car<00:02:14.300> tuned<00:02:14.569> in<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:15.080> her<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.739> kind
