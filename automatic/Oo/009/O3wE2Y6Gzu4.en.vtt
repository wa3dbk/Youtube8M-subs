00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
age rating for 18 plus so it looks like

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.279 
age rating for 18 plus so it looks like
they're<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> lift<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.629> create

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
one group specifically for the game so

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.380 
one group specifically for the game so
that's<00:00:52.140> great<00:00:52.620> news<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.949> Australia<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.640> it's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
change Blizzard bought a walk-off
they're<00:00:57.989> still<00:00:58.230> losing<00:00:58.559> players<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.699> wouldn't

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
they're still losing players I wouldn't

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.380 
they're still losing players I wouldn't
say<00:01:00.449> an<00:01:00.690> alarming<00:01:01.320> rate<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.760> at<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.359> point

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
say an alarming rate I know at one point

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
say an alarming rate I know at one point
I've<00:01:03.840> had<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> about<00:01:04.439> four<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.769> five

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I've had up to about four or five

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
I've had up to about four or five
accounts<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.549> run<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.570> think<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:07.140> just

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
accounts in the run so I think it's just

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.859 
accounts in the run so I think it's just
with<00:01:07.619> its<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.490> started<00:01:09.060> roughly<00:01:09.479> since<00:01:09.659> when

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
with its it's started roughly since when

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.530 
with its it's started roughly since when
the<00:01:09.960> battlenet<00:01:10.260> account<00:01:10.380> came<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.700> what

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the battlenet account came in so what

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.140 
the battlenet account came in so what
does<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.750> mean<00:01:13.049> well<00:01:13.560> once<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.790> could<00:01:14.970> put

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
does that mean well once you could put

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.940 
does that mean well once you could put
all<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.600> accounts<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.380> account<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
all of your accounts on to one account a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.499 
all of your accounts on to one account a
lot<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.189> people<00:01:17.310> took<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.909> time<00:01:18.150> at<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> same

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
lot of people took that time at the same

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.149 
lot of people took that time at the same
time<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.930> merge<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.320> other<00:01:19.470> characters<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
time to merge all other characters on to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
time to merge all other characters on to
the<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.400> account<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.880> different<00:01:21.360> realms

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the one account on different realms

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
the one account on different realms
different<00:01:21.990> servers<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.490> know<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
different servers and you know it just

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.070 
different servers and you know it just
keeps<00:01:24.060> getting<00:01:24.270> cheaper<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.570> cheaper<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.990> be

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
keeps getting cheaper and cheaper to be

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.330 
keeps getting cheaper and cheaper to be
out<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> transfer<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.710> characters<00:01:26.100> so

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
out of transfer your characters so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.320 
out of transfer your characters so
they're<00:01:26.520> probably<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.880> transferred

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
they're probably just transferred

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.940 
they're probably just transferred
they're<00:01:27.479> paying<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> paying<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> money<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
they're paying the paying the money to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.350 
they're paying the paying the money to
transfer<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.400> character<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.880> disabled<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
transfer the character and disabled the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910 
transfer the character and disabled the
account<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> don't<00:01:31.439> think<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
account so I don't think it's going to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.240 
account so I don't think it's going to
be<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> huge<00:01:32.340> drama<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.740> know<00:01:34.860> blizzard

but blizzard are introducing other

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.230 
but blizzard are introducing other
things<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.229> try<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:38.280> people<00:01:38.430> back<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
things to try and get people back in and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
things to try and get people back in and
there's<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.810> little<00:01:39.930> bit<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.590> next

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
there's a little bit on that just next

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.810 
there's a little bit on that just next
and<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> think<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.899> new

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
and what I think that is is this new

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.280 
and what I think that is is this new
presumable<00:01:44.820> expansion<00:01:45.600> coming<00:01:45.780> up<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> mists

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
presumable expansion coming up the mists

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.910 
presumable expansion coming up the mists
of<00:01:46.409> pandaria<00:01:46.579> now<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.560> I've

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
of pandaria now what that is and I've

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.649 
of pandaria now what that is and I've
seen<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> couple<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.939> videos<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.390> already

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
seen a couple of videos in this already

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.020 
seen a couple of videos in this already
I've<00:01:52.590> read<00:01:52.860> some<00:01:53.100> other<00:01:53.280> articles<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.000> well

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I've read some other articles as well

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
I've read some other articles as well
that<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.990> mists<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> pandaria<00:01:55.350> will

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that the mists of pandaria will

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.580 
that the mists of pandaria will
introduce<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.490> new<00:01:56.610> race<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
introduce a new race and that is the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.719 
introduce a new race and that is the
Panda<00:01:58.979> man<00:01:59.210> race<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.460> could

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
Panda man race so this this this could

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.310 
Panda man race so this this this could
be<00:02:02.909> interesting<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:03.780> might<00:02:04.200> even

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
be interesting because they might even

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.670 
be interesting because they might even
bring<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.890> new<00:02:05.070> MLA<00:02:05.790> style<00:02:06.380> class<00:02:07.380> where<00:02:07.619> you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
bring in a new MLA style class where you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.520 
bring in a new MLA style class where you
don't<00:02:07.799> need<00:02:07.979> weapons<00:02:08.390> or<00:02:09.390> using<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.989> staff<00:02:10.259> as

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
don't need weapons or using a staff as

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.730 
don't need weapons or using a staff as
so<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.840> folklore<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
so I think in the folklore of the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.710 
so I think in the folklore of the
ancient<00:02:14.130> Chinese<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.150> stuff<00:02:15.270> like<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
ancient Chinese and stuff like that the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.809 
ancient Chinese and stuff like that the
panda<00:02:16.080> walked<00:02:16.319> around<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.250> drunken

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
panda walked around like the drunken

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.600 
panda walked around like the drunken
panda<00:02:18.530> if<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.620> look<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.920> game<00:02:20.130> called<00:02:20.340> Han

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
panda if you look on a game called Han

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.000 
panda if you look on a game called Han
they've<00:02:20.850> recently<00:02:21.270> released<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.800> panda<00:02:22.800> type

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
they've recently released a panda type

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.240 
they've recently released a panda type
character<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.360> he<00:02:24.510> walks<00:02:24.720> around<00:02:25.250> when

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
character with and he walks around when

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.370 
character with and he walks around when
with<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.430> jug<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.150> alcohol<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:27.930> he<00:02:28.110> or<00:02:28.230> something

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
with a jug of alcohol so he or something

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.400 
with a jug of alcohol so he or something
like<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.920> with<00:02:29.489> his<00:02:29.670> polyp<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.300> other<00:02:31.080> people

like and with his polyp to other people

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.100 
like and with his polyp to other people

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
I think it's kind of cool it'll

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.870 
I think it's kind of cool it'll
introduce<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.709> lot<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.069> lot<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
introduce a lot of the lot of the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.600 
introduce a lot of the lot of the
cuteness<00:02:36.330> back<00:02:36.690> into<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.739> alliance<00:02:38.220> side<00:02:38.400> to

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
cuteness back into the alliance side to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.729 
cuteness back into the alliance side to
bring<00:02:39.150> back<00:02:39.330> all<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.020> kids<00:02:40.290> back<00:02:40.500> across

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
bring back all the kids back across

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.380 
bring back all the kids back across
again<00:02:41.040> instead<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.400> playing<00:02:41.550> blood<00:02:41.970> else<00:02:42.150> or

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
again instead of playing blood else or

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.509 
again instead of playing blood else or
night<00:02:42.870> else<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.290> then<00:02:43.380> blood<00:02:43.560> elves<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:44.010> so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
this will probably what I presume is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.259

going to be Alliance so it'll it'll

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.509 
going to be Alliance so it'll it'll
bring<00:02:49.230> people<00:02:49.590> back<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:50.010> for<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.190> painters
