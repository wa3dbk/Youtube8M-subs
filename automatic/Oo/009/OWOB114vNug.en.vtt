00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.570
 go it's badly romero warner 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.670
 month this new record but if we form 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.030
 available idof do it wrong he has to do 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.379
 very very badly this messiah so if I'm 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.330
 a video today is for you 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.830
 show one thing it's a trick of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.100
 crazy I discovered there really is not 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.170
 long is that there is really a way 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.590
 to make massive credit and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.009
 crazy mad margins with ebp is a 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.219
 type of card I showed you away 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.880
 in fact it's the training cards 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:42.360
 we do not care 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.950
 and then the cards then device it 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 is really really way to do 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.539
 something with that bored by chance 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.350
 in fact I was looking at the prices and then I 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.210
 I said shit 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.219
 frankly there really is nobody 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 on it we can have good cards 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:01.829
 for 200 250 and resell them easy 800 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.899
 850,900 so I thought it must be 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.970
 to go there so what I actually did 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.060
 that's what I'm doing now you 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.520
 put 800 in maximum price and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.220
 devices then research workout 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.380
 Unfortunately this is what you see is 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.150
 a lot of boxes do good what they are going 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 we interest 4-2-3-1 cards in 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.689
 especially since they are a small 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.430
 little more expensive than men especially 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.990
 that the 5 2 2 1 that's it sells 1000 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.810
 nearly 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.170
 layana above 800 then we have them 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.700
 cards 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.040
 2 second map which is very 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.439
 interesting is the map 4 3 2 1 the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.230
 card 4 3 2 1 that's right here like 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.750
 you can see it's selling its ace 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.240
 so I go on it is selling 1,950 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.320
 so we dance there we go to continue 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.900
 like that and then good there is only like 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.130
 that we find whip cards 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.370
 I like doing business I you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.660
 showed right away but it's a scandal 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:03.930
 I'm just waiting for my dear to finish 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.900
 so let's see ah see yeah but then I 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.490
 do not think I have it I do not think I have it 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.490
 because there is already someone on it 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.050
 will we succeed in the voice 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.760
 announcement I do not like it sailing is there when 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.380
 you see that it goes too fast you 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.480
 leave it's not a problem then I 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.820
 you finally see something that like 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.780
 outrageous so you always go 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.480
 the same in this device 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.700
 and then there this time it's up to you 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:42.650
 go put 950 minimum you go m 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.380
 you're going m you're going to put cooking 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.570
 so the idea you look at your cards 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.740
 cards you just bought it's going 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.980
 to have immediately 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.910
 if there is a way to do something good 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.190
 me 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.750
 the gap that I managed to have and I 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.270
 will show it to you in ten minutes 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.890
 it's the cards 4 3 of loeb so there this 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:12.510
 that we can see these 900 cases his share not 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:15.480
 already we see m 850 then full game to 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.800
 360 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.670
 ok the idea is to go up to a 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:29.140
 hour in fact like that you will see 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:32.170

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:38.380

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.860
 full of 90 from before 1950 where the 800 he goes 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.860
 not stay long 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.670

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.790
