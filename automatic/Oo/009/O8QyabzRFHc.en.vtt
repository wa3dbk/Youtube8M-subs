00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.450
 of some exotic snake animals 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.180
 good that would no longer cheer me up the truth 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.570
 I would not cheer up because having children in 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.850

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.880
 style 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.710

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.990
 metro 10 15 meter 10 or so 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.350
 They are the ones I recommend it for 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.590
 start to start in the world of 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.450
 snakes now yes this is very 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.149
 quiet as in mice from 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.550
 tiny as the newborn mouse 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.520
 there is changing as it goes 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.460
 growing is changing to food 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.550
 until you get to this it is at this size a 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.980
 little bit bigger 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.310

 the bird 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.230
 you would be encouraged to grab a viper 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.280
 snake 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.599
 is a python würm is a bourgeois albino 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.569
 Of course, this arrival is a 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.700
 This male takes you to grow up 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.620
 four and a half meters from three to four 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.930
 meters and a half more good more than anything 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.329
 to give prey to its size due 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.310

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.840
 I like young people a lot 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.230
 I did not want to have a test when I 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.030
 they leave so that it has it outside normal 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.890
 you invite the people who grab them and 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.230

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.040
 others that if you need to advance the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.350
 taking them for a walk more than ever 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.270

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.280
