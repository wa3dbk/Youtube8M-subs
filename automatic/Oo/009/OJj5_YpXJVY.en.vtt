glide system that we use here we have

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.349 
glide system that we use here we have
the<00:01:27.270> material<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> inside<00:01:28.469> of<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.920> bag

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
the material on the inside of the bag

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.910 
the material on the inside of the bag
not<00:01:30.359> allowing<00:01:30.719> the<00:01:30.810> zipper<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> catch<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.560> any

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
not allowing the zipper to catch on any

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.819 
not allowing the zipper to catch on any
material<00:01:32.219> in<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:34.079> zip<00:01:34.289> pillar<00:01:34.469> itself

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
material in there the zip pillar itself

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.310 
material in there the zip pillar itself
has<00:01:35.340> an<00:01:35.520> auto<00:01:35.700> lock<00:01:36.000> feature<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.960> that's<00:01:36.990> not

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
has an auto lock feature so that's not

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.599 
has an auto lock feature so that's not
going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> come<00:01:37.710> undone<00:01:38.009> during<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> night

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
going to come undone during the night

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.130 
going to come undone during the night
and<00:01:38.909> then<00:01:39.450> you'll<00:01:39.570> also<00:01:39.719> find<00:01:39.990> that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and then you'll also find that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
and then you'll also find that
throughout<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> length<00:01:41.039> of<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> zips<00:01:41.820> we

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
throughout the length of all the zips we

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.029 
throughout the length of all the zips we
have<00:01:42.179> full<00:01:42.450> length<00:01:42.689> zipper<00:01:42.899> files<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.829> this

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
have full length zipper files so this

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.370 
have full length zipper files so this
one<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.939> stop<00:01:45.179> any<00:01:45.479> drafts<00:01:45.840> from<00:01:46.049> coming

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
one here to stop any drafts from coming

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.069 
one here to stop any drafts from coming
in<00:01:46.499> through<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.890> app<00:01:47.070> itself<00:01:47.899> at<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> top

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
in through this app itself at the top

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.950 
in through this app itself at the top
you<00:01:49.770> will<00:01:49.799> find<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.820> both<00:01:51.119> sides<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.749> have

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
you will find on both sides we have

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
you will find on both sides we have
internal<00:01:52.530> storage<00:01:52.859> pockets<00:01:53.249> and<00:01:53.460> then

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
internal storage pockets and then

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.719 
internal storage pockets and then
running<00:01:54.960> across<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.499> we<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.310> detachable

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
running across here we have a detachable

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
running across here we have a detachable
hood<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.929> the<00:01:58.109> zip<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.710> runs

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
hood so there is just the zip that runs

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
hood so there is just the zip that runs
along<00:01:59.159> here<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.490> well<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.329> take<00:02:00.509> this

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
along here as well so we can take this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.709 
along here as well so we can take this
off<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:02.069> also<00:02:02.520> has<00:02:02.939> built-in<00:02:03.479> pill

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
off and this also has built-in pill

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.649 
off and this also has built-in pill
isn't<00:02:03.929> it<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.350> great<00:02:05.310> feature<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.270> contour

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
isn't it a great feature of the contour

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.450 
isn't it a great feature of the contour
double<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.409> if<00:02:07.679> you<00:02:07.770> want<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.039> create<00:02:08.250> two

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
double is if you want to create two

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.340 
double is if you want to create two
single<00:02:09.149> sleeping<00:02:09.450> bags<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:09.929> simple<00:02:10.260> to

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
single sleeping bags it's very simple to

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.390 
single sleeping bags it's very simple to
do<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.620> just<00:02:10.800> simply<00:02:11.070> on<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.620> top<00:02:13.800> here<00:02:14.010> and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
do we just simply on the top here and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.950 
do we just simply on the top here and
then<00:02:14.550> we<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.850> take<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> two<00:02:15.480> apart

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
then we can take the two apart

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.740 
then we can take the two apart
Zephyrs<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.980> create<00:02:17.310> two<00:02:17.520> singles<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.630> that's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
Zephyrs and create two singles so that's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.510 
Zephyrs and create two singles so that's
all<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.990> features<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.470> our<00:02:19.740> contour<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.250> double

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
all the features of our contour a double

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.750 
all the features of our contour a double
thanks<00:02:20.940> very<00:02:21.150> much<00:02:21.270> for<00:02:21.420> watching
