games by the master sub Kolski himself
to<00:00:23.480> demonstrate<00:00:24.480> how<00:00:24.890> devastating<00:00:25.890> one

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
to demonstrate how devastating one

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.540 
to demonstrate how devastating one
before<00:00:26.760> was<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.300> his<00:00:27.720> hands

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
we'll then go on to look at some theory

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.240 
we'll then go on to look at some theory
I've<00:00:32.160> pulled<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.640> most<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> main<00:00:33.630> lines

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
I've pulled out most of the main lines

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.889 
I've pulled out most of the main lines
concentrated<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.399> essential<00:00:36.149> information

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
concentrated on essential information

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.950 
concentrated on essential information
and<00:00:37.610> try<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> show<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.120> way<00:00:39.360> forward<00:00:39.719> in

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and try to show you a way forward in

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.650 
and try to show you a way forward in
each<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.559> these<00:00:40.710> main<00:00:40.980> lines<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.239> you

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
each of these main lines so that you

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.330 
each of these main lines so that you
know<00:00:42.780> once<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.140> learn<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> theory<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.280> will

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
know once you learn the theory you will

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.720 
know once you learn the theory you will
have<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> good<00:00:44.850> basic<00:00:45.300> grasp<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:46.670> how<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
have a good basic grasp of how the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
have a good basic grasp of how the
opening<00:00:48.180> works<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.980> finally<00:00:49.980> we're<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
opening works and finally we're going to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.340 
opening works and finally we're going to
go<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> look<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:50.940> some<00:00:51.000> modern<00:00:51.660> games<00:00:51.930> for

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
go on to look at some modern games for

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.830 
go on to look at some modern games for
the<00:00:52.410> last<00:00:52.559> few<00:00:52.860> years<00:00:52.920> where<00:00:53.579> v4<00:00:54.090> has<00:00:54.329> featured

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the last few years where v4 has featured

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
the last few years where v4 has featured
to<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.289> whether<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.699> still<00:00:57.030> working<00:00:57.510> at

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to see whether it's still working at

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.660 
to see whether it's still working at
master<00:00:58.050> level<00:00:58.879> but<00:00:59.879> firstly<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.570> ideas<00:01:01.670> well

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
master level but firstly the ideas well

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.899 
master level but firstly the ideas well
okay<00:01:03.769> from<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:04.920> perspective<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.790> most

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
okay from my perspective the most

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.929 
okay from my perspective the most
obvious<00:01:06.390> idea<00:01:06.840> behind<00:01:07.170> v4<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.490> create<00:01:08.880> an

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
obvious idea behind v4 is to create an

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
obvious idea behind v4 is to create an
unusual<00:01:09.420> position<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> outset

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
unusual position right at the outset

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.359 
unusual position right at the outset
which<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.390> studied<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.799> opponent

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
which you have studied and your opponent

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.539 
which you have studied and your opponent
has<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.780> element<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> surprise<00:01:16.549> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
has not the element of surprise the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.070 
has not the element of surprise the
element<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.979> an<00:01:21.439> orthodoxy<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:24.080> apparent

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
element of an orthodoxy is very apparent

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.810 
element of an orthodoxy is very apparent
after<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.100> before

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
after the one before

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.090 
after the one before
and<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:28.049> you've<00:01:28.229> studied<00:01:28.439> these<00:01:28.650> positions

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and so if you've studied these positions

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.740 
and so if you've studied these positions
well<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.880> likely<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.509> you're<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
well it's likely that you're going to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.350 
well it's likely that you're going to
have<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> head<00:01:31.079> start<00:01:31.409> over<00:01:31.560> well<00:01:32.220> 99%<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.180> your

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
have a head start over well 99% of your

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.010 
have a head start over well 99% of your
opponents<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.740> b4<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:36.060> unusual

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
opponents and so b4 is a very unusual

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.609 
opponents and so b4 is a very unusual
and<00:01:37.200> interesting<00:01:37.560> move<00:01:38.750> quite<00:01:39.750> often<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and interesting move quite often it's a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.440 
and interesting move quite often it's a
provocative<00:01:40.890> move<00:01:41.220> because<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.970> pawn<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.420> b4

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
provocative move because that pawn on b4

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.920 
provocative move because that pawn on b4
is<00:01:43.350> exposed<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.280> unprotected<00:01:45.000> black<00:01:45.570> often

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
is exposed as unprotected black often

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.899 
is exposed as unprotected black often
gets<00:01:46.079> carried<00:01:46.409> away<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.399> cell<00:01:47.700> culture

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
gets carried away in the cell culture

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.380 
gets carried away in the cell culture
trying<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.600> attack<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.140> win<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.500> pawn

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
trying to attack and win this pawn

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.480 
trying to attack and win this pawn
sometimes<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.200> b-pawn<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> offered<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.220> bait

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
sometimes the b-pawn is offered as bait

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.420 
sometimes the b-pawn is offered as bait
in<00:01:53.869> order<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.110> create<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.740> central<00:01:56.189> pour

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
in order to create a central pour

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.980 
in order to create a central pour
majority<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.750> interesting<00:01:59.630> quite<00:02:00.630> often<00:02:00.780> in

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
majority it's interesting quite often in

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.240 
majority it's interesting quite often in
the<00:02:01.020> sole<00:02:01.259> Kolski<00:02:01.619> black<00:02:03.649> takes<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.829> pawn<00:02:05.100> on

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the sole Kolski black takes this pawn on

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.389 
the sole Kolski black takes this pawn on
b4<00:02:05.280> only<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> find<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.409> D&amp;E<00:02:07.829> pause<00:02:08.099> which

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
b4 only to find that the D&amp;E pause which

opening suddenly come forward and

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.120 
opening suddenly come forward and
cramping<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.230> feature<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.650> soul

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
cramping it's a feature of the soul

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.730 
cramping it's a feature of the soul
skeered<00:02:14.600> white<00:02:15.600> often<00:02:15.750> gets<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.170> central<00:02:16.530> poor

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740
