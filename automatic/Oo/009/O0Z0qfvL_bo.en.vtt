00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
liking because I got it in the summer

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.410 
liking because I got it in the summer
time<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.759> getting<00:01:59.880> colder<00:02:00.390> i

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
time but now that it's getting colder i

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.630 
time but now that it's getting colder i
found<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.229> lasts<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> lot<00:02:01.799> longer<00:02:01.860> when

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
found that it lasts a lot longer when

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.300 
found that it lasts a lot longer when
you<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.969> drier<00:02:03.329> skin<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:04.950> works<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you have drier skin and it just works a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.790 
you have drier skin and it just works a
lot<00:02:05.430> better<00:02:05.490> when<00:02:05.880> your<00:02:06.030> skin<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
lot better when your skin is more on the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.710 
lot better when your skin is more on the
right<00:02:06.950> side<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.520> definitely<00:02:07.760> aren't<00:02:08.479> going

don't<00:04:11.250> really<00:04:11.609> like<00:04:11.849> I<00:04:12.689> bought<00:04:13.260> this

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
don't really like I bought this

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.229 
don't really like I bought this
foundation<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.340> kind<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.730> give<00:04:14.909> it<00:04:14.939> a<00:04:15.060> bad

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
foundation and kind of give it a bad

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.749 
foundation and kind of give it a bad
review<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.500> NARS<00:04:16.739> sheer<00:04:16.889> glow<00:04:17.160> I

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
review and it is the NARS sheer glow I

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.060 
review and it is the NARS sheer glow I
still<00:04:18.630> have<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:18.989> because<00:04:19.289> I<00:04:19.320> wasn't<00:04:19.650> able<00:04:19.799> to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
still have it because I wasn't able to

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
still have it because I wasn't able to
return<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.549> at<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:20.910> time<00:04:21.500> but<00:04:22.759> this<00:04:23.759> one<00:04:23.970> is

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
return it at the time but this one is

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.879 
return it at the time but this one is
definitely<00:04:24.210> more<00:04:24.690> for<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.960> drier<00:04:25.199> skin<00:04:25.500> type

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
definitely more for a drier skin type

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.040 
definitely more for a drier skin type
and<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:26.669> I'm<00:04:26.940> looking<00:04:27.060> forward<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.630> using<00:04:27.780> this

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.719 
and so I'm looking forward to using this
throughout<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.530> winter<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:29.130> see<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.580> know

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
how I like it better because when I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.920 
how I like it better because when I
originally<00:04:32.039> got<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.729> was<00:04:32.970> way<00:04:33.120> too<00:04:33.150> greasy<00:04:33.690> for
