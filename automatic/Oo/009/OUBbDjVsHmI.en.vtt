I'm<00:00:10.110> trying<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.500> use<00:00:10.590> my<00:00:10.800> phone<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> camera

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
I'm trying to use my phone in the camera

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.820 
I'm trying to use my phone in the camera
my<00:00:12.059> phone<00:00:12.330> unfortunately<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.380> seems<00:00:13.590> like

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
my phone unfortunately it seems like

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.490 
my phone unfortunately it seems like
that<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:14.040> cameras<00:00:14.519> like<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.150> large<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:16.470> fit

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
that my cameras like it's a large to fit

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.370 
that my cameras like it's a large to fit
easily<00:00:17.369> inside<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> best<00:00:19.050> angle

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
easily inside so this is the best angle

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
easily inside so this is the best angle
i<00:00:19.619> could<00:00:19.830> get<00:00:20.010> where<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.609> focus<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.330> won't

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
i could get where it's in focus we won't

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.590 
i could get where it's in focus we won't
be<00:00:21.660> able<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.900> see<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.260> whole<00:00:22.410> screen<00:00:23.600> i'm

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
be able to see the whole screen i'm

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.859 
be able to see the whole screen i'm
going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> try<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.140> show<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.560> guys<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:26.869> titans

different views to kind of show you this
was<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.260> best<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.740> I<00:04:41.800> could<00:04:42.030> manage<00:04:43.440> so<00:04:44.440> look

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
was the best that I could manage so look

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.030 
was the best that I could manage so look
if<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.980> start<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.580> bring<00:04:45.730> it<00:04:45.820> back<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:47.830> then

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
if I start to bring it back you then

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.420 
if I start to bring it back you then
start<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.640> actually<00:04:48.790> see<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.810> lens<00:04:50.710> more

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
start to actually see the lens more

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:59.100 
start to actually see the lens more
that's<00:04:52.030> why<00:04:52.270> I<00:04:52.300> have<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.660> is<00:04:52.900> angry<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.900> now<00:04:59.050> if

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
that's why I have it is angry so now if

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.520 
that's why I have it is angry so now if
I<00:04:59.260> move<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.820> then<00:05:00.820> that's<00:05:01.030> more<00:05:01.420> of<00:05:01.630> their<00:05:01.870> the

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
I move it then that's more of their the

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.320 
I move it then that's more of their the
lens<00:05:02.800> there<00:05:03.130> so<00:05:03.340> obviously<00:05:03.700> that's<00:05:03.880> not<00:05:04.060> ideal

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
lens there so obviously that's not ideal

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.480 
lens there so obviously that's not ideal
cuz<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:04.870> start<00:05:05.140> to<00:05:05.350> see<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.770> warping<00:05:06.250> of<00:05:06.340> the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
cuz you start to see the warping of the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.800 
cuz you start to see the warping of the
lens

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.620

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.090 

see<00:05:29.730> I<00:05:29.970> can<00:05:30.270> bring<00:05:30.390> it<00:05:30.510> back<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.750> bit<00:05:30.900> but<00:05:31.320> then

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
see I can bring it back a bit but then

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.000

you<00:05:32.280> start<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.700> see<00:05:33.030> obviously<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:34.230> lens<00:05:34.440> a

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
you start to see obviously the lens a

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.810 
you start to see obviously the lens a
lot<00:05:35.280> more

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.020 

I<00:05:37.880> did<00:05:38.510> find<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.110> was<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.530> best<00:05:39.770> need<00:05:40.550> to

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
I did find that was the best need to

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.900 
I did find that was the best need to
kind<00:05:41.330> of<00:05:41.420> have<00:05:41.600> it<00:05:41.630> slightly<00:05:42.110> tilted<00:05:42.830> into<00:05:43.820> the

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
kind of have it slightly tilted into the

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.820 
kind of have it slightly tilted into the
lens

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.590 

okay<00:05:48.830> so<00:05:48.890> i<00:05:49.070> think<00:05:49.190> that's<00:05:49.490> hopefully<00:05:50.360> enough

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
okay so i think that's hopefully enough

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.420 
okay so i think that's hopefully enough
hopefully<00:05:50.900> you<00:05:51.170> guys<00:05:51.290> a<00:05:51.350> lot<00:05:51.560> of<00:05:51.680> good<00:05:51.830> idea<00:05:52.280> as
