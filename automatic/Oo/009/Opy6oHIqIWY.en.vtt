little variation to it and so we've

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.509 
little variation to it and so we've
broken<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:26.490> into<00:00:26.670> two<00:00:27.060> pieces<00:00:28.189> this<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.400> our

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
broken it up into two pieces this is our

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.910 
broken it up into two pieces this is our
pattern<00:00:29.820> outside<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.900> our<00:00:31.140> master<00:00:31.650> pattern

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
pattern outside and our master pattern

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.750 
pattern outside and our master pattern
this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.340> our<00:00:32.640> straps<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:35.340> should<00:00:35.550> know

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
you don't then go back to the rest of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.979

the tutorials and look on how to make a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.200 
the tutorials and look on how to make a
pattern<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.739> you'll<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.579> able<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
this point and so let's start to put

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.290 
this point and so let's start to put
this<00:00:47.940> back<00:00:48.180> together<00:00:49.309> okay<00:00:50.719> we're<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
this back together okay we're back and

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.330 
this back together okay we're back and
what<00:00:54.300> we've<00:00:54.480> done<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.930> cut<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.410> outside

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
what we've done is cut the outside

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.660 
what we've done is cut the outside
pieces<00:00:56.969> from<00:00:57.239> our<00:00:57.420> outside<00:00:57.870> pattern<00:00:58.670> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
pieces from our outside pattern and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.750 
pieces from our outside pattern and
because<00:01:00.030> I'm<00:01:00.180> making<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.570> leather<00:01:00.840> bag<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
because I'm making a leather bag I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.000 
because I'm making a leather bag I
skydived<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:03.149> my<00:01:03.390> head<00:01:03.660> edges<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> hand

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
skydived all my head edges with a hand

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.880 
skydived all my head edges with a hand
skiver<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.450> area<00:01:06.869> right<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
skiver so that this area right here is

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.250 
skiver so that this area right here is
going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> be<00:01:08.790> thinner<00:01:09.090> than<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.600> body<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
going to be thinner than the body of the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.770 
going to be thinner than the body of the
leather<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.790> easier<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> turn<00:01:12.630> around

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
leather so that's easier to turn around

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.190 
leather so that's easier to turn around
my<00:01:13.170> stays<00:01:14.000> also<00:01:15.000> here's<00:01:15.270> my<00:01:15.420> boat<00:01:15.689> pattern
