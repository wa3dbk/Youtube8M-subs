step in abandoning the gold standard

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.039 
step in abandoning the gold standard
what<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> important<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> visually<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
what is important is to visually see the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
what is important is to visually see the
devaluation<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> US<00:01:47.250> dollar<00:01:47.490> since<00:01:47.939> we

devaluation of the US dollar since we

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.210 
devaluation of the US dollar since we

were taken off the gold standard keep in

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.310 
were taken off the gold standard keep in
mind<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> price<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.030> gold<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:51.930> doesn't<00:01:52.229> go

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
mind the price of gold really doesn't go

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.950

up or move it has historical value it is

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.050 
up or move it has historical value it is
extremely<00:01:55.409> consistent<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.670> instead<00:01:56.909> of

extremely consistent so instead of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.550 
extremely consistent so instead of
seeing<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> price<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.110> gold<00:01:58.259> going

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
and what I find most interesting is you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.990 
and what I find most interesting is you
want<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.160> buy<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> brand-new<00:02:13.670> Corvette

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
want to buy a brand-new Corvette

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.480 
want to buy a brand-new Corvette
Convertible<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:14.840> 2008<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:16.130> would<00:02:16.340> cost

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
Convertible in 2008 it would cost

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.390 
Convertible in 2008 it would cost
roughly<00:02:16.760> 55<00:02:17.360> thousand<00:02:17.900> dollars<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.160> gold

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
roughly 55 thousand dollars so in gold

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.820 
roughly 55 thousand dollars so in gold
that'd<00:02:20.060> be<00:02:20.090> roughly<00:02:20.420> 60<00:02:20.810> ounces<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.320> gold<00:02:21.530> at

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
that'd be roughly 60 ounces of gold at

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.070 
that'd be roughly 60 ounces of gold at
the<00:02:21.920> spot<00:02:22.160> price<00:02:22.460> of<00:02:22.790> 930<00:02:23.420> dollars<00:02:23.780> per<00:02:23.930> ounce

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
the spot price of 930 dollars per ounce

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.920 
the spot price of 930 dollars per ounce
so<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.220> time<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.580> goal<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.850> 930<00:02:26.420> dollars<00:02:26.840> you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
so the time of goal is 930 dollars you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.380 
so the time of goal is 930 dollars you
could<00:02:27.080> basically<00:02:27.320> take<00:02:27.530> 60<00:02:28.250> 1<00:02:28.910> ounce<00:02:29.090> gold

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
could basically take 60 1 ounce gold

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.080 
could basically take 60 1 ounce gold
coins<00:02:29.660> cash<00:02:30.350> them<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.070> buy<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.850> very

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
coins cash them in and buy that very

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.870 
coins cash them in and buy that very
same<00:02:32.330> car<00:02:32.830> inversely<00:02:33.830> if<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.610> remove

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
same car inversely if you remove

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.610

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
me try this one back in 1964 and earlier

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.340 
me try this one back in 1964 and earlier
a<00:03:25.190> quarter<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.030> by<00:03:26.270> you<00:03:26.330> roughly<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.840> gallon<00:03:27.290> of

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
a quarter of by you roughly a gallon of

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.590 
a quarter of by you roughly a gallon of
gas<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:28.400> is<00:03:28.490> because<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.940> quarters<00:03:29.300> made<00:03:29.450> in

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
gas this is because the quarters made in

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.990 
gas this is because the quarters made in
1964<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.500> earlier<00:03:30.800> were<00:03:31.430> made<00:03:31.580> of<00:03:31.700> ninety

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
1964 and earlier were made of ninety

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.930 
1964 and earlier were made of ninety

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
percent silver and ten percent copper so

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.670 
percent silver and ten percent copper so
the<00:03:35.060> spot<00:03:35.270> price<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.690> silver<00:03:35.870> being<00:03:36.200> seventeen

the spot price of silver being seventeen

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.680 
the spot price of silver being seventeen
dollars<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.220> twenty<00:03:37.520> cents<00:03:37.730> an<00:03:37.850> ounce<00:03:38.000> this

dollars and twenty cents an ounce this

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.080 
dollars and twenty cents an ounce this
makes<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.110> quarters<00:03:39.470> actual<00:03:39.920> value<00:03:40.370> three

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
makes that quarters actual value three
