flies<00:00:33.360> into<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.660> backfield<00:00:34.520> this<00:00:35.520> pressure

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
flies into the backfield this pressure

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
flies into the backfield this pressure
from<00:00:36.180> Adam<00:00:36.480> 12<00:00:36.660> would<00:00:37.110> still<00:00:37.380> get<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.710> even<00:00:37.950> if

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
from Adam 12 would still get in even if

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.380 
from Adam 12 would still get in even if
running<00:00:38.370> back<00:00:38.579> was<00:00:38.730> blocked<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> right

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
running back was blocked to the right

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.330 
running back was blocked to the right
however<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.260> forgot<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.559> try<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.219> this

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
however we forgot to try that in this

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.549 
however we forgot to try that in this
game<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.660> want<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> test<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.350> go

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
game so if you want to test that out go

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
game so if you want to test that out go
for<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> same<00:00:45.360> pressure

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
for it you can get the same pressure

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.889 
for it you can get the same pressure
from<00:00:45.930> 43<00:00:46.379> under<00:00:46.969> same<00:00:47.969> concept<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.600> from<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
from 43 under same concept just from the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
from 43 under same concept just from the
left<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.800> only<00:00:50.010> thing<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
left the only thing is that the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.610 
left the only thing is that the
defensive<00:00:51.000> end<00:00:51.059> doesn't<00:00:51.300> nice<00:00:51.840> post<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> line

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
defensive end doesn't nice post the line

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.470 
defensive end doesn't nice post the line
of<00:00:52.770> scrimmage<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> foots<00:00:53.579> angle<00:00:53.910> isn't<00:00:54.239> as

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
of scrimmage so the foots angle isn't as

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.450 
of scrimmage so the foots angle isn't as
good<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> takes<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> half<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.129> second

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
good it takes about a half a second

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.250 
good it takes about a half a second
longer<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> backfield<00:00:57.360> this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
longer to get to the backfield this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.599 
longer to get to the backfield this
book's<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.949> good<00:00:59.070> against<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> draw

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
book's is really good against the draw

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.010 
book's is really good against the draw
because<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.090> right<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.329> screen<00:01:00.390> defensive

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
because the right of screen defensive

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
because the right of screen defensive
end<00:01:01.170> will<00:01:01.500> hit<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> running<00:01:02.460> back<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
end will hit the running back in the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
end will hit the running back in the
backfield<00:01:02.870> profile<00:01:03.870> your<00:01:04.110> loss<00:01:04.290> every<00:01:04.650> time

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
backfield profile your loss every time

and<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:06.000> last<00:01:06.119> thing<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.590> drop<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and the last thing is you can drop the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.340 
and the last thing is you can drop the
