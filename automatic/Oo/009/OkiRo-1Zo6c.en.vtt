difficulties as the day progressed I saw

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.600 
difficulties as the day progressed I saw
more<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.520> more<00:00:48.829> progress<00:00:49.829> towards<00:00:50.340> actually

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
more and more progress towards actually

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.970 
more and more progress towards actually
getting<00:00:50.760> started<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> creating<00:00:52.890> your

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
getting started so creating your

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.299 
getting started so creating your
character<00:00:53.660> was<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:55.050> thing<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:56.100> was

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
character was one thing which was

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.490 
character was one thing which was
actually<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.789> easiest<00:00:57.180> part<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
actually the easiest part it was the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.349 
actually the easiest part it was the
actual<00:00:59.010> first<00:00:59.340> mission<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.969> was<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
actual first mission that was the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.849 
actual first mission that was the
longest<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.289> couldn't<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.649> into<00:01:01.770> that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
longest if you couldn't get into that

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380 
longest if you couldn't get into that
first<00:01:02.100> mission<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> take<00:01:03.329> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
first mission it was going to take you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.140 
first mission it was going to take you
forever<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:05.220> first<00:01:05.430> mission<00:01:05.610> was<00:01:05.970> by

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
forever and the first mission was by

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
forever and the first mission was by
herself<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.049> apparently<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.770> had<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> wait

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
herself but apparently you had to wait

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.690 
herself but apparently you had to wait
for<00:01:08.159> players<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.720> kind<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.400> done<00:01:11.400> wrong

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
for players so it was kind of done wrong

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.330 
for players so it was kind of done wrong
in<00:01:12.000> my<00:01:12.150> opinion<00:01:12.240> um<00:01:13.070> but<00:01:14.070> about<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
in my opinion um but about the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920 
in my opinion um but about the
characters<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> want<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.390> into<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
characters so I want to get into that so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.280 
characters so I want to get into that so
I<00:01:16.610> thought<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> character<00:01:18.689> creation

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
I thought that the character creation

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.660 
I thought that the character creation
was<00:01:19.500> very<00:01:19.770> interesting<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.520> actually

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
was very interesting and that's actually

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
was very interesting and that's actually
what<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> guys<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.390> watching<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.960> me

what you guys can be watching is me
creating<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.470> character<00:01:22.820> because<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.939> took<00:01:24.090> so

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
creating my character because it took so

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.590 
creating my character because it took so
long<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.479> me<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> finally<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.470> online<00:01:25.740> I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
I thought it was very interesting how

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.780 
I thought it was very interesting how
it's<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> pick<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.920> mother's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it's you know you pick your mother's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.219 
it's you know you pick your mother's
parents<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> pick<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:48.869> father's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
parents and you pick your father's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.719 
parents and you pick your father's
parents<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.950> determines<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.549> they're

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
parents and that determines what they're

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700 
parents and that determines what they're
like<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> two<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> them<00:01:52.290> determine

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710

interesting<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.290> when<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.549> about<00:01:56.610> it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
interesting as when you think about it

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
interesting as when you think about it
because<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.869> exactly<00:01:58.259> how<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> know

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
because it's it's exactly how you know

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.620 
because it's it's exactly how you know
real<00:01:58.979> life<00:01:59.189> works<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.670> not<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.450> in

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
real life works it's not just you go in

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.850 
real life works it's not just you go in
and<00:02:00.780> create<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.020> character<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.770> you

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and create a character in that to you

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.630 
and create a character in that to you
are<00:02:02.750> but<00:02:03.750> at<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> same<00:02:04.170> time<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.740> wish<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.340> I

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
are but at the same time I wish that I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
are but at the same time I wish that I
still<00:02:06.210> had<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.630> option<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.170> had<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> option

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.070 
still had that option I had the option
to<00:02:08.009> actually<00:02:08.580> create<00:02:09.390> my<00:02:09.509> character<00:02:09.569> how<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
to actually create my character how I

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
be that's something that i would have

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.270 
be that's something that i would have
liked<00:02:24.370> as<00:02:25.260> well<00:02:26.260> as<00:02:26.530> what<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:26.920> were<00:02:27.129> given

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
liked as well as what we were given

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.850 
liked as well as what we were given
because<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.480> was<00:02:28.629> extremely<00:02:29.049> hard<00:02:29.409> for<00:02:29.470> me

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
because it it was extremely hard for me

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.530 
because it it was extremely hard for me
to<00:02:30.250> be<00:02:30.370> able<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.610> see<00:02:30.760> what<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.030> grandparents

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
to be able to see what the grandparents

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.780 
to be able to see what the grandparents
looked<00:02:31.720> like<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.260> then<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.220> parents<00:02:33.400> were

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
looked like and then the parents were

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.940 
looked like and then the parents were
weren't<00:02:34.569> as<00:02:34.780> hard<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.260> see<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:35.709> they<00:02:35.860> were

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
weren't as hard to see but they were

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.530 
weren't as hard to see but they were
still<00:02:36.010> difficult<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.700> see<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.209> was<00:02:37.420> like

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
still difficult to see so it was like

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.009 
still difficult to see so it was like
you<00:02:38.349> really<00:02:38.650> didn't<00:02:38.920> know<00:02:39.160> what<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.660> outcome

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
you really didn't know what the outcome

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.699 
you really didn't know what the outcome
was<00:02:41.110> going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.349> be<00:02:41.500> um<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.970> in<00:02:43.659> my<00:02:44.170> opinion<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
was going to be um so in my opinion I

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.280 
was going to be um so in my opinion I
think<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:45.159> the<00:02:45.400> character<00:02:46.299> creation<00:02:46.750> was<00:02:46.959> a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
think that the character creation was a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.000 
think that the character creation was a
very<00:02:47.920> creative<00:02:48.310> idea<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.870> just<00:02:50.470> didn't<00:02:50.890> hit

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
very creative idea it just didn't hit

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.240 
very creative idea it just didn't hit
the<00:02:51.129> mark<00:02:51.310> very<00:02:51.609> well<00:02:51.849> um<00:02:52.799> alright<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:53.980> but

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
the mark very well um alright so but

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.849 
the mark very well um alright so but
besides<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.569> was<00:02:55.810> impossible<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.530> get

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
besides that so it was impossible to get

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.130 
besides that so it was impossible to get
online<00:02:57.269> because<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.390> had<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.629> play<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.900> first

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
online because you had to play the first

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.530 
online because you had to play the first
mission<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.709> first<00:02:59.950> mission<00:03:00.220> still<00:03:01.150> required

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
mission the first mission still required

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.539 
mission the first mission still required
players<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.200> be<00:03:02.319> in<00:03:02.349> the<00:03:02.650> game<00:03:02.890> even<00:03:03.280> though<00:03:03.370> it

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
players to be in the game even though it

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.640 
players to be in the game even though it
was<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.700> mission<00:03:04.060> by<00:03:04.209> herself<00:03:04.569> once<00:03:05.379> you<00:03:05.470> got

it's<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.880> little<00:03:40.090> too<00:03:40.269> strict<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:41.549> that's

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
it's a little too strict so that's

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.190 
it's a little too strict so that's

the<00:04:21.039> missions<00:04:21.400> with<00:04:21.579> multiple<00:04:21.969> people<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.450> did

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:22.719 
the missions with multiple people I did

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:26.420 
the missions with multiple people I did
have<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.200> chance<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.890> rob<00:04:24.219> a<00:04:24.250> few<00:04:24.460> stores<00:04:24.729> though

all<00:04:26.850> of<00:04:27.180> which<00:04:27.389> seem<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:28.050> be<00:04:28.199> functioning

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
all of which seem to be functioning

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.170 
all of which seem to be functioning
pretty<00:04:28.889> well<00:04:28.979> I<00:04:29.340> think<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.699> some<00:04:29.910> of<00:04:29.970> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
pretty well I think that some of the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.969 
pretty well I think that some of the
robbing<00:04:30.750> of<00:04:30.810> stores<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.380> going<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.650> get<00:04:31.740> kind

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
robbing of stores is going to get kind

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.159 
robbing of stores is going to get kind
of<00:04:32.070> repetitive<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.720> point<00:04:33.930> where<00:04:34.050> you're

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
of repetitive to the point where you're

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.260 
of repetitive to the point where you're
not<00:04:34.289> really<00:04:34.470> going<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.710> want<00:04:34.889> to<00:04:35.009> keep<00:04:35.880> robbing

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
not really going to want to keep robbing

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.570
