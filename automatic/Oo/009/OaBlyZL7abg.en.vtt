00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 youtube hall welcome new to a 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.020
 sloth your video we come to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.599
 great finale the last energy drink 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.929
 can from the fan package of tom and chris 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.389
 will fall beck energy shock the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.770
 Energy is the variant we have here 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.710
 I've got to be smart 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.970
 made on the side of bigstock like that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.890
 is the manufacturer I have 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 long no homepage where seen 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 first from 0 to 100 percent like that 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.429
 a flash animation goes through the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.940
 loaded side is grandma nostalgia 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.680
 nostalgia big shock is sitting in czech republic 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.660
 they are coming slowly with the first ones 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.579
 varieties also on the german market 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.590
 but we have so many varieties and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.120
 products only madness so I have 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.040
 also not seen such a long way 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.050
 big really big manufacturer needs 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.989
 that apparently never was 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.489
 So the variety is one of the most energy-sorte 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.800
 of course I could do all this here 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.800
 technically not read on the back 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.609
 but I know that is green tea 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.289
 should taste +40 who thinks now but 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.539
 that's definitely healthy now 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.630
 and low in calories and sometimes an alternative 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.119
 to normal energy drinks no 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.420
 I look back at the calorie count 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.640
 100 milliliters contain 46 kilocalories 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.460
 just like any stink normal 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.310
 We are energy drink in the caffeine content 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.820
 again at 32 milligrams to 100 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.340
 milliliter 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.460
 and the whole thing is half of course 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.180
 liter dose without hand signals out there 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.090
 Czech Republic 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.900
 so and now I start by us 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.939
 but who is currently at the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.770
 design thinks of doing this money now 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.439
 just for the tea or something no against 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.020
 design decide consistently yellow and 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.369
 Then you vary your logo and what you do 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.720
 They stop to show it like this 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.130
 now here are for yourself and so on 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.840
 bit of green tea or as a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.960
 leaflet or what that should be 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.890
 volleyball also stick as d 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.200
 volleyball now first the smell test 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.939
 yes yes that smells like this the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.939
 Energy drinks in any case 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.710
 in that I know it for yourself 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.770
 I imagine that I am 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.240
 for smell, however, this can all 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.770
 possible to be with me now one said 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.500
 there is a citizen in there I would be here now 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.690
 sit and think me yes I smell 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.400
 pear but commercial color variant so that 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.090
 must now clearly and well 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.030
 be now and not completely yellow 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.940
 transparent that goes that is very 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.480
 like these green tea varieties , though 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.890
 then it changes the drinks juice okay yet 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.990
 that is already equal to itself 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.550
 art by itself taste the smell 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:52.910
 there but now clicks the big test 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:54.740
 cheers at the latest if you doubt 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.070
 Had the thing maybe one 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.070
 Low calorie sugar free alternative is 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:10.430
 so lost the first moment sugar 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:12.680
 pure explosion just you see it is 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.010
 No bubbles these the energy drinks 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.420
 they do not bubble anymore 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.489
 can not stop or I say 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.260
 if you do not mind this 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.550
 aggressive bubbles and this sharpness 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.880
 there are of course sot e energy 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.950
 Drink places always great and I say 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.720
 in the morning or so , but then too 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.190
 the disadvantage 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.440
 which can also what la taste just 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.760
 when you say to yourself even half liter dose 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.920
 Of course you do not drink it now 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.500
 or not usually in five minutes 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.850
 away I'll be quite one 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.140
 half an hour is maybe one too 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.980
 hours around on the desk or 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.570
 so and then they are still very tasty 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.160
 faster stale means I say 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.470
 normal energy drinks then only 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.000
 less tingling or something and there have 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.530
 I always feel the first moment 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.470
 I always have that with his teesorte 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.420
 feel what normal energy drink the 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.320
 has already been open for two hours 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.320
 but no 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.900
 the taste is ok 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.320
 for sie.de energy drink definitely 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.829
 okay green tea I still have yesterday 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.260
 two three cups drunk 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.340
 one I have to say that tastes very 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.940
 different or 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.150
 nothing reminds me of this here 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.590
 But artificial 40 aroma is there and over 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.070
 this artificial liquid always 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.070
 again over it 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.110
 all the time when he and have him 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.970
 if iris roll swallowed 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.160
 another 12 seconds but about this 40th 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.080
 flavor sweden day practice over 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.820
 not so beautiful layers again 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.070
 cotton candy not frosting but 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.639
 really only sugar so pure sugar 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.990
 Pure sweet is up there again 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.990
 over it and that noticed all the time 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.500
 I do not know how to describe it 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.389
 I should really feel that way 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.610
 I have this topic so the energy 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.340
 drink juice the liquid on the tongue 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.020
 and I notice that in centimeters 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.630
 really this sugar layer that is one 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.099
 is very interesting but so must 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.800
 you just imagine that so that 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.539
 ding is also pure sugar 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.510
 Tasty but quite ok 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.520
 if you do not feel like it 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.820
 so it spilled into the energy drink 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.349
 These energydrinks and totally in 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.220
 order the recent liquid europe 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.229
 fine with me 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.720
 you still have a taste for it 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:42.169
 of these 40 so you always notice 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.220
 still so careful in front of him looked 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.410
 is absolutely alright 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.389
 that should have been it at the place 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.910
 again many thanks to tom and chris 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.590

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.360
 already on the big energy shock 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.340
 So does the kristan 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.830
 pronounce for the cool package 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.360
 I already have the next two packages 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.430
 thank you very much at this point you 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.750
 I need a little time always 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.139
 because I do not do it either 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.669
 every day full of the last video and 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.070
 then it takes something then jams there 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.660
 a little bit on until I get through all the things 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.099
 have and who cares who now 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.620
 he still knows that too 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.120
 unboxing video there was still a monster 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.280
 zero in the package 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.590
 but I had already tested it 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.060
 that's why and that and not christa 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.289
 do not know who of the two then have 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.180
 said yes but we have the impression 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:28.130
 they taste different in the Czech Republic 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.870
 in germany I am falling 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.159
 Of course, at some point 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.520
 if i stop a german monster 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.390
 energy drink zero dose see again 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.789
 I was under some 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.550
 comparison video with the two zero 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.710
 energy drinks next to each other and watch 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.400
 I wonder if something strikes me that's it 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.080
 have been 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.340
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.340
