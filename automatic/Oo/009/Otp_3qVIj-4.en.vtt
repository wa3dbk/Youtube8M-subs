00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.910 
far as doing another one but anyway here
we<00:00:20.550> are<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.210> shot<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.710> motor<00:00:22.710> that's<00:00:24.920> been

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
we are the shot of the motor that's been

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.470 
we are the shot of the motor that's been
finished<00:00:26.279> within<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.609> last<00:00:26.789> week<00:00:27.090> here<00:00:27.449> and

finished within the last week here and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
finished within the last week here and
this<00:00:30.480> didn't<00:00:30.900> finalize<00:00:31.109> before<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:31.890> made<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
this didn't finalize before we made it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.720 
this didn't finalize before we made it
up<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.850> trans<00:00:34.040> overdrive<00:00:35.040> unit<00:00:35.309> which<00:00:35.579> we

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
up to the trans overdrive unit which we

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.819 
up to the trans overdrive unit which we
have<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.030> back<00:00:36.239> shop<00:00:36.570> that's<00:00:37.410> all<00:00:37.620> ready

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
have in the back shop that's all ready

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.299 
have in the back shop that's all ready
to<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:40.850> take<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.440> quick<00:00:43.440> walk<00:00:43.680> back<00:00:44.010> there

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
to go on to take a quick walk back there

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.380 
to go on to take a quick walk back there
and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.369 

shot<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.470> that

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.880 

so<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:55.510> see<00:00:55.719> it's<00:00:55.899> been<00:00:56.019> fully<00:00:56.260> gone<00:00:56.469> through

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
so they see it's been fully gone through

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.150 
so they see it's been fully gone through
everything<00:00:57.899> rebuilt<00:00:58.899> on<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.109> internals<00:00:59.710> it

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
everything rebuilt on the internals it

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.759 
everything rebuilt on the internals it
was<00:01:00.250> actually<00:01:00.579> in<00:01:00.640> excellent<00:01:01.000> condition

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
was actually in excellent condition

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.399 
was actually in excellent condition
considering<00:01:02.820> its<00:01:03.820> age<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.479> typical<00:01:05.199> stuff

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
considering its age and typical stuff

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.510 
considering its age and typical stuff
that<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.619> find<00:01:05.890> on<00:01:06.040> these<00:01:06.159> so<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.220> slave

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
that you find on these so like the slave

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.160 
that you find on these so like the slave
cylinder<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.420> boot<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:10.750> all<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:10.960> stuff

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
cylinder and the boot and all that stuff

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.389 
cylinder and the boot and all that stuff
down<00:01:11.409> there

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.830 

just<00:01:19.399> waiting<00:01:19.729> for<00:01:19.759> one<00:01:20.000> small<00:01:20.299> part<00:01:20.539> for<00:01:20.750> the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
just waiting for one small part for the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.020 
just waiting for one small part for the
linkage<00:01:21.170> for<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.560> shifter<00:01:22.189> shifters<00:01:22.880> all

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
linkage for the shifter shifters all

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.200 
linkage for the shifter shifters all
rechromed<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:24.619> waiting<00:01:25.039> to<00:01:25.130> go<00:01:25.250> back<00:01:25.460> on<00:01:25.729> so<00:01:26.149> I

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
rechromed and waiting to go back on so I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.749 
rechromed and waiting to go back on so I
can<00:01:26.360> just<00:01:27.079> give<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.710> test<00:01:28.159> with<00:01:28.429> the<00:01:28.520> King

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
can just give it a test with the King

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.789 
can just give it a test with the King
already<00:01:29.390> bench<00:01:29.780> tested<00:01:30.259> it<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.439> everything's

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
already bench tested it and everything's

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.289 
already bench tested it and everything's
good

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
good

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.029 
good
here's<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:33.399> starter<00:01:34.450> already<00:01:35.450> done<00:01:35.920> ready<00:01:36.920> to

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
here's the starter already done ready to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.990 
here's the starter already done ready to
put<00:01:37.250> in<00:01:37.340> green

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.450

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
walk back over to the rotisserie and we

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.350 
walk back over to the rotisserie and we
have<00:01:47.890> basically<00:01:48.939> everything<00:01:49.939> on<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.090> chassis

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
have basically everything on the chassis

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.820 
have basically everything on the chassis
is<00:01:50.569> pretty<00:01:50.780> much<00:01:50.899> down<00:01:51.170> except<00:01:51.470> for<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.649> front
