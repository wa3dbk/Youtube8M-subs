and<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.630> I'm<00:00:39.720> doing<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.340> wiring<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.550> OBD<00:00:42.559> if

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and what I'm doing is wiring the OBD if

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it so you can see that where you plug

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.960 
it so you can see that where you plug
your<00:00:51.660> computer<00:00:51.900> into<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:53.730> read<00:00:53.880> your<00:00:54.060> codes

on<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.270> Dodge<00:01:03.660> where<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.229> pretty<00:01:04.409> easy<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
on a Dodge where it's pretty easy to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.160 
on a Dodge where it's pretty easy to
kick<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.420> looks<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.720> someone<00:01:07.049> got

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
kick and it looks like someone got

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.569 
kick and it looks like someone got
caught<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.829> something<00:01:08.040> busted<00:01:08.490> or

caught in it or something busted or
laughing<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.560> found<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> only<00:01:11.040> one

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
laughing I think we found the only one

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
laughing I think we found the only one
left<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.759> country<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.360> after<00:01:12.689> looking<00:01:13.680> at

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
left in the country but after looking at

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.719 
left in the country but after looking at
the<00:01:14.040> piece<00:01:14.659> I've<00:01:15.659> already<00:01:15.930> assembled<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.729> into

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the piece I've already assembled it into

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.250 
the piece I've already assembled it into
a<00:01:17.790> second<00:01:18.270> but

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.440 

I'm<00:01:21.710> started<00:01:22.040> thinking<00:01:22.400> that<00:01:22.550> you<00:01:23.360> could

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
I'm started thinking that you could

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.670 
I'm started thinking that you could
pretty<00:01:23.630> much<00:01:23.720> as<00:01:24.050> long<00:01:24.230> as<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.380> know<00:01:24.500> your

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
pretty much as long as you know your

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.740 
pretty much as long as you know your
wiring<00:01:24.860> better<00:01:25.190> I<00:01:25.370> mean<00:01:25.520> pretty<00:01:25.820> much<00:01:25.910> and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
wiring better I mean pretty much and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.740 
wiring better I mean pretty much and
your<00:01:27.050> PIN<00:01:27.260> out<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.680> can<00:01:27.830> know<00:01:28.540> where<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.630> put

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
your PIN out you can know where to put

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.070 
your PIN out you can know where to put
the<00:01:29.900> wires<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.560> put<00:01:31.010> it<00:01:31.130> out<00:01:31.250> yourself<00:01:31.670> and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
the wires and put it out yourself and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.120 
the wires and put it out yourself and
still<00:01:33.080> use<00:01:33.260> your<00:01:33.380> computer<00:01:33.770> if<00:01:33.830> something

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
still use your computer if something

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.620 
still use your computer if something
should<00:01:34.190> happen<00:01:34.370> to<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.850> friends<00:01:35.210> up<00:01:35.360> whatever

since they've come out with the obd2

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.800 
since they've come out with the obd2
system<00:01:43.700> because<00:01:44.270> it's<00:01:44.390> not<00:01:44.510> something<00:01:44.780> that

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
system because it's not something that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.980 
system because it's not something that
generally<00:01:45.110> goes<00:01:45.350> bad<00:01:45.730> but<00:01:46.730> this<00:01:47.600> started<00:01:47.900> out

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
generally goes bad but this started out

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.020 
generally goes bad but this started out
as<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.200> rear<00:01:48.440> brake<00:01:48.590> job<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.670> get<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:49.940> the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
as a rear brake job and I get in the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.640 
as a rear brake job and I get in the
skinny<00:01:50.330> because<00:01:50.540> he<00:01:50.660> had<00:01:50.750> an<00:01:50.810> ABS<00:01:51.230> light<00:01:51.470> on

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
skinny because he had an ABS light on

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.110 
skinny because he had an ABS light on
and<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.400> damn<00:01:52.580> thing<00:01:53.320> kept<00:01:54.320> reading<00:01:55.120> would

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
and the damn thing kept reading would

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.510 
and the damn thing kept reading would
enrage<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.510> codes<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:58.100> I<00:01:58.130> went<00:01:58.340> down<00:01:58.490> to

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
enrage the codes so I went down to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.610 
enrage the codes so I went down to
unplug<00:01:59.480> my<00:01:59.660> computer<00:02:00.080> make<00:02:00.230> sure<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.440> wiring

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
unplug my computer make sure the wiring

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.420 
unplug my computer make sure the wiring
was<00:02:00.890> plugged<00:02:01.400> in<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:02.650> lo<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:03.710> behold<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.220> fell

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
was plugged in and lo and behold it fell

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.340 
was plugged in and lo and behold it fell
off<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.610> my<00:02:04.760> hand<00:02:05.620> so<00:02:06.620> I<00:02:07.270> had<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.390> rewire<00:02:08.750> but

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
off of my hand so I had to rewire but

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.190 
off of my hand so I had to rewire but
that<00:02:09.530> still<00:02:10.100> works<00:02:10.250> for<00:02:10.399> Chrysler<00:02:10.930> found<00:02:11.930> one

that still works for Chrysler found one

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.150 
that still works for Chrysler found one
in<00:02:12.320> Toledo<00:02:13.040> or<00:02:13.070> something

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
in Toledo or something

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.550 
in Toledo or something
and<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.280> warehouse<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.330> was<00:02:17.200> actually<00:02:17.350> able

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
and in warehouse so I was actually able

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
and in warehouse so I was actually able
to<00:02:17.770> get<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.370> from<00:02:20.850> Chrysler<00:02:21.850> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
to get this one from Chrysler and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.710 
to get this one from Chrysler and
but<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.820> looking<00:02:25.090> at<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.360> can<00:02:25.420> pretty<00:02:25.660> much

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
but in looking at it you can pretty much

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.930 
but in looking at it you can pretty much
get<00:02:26.500> anyone<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.040> go<00:02:27.190> cut<00:02:27.460> one<00:02:27.610> out<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
get anyone you go cut one out of a

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.840 
get anyone you go cut one out of a
junkyard<00:02:28.330> problem<00:02:29.280> just<00:02:30.280> as<00:02:30.400> long<00:02:30.580> as<00:02:30.730> your

junkyard problem just as long as your

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.210 
junkyard problem just as long as your
pinouts<00:02:31.270> correct<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.960> you<00:02:32.020> wire<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.260> back<00:02:32.710> in

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
pinouts correct and you wire it back in

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.060 
pinouts correct and you wire it back in
you're<00:02:34.180> good

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
you're good

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.910 
you're good
how<00:02:36.070> do<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.220> do<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.790> got<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.940> crystal<00:02:37.330> ball

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
how do I do that is I got a crystal ball

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.530 
how do I do that is I got a crystal ball
and<00:02:38.920> I'm<00:02:39.250> not<00:02:39.430> kidding<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.850> really<00:02:40.150> do

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
and I'm not kidding I really do

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.480 
and I'm not kidding I really do
I'll<00:02:40.750> show<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.020> that<00:02:41.080> in<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.350> second<00:02:41.740> but<00:02:42.250> I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
I'll show you that in a second but I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.850 
I'll show you that in a second but I
don't<00:02:42.940> know<00:02:43.200> hopefully<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.440> see<00:02:44.680> this

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
don't know hopefully you can see this

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.160 
don't know hopefully you can see this
but<00:02:45.280> what<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:45.910> did<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:46.510> comes<00:02:46.750> with<00:02:49.170> comes

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
but what I did it just comes with comes

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.320 
but what I did it just comes with comes
with<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.440> sixteenth<00:02:50.950> wire<00:02:51.700> do<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.030> only<00:02:52.150> have

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
with the sixteenth wire do you only have

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.600 
with the sixteenth wire do you only have
to<00:02:52.450> use<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.810> think<00:02:52.840> seven<00:02:53.470> one<00:02:54.040> two<00:02:54.070> three<00:02:54.190> four

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
to use I think seven one two three four

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.230 
to use I think seven one two three four
five<00:02:54.880> six<00:02:55.120> seven<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.320> pin<00:02:56.560> out<00:02:56.680> but<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.580> it

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
five six seven in this pin out but I it

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.700 
five six seven in this pin out but I it
gives<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.600> extra<00:02:58.840> for<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:58.990> kitchen<00:02:59.350> screw-up

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
gives you extra for the kitchen screw-up

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.600 
gives you extra for the kitchen screw-up
maybe<00:02:59.920> some<00:03:00.550> cars<00:03:01.050> use<00:03:02.050> more<00:03:02.710> than<00:03:02.890> others<00:03:03.960> so

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
maybe some cars use more than others so

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.000 
maybe some cars use more than others so
this<00:03:06.610> pretty<00:03:06.850> much<00:03:09.450> works<00:03:10.450> for<00:03:10.740> many<00:03:11.740> cars

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
this pretty much works for many cars

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.130 
this pretty much works for many cars
very<00:03:12.670> simple<00:03:13.180> it's<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.330> fifty<00:03:13.630> dollar<00:03:13.660> part

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
very simple it's a fifty dollar part

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.310 
very simple it's a fifty dollar part
though<00:03:14.350> but<00:03:15.340> if<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.510> had<00:03:16.660> more<00:03:16.810> time<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.230> can

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
though but if I had more time you can

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.780 
though but if I had more time you can
get<00:03:17.470> around<00:03:17.650> better<00:03:17.800> I<00:03:18.040> find<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.430> out<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.700> your

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
get around better I find you out to your

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.810 
get around better I find you out to your
clip<00:03:19.150> one<00:03:19.330> off<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.690> do<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.960> that<00:03:20.290> cost<00:03:20.560> time

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
clip one off you do it that cost time

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.160 
clip one off you do it that cost time
time<00:03:21.820> is<00:03:21.970> money<00:03:22.000> if<00:03:22.390> you're<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.570> mechanic<00:03:22.690> and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
time is money if you're a mechanic and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.690 
time is money if you're a mechanic and
you<00:03:23.260> know<00:03:23.350> how<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:26.459> basically<00:03:27.459> I've

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
you know how that is so basically I've

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.880 
you know how that is so basically I've
already<00:03:28.000> pressed<00:03:28.270> them<00:03:28.420> in<00:03:28.540> I've<00:03:29.470> looked<00:03:29.770> at

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
already pressed them in I've looked at

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.550 
already pressed them in I've looked at
my<00:03:30.010> schematic<00:03:30.550> press<00:03:31.360> them<00:03:31.570> in<00:03:31.690> they<00:03:32.230> aren't

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
my schematic press them in they aren't

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.630 
my schematic press them in they aren't

the<00:03:34.960> truck<00:03:35.960> so<00:03:37.150> my<00:03:38.150> lady<00:03:38.510> actually<00:03:39.550> gave<00:03:40.550> me

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
the truck so my lady actually gave me

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.020 
the truck so my lady actually gave me
this<00:03:42.050> was<00:03:42.290> last<00:03:43.040> week<00:03:43.280> when<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.580> started<00:03:43.940> this

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
this was last week when I started this

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.380 
this was last week when I started this
project<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:45.640> we<00:03:46.640> had<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.819> wait<00:03:46.940> for<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.150> part

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
project and we had to wait for the part

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.030 
project and we had to wait for the part
to<00:03:47.480> come<00:03:47.630> in<00:03:47.750> obviously<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.590> we<00:03:48.740> did<00:03:48.890> some

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
to come in obviously so we did some

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.650 
to come in obviously so we did some
homework<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:49.610> she<00:03:49.760> actually<00:03:49.880> wrote<00:03:50.720> down<00:03:52.660> the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
homework and she actually wrote down the

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.650 
homework and she actually wrote down the
corresponding<00:03:53.990> numbers<00:03:54.680> these<00:03:54.920> are<00:03:55.100> numbered

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
corresponding numbers these are numbered

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.210 
corresponding numbers these are numbered
I'll<00:03:56.660> be<00:03:56.780> damned<00:03:57.020> if<00:03:57.140> I<00:03:57.290> can<00:03:57.470> read<00:03:57.680> upside<00:03:57.860> to

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
I'll be damned if I can read upside to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.710 
I'll be damned if I can read upside to
use<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> magnifying<00:03:58.580> glass<00:03:59.150> because<00:03:59.420> they<00:03:59.660> are

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
use a magnifying glass because they are

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.780 
use a magnifying glass because they are
small<00:04:00.050> but<00:04:00.170> they<00:04:00.290> are<00:04:00.320> numbered<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.010> they<00:04:01.730> do

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
small but they are numbered and they do

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.310 
small but they are numbered and they do
give<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.360> pinout<00:04:02.660> on<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.020> on<00:04:03.170> the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
give you the pinout on the on the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.160 
give you the pinout on the on the
computer<00:04:03.739> as<00:04:03.830> well<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:04.989> there's<00:04:05.989> several

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
computer as well so there's several

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.699 
computer as well so there's several
different<00:04:06.470> ways<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.590> go<00:04:06.770> about<00:04:06.800> doing<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.250> but

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
different ways to go about doing it but

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.620 
different ways to go about doing it but
this<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.010> pen<00:04:10.190> out<00:04:10.340> in<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.150> car

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.659 

4:01<00:04:15.609> dakota<00:04:16.609> sport<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.840> this<00:04:18.680> corresponds

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
4:01 dakota sport and this corresponds

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.450 
4:01 dakota sport and this corresponds
with<00:04:19.700> this<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:20.480> it<00:04:21.079> has<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.410> be<00:04:21.440> wired<00:04:22.100> into

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
with this and it has to be wired into

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.909 
with this and it has to be wired into
the<00:04:22.490> car

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.200 

just<00:04:30.919> kind<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.160> fell<00:04:31.370> apart<00:04:31.460> because<00:04:31.940> other

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
just kind of fell apart because other

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.800 
just kind of fell apart because other
pieces<00:04:32.449> are<00:04:32.690> in<00:04:32.780> there<00:04:33.699> so<00:04:34.699> maybe<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:35.600> quick

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
pieces are in there so maybe a quick

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.200 
pieces are in there so maybe a quick
shot<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.110> how<00:04:37.009> I<00:04:37.039> did<00:04:37.370> this<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:40.210> hopefully

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
shot of how I did this and hopefully

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.129 
shot of how I did this and hopefully
it'll<00:04:41.330> help<00:04:41.509> somebody<00:04:43.720> get<00:04:44.720> you<00:04:44.870> off<00:04:44.930> the

I actually bought hard drives that are
updated<00:05:05.900> through<00:05:06.500> like<00:05:07.030> 2012<00:05:08.030> now<00:05:08.419> I<00:05:08.690> think

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
I already even crimp the ends so we're

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.260 
I already even crimp the ends so we're
gonna<00:06:09.400> crimp<00:06:09.640> the<00:06:09.790> ends<00:06:09.940> to<00:06:10.240> the

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
gonna crimp the ends to the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.960 
gonna crimp the ends to the
corresponding<00:06:11.200> colors<00:06:11.500> that<00:06:12.460> are<00:06:12.580> in<00:06:12.670> the<00:06:12.790> car

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
corresponding colors that are in the car

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.850 
corresponding colors that are in the car
on<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.330> other<00:06:13.450> harness<00:06:13.900> and<00:06:14.110> then<00:06:14.620> each

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
on the other harness and then each

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.470 
on the other harness and then each
friend<00:06:15.100> come<00:06:15.250> on<00:06:15.370> it<00:06:15.550> should<00:06:15.700> be<00:06:15.760> good<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.120> made

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.480 
friend come on it should be good I made

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.240 
friend come on it should be good I made
it<00:06:16.570> a<00:06:16.630> lot<00:06:16.780> longer<00:06:17.320> than<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:17.710> should<00:06:17.800> have

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
it a lot longer than I should have

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.810 
it a lot longer than I should have
so<00:06:19.120> this<00:06:19.570> way<00:06:19.830> you<00:06:20.830> know<00:06:20.950> I<00:06:20.980> got<00:06:21.430> a<00:06:21.460> little<00:06:21.670> room

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
so this way you know I got a little room

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.370 
so this way you know I got a little room
to<00:06:21.850> work<00:06:22.090> because<00:06:22.300> they<00:06:22.570> do<00:06:22.630> not<00:06:22.900> give<00:06:23.140> you<00:06:23.230> any

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
to work because they do not give you any

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.720 
to work because they do not give you any
room<00:06:23.590> to<00:06:23.620> work<00:06:23.830> under<00:06:24.100> that<00:06:24.130> I<00:06:24.250> could<00:06:24.490> have<00:06:24.580> cut

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
room to work under that I could have cut

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.690 
room to work under that I could have cut
most<00:06:25.000> of<00:06:25.120> the<00:06:25.210> harness<00:06:25.420> out<00:06:25.720> but<00:06:26.310> then<00:06:27.310> it's<00:06:27.460> 6

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
most of the harness out but then it's 6

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.520 
most of the harness out but then it's 6
4<00:06:27.970> or<00:06:28.000> 300<00:06:28.540> pounds<00:06:28.810> that's<00:06:28.930> really<00:06:29.290> hard<00:06:29.470> to

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
4 or 300 pounds that's really hard to

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.730 
4 or 300 pounds that's really hard to
get<00:06:29.620> out<00:06:29.710> of<00:06:29.800> the<00:06:29.860> dashes<00:06:31.350> so<00:06:32.350> here<00:06:32.500> we<00:06:32.590> go

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
get out of the dashes so here we go

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.420 
get out of the dashes so here we go
here's<00:06:33.280> a<00:06:33.310> truck<00:06:35.010> see<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.100> truck

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.650 

I<00:06:39.460> don't<00:06:40.180> just<00:06:40.389> build<00:06:40.570> hot<00:06:40.870> rods<00:06:40.900> man<00:06:45.479> she<00:06:46.479> says

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
I don't just build hot rods man she says
