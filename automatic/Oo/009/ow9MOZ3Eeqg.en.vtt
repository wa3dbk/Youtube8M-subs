00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:03.409 

so<00:00:02.159> my<00:00:02.340> name<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.610> carl<00:00:02.850> berger<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.210> i'm<00:00:03.300> going

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
so my name is carl berger and i'm going

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.720 
so my name is carl berger and i'm going
to<00:00:03.480> talk<00:00:03.720> today<00:00:03.899> about<00:00:04.160> plasma<00:00:05.160> oscillations

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
to talk today about plasma oscillations

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.480 
to talk today about plasma oscillations
in<00:00:05.940> plasmas<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.830> i'm<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.069> start<00:00:08.250> out<00:00:08.429> by

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
in plasmas and i'm going to start out by

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.419 
in plasmas and i'm going to start out by
just<00:00:09.420> giving<00:00:09.570> some<00:00:09.960> physical<00:00:10.349> insight<00:00:10.740> into

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
just giving some physical insight into

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.999 
just giving some physical insight into
what's<00:00:12.240> going<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.900> these<00:00:12.990> systems<00:00:13.410> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
what's going on in these systems and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.340 
what's going on in these systems and
then<00:00:14.250> i'm<00:00:14.400> going<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.630> little<00:00:15.900> bit<00:00:16.109> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
then i'm going to do a little bit of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.000 
then i'm going to do a little bit of
back<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.859> envelope<00:00:17.359> algebra<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:19.560> derive

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
back in the envelope algebra to derive

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.759 
back in the envelope algebra to derive
the<00:00:20.220> plasma<00:00:20.640> frequency<00:00:21.199> derive<00:00:22.199> might<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.529> too

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the plasma frequency derive might be too

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.650 
the plasma frequency derive might be too
strong<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.070> term<00:00:23.160> because<00:00:23.670> really<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> want

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
strong a term because really if you want

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.960 
strong a term because really if you want
a<00:00:24.720> proper<00:00:24.930> derivation<00:00:25.560> you're<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.760> have

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
a proper derivation you're going to have

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.970 
a proper derivation you're going to have
to<00:00:27.180> go<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> another<00:00:28.080> source<00:00:28.529> you're<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.920> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to go to another source you're going to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
to go to another source you're going to
have<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.250> look<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> textbook<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.480> another

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
have to look in the textbook or another

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.380 
have to look in the textbook or another
online<00:00:31.140> resource<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.610> plasmas<00:00:33.120> are<00:00:33.149> very

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
online resource but plasmas are very

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.729 
online resource but plasmas are very
interesting<00:00:33.750> these<00:00:33.899> days<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.469> plasma

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
interesting these days and plasma

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.990 
interesting these days and plasma
oscillations<00:00:35.309> are<00:00:35.430> interesting<00:00:35.820> because

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
oscillations are interesting because

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.660 
oscillations are interesting because
this<00:00:36.390> particular<00:00:36.630> type<00:00:37.110> surface<00:00:37.469> plasma<00:00:38.100> has

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this particular type surface plasma has

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.240 
this particular type surface plasma has
recently<00:00:39.120> got<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.960> lot<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.530> attention<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.070> terms

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
recently got a lot of attention in terms

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.549 
recently got a lot of attention in terms
of<00:00:41.399> making<00:00:41.520> nano<00:00:41.879> optical<00:00:42.450> devices<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.350> so

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
of making nano optical devices and so

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
of making nano optical devices and so
that's<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> reasons<00:00:45.030> people<00:00:45.120> are

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that's one of the reasons people are

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.160 
that's one of the reasons people are
interested<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.710> area<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> what's<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
interested in this area so what's a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
interested in this area so what's a
plasma<00:00:49.649> first<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.160> well<00:00:50.760> we're<00:00:51.030> also

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
plasma first of all well we're also

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.869 
plasma first of all well we're also
going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> talk<00:00:51.719> about<00:00:51.899> metals<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.219> middle

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
going to talk about metals in the middle

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.299 
going to talk about metals in the middle
as<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> type<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.539> plasma<00:00:54.780> plasma<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> gas<00:00:56.100> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
as a type of a plasma plasma is a gas of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.360 
as a type of a plasma plasma is a gas of
charged<00:00:56.520> particles<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.829> in<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.980> metal

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
charged particles and in a metal

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.240 
charged particles and in a metal
metallic<00:00:59.850> plasma<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.079> neutral<00:01:01.260> plasma<00:01:01.980> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
metallic plasma it's a neutral plasma so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.039 
metallic plasma it's a neutral plasma so
that<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.489> average<00:01:02.670> there's<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> same<00:01:03.660> number

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that on average there's the same number

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.010 
that on average there's the same number
of<00:01:05.090> positive<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.210> negative<00:01:06.479> charges<00:01:06.840> not

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
of positive and negative charges not

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.530 
of positive and negative charges not
like<00:01:07.200> I've<00:01:07.350> drawn<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> metal<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:10.140> have

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
like I've drawn it in a metal you have

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.810 
like I've drawn it in a metal you have
positive<00:01:12.540> charges<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.500> screened<00:01:14.070> nuclei

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
positive charges are screened nuclei

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.330 
positive charges are screened nuclei
that<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.020> poor<00:01:16.409> electrons<00:01:16.860> still<00:01:17.130> bound

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that have the poor electrons still bound

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.539 
that have the poor electrons still bound
to<00:01:17.490> them<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.250> negative<00:01:20.250> charges

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
to them and then the negative charges

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.890 
to them and then the negative charges
are<00:01:20.869> free<00:01:21.869> electrons<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.560> move<00:01:22.710> around<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
are free electrons that move around and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.679 
are free electrons that move around and
if<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.439> about<00:01:25.790> what<00:01:26.790> happens<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.509> such

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
if you think about what happens in such

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.810 
if you think about what happens in such
a<00:01:27.720> neutral<00:01:27.960> system<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.520> realize

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
a neutral system is you you can realize

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.249 
a neutral system is you you can realize
even<00:01:30.150> though<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.329> average<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.170> be

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
even though on average it's going to be

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
even though on average it's going to be
neutral<00:01:31.520> maybe<00:01:32.520> over<00:01:32.850> some<00:01:32.880> short<00:01:33.299> length

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
neutral maybe over some short length

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
neutral maybe over some short length
scale<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.470> draw<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> box<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.520> here

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
scale so if we just draw a box in here

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.550 
scale so if we just draw a box in here
you<00:01:36.479> might<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> little<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.259> extra

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you might have a little bit extra

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.929 
you might have a little bit extra
negative<00:01:37.799> charge<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:38.490> bit<00:01:38.640> extra

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
negative charge a little bit extra

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
negative charge a little bit extra
positive<00:01:39.210> charge<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:40.560> will

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
positive charge and so that there will

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.569 
positive charge and so that there will
be<00:01:41.270> occasionally<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.979> charge<00:01:43.979> separation

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
be occasionally some charge separation

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.940 
be occasionally some charge separation
so<00:01:44.850> let's<00:01:45.600> draw<00:01:45.869> some<00:01:46.140> charge<00:01:46.350> separation

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
so let's draw some charge separation

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.179 
so let's draw some charge separation
happening<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:49.259> church<00:01:49.470> separation

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
happening here and the church separation

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.450 
happening here and the church separation
gets<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.360> really<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:51.840> goes<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.250> in<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
gets that really what goes on in a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
gets that really what goes on in a
plasma<00:01:53.970> because<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.810> plasma<00:01:55.020> oscillation

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
plasma because in a plasma oscillation

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.840 
plasma because in a plasma oscillation
because<00:01:56.130> once<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> charge

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
because once you have a charge

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.660 
because once you have a charge
separation<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> Coulomb<00:01:58.500> force<00:01:58.770> now

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
separation you have a Coulomb force now

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.749 
separation you have a Coulomb force now
in<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.180> plasma<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.100> positive<00:02:02.100> charges<00:02:02.369> because

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
in a plasma the positive charges because

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.670 
in a plasma the positive charges because
they're<00:02:02.939> nuclei<00:02:03.299> are<00:02:04.049> quite<00:02:04.380> stationary<00:02:06.680> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
they're nuclei are quite stationary the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.570 
they're nuclei are quite stationary the
electrons<00:02:08.129> move<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.539> system<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
electrons move so in this system the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.890 
electrons move so in this system the
force<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
force is going to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.890 
force is going to
to<00:02:13.439> pull<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:14.430> negative<00:02:14.819> charge<00:02:15.180> towards<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to pull the negative charge towards the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.750 
to pull the negative charge towards the
positive<00:02:16.379> just<00:02:16.680> because<00:02:16.980> electrons<00:02:17.489> are<00:02:17.579> so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
positive just because electrons are so

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.619 
positive just because electrons are so
much<00:02:17.909> lighter<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.540> much<00:02:18.689> more<00:02:18.900> mobile<00:02:19.079> and<00:02:20.629> as

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
much lighter so much more mobile and as

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.089 
much lighter so much more mobile and as
it<00:02:21.780> moves<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.230> going<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.409> pick<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:22.709> kinetic

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
it moves it's going to pick up kinetic

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.550 
it moves it's going to pick up kinetic
energy<00:02:23.459> in<00:02:23.579> fact<00:02:23.790> when<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.030> passes<00:02:24.560> positive

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
energy in fact when it passes positive

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.809 
energy in fact when it passes positive
charge<00:02:25.829> it's<00:02:26.069> actually<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.549> have<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
charge it's actually going to have the

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.460 
charge it's actually going to have the
maximum<00:02:27.299> kinetic<00:02:27.450> energy<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.170> then<00:02:28.319> it's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
maximum kinetic energy and then it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.559 
maximum kinetic energy and then it's
going<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> start<00:02:28.739> slowing<00:02:29.099> down<00:02:29.370> because<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
going to start slowing down because the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.119 
going to start slowing down because the
Coulomb<00:02:30.840> force<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.230> now<00:02:31.409> going<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.739> be

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
Coulomb force is now going to be

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.819 
Coulomb force is now going to be
opposite<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.819> sign<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.439> will<00:02:34.560> just

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
opposite in sign and so it will just

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.500 
opposite in sign and so it will just
come<00:02:35.099> out<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:35.670> turn<00:02:35.909> around<00:02:36.060> eventually

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
come out here turn around eventually

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.869 
come out here turn around eventually
come<00:02:37.140> back<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.680> there<00:02:38.579> you<00:02:38.700> get<00:02:38.819> the

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
come back and there you get the

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.199 
come back and there you get the
oscillation<00:02:39.620> okay<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.709> comes<00:02:40.890> back<00:02:41.220> go

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
oscillation okay it comes back go

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.270 
oscillation okay it comes back go
through<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.260> oscillation<00:02:43.409> you<00:02:44.159> can

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
through and the oscillation you can

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.649 
through and the oscillation you can
think<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.519> oscillations<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.299> terms<00:02:45.510> of

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
think of oscillations in terms of

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.140 
think of oscillations in terms of
exchange<00:02:46.079> of<00:02:46.230> energy<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.639> exchange<00:02:47.970> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
exchange of energy so the exchange of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.149 
exchange of energy so the exchange of
energy<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.049> between<00:02:49.530> an<00:02:49.709> electrostatic

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
energy here is between an electrostatic

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:56.539 
energy here is between an electrostatic
energy<00:02:52.010> electrostatic<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:55.549> kinetic

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
energy electrostatic and a kinetic

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:05.869 
energy electrostatic and a kinetic
energy<00:02:58.069> connecticut<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.799> actually<00:03:04.879> the

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
energy connecticut so actually the

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.629 
energy connecticut so actually the
exchange<00:03:06.599> happens<00:03:06.959> twice<00:03:07.290> per<00:03:07.680> oscillation

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
exchange happens twice per oscillation

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.129 
exchange happens twice per oscillation
period<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.689> start<00:03:09.959> out<00:03:10.109> with

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
period if you start out with

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.470 
period if you start out with
electrostatic<00:03:10.950> potential<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:12.269> then

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
electrostatic potential you then

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.509 
electrostatic potential you then
transfer<00:03:12.959> into<00:03:13.079> kinetic<00:03:13.379> potential<00:03:13.709> then

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
transfer into kinetic potential then

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.449 
transfer into kinetic potential then
back<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:15.030> electrostatic<00:03:15.329> potential<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:17.370> then

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
back to electrostatic potential and then

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.369 
back to electrostatic potential and then
back<00:03:17.669> to<00:03:17.849> kinetic<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.419> then<00:03:18.599> complete<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
back to kinetic and then complete the

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.589 
back to kinetic and then complete the
cycle<00:03:19.769> back<00:03:20.459> electrostatic<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:21.480> go

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
cycle back electrostatic so you go

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.589 
cycle back electrostatic so you go
through<00:03:21.810> two<00:03:22.730> exchanges<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.879> energy<00:03:24.239> in<00:03:24.510> a

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
through two exchanges of energy in a

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.780 
through two exchanges of energy in a
single<00:03:24.840> period<00:03:28.159> so<00:03:29.159> that's<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.519> basic

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
single period so that's the basic

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.300 
single period so that's the basic
physical<00:03:30.150> picture<00:03:30.659> of<00:03:30.959> turn<00:03:31.590> separation

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
physical picture of turn separation

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.759 
physical picture of turn separation
followed<00:03:32.730> by<00:03:33.109> oscillation<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.409> of<00:03:34.530> course

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
followed by oscillation and of course

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.199 
followed by oscillation and of course
that<00:03:34.980> oscillation<00:03:35.459> isn't<00:03:35.909> going<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.090> last

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
that oscillation isn't going to last

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.580 
that oscillation isn't going to last
forever<00:03:36.449> there<00:03:36.870> will<00:03:36.959> be<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.079> little<00:03:37.349> bit<00:03:37.470> of

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
forever there will be a little bit of

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.250 
forever there will be a little bit of
decay<00:03:37.919> or<00:03:38.159> loss<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.120> there<00:03:39.989> will<00:03:40.049> be<00:03:40.109> a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
decay or loss and so there will be a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.740 
decay or loss and so there will be a
little<00:03:40.470> bit<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:41.239> slowing<00:03:42.239> down<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.629> will

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
little bit of slowing down that will

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.390 
little bit of slowing down that will
damp<00:03:43.319> out<00:03:43.500> eventually<00:03:44.840> now<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.199> a<00:03:49.400> more

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
damp out eventually now in a more

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.289 
damp out eventually now in a more
mathematical<00:03:50.870> sense<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:52.919> look<00:03:53.190> at<00:03:53.400> the

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
mathematical sense you can look at the

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.589 
mathematical sense you can look at the
stored<00:03:55.519> potential<00:03:56.519> energy<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:57.359> the

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
stored potential energy in the

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.689 
stored potential energy in the
electrostatic<00:03:58.260> system<00:03:58.620> but<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.280> do<00:03:59.549> that

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
electrostatic system but to do that

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.159 
electrostatic system but to do that
first<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.090> need<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.329> make<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.569> guess<00:04:00.870> at<00:04:01.049> the

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
first you need to make a guess at the

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.069 
first you need to make a guess at the
amount<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.379> charge<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:03.060> separation<00:04:03.449> of

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
amount of charge and the separation of

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.430 
amount of charge and the separation of
the<00:04:04.169> charges<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.919> so<00:04:05.159> we'll<00:04:05.849> just<00:04:06.260> guess<00:04:07.260> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
the charges and so we'll just guess the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.710 
the charges and so we'll just guess the
electron<00:04:07.829> charge<00:04:08.180> because<00:04:09.180> these<00:04:09.329> are<00:04:09.510> free

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
electron charge because these are free

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.339 
electron charge because these are free
electrons<00:04:10.139> are<00:04:10.349> moving<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.659> the<00:04:12.659> separation

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
electrons are moving and the separation

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.259 
electrons are moving and the separation
and<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.560> one<00:04:13.739> that's<00:04:13.919> most<00:04:14.220> logical<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.060> just

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
and the one that's most logical is just

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.089 
and the one that's most logical is just
the<00:04:15.389> average<00:04:15.659> separation<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:16.320> particles<00:04:16.799> in

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
the average separation of particles in

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.960 
the average separation of particles in
the<00:04:17.159> system

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
the system

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.019 
the system
we'll<00:04:18.599> call<00:04:18.750> s<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.519> that'll<00:04:20.519> be<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.760> cube

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.029 
we'll call s and that'll be the cube

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.530 
we'll call s and that'll be the cube
root<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:23.070> inverse<00:04:23.340> density

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
root of the inverse density

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.219 
root of the inverse density
particle<00:04:26.540> density<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:28.430> if<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.720> remember<00:04:30.199> a

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
particle density so if you remember a

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.040 
particle density so if you remember a
little<00:04:30.410> bit<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.710> your<00:04:30.830> electricity<00:04:31.130> magnetism

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
little bit of your electricity magnetism

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.650 
little bit of your electricity magnetism
the<00:04:33.520> potential<00:04:34.520> energy<00:04:34.820> stored<00:04:34.880> between<00:04:35.360> two

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
the potential energy stored between two

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.370 
the potential energy stored between two
separate<00:04:36.080> charges<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:37.060> going<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.150> be<00:04:38.380> just

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
separate charges is going to be just

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.150 
separate charges is going to be just
closed<00:04:39.620> constant<00:04:40.190> times<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.180> charge<00:04:41.419> squared

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
closed constant times the charge squared

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.510 
closed constant times the charge squared
over<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.280> separation<00:04:43.729> and<00:04:44.889> if<00:04:45.889> you<00:04:45.979> remember

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
over the separation and if you remember

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.740 
over the separation and if you remember
your<00:04:47.860> harmonic<00:04:49.000> oscillator<00:04:50.000> physics<00:04:50.449> so<00:04:50.600> this

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
your harmonic oscillator physics so this

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.960 
your harmonic oscillator physics so this
is<00:04:50.930> from<00:04:51.220> classical<00:04:52.220> mechanics<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:52.760> by<00:04:52.910> the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
is from classical mechanics and by the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.629 
is from classical mechanics and by the
way<00:04:53.150> I'm<00:04:53.990> assuming<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:55.010> remember

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
way I'm assuming that you remember

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.920 
way I'm assuming that you remember
electrostatics<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.419> classical<00:04:56.840> mechanics

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
electrostatics and classical mechanics

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.279 
electrostatics and classical mechanics
if<00:04:57.440> you've<00:04:57.590> studied<00:04:57.830> those<00:04:58.160> if<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.729> haven't

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
if you've studied those if you haven't

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.860 
if you've studied those if you haven't
you<00:05:00.289> need<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.680> catch<00:05:01.340> up<00:05:01.370> on<00:05:01.639> that<00:05:01.850> area<00:05:02.240> to

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
you need to catch up on that area to

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.640 
you need to catch up on that area to
understand<00:05:03.260> this<00:05:04.660> but<00:05:05.660> in<00:05:05.780> that<00:05:05.900> case<00:05:06.139> the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
understand this but in that case the

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.290 
understand this but in that case the
harmonic<00:05:07.280> oscillator<00:05:07.750> energy<00:05:08.750> is<00:05:08.810> one-half<00:05:09.289> M

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
harmonic oscillator energy is one-half M

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.500 
harmonic oscillator energy is one-half M
Omega<00:05:12.250> we'll<00:05:13.250> call<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.580> Omega<00:05:13.970> P<00:05:14.240> that's

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
Omega we'll call that Omega P that's

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.830 
Omega we'll call that Omega P that's
going<00:05:14.750> to<00:05:14.810> be<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.020> oscillation<00:05:15.530> frequency<00:05:16.840> x

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
going to be the oscillation frequency x

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.870 
going to be the oscillation frequency x
squared<00:05:18.289> so<00:05:18.590> that's<00:05:18.800> a<00:05:18.949> standard<00:05:19.310> form<00:05:19.580> for

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
squared so that's a standard form for

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.520 
squared so that's a standard form for
the<00:05:20.060> kinetic<00:05:20.419> for<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.780> energy<00:05:21.139> stored<00:05:21.380> in<00:05:21.410> the

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
the kinetic for the energy stored in the

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.529 
the kinetic for the energy stored in the
oscillator<00:05:21.979> so<00:05:22.190> if<00:05:22.280> I<00:05:22.340> used<00:05:22.520> x<00:05:22.699> squared<00:05:23.000> that

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
oscillator so if I used x squared that

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.480 
oscillator so if I used x squared that
at<00:05:23.810> X<00:05:24.020> should<00:05:24.380> actually<00:05:24.530> be<00:05:24.830> an<00:05:24.919> S<00:05:25.070> that's<00:05:25.699> sort

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
at X should actually be an S that's sort

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.800 
at X should actually be an S that's sort
so<00:05:30.039> stating<00:05:31.039> these<00:05:31.190> as<00:05:31.340> equal<00:05:32.330> is<00:05:32.450> a<00:05:32.479> little

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
so stating these as equal is a little

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.560 
so stating these as equal is a little
bit<00:05:32.990> odd<00:05:33.229> because<00:05:33.800> it's<00:05:34.580> clearly<00:05:34.849> not<00:05:35.000> a<00:05:35.180> truly

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
bit odd because it's clearly not a truly

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.080 
bit odd because it's clearly not a truly
harmonic<00:05:36.020> oscillator<00:05:36.830> because<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.580> force

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
harmonic oscillator because the force

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.940 
harmonic oscillator because the force
acting<00:05:38.570> on<00:05:38.750> these<00:05:38.960> goes<00:05:39.260> like<00:05:39.440> one<00:05:39.680> over<00:05:39.710> the

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
acting on these goes like one over the

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.860 
acting on these goes like one over the
seperation<00:05:40.490> squared<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:41.030> it's<00:05:41.750> not

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
seperation squared and it's not

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.779 
seperation squared and it's not
proportional<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:43.039> separation<00:05:43.220> as<00:05:43.669> it

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
proportional to the separation as it

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.279 
proportional to the separation as it
should<00:05:43.970> be<00:05:44.090> a<00:05:44.120> harmonic<00:05:44.599> oscillator<00:05:44.720> so

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
should be a harmonic oscillator so

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:46.779 
should be a harmonic oscillator so
that's<00:05:45.470> where<00:05:45.680> this<00:05:45.860> derivation<00:05:46.099> is<00:05:46.550> really

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
that's where this derivation is really

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.719 
that's where this derivation is really
quite<00:05:47.060> rough<00:05:47.440> but<00:05:48.440> it<00:05:48.620> gives<00:05:48.860> you<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.550> correct

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
quite rough but it gives you the correct

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.279 
quite rough but it gives you the correct
form<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.630> it<00:05:50.780> gives<00:05:50.930> you<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.110> correct

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
form and it gives you the correct

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.790 
form and it gives you the correct
physical<00:05:51.500> insight<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.449> the<00:05:54.169> result<00:05:54.560> of<00:05:54.740> a

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
physical insight and the the result of a

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.350 
physical insight and the the result of a
little<00:05:55.039> bit<00:05:55.130> of<00:05:55.250> algebra<00:05:55.639> is<00:05:55.820> just<00:05:56.090> that<00:05:56.240> the

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
little bit of algebra is just that the

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.140 
little bit of algebra is just that the
plasma<00:05:56.810> frequency<00:05:57.310> scales<00:05:58.310> with<00:05:58.639> the<00:05:58.940> square

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
plasma frequency scales with the square

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.710 
plasma frequency scales with the square
root<00:05:59.510> of<00:06:01.240> the<00:06:02.240> free<00:06:03.699> carrier<00:06:04.699> density<00:06:05.210> squared

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
root of the free carrier density squared

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.469 
root of the free carrier density squared
charge<00:06:06.380> squared<00:06:06.740> and<00:06:06.979> divided<00:06:07.970> by<00:06:08.000> the<00:06:08.180> mass

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
charge squared and divided by the mass

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:09.969 
charge squared and divided by the mass
and<00:06:08.690> this<00:06:08.750> is<00:06:08.810> actually<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.349> effective<00:06:09.740> mass

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
and this is actually the effective mass

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.879 
and this is actually the effective mass
not<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.490> electron<00:06:10.910> mass<00:06:11.150> but<00:06:12.139> at<00:06:12.380> this<00:06:12.620> point

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
not the electron mass but at this point

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.189 
not the electron mass but at this point
we've<00:06:13.070> ignored<00:06:13.580> all<00:06:13.970> sorts<00:06:14.270> of<00:06:14.360> other<00:06:14.660> factors

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
we've ignored all sorts of other factors

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.100 
we've ignored all sorts of other factors
so<00:06:15.470> like<00:06:16.250> Coulomb's<00:06:16.699> constant<00:06:17.110> has

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
so like Coulomb's constant has

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.629 
so like Coulomb's constant has
disappeared<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:18.889> so<00:06:18.949> in<00:06:19.160> fact<00:06:19.340> I'm<00:06:19.430> going<00:06:19.580> to

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
disappeared and so in fact I'm going to

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.020 
disappeared and so in fact I'm going to
replace<00:06:19.849> that<00:06:20.060> equality<00:06:20.360> with<00:06:21.320> just<00:06:21.710> a<00:06:21.830> little

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
replace that equality with just a little

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.870 
replace that equality with just a little
proportional<00:06:23.030> to<00:06:23.150> symbol<00:06:24.430> so<00:06:25.430> it<00:06:25.550> tells<00:06:25.729> you

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
proportional to symbol so it tells you

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.580 
proportional to symbol so it tells you
that<00:06:26.000> the<00:06:26.479> plasma<00:06:26.840> frequency<00:06:27.020> which<00:06:27.440> is

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
that the plasma frequency which is

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.320 
that the plasma frequency which is
typically<00:06:28.010> in<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.250> ultraviolet<00:06:28.940> for<00:06:29.090> metals

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
typically in the ultraviolet for metals

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.070 
typically in the ultraviolet for metals
it<00:06:29.539> goes<00:06:29.690> up<00:06:29.930> with<00:06:30.380> the<00:06:31.810> free<00:06:32.810> particle

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
it goes up with the free particle

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.930 
it goes up with the free particle
density<00:06:33.590> in<00:06:33.919> the<00:06:34.159> plasma

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
density in the plasma

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.110

so<00:06:36.940> that's<00:06:37.180> plasma<00:06:37.660> oscillation<00:06:38.460> now<00:06:39.460> what's

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
so that's plasma oscillation now what's

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.860 
so that's plasma oscillation now what's
a<00:06:40.210> plasma<00:06:40.720> on<00:06:40.780> well<00:06:41.590> plasma<00:06:42.220> is<00:06:42.610> a<00:06:43.390> single

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
a plasma on well plasma is a single

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
quantum of a plasma oscillation so just

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.560 
quantum of a plasma oscillation so just
like<00:06:47.530> a<00:06:47.560> photon<00:06:48.070> is<00:06:48.310> a<00:06:48.340> single<00:06:48.880> quantum<00:06:49.300> of<00:06:49.450> an

like a photon is a single quantum of an

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.960 
like a photon is a single quantum of an
electromagnetic<00:06:50.040> oscillation<00:06:51.040> a<00:06:51.250> single

plasma is a quantum of a plasma

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.070 
plasma is a quantum of a plasma
oscillation<00:06:54.970> the<00:06:55.600> difference<00:06:55.960> between

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
oscillation the difference between

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.840 
oscillation the difference between

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
oscillation comes down to this exchange

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.600 
oscillation comes down to this exchange
of<00:07:00.430> energy<00:07:01.180> here<00:07:01.450> so<00:07:02.230> in<00:07:02.470> a<00:07:02.620> conventional

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.760 
electromagnetic isolation you're
exchanging<00:07:05.320> energy<00:07:05.680> between<00:07:06.010> electrostatic

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
plasma oscillation you exchange energy

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.200 
plasma oscillation you exchange energy
between<00:07:16.690> electrostatic<00:07:17.530> and<00:07:17.970> kinetic<00:07:18.970> and<00:07:19.150> of

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
between electrostatic and kinetic and of

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.120 
between electrostatic and kinetic and of
course<00:07:19.420> there's<00:07:19.600> also<00:07:19.780> some<00:07:20.290> magnetic<00:07:20.620> fields

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130 
course there's also some magnetic fields

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.420 
course there's also some magnetic fields
formed<00:07:22.000> by<00:07:22.960> the<00:07:23.020> current<00:07:23.470> here<00:07:23.770> but<00:07:24.160> it's<00:07:24.310> the

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
formed by the current here but it's the

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.790 
formed by the current here but it's the
presence<00:07:24.820> of<00:07:24.880> this<00:07:25.150> kinetic<00:07:25.480> energy<00:07:25.930> that's

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 
presence of this kinetic energy that's

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.890 
presence of this kinetic energy that's
really<00:07:27.370> quite<00:07:27.640> different<00:07:27.910> from<00:07:28.570> what<00:07:28.780> you're

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:28.900 
really quite different from what you're

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.240 
really quite different from what you're
thinking<00:07:29.230> what<00:07:29.470> you're<00:07:29.620> accustomed<00:07:30.010> to

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.250 
thinking what you're accustomed to

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.620 
thinking what you're accustomed to
thinking<00:07:30.610> about<00:07:30.640> in<00:07:30.910> free<00:07:31.120> space<00:07:31.390> for

thinking about in free space for
electromagnetic<00:07:32.380> field<00:07:32.950> and<00:07:33.190> this<00:07:33.640> also

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:33.850 
electromagnetic field and this also

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.280 
electromagnetic field and this also
relates<00:07:34.060> to<00:07:34.270> the<00:07:34.390> concept<00:07:34.570> of<00:07:34.900> kinetic

relates to the concept of kinetic

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.720 
relates to the concept of kinetic
