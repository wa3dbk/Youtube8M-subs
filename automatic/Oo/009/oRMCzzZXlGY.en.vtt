00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello today I'm going to prepare the soup 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.870
 spinach 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.490
 the amounts that I'm going to use are for 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.440
 three people 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:18.259
 a carrot a celery stalk two potatoes 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.259
 a quarter of onion bighead and human 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.410
 the benefits of this soup 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.920
 has calcium zinc magnesium 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.380
 okay 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.560
 everyone 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.560
 see you 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.030
 and it is already 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.560
 ah 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.560
 does not usually put spinach yet 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.329
 when 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.479
 I'm going to measure the amount of water as 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.479
 a soup 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:20.440
 I go to courses for water 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.420
 and 2 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.120
 and is the amount of 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.280
 let say 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.520
 in three people because because they already 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.009
 vegetables and everything gives me volume for him 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.530
 I'm going to add a little bit of salt and 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.050
 after 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.510
 taste 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.150
 on high heat when it is already on fire 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.150
 high low in the heat and they can do it 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.390
 and leave so 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.990
 well here we see the soup that is 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.390
 boiling I'm going to lower the heat to medium and 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.470
 continue cooking until until the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.470
 vegetables are squishy 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.319
 at this moment already pretty of criticism 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.319
 the spine 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.629
 and we leave it 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.340
 and all this you 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.670
 cool and receive with the beans and 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.670
 blender 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.800
 delicious 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.520
 the stove returns because I'm going to 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.260
 warm up again although it 's a little bit 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.390
 warm if you want to serve well 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.170

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.170
