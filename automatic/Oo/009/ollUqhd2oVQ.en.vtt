Jim<00:01:19.740> Brooks<00:01:20.090> talked<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.240> everybody<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.899> as

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
Jim Brooks talked with everybody and as

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.660 
Jim Brooks talked with everybody and as
I<00:01:22.170> said<00:01:22.229> our<00:01:22.380> configuration<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.310> vastly

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
I said our configuration is vastly

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.460 
I said our configuration is vastly
different<00:01:23.789> our<00:01:24.210> challenges<00:01:24.810> were<00:01:24.990> different

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
different our challenges were different

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.340 
different our challenges were different
so<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.819> had<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> take<00:01:27.539> what<00:01:27.929> Florida

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so we had to kind of take what Florida

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.550 
so we had to kind of take what Florida
had<00:01:28.500> done<00:01:28.709> take<00:01:29.429> learn<00:01:29.729> those<00:01:29.940> lessons

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
had done take learn those lessons

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.160 
had done take learn those lessons
integrate<00:01:31.560> those<00:01:31.799> into<00:01:31.860> our<00:01:32.310> thinking<00:01:32.670> here

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
integrate those into our thinking here

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.240 
integrate those into our thinking here
because<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.319> is<00:01:34.409> again<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> completely

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because it is again a completely

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.660 
because it is again a completely
different<00:01:35.520> design

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
different design

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.870 
different design
and<00:01:37.390> again<00:01:38.020> how<00:01:38.500> do<00:01:38.560> we<00:01:38.770> go<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.520> extreme

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
and again how do we go to the extreme

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.999 
and again how do we go to the extreme
how<00:01:40.030> we<00:01:40.150> raise<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.540> level<00:01:40.840> what<00:01:41.619> are<00:01:41.710> some<00:01:41.890> of

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
how we raise the level what are some of

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.070 
how we raise the level what are some of
the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.080 
the
interesting<00:01:44.040> interactive<00:01:44.430> things<00:01:44.850> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
interesting interactive things that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.240 
interesting interactive things that
guests<00:01:45.360> might<00:01:45.510> find<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.250> might

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
guests might find here that might

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.300 
guests might find here that might
overlook<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.910> specific<00:01:48.680> see<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:50.130> little

always trying to think about

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.580 
always trying to think about
we<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.880> how<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.150> prove<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.230> I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
we can do that and how we can prove so I

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.230 
we can do that and how we can prove so I
mean<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.250> doesn't<00:02:50.520> stop<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:50.820> could<00:02:50.850> move

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
mean it doesn't stop we could move

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.930

listen to customer feedback because
that's<00:02:55.350> very<00:02:55.650> very<00:02:55.800> important<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.700> we

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that's very very important that we

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.090 
that's very very important that we
continue<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.210> challenge<00:02:57.450> ourselves<00:02:58.010> what<00:02:59.010> are

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
continue to challenge ourselves what are

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.990 
continue to challenge ourselves what are
some<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.370> things<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.850> do

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
some of the things that you do

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.750 
some of the things that you do
creatively<00:03:00.540> as<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.810> designer<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.710> try<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.550> take

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
creatively as a designer to try and take

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.910 
creatively as a designer to try and take
a<00:03:02.790> two<00:03:03.180> dimensional

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
a two dimensional

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.040 
a two dimensional
and<00:03:05.550> make<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.910> still<00:03:06.300> resonates<00:03:06.569> a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
and make it still resonates a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.150 
and make it still resonates a
three-dimensional<00:03:07.800> world

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
three-dimensional world

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.920 
three-dimensional world
well<00:03:10.160> that's<00:03:10.760> really<00:03:11.060> at<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.570> core<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
well that's really at the core of the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.200 
well that's really at the core of the
challenge<00:03:12.380> because<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:13.130> lot<00:03:13.820> of<00:03:13.850> times<00:03:14.030> we'll

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
challenge because a lot of times we'll

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.240 
challenge because a lot of times we'll
start<00:03:14.480> out<00:03:14.570> in<00:03:14.750> terms<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:15.080> a<00:03:15.620> design<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.160> how

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
start out in terms of a design and how

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.100 
start out in terms of a design and how
do<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.430> dimensionalize<00:03:17.090> would<00:03:17.540> bring<00:03:17.840> how<00:03:18.050> do

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
do you dimensionalize would bring how do

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.440 
do you dimensionalize would bring how do
you<00:03:18.200> dimensionalize<00:03:18.760> anything<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.180> that's

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
you dimensionalize anything and that's

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.030 
you dimensionalize anything and that's
where<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.840> collaboration<00:03:21.410> with<00:03:21.530> fox<00:03:21.770> racing

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
where the collaboration with fox racing

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.810 
where the collaboration with fox racing
comes<00:03:22.430> in<00:03:22.640> because<00:03:23.300> it's<00:03:24.260> not<00:03:24.410> rit<00:03:24.770> what<00:03:25.550> we<00:03:25.670> do

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
comes in because it's not rit what we do

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.670 
comes in because it's not rit what we do
is<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.120> do<00:03:26.300> bring<00:03:26.570> experiences<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.320> life<00:03:27.500> and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
is we do bring experiences to life and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.070 
is we do bring experiences to life and
create<00:03:27.950> personal<00:03:28.670> experiences<00:03:29.330> but<00:03:29.870> how<00:03:30.020> do

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
create personal experiences but how do

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.260 
create personal experiences but how do
we<00:03:30.200> do<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.490> very<00:03:31.490> close<00:03:31.670> collaboration<00:03:32.210> with

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
we do that very close collaboration with

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.500 
we do that very close collaboration with
the<00:03:32.780> folks<00:03:32.990> at<00:03:33.140> Gracie<00:03:33.880> but<00:03:34.880> we<00:03:35.000> charged<00:03:35.300> some

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
the folks at Gracie but we charged some

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.110 
the folks at Gracie but we charged some
new<00:03:35.570> territory<00:03:36.080> because<00:03:36.320> you<00:03:36.470> don't<00:03:36.650> see<00:03:37.120> the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
new territory because you don't see the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.240 
new territory because you don't see the
