00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.040
 let's say this 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello friends I am going to present what 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.889
 is the tutorial to make a small 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.970
 Steam boat good materials that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.530
 can we use it will be a can 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.530
 two flexible pots 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.769
 Plasticine Free 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.660
 silly kohn 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.670
 and an extra silicon bar by itself 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.670
 then scissors 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.680
 and a piece of cardboard for the base 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 matches 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.100
 a small piece of candle 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.160
 now we will cut what is the can of 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.000
 extreme extreme 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.710
 this will serve us for what 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.710
 make up the button 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.710
 and because we use aluminum we use 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.909
 aluminum because it's a way 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.390
 way 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.479
 to produce this steam since this does not 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.130
 uses will not use will not serve as 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.130
 boat engine 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:24.270
 good now as next step 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.579
 we will fold the aluminum in half 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.850
 to give shape to what is the 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.850
 engine 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.939
 we cut it in half because it's 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.939
 very big 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.320
 well now the two extremes that we have 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.460
 we'll save them for later 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.520
 use them as a base as a species 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.520
 of 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.070
 after the cut part we doubled in 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.070
 the side 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.950
 on the right side and we make a 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.180
 fold as part of it in 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.969
 higher 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.599
 this helps us not to have everything 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:25.409
 sealed , the steam does not escape through the 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.409
 small holes 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.830
 As we can see here that we will 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.280
 bending at the top 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.410
 this 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.620
 that is well thought out so that 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.710
 so that steam does not come out 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.710
 there 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.900
 well this one was already this with the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.490
 play dough we can find it or 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.660
 also with a silicone gun 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:05.110
 the joke is this to try not to 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.300
 have no benefit in the other part 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.120
 of aluminum this 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.640
 we put what is being the pots 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.450
 so that I can go out there 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.450
 the steam 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.600
 that we are seeing as we introduce the 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.600
 two pots 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.930
 then we seal it with plasticine or 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.250
 or with the silicone gun 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.890
 we call them well to be firm firm 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.180
 the silicone and that does not have any 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.459
 air vent 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.840
 after this we do we cut what 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.840
 starting the base of the boat 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.850
 of cardboard we cut well 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.850
 the marked parts 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.830
 well we are cutting what is coming 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.830
 being the cardboard 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.150
 this is this is what is being 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.150
 the base of the boat 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.250
 we cut 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.710
 we will do the same with what has been 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.110
 the piece of aluminum 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.860
 there is the mold 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.840
 this piece of aluminum is for you to 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.750
 that is not going to get wet when 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.819
 introduce the boat to the water that we 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.620
 also serves to have a 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.620
 better exploitation in the water 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.980
 there we go cutting slowly 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.650
 very carefully, do not let's go to 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.550
 cut with him 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.550
 with aluminum 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.800
 that it looks good what has been the 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.349
 mold of 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.349
 of aluminum with carton 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.770
 well there was this we hit it with 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.770
 silicone 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.189
 that is well stuck 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.080
 Well, these are the basis of 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.080
 ship 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.750
 here we see already already stuck to the base 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.439
 from the boat we make a hole where 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.639
 fit the pots with this piece of 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:43.330
 aluminum 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.879
 this one we're going to be sticking 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.960
 also to then hit what 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.960
 it's been the little candle 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.500
 there we go introducing what is coming 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.600
 being pots 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.140
 we will give you the mold 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.560
 necessary this way for the candle 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.560
 I can 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.949
 can heat what is being the 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.949
 aluminum 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:14.250
 this we seal the part of the 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.340
 hole in the base of the boat so that 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.970
 can not penetrate what has been the 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.760
 water because if we do not sink in there 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:28.340
 we seal well well well and very well 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.230
 let's continue there we are throwing 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.249
 we take off the supports also what 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:37.709
 is the base below 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:37.709
 so that not so that it does not move and this 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.720
 do not take this direction the ship towards 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.720
 other side 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:52.149
 that's how the ship was and our prototype 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.149
 well well structured 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.030
 good on the part of the evidence of 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.260
 aluminum we will stick what comes 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.260
 being the candle 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.270
 the candle can be the size so that 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.270
 be the necessary size 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.390
 the size needed so you can 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:17.720
 burn what is being aluminum 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.700
 inside the pots we will enter a little 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.560
 of water 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.560
 before introducing it to 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.560
 to the water to test the boat 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.220
 there we are testing the prototype on 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.220
 Steamboat 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.830
 let's see how this is progressing 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.390
 of misfortunes
