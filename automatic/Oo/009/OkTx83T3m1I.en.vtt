00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.900
 hello welcome to our 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.130
 bastille adventure camp and me 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.760
 want us back in different 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.189
 We fall for adventure and that's what we need 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.320
 your adventure maps that you build for us 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 but not without a few 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.650
 frame conditions are here 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.440
 some information that is important 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.300
 that's exactly what it's important to do 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 that we animal the whole adventure naps 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.030
 can make in vanilla minecraft 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.930
 can play so no additional power 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.600
 grow server or the like 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
 put up to the course that no 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.670
 mods installed in some way 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.580
 have to be and that was given 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.440
 actually very desirable is that you 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.210
 there as well as two will play it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.040
 according to things are installed the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.380
 you can solve in pairs and so on 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.960
 continue so a two players with 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.880
 Also important is a minimum 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.500
 playing length of 15 minutes and one 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.409
 maximum play length of about 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.930
 an hour will be considerably longer 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.939
 then we reserve that 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.460
 abort and the videos only 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.689
 not to upload from this map because 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.069
 otherwise that's too extreme right then 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.140
 of course a thing with the 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.850
 resources ex if no extra now 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.859
 just download respect 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.990
 make use of respectively 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.859
 and of course you have one 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.630
 small selection 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.090
 for one, of course, the tv l dressage 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.649
 spec which is available is clear 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.509
 then, of course, the atrium of the server 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.340
 pack and the waldfest respects that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.920
 will be on a sign on the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 start the adventure map so that we know 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.810
 what we are dealing with 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.939
 also at the start of the venture maps 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.829
 should be a sign where the names 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.200
 the creator or the creator 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.060
 are noted so we know from the same 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.060
 the map is and also accordingly 

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:09.240
 then we need of course or 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.979
 we do not need it in 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.680
 which for the pasture or challenge march 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.220
 Say where we have any things 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.960
 have to do it 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.880
 or have to kill any things 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.600
 or just to survive 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.800
 it is supposed to be an adventure map 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.590
 be in the classic sense 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.680
 In addition, a clearly recognizable 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.500
 end so the map should be a clear 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.060
 recognizable end own that if we 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.100
 also arrived at the end are also 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.800
 remember and not at all perplexed in the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.020
 around without knowing whether now 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.880
 the map is over or if it still is 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.110
 continues 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.910
 We also have the following 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.610
 think about it as a little something special 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.330
 The following conditions should be incorporated 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.030
 become 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.450
 These are trivial things that you about the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.120
 map distributed for example should me 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.340
 or muslims a crazy magician 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.440
 or crazy professor also contains 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.290
 should be a sacred tree in any one 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.570
 Wise should be shown 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.060
 pig with the name pegs in it 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.280
 A flower as a flower occurs 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.020
 referred to as 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.590
 you would have to have a rainbow somewhere 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.690
 see 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.880
 that 's all it could do in clear 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.620
 not recognizable on the whole web 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.850
 so miss should distribute now 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.230
 do not be that stuff in 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.110
 roll any secret or 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.550
 optional passages are included 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.660
 but it is important for us to do that 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.310
 to make it a little bit special 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.410
 these things occur in it and am 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.810
 most important is the note that 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.150
 is just distributed on the map is who 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.970
 the things dull only at the beginning or on 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.160
 the end all together in the corner drives that 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.510
 did not make sense of the thing we ourselves 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.310
 have thought but it must be nice 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.280
 be woven into the whole 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.080
 atmosphere or environment story what also 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.760
 That would always be nice if that works 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.670
 Now we come to important points 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.040
 and that sends us if you have a map 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.880
 created 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:13.269
 map only via pn on youtube with the 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.739
 concerning my adventure map for you the 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.799
 content should be the downloadlink 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.690
 include and the minecraft version 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.830
 by playing this 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.810
 important here is when you 17 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.360
 can you use or the 18 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.600
 Snapshots are important in snapshot 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.630
 there should then respect what you 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.630
 also used for working 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.880
 the deadline is 31 5 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.190
 2014 you can start already 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.410
 and the mez from the first five 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.210
 to send 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.500
 if you wanted to be very fast that 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.500
 fits with us i enjoy
