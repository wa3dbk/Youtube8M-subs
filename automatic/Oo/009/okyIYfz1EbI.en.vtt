00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.120
 Hello, we are with you Victor Tereschenko 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.960
 today we will learn as much as possible on our own 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.389
 computer to make a goal any file any 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.520
 attempt to hide 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.200
 that is invisible to other users 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.090
 but it is often necessary if we allow somewhere 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.170
 at work on one computer 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.740
 work not only employees or 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.109
 let's say at home 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.659
 where there are small children or just 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.939
 want public information opening 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.929
 to make it available 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.579
 so prc is about pledges season wont 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.499
 care kupap what is called a check 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.220
 I drive the dodin rules 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.530
 we press the right mouse button in sk as 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.820
 mockery 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.000
 so we are here a little bit did not fit me 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 very long at the very bottom and there is 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.740
 properties tab 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.050
 click properties 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.010
 there is just choose attributes 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 and place the hidden 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.860
 apply 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 claim that relates to the folder 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.110
 nomadic willing to pay 3 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.500
 so and so and folders 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.080
 check 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.380
 mermaid can scare away the words let's say 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.900
 flip the file again down below 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.750
 in may properties 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.700
 hidden 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.900
 apply such all 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.290
 Before this file, we also can not see 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.700
 so this will be the first part of the task 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.340
 like 3 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.620
 folder or file and now the second part 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.660
 tasks like 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.270
 all the same m as if the moment 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.440
 read 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.440
 and see that I found him alone in Moscow 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.490
 so chase will be in the right to 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.439
 Is the total commander really by the way if you have 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.329
 computer is not worth this program someone 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.049
 rk team 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.079
 I highly recommend obliging the past 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.270
 because here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.960
 Well, the mass of opportunities m can be done through 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.010
 10 20 years issued more video lessons on 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.760
 working with this program is what we 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.940
 maybe a lot 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.120
 so here from but this is if you work with 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.799
 by team 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.579
 on the right then the team just come 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:02.970
 fold of faces 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.960
 Advanced settings 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.149
 and here and with the hidden system show 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.899
 files 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.299
 let's see you 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.569
 check 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.840
 according to her, those who check yes everything is very 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.059
 simply 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.459
 alive suddenly 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.139
 No, the program section of the account is running. 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.769
 teams then 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.549

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:32.929
 and choose 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.010
 open the control panel tab 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.579
 plot control panel work 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.179
 along with one reason or another 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:42.209
 There is such a goat call parameters 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.509
 folders if you are working in the system and 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:45.779
 grandparents speaker 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.709
 there will be folder properties too 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.499
 fold click 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.839
 so here with us 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.020
 take 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.020
 the liner is in the bottom 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.739
 there is no currently open files folder or 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.629
 show and by the way before the staff 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.849
 let's open 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.829
 it already is 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.350
 So 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.319
 here is more 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.429
 Here in Russia is now amazing 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.959
 because it is worth not showing sticks 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.400
 hidden under the phone 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.959
 if we set to show 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.139
 ok 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.839
 right here with us 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.839
 see yes Kurilov 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.459
 while checking or 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.669
 file verification 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.009
 delicacy is very simple 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:40.889
 so take advantage of it 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.169
 year will be in Europe and finish 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.889
 thought that it was nothing to do with 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:46.019
 dating
