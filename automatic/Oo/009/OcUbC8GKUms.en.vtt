and the second thing which is a little

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.939 
and the second thing which is a little

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
understandable why they didn't include

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.340 
understandable why they didn't include
is<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.880> play<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.329> charge<00:00:33.600> kit<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.290> that's

actually advertised on the back of the
packaging<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.739> kind<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:37.980> annoying

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
packaging but it's just kind of annoying

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.000 
packaging but it's just kind of annoying
that<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.360> only<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.469> play<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.710> charge

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that they only have the play in charge

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.940 
that they only have the play in charge
kit<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.489> black<00:00:41.910> now<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.780> retail<00:00:43.260> stores<00:00:43.500> such

kit in black now in retail stores such

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.010 
kit in black now in retail stores such
as<00:00:44.100> Best<00:00:44.280> Buy<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.239> don't<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
as Best Buy but they don't have the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
as Best Buy but they don't have the
white<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.670> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
white one so it's not really going to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.520 
white one so it's not really going to
match<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.090> controller<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.230> kind<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
match my controller so it's kind of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.840 
match my controller so it's kind of
annoying<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.219> having<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> use<00:00:50.700> the

written in about 50,000 languages had no
one<00:01:02.190> ever<00:01:02.340> reads<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.030> then<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.600> your

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
batteries and I'm not too fond of these

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.310 
batteries and I'm not too fond of these
and<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.030> because<00:01:06.210> I'm<00:01:06.479> eco-friendly

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and it's not because I'm eco-friendly

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.080 
and it's not because I'm eco-friendly
but<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.189> think<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.549> kind<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.909> hassle

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
but I just think it's kind of a hassle

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
but I just think it's kind of a hassle
having<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.600> search<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.530> drawers<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
all around the house to find batteries

all around the house to find batteries
when<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.140> plug<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.619> straight<00:01:14.610> into

controller<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.490> has<00:01:29.549> shipped<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.150> fad

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
controller that has shipped with the fad

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
controller that has shipped with the fad
Xbox<00:01:30.990> previously<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.040> are<00:01:32.100> only<00:01:32.220> three

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
Xbox previously and there are only three

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
Xbox previously and there are only three
made<00:01:32.759> differences<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> most

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
made differences one which is the most

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.710 
made differences one which is the most
obvious<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.909> bottom<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
obvious is that at the bottom it's a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
obvious is that at the bottom it's a
shiny<00:01:36.990> white<00:01:37.350> now<00:01:37.619> instead<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.400> matte

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
shiny white now instead of that matte

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
shiny white now instead of that matte
dark<00:01:39.090> gray<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.630> another<00:01:39.960> difference<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.590> in

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
dark gray and another difference is in

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
dark gray and another difference is in
the<00:01:41.040> new<00:01:41.189> controller<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.970> directional<00:01:42.450> pad

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the new controller the directional pad

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.440 
the new controller the directional pad
and<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.229> analog<00:01:43.829> sticks<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> lighter<00:01:45.119> gray

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and the analog sticks are a lighter gray

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.990 
and the analog sticks are a lighter gray
whereas<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> older<00:01:46.920> controller<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
whereas on the older controller is a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
whereas on the older controller is a
darker<00:01:48.360> gray<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.590> third<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.100> final

darker gray and the third and final
difference<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.970> I've<00:01:51.090> noticed<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
difference that I've noticed in the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.270 
difference that I've noticed in the
controllers<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> Guide<00:01:52.770> button<00:01:53.009> on

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
controllers is in the Guide button on

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
controllers is in the Guide button on
the<00:01:53.759> older<00:01:54.000> controller<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> brushed<00:01:55.229> metal

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the older controller is a brushed metal

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.740 
the older controller is a brushed metal
look<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> newer<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
look and here on the newer one is a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
look and here on the newer one is a
chrome<00:01:58.259> look<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.920> actually<00:01:59.040> see<00:01:59.399> my

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
chrome look and you can actually see my

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760 
chrome look and you can actually see my
reflection<00:01:59.670> of<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.840> phone<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> use<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
reflection of the phone that I use to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.370 
reflection of the phone that I use to
take<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.159> picture<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.390> maybe<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.079> me

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
take this picture so maybe it's just me

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.830 
take this picture so maybe it's just me
but<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.430> white<00:02:05.579> Xboxes<00:02:06.360> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
but I really like the white Xboxes you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.210 
but I really like the white Xboxes you
know<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> hope<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:07.649> bring<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:08.039> back

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
know I hope that they bring them back

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.930 
know I hope that they bring them back
and<00:02:08.489> start<00:02:08.879> selling<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.959> 250<00:02:10.830> gig<00:02:11.009> white<00:02:11.250> Xboxes

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
and start selling a 250 gig white Xboxes

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.610 
and start selling a 250 gig white Xboxes
so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> would<00:02:12.780> definitely<00:02:12.900> pick<00:02:13.260> one
