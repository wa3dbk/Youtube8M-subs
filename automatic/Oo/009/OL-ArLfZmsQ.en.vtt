00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.570
 and what the hell, we started talking about 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.000
 these two consoles opens a strong debate 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:14.270
 which is the best if it is better to 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.100
 sony that does not get worse than microsoft 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.480
 but the reality is that it is still a 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.670
 new age of video games and 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.250
 entertainment from which we can take 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.110
 much profit and hours of fun and 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.090
 we know what the 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.340
 video game consoles but what about 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.780
 the games 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.260
 what are the strongest bets for 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:37.400
 the next generation of exclusives we 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.210
 they will give up or playstation 4 or 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.680
 by xbox one 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.980
 well that's what you know is the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.280
 moment after the comparison of the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.379
 consoles arrive at the moment of truth 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.390
 the games here we summarize the first 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.090
 titles that have been announced for the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 next generation consoles a list 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.250
 that will be concretized in the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 next conferences of 3 already 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.900
 As launch approaches to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.820
 end of the year 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.620
 good to see these are the games 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.100
 exclusive playstation 4 which 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.970
 are net 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.550

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.590
 the witness 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.030
 the games of the xbox one and those that we 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 show so far are 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 forza motorsport 5 how much in wake and wave 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.290
 also in multiplatform games 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.510
 although in the next e3 it will produce 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.760
 an authentic avalanche of games for 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.010
 pc 4 and xbox one 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.510
 we wanted to highlight a few 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.550
 titles that were taught in the 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.880
 conferences and they will appear in both 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.880
 consoles 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.460
 which are 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.690
 one of the main and the best 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:12.060
 call of duty ghosts destiny devil 3 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:18.090

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.610
 mitchell 3 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.530
 If, as it seems, he only wants his 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.290
 console is available worldwide 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.780
 for the Christmas campaign we will have to 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.260
 announce the price and date of 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.930
 launch of playstation 4 on e3 and 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.950
 if he does microsoft he can not stay 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.349
 with crossed arms 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.110
 Another important aspect will be the price 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.360
 itself although it is very likely that both 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.430
 companies know in detail the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.730
 plans of his rival 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.629
 a difference of just over 12 per 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.120
 say 50 dollars would be enough 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:07.430
 meaningful to discard the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.879
 balance in favor of one of these two 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.670
 fortunately companies who more 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.129
 they have to win for those who have more 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.200
 to win in this price war 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:23.050
