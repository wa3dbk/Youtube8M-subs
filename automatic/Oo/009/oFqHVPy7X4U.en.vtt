00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the same color now I'm wondering because

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.400 
the same color now I'm wondering because
this<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.269> wrecking<00:02:18.690> different<00:02:18.989> engine<00:02:19.290> at

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
this is a wrecking different engine at

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.050 
this is a wrecking different engine at
some<00:02:19.590> stage<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.250> was<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> recondition

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
some stage and that was a recondition

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.790 
some stage and that was a recondition
engine<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.810> was<00:02:21.930> only<00:02:22.110> meant<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.530> done

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
engine that was only meant to be done

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.920 
engine that was only meant to be done
about<00:02:22.950> 130,000<00:02:23.910> case<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.540> that's<00:02:24.630> why<00:02:24.780> we're

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
about 130,000 case so that's why we're

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.430 
about 130,000 case so that's why we're
putting<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.350> but<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.240> look<00:02:27.540> right<00:02:28.200> down

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
putting it in but if you look right down

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.210 
putting it in but if you look right down
here<00:02:28.680> it's

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
here it's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160 
here it's
like<00:02:29.460> an<00:02:29.580> aqua<00:02:29.940> blue<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.180> grainy<00:02:30.570> sort<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.020> blue

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
like an aqua blue a grainy sort of blue

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.020 
like an aqua blue a grainy sort of blue
and<00:02:32.070> then<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.370> look<00:02:32.490> on<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and then if you look on like the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.590 
and then if you look on like the
flexplate

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
flexplate

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.530 
flexplate
there<00:02:34.010> that's<00:02:35.010> that's<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.540> traditional

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
there that's that's the traditional

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.410 
there that's that's the traditional
currency<00:02:37.050> yeah<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.190> all<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.820> color<00:02:39.180> so

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
currency yeah it's all that we color so

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.330 
currency yeah it's all that we color so
I<00:02:39.450> wonder<00:02:39.690> if<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.780> or<00:02:40.680> anyone<00:02:40.920> can<00:02:41.010> tell<00:02:41.190> me

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
I wonder if that or anyone can tell me

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.220 
I wonder if that or anyone can tell me
whether<00:02:41.490> that's<00:02:41.580> like<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.990> recognition<00:02:42.990> as

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
whether that's like a recognition as

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.290 
whether that's like a recognition as
color<00:02:43.680> thing<00:02:44.040> or<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.500> or<00:02:46.910> well<00:02:47.910> maybe<00:02:48.030> it's

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
color thing or to it or well maybe it's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.000 
color thing or to it or well maybe it's
absolutely<00:02:48.990> nothing<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.560> no<00:02:49.740> one<00:02:49.770> can

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
absolutely nothing and no one can

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.410 
absolutely nothing and no one can
explain<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.460> but<00:02:50.670> yeah<00:02:50.880> if<00:02:50.970> anyone<00:02:51.180> could

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
explain it but yeah if anyone could

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.270 
explain it but yeah if anyone could
that'd<00:02:51.720> be<00:02:51.810> much<00:02:52.110> appreciated<00:02:52.290> I'm<00:02:53.010> quite

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
that'd be much appreciated I'm quite

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.720 
that'd be much appreciated I'm quite
curious<00:02:53.520> on<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.950> one's<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.310> wild<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
curious on that this one's a wild and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.350 
curious on that this one's a wild and
Gracie<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:59.280> actually<00:02:59.640> doesn't<00:02:59.850> run<00:03:00.030> too<00:03:00.180> bad

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
Gracie this actually doesn't run too bad

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.360 
Gracie this actually doesn't run too bad
so<00:03:00.690> I'm<00:03:00.780> thinking<00:03:01.140> I'll<00:03:01.410> probably<00:03:01.709> put<00:03:02.310> a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
so I'm thinking I'll probably put a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.250 
so I'm thinking I'll probably put a
gasket<00:03:02.760> kit<00:03:02.910> through<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.420> painted<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.110> lot

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
gasket kit through it and painted a lot

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.080 
gasket kit through it and painted a lot
nice<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.830> probably<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.610> correct<00:03:05.910> blue

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
nice and probably get the correct blue

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.770 
nice and probably get the correct blue
this<00:03:06.270> time<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.830> then<00:03:07.980> try<00:03:08.070> sell<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.459> off<00:03:08.780> using

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
this time and then try sell it off using

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.540 
this time and then try sell it off using
icicle<00:03:10.260> motor<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:10.620> someone<00:03:10.830> putting<00:03:11.100> to

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
icicle motor for someone putting to

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.590 
icicle motor for someone putting to
their<00:03:11.700> car<00:03:11.940> if<00:03:12.090> they've<00:03:12.240> got<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> blown<00:03:12.570> motor

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
their car if they've got a blown motor

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.380 
their car if they've got a blown motor
or<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.350> know<00:03:13.470> something<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.190> no<00:03:15.060> motor

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
or you know something like that no motor

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.820 
or you know something like that no motor
on<00:03:15.540> its<00:03:15.690> way<00:03:15.810> out<00:03:15.840> because<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.440> actually<00:03:16.709> runs

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
on its way out because it actually runs

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.470 
on its way out because it actually runs
pretty<00:03:17.100> pretty<00:03:17.490> sweet<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.910> don't<00:03:18.330> know<00:03:18.390> how

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
pretty pretty sweet I don't know how

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.760 
pretty pretty sweet I don't know how
many<00:03:18.540> carries<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:18.990> on<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.170> but<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.380> don't<00:03:19.530> think

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
many carries it on it but I don't think

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.280 
many carries it on it but I don't think
there<00:03:20.070> would<00:03:20.160> be<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.340> many<00:03:20.670> because<00:03:20.970> it's

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
there would be that many because it's

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.420 
there would be that many because it's
recon<00:03:22.290> motor<00:03:22.530> at<00:03:22.680> some<00:03:22.860> stage<00:03:23.040> it's<00:03:23.250> got<00:03:23.370> the
