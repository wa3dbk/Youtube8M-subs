emotions<00:06:45.850> and<00:06:46.030> it<00:06:46.330> makes<00:06:46.600> it<00:06:46.780> really<00:06:47.080> really

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
emotions and it makes it really really

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.590 
emotions and it makes it really really
raw<00:06:47.860> and<00:06:48.160> really<00:06:48.580> natural<00:06:48.910> and<00:06:49.000> really<00:06:49.210> really

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
raw and really natural and really really

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.029 
raw and really natural and really really
it's<00:06:49.840> called<00:06:50.020> new-school<00:06:50.289> acting<00:06:50.740> so

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 
it's called new-school acting so

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:53.820 
it's called new-school acting so
hopefully<00:06:51.970> it<00:06:52.240> actually<00:06:52.960> it<00:06:53.050> will<00:06:53.260> I<00:06:53.470> believe

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
hopefully it actually it will I believe

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.129 
hopefully it actually it will I believe
it<00:06:53.979> will<00:06:54.160> eventually<00:06:54.430> take<00:06:55.150> over<00:06:55.300> would<00:06:56.110> you

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139 
it will eventually take over would you

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:57.689 
it will eventually take over would you
would<00:06:56.650> you<00:06:56.710> say<00:06:56.979> it<00:06:57.130> like<00:06:57.280> what<00:06:57.430> was<00:06:57.520> it<00:06:57.610> like

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
would you say it like what was it like

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.270 
would you say it like what was it like
before<00:06:58.090> exactly<00:06:58.660> right<00:06:59.110> just<00:06:59.440> how<00:06:59.770> to<00:06:59.830> get<00:07:00.100> how

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
before exactly right just how to get how

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.029 
before exactly right just how to get how
far<00:07:00.580> certainly<00:07:01.210> yeah<00:07:01.479> like<00:07:01.930> I<00:07:02.410> don't<00:07:02.740> believe

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
far certainly yeah like I don't believe

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.490 
far certainly yeah like I don't believe
