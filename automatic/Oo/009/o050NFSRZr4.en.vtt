00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it's just attached itself down the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.330 
it's just attached itself down the
crevices<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.370> this<00:01:11.520> ear<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.120> it's<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:14.070> still

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
crevices of this ear and it's it's still

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.000 
crevices of this ear and it's it's still
alive<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.360> getting<00:01:15.750> ready<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.170> feed<00:01:16.500> when

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
alive it's getting ready to feed when

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.840 
alive it's getting ready to feed when
they<00:01:17.159> feed<00:01:17.490> they<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:18.150> expand

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
they feed they get they expand

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.710 
they feed they get they expand

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
little tip key and we're going to place

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.609 
little tip key and we're going to place
it<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.150> tick<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.690> pull<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.140> pull<00:01:31.500> out

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it on this tick to pull out pull out

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.499 
it on this tick to pull out pull out
everything<00:01:32.100> including<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.580> head<00:01:32.790> there's<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
everything including the head there's a

ticks but basically you want to get down
close<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> skin<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.270> head<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
close to the skin so that the head is

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.710 
close to the skin so that the head is
removed<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> same<00:01:40.530> time<00:01:41.240> because<00:01:42.240> if<00:01:42.600> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
removed at the same time because if you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.290 
removed at the same time because if you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
see here's the tick key it's going over

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.880 
see here's the tick key it's going over
top<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.000> tick<00:01:51.270> we're<00:01:52.200> trying<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.770> it
