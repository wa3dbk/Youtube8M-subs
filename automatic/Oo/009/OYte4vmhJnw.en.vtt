00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 the squat one-leg squat 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.200
 gun is one of the best exercises 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.389
 for the glutes and thighs the only 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.880
 problem is that if your calves do not 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.549
 they are flexible enough you do not go 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.120
 to be able to get off well of course you can 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.670
 place a disc under your heel 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.400
 but in the long term you must work in your 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.410
 flexibility so do not get used to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.170
 lift your heel but stretch the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.630
 muscles of your calves and so on 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.000
 ago to have a leg and extend 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.520
 your arms in front of your chest then 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.250
 Get down on one leg as much as you 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.950
 possible without lifting your heel and inhale 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.740
 at the same time 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.380
 and look forward and I do not know where it is 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.660
 back ideally would be that your hip 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.180
 is below your knee in the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.430
 lowest point but probably not 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.160
 be able to get down so much at the beginning 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.630
 then return to the starting position 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.630
 slowly and exhale 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.239
 the higher you keep the leg that 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.580
 be in the air much better at the beginning 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.720
 maybe you 're only going to be able to do half 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.240
 squat 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.700
 but do not forget that you must go down so much 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.610
 as you can without raising your 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.740
 heel keep your knees well together 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.140
 all the time and cup your 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.040
 back or push your chest forward 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.040
 when you stop 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.500
 do not round your back like this 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.330
 also make sure you get to the fault 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.310
 muscle which means that you should 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.680
 get to the point where the muscles of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.620
 your legs give up completely 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.480
 and you can not get up again 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.780
 millimeter 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.460
 if you are a beginner you can slide 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.250
 the leg that is in the air in the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.430
 I usually get up when you get up but make sure 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.980
 to stand with only one leg 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.650
 you shift your weight back and forth to 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.990
 get up with both legs if you can 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.069
 do more than 20 repetitions you can 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.219
 load someone on your back 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.249
 do not lie if you can do more than 20 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:17.319
 repetitions do another exercise before 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:20.049
 your squats pistols you can do 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.299
 squats with bar press legs or 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.459
 leg extensions or you can download 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.159
 even more or just do your 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.010
 squat pistols slower not you 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.590
 I advise doing this exercise with weights 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.019
 and just in case this exercise is not only 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.299
 for girls the pistol squat is a 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.549
 excellent leg exercise but in 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.859
 my opinion many guys do not 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.680
 because it's something difficult to balance or 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.930
 because they lack flexibility finally 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.900
 if you want to work even more on your 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.840
 buttocks squeeze your buttocks when you 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.540
 pairs and stretches 10 to 15 seconds between 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.540
 series I usually do this stretch
