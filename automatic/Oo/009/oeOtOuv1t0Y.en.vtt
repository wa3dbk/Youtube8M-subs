00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello with you i usually i will put u now 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.309
 ipod nano 7 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.260
 generations in silver by 16 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.410
 gigabyte 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.670
 let's remove the cap from him like that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:23.519
 it opens out here you can 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:31.189
 so here stretch to open and here 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.189
 something like this 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.829
 in general, such a tone is enough 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.030
 thin lightly brilliantly some such 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.750
 type a dick is ok with a connector here 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.899
 us such a plastic and let's take off 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.670
 film 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.969
 there is such a knot 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.370
 but of course we have already opened it and so 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.050
 clean show you how it lies 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:05.580
 funny boxes are round 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.630
 ikonochku screen but not so much that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.580
 still quite normal screen 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.830
 the screen is small I don't even understand why 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.130
 it was necessary to do so that it was 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.520
 watch movies could have been here 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.520
 even a trash button with such a round and 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.670
 include power button turn on well in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.220
 Generally about such here he is 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.000
 if we talk about the zoom buttons and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.409
 decrease the volume then naturally you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.540
 you can change them 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.369
 it means in the middle you turn 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.009
 turn off the general functions here 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.090
 absolutely the same as in headphones 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.590
 from apple who have this here 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.530
 volume buttons with 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.689
 microphone if we talk about how 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.380
 it is thin then it can be compared with 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.100
 pencil it is much thinner somewhere 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.070
 at one and a half 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.320
 if not in two and if the lightness says 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.360
 but I don't even know what to compare it with 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.379
 very very light literally not 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.790
 felt in the hand in general player 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.799
 all player player 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.989
 and let's move from interesting to not 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.629
 interesting boxes well here 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.890
 Naturally this is this greeting 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.680
 flat with stickers so small 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.230
 quick start guide 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:38.609
 of how the earpods come in and 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:43.920
 now we will get them in such a box 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:47.760
 cardboard somehow so they look or 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.209
 important important important functions of the body on 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.430
 lightning 30 pin connector 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.819
 apple connector has been in use since 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.450
 create ipod 1 that is about ten 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.819
 years and new 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.150
 lightning connector which is used 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.510
 recently when iphone was presented 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.329
 five 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.730
 Well, appreciate how much lightning connector 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.599
 small he is very small i used to be 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.709
 thought well yes he is small to small but 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:23.889
 when picked up he even seemed to me 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.940
 less than he imagined naturally 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.919
 two-sided by contrast in general 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.370
 already it is necessary to discard it in general 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.479
 shit 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.229
 and this despite its size is excellent 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:40.569
 performs all its functions and purpose 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:44.019
 if we talk about the differences and the old to 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:46.780
 the sixth generation here have 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.299
 bluetooth right here it is 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.609
 natural spot 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.639
 screen increased 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.359
 here are these here are pretty little icons 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.299
 home button 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:03.370
 he became thinner and one of the drawbacks 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:06.080
 is this what he is now without a clip 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.060
 it can not be attached to 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.840
 fit while running but also 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.570
 in general when you want but still he 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.640
 much better than 6th generation ipod nano 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.070
 and no wonder 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.019
 the screen here is 16 by 9 we can 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.700
 view the video although I donâ€™t know how 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.440
 you need to be a man to look at 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.290
 on millions and blockbuster for 2 with 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.570
 half inch display with somehow not 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.880
 very good resolution but it must be 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.690
 basically the video here is not looking at 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.450
 clips 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.210
 that is, respectively for music in 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.120
 basically the whole thing and the podcasts 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.610
 Naturally here, too, there is a new ipod 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.420
 nano produces therefore the technical process 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.250
 as iphone 5 here these edges are visible 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.260
 experience the nobility of iphone 5 with your 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.360
 new my old subjects all 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:58.130
 edge in two hours if you sum up 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.900
 so I saw buy go and on the night of the seventh 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.610
 generations then of course you can say 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.470
 that this is a very very cool device 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.930
 that is, if you haven't been giving live at 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.080
 darn laziness it certainly can take 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.700
 and if there is, in principle, not necessarily 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.680
 that's all with you i was brilliant 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.990
 moth subscribe to the channel 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.500
 Like and goodbye soon 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.500
 I'll see you
