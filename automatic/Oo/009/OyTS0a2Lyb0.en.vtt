pressure boa constrictors can grow up to
13<00:01:35.410> feet<00:01:35.440> long<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:36.220> be<00:01:36.430> well<00:01:36.700> over<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:37.000> hundred

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
13 feet long and be well over a hundred

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.090 
13 feet long and be well over a hundred
pounds<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:37.990> combine<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.680> last<00:01:38.890> two

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
pounds so you combine the last two

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.130 
pounds so you combine the last two
