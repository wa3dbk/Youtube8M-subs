00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
middle let's go as I said whole point of

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.250 
middle let's go as I said whole point of
this<00:01:36.970> is<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.240> build<00:01:37.479> structures<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:41.020> does

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
this is to build structures and it does

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.190 
this is to build structures and it does
actually<00:01:42.600> remember<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.630> structures<00:01:44.080> that

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
actually remember the structures that

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.630 
actually remember the structures that
you've<00:01:44.350> made<00:01:44.500> already<00:01:44.650> know<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.070> can<00:01:45.220> pinch

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
you've made already know you can pinch

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.660 
you've made already know you can pinch
to<00:01:45.820> zoom<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:47.500> two<00:01:47.740> things<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.189> scroll<00:01:48.549> around

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
to zoom use two things to scroll around

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.330 
to zoom use two things to scroll around
and<00:01:49.540> basically<00:01:49.869> you<00:01:50.409> have<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.770> box<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.070> monkeys

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
and basically you have a box of monkeys

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.660 
and basically you have a box of monkeys
as<00:01:52.229> sure<00:01:53.229> now<00:01:53.259> oh<00:01:53.710> gosh<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:56.220> have<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.369> get

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
as sure now oh gosh and you have to get

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.929 
as sure now oh gosh and you have to get
them<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.119> end<00:01:58.390> where<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.780> little<00:01:58.930> there

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
them to the end where that little there

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.789 
them to the end where that little there
whatever<00:02:00.939> that<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.329> and<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:03.070> can<00:02:03.119> use<00:02:04.119> this<00:02:04.329> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
whatever that is and you can use this to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.380 
whatever that is and you can use this to
basically<00:02:05.799> make<00:02:06.130> structures<00:02:06.909> out<00:02:07.150> of

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
basically make structures out of

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.830 
basically make structures out of
coconuts<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:08.100> bamboo<00:02:09.269> to<00:02:10.269> help<00:02:10.390> them<00:02:10.540> get<00:02:10.720> to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
coconuts and bamboo to help them get to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.789 
coconuts and bamboo to help them get to
the<00:02:10.929> other<00:02:11.019> side<00:02:11.200> now<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.590> does<00:02:11.709> actually

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
the other side now it does actually

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.490 
the other side now it does actually
remember<00:02:12.400> what<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.329> build<00:02:13.600> from<00:02:14.079> last<00:02:14.320> time

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
remember what you build from last time

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.190 
remember what you build from last time
so<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:16.030> don't<00:02:16.630> actually<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.989> build

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
so I don't actually have to build

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.240 
so I don't actually have to build
anything<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.560> show<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.739> this<00:02:17.860> which<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.100> quite

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
anything to show you this which is quite

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
fun so you press that button and they'll

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
go let's see what side note they have to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.800 
go let's see what side note they have to
get<00:02:26.190> bananas<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:27.310> they<00:02:27.430> go<00:02:27.610> along<00:02:27.720> well<00:02:28.720> they

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
get them towards the end but so if they

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.240 
get them towards the end but so if they
get<00:02:34.060> their<00:02:34.209> bananas<00:02:34.630> as<00:02:34.780> well<00:02:35.110> then<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.100> get

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
get their bananas as well then you get

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.840 
get their bananas as well then you get
extra<00:02:36.519> points

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.000 

so<00:02:39.480> they<00:02:39.690> are<00:02:39.840> all<00:02:40.020> happy<00:02:40.380> perfect<00:02:42.710> level<00:02:43.710> past

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
and I've got a gold space yay so and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.920 
and I've got a gold space yay so and
that's<00:02:49.410> that's<00:02:49.590> pretty<00:02:49.770> much<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.160> that's<00:02:50.930> what

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
that's that's pretty much it that's what

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.110 
that's that's pretty much it that's what
you<00:02:52.020> do<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.170> varying<00:02:52.590> degrees<00:02:52.790> each<00:02:53.790> one<00:02:54.090> of

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
you do to varying degrees each one of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.920 
you do to varying degrees each one of
these<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:55.320> does<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.620> hard<00:02:55.830> as<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.070> go<00:02:56.190> along

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
these it does get hard as you go along

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.000 
these it does get hard as you go along
do<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.050> swing<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:01.230> things<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.680> make

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
do you swing the things that you make

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.150 
do you swing the things that you make
can<00:03:02.400> be<00:03:02.970> as<00:03:03.210> elaborate<00:03:03.600> or<00:03:03.950> simple<00:03:04.950> as<00:03:05.040> you

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
can be as elaborate or simple as you

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.980 
can be as elaborate or simple as you
like<00:03:05.310> but<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.730> do<00:03:05.940> only<00:03:06.210> have<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.720> limited

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
like but you do only have a limited

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.870 
like but you do only have a limited
number<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:08.630> bamboo<00:03:09.630> sticks<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.770> building<00:03:11.250> to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
number of bamboo sticks but building to

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.190 
number of bamboo sticks but building to
simply<00:03:12.150> for<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.360> sake<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.570> actually<00:03:12.870> showing

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.410 
currently using the saw tool which will
just<00:03:19.500> remove<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.660> bamboo<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:24.360> you

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
play but well build by tapping and it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.150 
play but well build by tapping and it
will<00:03:29.400> show<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:30.290> blue<00:03:31.290> line<00:03:31.530> as<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.890> where<00:03:32.040> it

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
will show you a blue line as to where it

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:42.190 
will show you a blue line as to where it
could<00:03:32.280> be<00:03:32.310> somes<00:03:32.940> compose<00:03:33.450> there<00:03:39.200> yeah<00:03:40.200> it's

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
could be somes compose there yeah it's

what else can i do i'll put up there I
don't<00:03:47.700> know<00:03:47.820> see<00:03:48.480> tapping<00:03:48.780> on<00:03:48.870> them<00:03:49.020> will

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
don't know see tapping on them will

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.290 
don't know see tapping on them will
actually<00:03:49.410> remove<00:03:49.830> them<00:03:50.220> too<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.090> if<00:03:51.180> you

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
actually remove them too so if you

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.000 
actually remove them too so if you
didn't<00:03:51.960> want<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.230> one<00:03:52.440> there<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:55.440> let's<00:03:55.740> see

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
didn't want that one there so let's see

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.400 
didn't want that one there so let's see
now<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:57.180> does<00:03:57.390> have<00:03:57.540> various<00:03:57.840> other<00:03:57.930> elements

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
now it does have various other elements

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.360 
now it does have various other elements
like<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:59.010> bit<00:03:59.340> there<00:03:59.630> and<00:04:00.630> there<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:02.280> will

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
like that bit there and there it will

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.160 
like that bit there and there it will
actually<00:04:02.550> swing<00:04:03.150> around<00:04:03.300> those<00:04:03.570> points<00:04:03.930> and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
actually swing around those points and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.890 
actually swing around those points and
also<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:05.250> metal<00:04:05.850> logging<00:04:06.150> ones<00:04:06.330> are<00:04:06.570> metal

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
also the metal logging ones are metal

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.830 
also the metal logging ones are metal
and<00:04:07.050> will<00:04:07.230> not<00:04:07.380> break<00:04:07.590> whereas<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:09.180> bamboo

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
and will not break whereas the bamboo

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.099 
and will not break whereas the bamboo
will<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:11.790> let's<00:04:12.450> see<00:04:13.050> what<00:04:13.200> happens<00:04:13.500> action

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
will so let's see what happens action

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.750 
will so let's see what happens action
will<00:04:16.109> they<00:04:16.260> actually<00:04:16.350> make<00:04:16.770> it<00:04:16.859> across<00:04:17.130> or

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
will they actually make it across or

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.580 
will they actually make it across or
will<00:04:18.270> have<00:04:18.540> one<00:04:18.840> tiny<00:04:19.140> piece<00:04:19.350> in<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.560> middle

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
will have one tiny piece in the middle

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.210 
will have one tiny piece in the middle
break<00:04:20.390> let's<00:04:21.390> hope<00:04:21.540> not<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:22.020> want<00:04:22.950> them<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.130> get

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
oh i just clicked on action by accident

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.520 
oh i just clicked on action by accident
so<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:16.240> is<00:05:16.330> what<00:05:16.449> happens<00:05:16.750> when<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:17.289> don't

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
so this is what happens when you don't

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.050 
so this is what happens when you don't
actually<00:05:17.680> build<00:05:17.979> then<00:05:18.099> I<00:05:18.129> think<00:05:18.370> they<00:05:18.610> they

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
actually build then I think they they

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.610 
actually build then I think they they
can't<00:05:19.300> go<00:05:19.479> anywhere<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:22.229> split<00:05:23.229> up<00:05:23.319> setting

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
can't go anywhere and split up setting

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.589 
can't go anywhere and split up setting
for<00:05:23.770> them<00:05:23.919> as<00:05:24.069> you<00:05:24.219> can<00:05:24.310> imagine<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:24.789> they

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
for them as you can imagine and they

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:31.080 
for them as you can imagine and they
don't<00:05:25.750> seem<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.289> happy<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:30.520> nothing

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
don't seem to you happy and and nothing

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.469 
don't seem to you happy and and nothing
happens<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.569> they<00:05:31.719> just<00:05:32.819> hang<00:05:33.819> there<00:05:34.000> sadly

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
happens and they just hang there sadly

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.170 
happens and they just hang there sadly
but<00:05:34.719> Google<00:05:34.990> look<00:05:35.349> at<00:05:35.440> their<00:05:35.560> sad<00:05:35.710> faces

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
but Google look at their sad faces

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.680 
but Google look at their sad faces
mm-hmm<00:05:37.590> anyway<00:05:38.590> I'm<00:05:38.949> gonna<00:05:39.219> try<00:05:39.400> again<00:05:39.690> and

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
mm-hmm anyway I'm gonna try again and

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.059 
mm-hmm anyway I'm gonna try again and
see<00:05:40.900> if<00:05:40.930> I<00:05:41.050> can<00:05:41.169> actually<00:05:41.500> do<00:05:42.009> this<00:05:42.539> so<00:05:44.069> let's

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
see if I can actually do this so let's

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.689 
see if I can actually do this so let's
build<00:05:45.580> I'm<00:05:46.029> going<00:05:46.479> to<00:05:46.539> put<00:05:46.690> out<00:05:46.750> there<00:05:47.580> cuz<00:05:48.580> of

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
build I'm going to put out there cuz of

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.510 
build I'm going to put out there cuz of
course<00:05:48.969> triangles<00:05:49.779> on<00:05:50.199> the<00:05:50.500> strongest<00:05:51.130> shapes

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
course triangles on the strongest shapes

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.820 
course triangles on the strongest shapes
available<00:05:53.219> let's<00:05:54.219> see<00:05:54.969> if<00:05:55.210> I<00:05:55.330> can<00:05:55.590> make<00:05:56.590> them

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
available let's see if I can make them

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:04.769 
available let's see if I can make them
get<00:05:57.699> down<00:05:57.969> there<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.750> determine<00:05:59.380> a<00:06:03.539> while<00:06:04.539> back

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:04.779 
get down there to determine a while back

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:08.760 
get down there to determine a while back
at<00:06:05.110> University<00:06:05.770> we<00:06:06.219> had<00:06:06.430> to<00:06:06.610> make<00:06:06.819> bridges<00:06:07.770> out

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
at University we had to make bridges out

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.939 
at University we had to make bridges out
of<00:06:09.039> nothing<00:06:10.000> but<00:06:10.210> spaghetti<00:06:10.930> and<00:06:11.759> super<00:06:12.759> glue
