00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 halli hello and welcome soft 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.589
 fiftieth follow 13 before and yes 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.540
 today the 50 follow nothing special 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.179
 actually the 50 follow for that we are 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.889
 yes, it's a big one 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.750
 break was at the red-blue Germany 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.359
 the second video the right yesterday 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.100
 Yesterday it was spoken that day 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.750
 again two videos are not 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.430
 be surprised that there are today 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.859
 if that does not get it yesterday 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 I should have that in the cellar 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.769
 I should have said exactly 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.199
 look at both if you are always on the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.730
 Anyway, the latest stand wanted to be 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.340
 of course plays again today 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.260
 our food and as far as I am concerned 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 remember likely that here the first round 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.480
 the cup after we in last one 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.930
 quite simply won final 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.680
 with the 80 or 90 or something on the 3 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.120
 I do not remember exactly and because of that 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.829
 yes, that's worth the first round 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 are still no lust cap on 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.270
 siemens me much a propaganda 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.010
 is just too good ran as why 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.030
 Should I play something else then ? 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.470
 and yes he gives mega monster chances 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 these pages injured just missed 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.390
 ekici had us in the lead but 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.619
 then it's the first time in the country 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.090
 distin and meadow in the gate in addition also 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.000
 the second corner is reasonably dangerous 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.880
 again it is because but clearly 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.650
 first, but then we have the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.740
 next chance for this nice pass 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.000
 from shaqiri to the image as active 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.290
 ever get out and suggest that he 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.390
 will do it again here comes naturally 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.220
 the flank and shaqiri with one 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.770
 pretty weird pretty pretty 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.829
 Strange header with start and then 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.259
 there we are even the thing is 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.820
 in it and we have 2 0 against 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.490
 Surprisingly natural again april lays 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.640
 feeling like he did then 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.370
 at that time in the long-long countries 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.570
 which one was sometime and now 13 0 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.380
 through kyle richards and we have it 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.770
 decides cheers I do not play 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.390
 This will be a bit more 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.720
 weird and that's why we win that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.910
 first game after 45 minutes with 13 0 and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.080
 pull back into the quarterfinals 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.330
 on 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.300
 and that will of course be the next game 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.290
 that you will see then as soon as possible 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.170
 you finally the connection 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.790
 is somehow canceled player of the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.489
 day 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.320
 13:05 103 min shot and then it works 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.970
 actually already continue directly 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.220
 I'll give you that for a second 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.080
 now also the semi-final all 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.090
 very professional to show what I am 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.519
 stop everything now and after that 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.560
 ultimate team is loading yes 320 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.910
 next round semifinal we take 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.830
 which team do we take, I believe 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.160
 again our first team exactly and com 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.510
 this 4121 la league team did not go 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.600
 front tiguan and di maria lay the day 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.660
 and then something with costa stops again 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.000
 ride mostly and in any case 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.620
 that was a game that was clear 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.900
 was more difficult than the other I mean 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.060
 had not been small for the person personally 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.040
 too dangerous strikers they her 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.320
 we can say who is for you the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.140
 strongest old people agree with him than will 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.060
 Interested where he believes so I went 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.070
 not against the game when I see it 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.760
 at first tired because I already am 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.709
 I lost 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.290
 Let's take for example now for 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.540
 me it will be more time I would 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.910
 say someone like balotelli 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.709
 Balotelli is really mostly 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.810
 Shoot from where you want and he leaves 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.630
 pure and he sits down is tall it 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.860
 relatively fast balotelli I would up 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.410
 definitely be then definitely still 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.840
 It is hardly possible to stop it either 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.750
 Hard to stop the two of them have to 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.670
 so I do not play one 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.420
 favorites of moderately that 's davis are 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.220
 the two over par to storm in the game 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.430
 what you think it is 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.120
 and yes , I'm here 220 I have 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.630
 have shown the second gate by me 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.060
 or not 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.230
 or higuaín but ultimately one thing 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.580
 better that he is not bad 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.590
 striker is and marks the 2 261 in 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.060
 this moment 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.069
 also slightly undeserved but she should 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.019
 then he will be much better and better 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.360
 the game was pretty balanced that way 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.610
 that we took a long time to 73 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.440
 minutes to be exact for the next one 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.729
 chance this gets a gündogan and 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.729
 watch out now, etc 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:30.210
 yes I would say yes very close to me 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.930
 would say a gigantic factory 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.640
 goalkeeper error no a huge mistake 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.020
 of course at the tempo I would be 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.130
 remains may lie with the manager 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.230
 but no matter 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.540
 Place two was in the lead and everyone has 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.670
 at the chance the whole here already 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.310
 finish directly and do not succeed 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.980
 but to get past Diego Lopez offices 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.840
 90 minutes to cash in again 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.120
 she in richards who prevails 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.550
 beautiful climber nice shot but 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.400
 but slightly over it and so the end 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.680
 then 32 at the end and we 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.830
 do not pull very loose fuzzy 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.430
 really one in the next round 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.220
 on 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.170
 and with that we stand next episode in 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.150
 semifinals and whether we have the title to 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.650
 second time in a row can win that 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.510
 valve is unfortunately in the next 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.230
 episodes drive the video like hunt 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.180
 supervised 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.650
 that's gonna be a rating 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.260
 I hope and will be today 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.610
 Of course, we also look forward to it 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.290
 if you would subscribe then 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.730
 course always up to date 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.860
 stood walls again a new video 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.960
 comes and yes if it is otherwise 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.250
 anything that's not often gives the 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.760
 next video again i want to say 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.760
 would have
