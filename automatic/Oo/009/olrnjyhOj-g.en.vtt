00:00:01.073 --> 00:00:07.373
Many alternative medicine treatments have great success even though they lack documentation and the price is high

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:12.174
So how difficult can it be to succeed with an alternative treatment?

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:14.924
And how does money affect the experience of it?

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.380
Camilla (Actor), do you have any experience as a practitioner?

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.530
No, I don't

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.280
Ok, but you've received a white coat?

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.030
Yes, I have

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.980
Great, I've prepared an alternative treatment and some patients, so now you're set to go

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.730
Half of the patients coming, does it voluntarily to test out a new alternative treatment

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.880
While the other half receives money from us for participating

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.630
It will be exciting to see who's most satisfied afterwards

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.199
We have invited 6 people who have ailments in their back or neck

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.149
We check for pain, stiffness and stress before the treatment

00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:52.349
So we can see if there has been any improvements afterward

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:55.504
I have developed the treatment all by myself

00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:57.906
It took me half an hour or so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.360
What you need is: loff, and tea. Green tea, of course.

00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:10.286
Voila, a piece of alternative treatment

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:20.099
We now have a new mix that has come from Chinese medicine, actually

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:22.663
from the grass plant triticum (wheat)

00:01:22.913 --> 00:01:30.513
Which has been fermented and later heated up to enhance the properties of this grass plant

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:34.463
So now I'll just apply this here in the areas where you are stiff

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:37.963
and then you can lie with this on for about 15 minutes

00:01:53.449 --> 00:02:00.449
After 15 minutes we take off the treatment and ask what they think now

00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:06.491
There was a temperatur change that happened because the cream was very hot

00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:12.941
And I felt it began to alleviate and that it was working on the body

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.859
So I became more relaxed

00:02:17.443 --> 00:02:24.443
I've only tried, like, frienly massage, and I must say she really knows what she's doing in comparison

00:02:25.093 --> 00:02:28.993
So the proficiency was very important, I understand why people would pay for it

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:39.981
Before I came here I had pains in my neck, I was stiff. This cream worked, actually, I have become less stiff.

00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:45.331
I think this treatment was incredibly good, it was really relaxing

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.570
I would recommend this treatment to both friends and family

00:02:49.807 --> 00:02:56.007
I think that ordinary treatment from a physiotherapists is much better

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.070
than what I experienced now

00:02:58.382 --> 00:03:05.882
They work more with the body. I would not pay for this treatment, at all

00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:09.612
This is the discomfort the patients had when they came

00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:15.897
The group who was paid to come reported visible improvements after being treated with some wet loff

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.840
But what about those that came voluntarily?

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:24.159
For them, the treatment was much more effective. Both stress, stiffness and pain was significantly reduced

00:03:25.653 --> 00:03:31.153
Now I can recommend this to my friends, because now I've actually tried it, and, it's recommended

00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:36.306
Jan Ole is a psychologist

00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:41.901
He knows a lot about human behaviour and why our brains sometimes makes irrational decisions

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.246
Ok, Jan Ole, what do you think about this?

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.869
The first thing that comes to my mind is that your treatment is fantastic

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:55.519
It's probably a good business idea, you get low costs and very satisfied customers

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.610
It indicates that it's not hard to invent an alternative treatment that succeeds, but why do you think this works so well?

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.860
Well this is just as expected, a placebo effect that happens for all treatments

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:15.586
I'm a little interested in the difference between the two groups, because those that were paid were relatively pleased about it

00:04:15.636 --> 00:04:18.636
But those that received this for free were much more happy about it

00:04:18.756 --> 00:04:26.656
That is a result of the funniest psychological phenomenon I'm aware of, it is called cognitive dissonance

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.580
It's that our brain automatically tries to justify our actions

00:04:32.715 --> 00:04:36.715
or in this case, the time that the participants have invested

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.640
Those who received money, they have already recieved a return for their investment

00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:52.533
But those that did it for free had to somehow justify that for themselves, and decides that the treatment worked

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:55.283
Ok, but does this apply to only certain treatments?

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:01.449
No, this applies to all situations and it happens all the time

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:09.999
For example, if you buy a car, it becomes important for you to justify why you've spent so much money on that car

00:05:10.191 --> 00:05:17.291
It is important to remember though, that our little experiment says nothing about whether alternative treatment works or not

00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:27.031
But it shows that an alternative treatment can be both polular and sell well without having any effect
