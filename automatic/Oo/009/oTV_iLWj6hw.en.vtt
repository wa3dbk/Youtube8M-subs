except<00:00:21.659> minus<00:00:22.349> the<00:00:22.529> noodles<00:00:23.009> so<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.730> going

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:23.819 
except minus the noodles so it's going

just deliciousness and I think this

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.469 
just deliciousness and I think this
would<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.249> a<00:00:29.339> good<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.699> either<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.210> is

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:30.479 
would be a good one to either have is

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.240 
would be a good one to either have is
like<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> your<00:00:31.109> main<00:00:31.349> entree<00:00:31.890> wasn't<00:00:32.160> like

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
