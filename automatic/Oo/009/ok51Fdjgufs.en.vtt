LA I remember coming in with makeup and
a<00:00:42.300> tan<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.230> unnecessary<00:00:43.530> because

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
a tan and it was so unnecessary because

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.930 
a tan and it was so unnecessary because
they<00:00:44.610> ripped<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.270> all<00:00:45.600> off<00:00:45.900> and<00:00:46.290> then<00:00:46.860> put<00:00:47.670> each

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
they ripped it all off and then put each

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.229
