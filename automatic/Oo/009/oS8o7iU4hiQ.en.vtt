00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.210
 welcome dear well what are you today 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.770
 we're talking about acoustics again and 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 up again from djebel 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.059
 but this time not bluetooth hydrochloric not 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.969
 portable and stationary computer 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.340
 called on jabel pebbles and gives out 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.080
 quite an interesting sound what is in it 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.510
 so interesting we are with you today and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.119
 we understand this went 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.619
 the speaker system consists of two 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.060
 practically independent of each other 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.189
 elements well, it's clear that they are 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.790
 cabled but nevertheless they can 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.690
 pull apart the right channel 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.309
 presents 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.910
 Well, like the left, in general, here is such 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.140
 interesting little thing but a wheel 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.239
 Wait sawn lower part and stand 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.950
 front of the inscription death and under the lattice 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.190
 there is a small LED 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.309
 showing that something is working on 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.210
 back side we have a phase inverter output 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.579
 and the connector is already 2 left 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.080
 channel 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.790
 on the side there is such a button 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.520
 snapping quite loudly it allows 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.189
 adjust the volume in the system and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.830
 she has endless scrolling right and 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.540
 to the left but it is generally convenient for you 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.490
 you need to somehow be configured that is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.340
 set included pressed the button and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 forward with songs spin 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.570
 on the opposite side we only have 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.759
 rubber ring designer bottom 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.210
 stand where is wound and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.310
 embedded conventional connector yusb if 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.250
 want to connect something standard with 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.799
 plug three and a half jack please 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.030
 here's a line input take an external cable 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.670
 before you have to buy it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.290
 and go ahead with the song left channel as i'm already 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.090
 spoke not much different here 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.180
 instead of the knob button just 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.119
 otherwise plastic plug 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.829
 same thing and at the end he has 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.689
 such is the connector that is inserted into 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.689
 the board I showed you 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
 birch bark 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.530
 business 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.530
 dancing 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.099
 Well dear, let's sum 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.739
 totals 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.390
 we have a device worth 3000 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.970
 rubles but here at the time of the review in 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.129
 Petersburg, you can go to 3000 and buy 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.829
 what you get is an interesting device 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.079
 in appearance she is very good 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.090
 collected for quality no claims 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.190
 no there is an interesting solution with 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.650
 volume control and right there button 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.750
 turn on off and you get in 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.940
 principle, then quite a good sound 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.459
 also certainly expected more of this 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.560
 more wadded bass some failed 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.409
 the middle here and the middle is raised and 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.359
 you are so more accented yes 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.120
 Understandable thing in super-duper deep 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.519
 such a sub bass he will not climb him there 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.579
 nothing more than to climb but nevertheless you get 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.260
 In principle, quite a good sound 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.870
 if you do not carp especially for quality 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.790
 3000 I think very, very decent and 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.160
 The decision I would imagine for example 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.319
 put around the computer and listen to music 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.569
 when something makes me quite 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.190
 I am satisfied that it is the first jack 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.410
 Burke and that I treat like this 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.720
 very good and definitely recommend 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.940
 look and buy if possible 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.980
 such a conclusion today all respected on 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.579
 today all i say goodbye to you but 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.010
 briefly 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.010
 for soon there will be new reviews for now
