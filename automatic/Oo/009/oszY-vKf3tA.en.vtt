00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
way or else it will not work now you're

00:02:23.790 --> 00:03:01.250 
way or else it will not work now you're
going<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.209> go<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:56.030> this<00:02:58.250> now<00:03:00.260> run

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
going to want to go like this now run

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.190 
going to want to go like this now run
get<00:03:01.440> your<00:03:01.560> wrench<00:03:01.739> down<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.780> hope<00:03:03.780> these<00:03:03.930> ones

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
get your wrench down and hope these ones

like<00:03:18.159> so<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:21.040> looks<00:03:21.250> like<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:22.769> now<00:03:29.519> you

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
like so it looks like that now you

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.420 
like so it looks like that now you
should<00:03:30.730> probably<00:03:31.260> follow<00:03:32.260> my<00:03:32.650> bit<00:03:32.890> first

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
should probably follow my bit first

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.339 
should probably follow my bit first
once<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.940> know<00:03:34.030> how<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.209> do<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.599> you<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:35.049> make

once you know how to do it you can make

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.940 
once you know how to do it you can make
the<00:03:35.650> other<00:03:35.799> ones<00:03:36.040> but<00:03:36.569> now<00:03:37.569> we're<00:03:37.840> just<00:03:37.959> gonna

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.100 

make<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.010> redstone<00:03:42.430> line<00:03:44.040> into<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.159> middle<00:03:46.110> put

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
make a redstone line into the middle put

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.910 
make a redstone line into the middle put
a<00:03:47.140> block<00:03:47.349> here<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:49.079> see<00:03:50.079> if<00:03:50.230> they<00:03:50.440> work<00:03:50.709> now

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
a block here and see if they work now

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.000 
a block here and see if they work now
you<00:03:51.879> have<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.269> join<00:03:52.690> your<00:03:52.870> redstone<00:03:53.290> on<00:03:53.650> one<00:03:53.980> of

these if you put your redstone on this
side<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.209> won't<00:03:58.329> work<00:03:58.569> because<00:03:58.930> there's

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
side it won't work because there's

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.530 
side it won't work because there's
nothing<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.459> join<00:04:00.609> to<00:04:00.819> this<00:04:00.910> that<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.180> didn't

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540
