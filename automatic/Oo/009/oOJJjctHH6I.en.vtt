I<00:00:25.039> just<00:00:26.039> think<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.279> right<00:00:26.430> time<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.910> think

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
I just think it's the right time I think

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.529 
I just think it's the right time I think
you<00:00:28.740> know<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.670> disappointed<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.240> with

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you know I was disappointed with with

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.080 
you know I was disappointed with with
the<00:00:30.630> performance<00:00:31.080> last<00:00:31.289> weekend<00:00:32.090> obviously

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the performance last weekend obviously

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.520 
the performance last weekend obviously
at<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.210> point<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> result<00:00:33.930> midweek<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
at this point with a result midweek and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530 
at this point with a result midweek and
I<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:35.610> think<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.850> right<00:00:35.910> time<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.360> think

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
I just think it's the right time I think

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.229 
I just think it's the right time I think
it's<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.469> club<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.640> squad<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it's that the club the squad is in a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.240 
it's that the club the squad is in a
good<00:00:39.390> position<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.170> know<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.100> said

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
good position it's you know like I said

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.740 
good position it's you know like I said
we're<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.670> too<00:00:41.820> far<00:00:41.850> off<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.180> top<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> tag

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
we're not too far off the top of the tag

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.790 
we're not too far off the top of the tag
we're<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:42.989> too<00:00:43.079> far<00:00:43.110> off<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.410> other<00:00:43.649> end<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
we're not too far off the other end of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.830 
we're not too far off the other end of
an<00:00:43.920> ADA<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.489> think<00:00:45.149> there's<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.660> lot<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
an ADA but I think there's a lot of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.130 
an ADA but I think there's a lot of
positives<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> little<00:00:46.500> Oban<00:00:47.300> I<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
positives to it little Oban I think you

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
positives to it little Oban I think you
know<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.469> take<00:00:49.680> myself<00:00:50.039> every<00:00:50.460> equation<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
know if I take myself every equation is

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.279 
know if I take myself every equation is
probably<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> lot<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.360> negativity<00:00:51.690> towards<00:00:52.170> me

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
probably a lot of negativity towards me

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.750 
probably a lot of negativity towards me
out<00:00:52.469> there<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> moment<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
out there at the moment so I think it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.029 
out there at the moment so I think it
the<00:00:53.940> benefit<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> me<00:00:54.930> stepping<00:00:55.559> aside<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the benefit of me stepping aside and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.410 
the benefit of me stepping aside and
hopefully<00:00:56.550> someone<00:00:56.820> else<00:00:56.940> coming<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.270> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
hopefully someone else coming in and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.060 
hopefully someone else coming in and
pushing<00:00:57.539> around<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.020> huge

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
pushing around is huge

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.790 
pushing around is huge
a<00:00:59.100> mass<00:00:59.969> decision<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.600> conflicts<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.649> been

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
a mass decision of conflicts it's been

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.049 
a mass decision of conflicts it's been
very<00:01:02.070> difficult<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:02.940> I've

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
very difficult you know because I've

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.820

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
there's a real good feeling about the
place<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.490> moment<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:45.149> relation<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
place at the moment in relation to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.149 
place at the moment in relation to
walking<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.049> winning<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> club<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
walking with winning the club the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.700 
walking with winning the club the
training<00:01:47.490> ground<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.240> ground<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.290> staff<00:01:49.530> we

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
training ground the ground the staff we

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.020 
training ground the ground the staff we
have<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.040> players<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.729> think<00:01:50.790> it's

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
have the players we have I think it's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
have the players we have I think it's
it's<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.049> cool<00:01:52.200> place<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.439> walk<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it's it's it's a cool place to walk and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.800 
it's it's it's a cool place to walk and
I'm<00:01:53.009> I'm<00:01:53.579> hoping<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.119> someone<00:01:54.329> comes<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
I'm I'm hoping that someone comes in and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
I'm I'm hoping that someone comes in and
gets<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> feel<00:01:55.439> good<00:01:55.619> factor<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.280> kicks<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
gets the feel good factor and kicks it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.179 
gets the feel good factor and kicks it
on<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:58.380> last<00:01:58.560> thing<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.770> want<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.040> was

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
on and the last thing I want to do was

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.980 
on and the last thing I want to do was
leave<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.909> position<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.570> found<00:02:00.719> in

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
leave it in a position that we found in

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.240 
leave it in a position that we found in
to<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.409> honest<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:01.950> we're<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
to be honest and I think we're in a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.740 
to be honest and I think we're in a
really<00:02:02.280> good<00:02:02.549> position<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.600> can

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
really good position now that it can

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.380 
really good position now that it can
move<00:02:03.960> forward<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.979> reviewing<00:02:05.340> your<00:02:06.030> time<00:02:06.210> he

obviously progress was made when you you

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.309 
obviously progress was made when you you
joined<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.119> see<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.300> team<00:02:09.569> was<00:02:09.690> involved<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.289> a

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
top six place to cut finals how

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.360 
top six place to cut finals how
frustrating<00:02:16.080> was<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:17.160> big

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
frustrating was it like that the big

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
frustrating was it like that the big
games<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.690> didn't<00:02:19.110> click<00:02:19.349> into

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
games it just it just didn't click into

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.350 
games it just it just didn't click into
place<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.550> cut<00:02:20.790> finals<00:02:21.209> in

place for that the to cut finals in

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.630 
place for that the to cut finals in
Europe<00:02:21.900> yeah<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.440> think<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:23.010> we're<00:02:23.370> looking<00:02:23.550> at

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
Europe yeah I think if we're looking at

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.979 
Europe yeah I think if we're looking at
the<00:02:23.730> bigger<00:02:23.940> games<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.390> probably<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> tail

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
the bigger games it's probably the tail

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.600 
the bigger games it's probably the tail
we<00:02:25.140> warned<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:26.130> mattered<00:02:26.459> where

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
we warned that really mattered where

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280 
we warned that really mattered where
we're<00:02:26.970> probably<00:02:27.390> don't<00:02:27.540> fair<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.930> inherits

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
we're probably don't fair and inherits

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.440 
we're probably don't fair and inherits
in<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.470> cup<00:02:28.620> last<00:02:28.860> year<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.640> two<00:02:29.790> corners<00:02:30.330> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
in the cup last year the two corners and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.280 
in the cup last year the two corners and
the<00:02:30.540> European<00:02:30.900> games<00:02:31.019> were<00:02:31.230> very

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the European games were very

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.040 
the European games were very
disappointing

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
disappointing

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.870 
disappointing
but<00:02:34.050> that's<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.680> as<00:02:35.400> far<00:02:35.580> as<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.730> get

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
but that's you have as far as you get

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.759 
but that's you have as far as you get
results<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.810> know<00:02:36.930> whatever<00:02:37.380> club<00:02:37.590> your

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
some hard memories as well but that's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.559 
some hard memories as well but that's
part<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.250> parcel<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.700> game<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.970> think<00:02:48.000> just

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
part and parcel of the game I think just

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.170 
part and parcel of the game I think just
how<00:02:48.690> challenging<00:02:48.930> was<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.519> dark<00:02:50.790> times

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
this there is a lot of positives but

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.320 
this there is a lot of positives but
