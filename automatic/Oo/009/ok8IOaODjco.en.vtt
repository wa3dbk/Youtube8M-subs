00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
who not well no it was supposed to be

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.140 
who not well no it was supposed to be
something<00:04:27.410> completely<00:04:27.500> different<00:04:27.970> like<00:04:28.970> my

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
something completely different like my

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.000 
something completely different like my
vision<00:04:29.840> for<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:30.080> was<00:04:30.169> completely<00:04:30.650> different
