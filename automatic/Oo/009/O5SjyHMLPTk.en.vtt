00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.530
 today we are going to prepare the recipe for 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.240
 tamales in the style of vegas in Cuba and 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.339
 the hand of 1000 álvarez 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.349
 first of all we need a mass that 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:15.840
 we have already made with water and flour 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:18.660
 of corn two types chili and hot pepper 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.320
 culantro and ajo porro 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:28.130
 a chicken broth pill oil 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.130
 of course cumin garlic and onion 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.860
 for the filling we will use two types 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.690
 of hot dog meat and meat 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.840
 pork that we chop we have the following 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.840
 way 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.030
 With the help of a mortar we will go 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.370
 making a descent with all the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.120
 ingredients first crush 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.120
 garlic and onion 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.350
 next we will add the culantro and 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.879
 the garlic porro already cut into small 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.879
 pieces to facilitate the work 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.430
 then we will select the hot pepper 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.950
 which is the one that is supposed to give better 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.950
 taste 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.930
 once we have this descent the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.510
 we reserve 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.640
 after so much to deposit in a bowl 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.990
 all the masa for tamales that we had 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.740
 in the refrigerator and that we had 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.520
 prepared the previous day and also the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.100
 cumin grains we crush them for 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.760
 season the sofrito that we will make 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.760
 then 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.140
 first of all we add the oil to the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.189
 paella and we also add the meat of 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.189
 pork to sauté the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.430
 and let it cook 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.000
 and then passed to a 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.420
 quarter of an hour we add the puppy 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.500
 hot 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.500
 that we also cook 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.819
 when it absorbs most of the water 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.760
 we added the flock that we had 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.190
 prepared in advance as well as the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.980
 I thought we had crushed 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.980
 and we just let cook to taste 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.440
 yes 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.769
 finally we add our pill 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.879
 chicken broth to our stew to 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.879
 finish spicing the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.250
 a photo of me chemistry of looks like 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.250
 we are 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.190
 to finish we will add the sofrito to 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.010
 the dough for the tamales 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.650
 with the result after rectifying 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.060
 As we will see, we will elaborate the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.910
 famous tamales de bellas 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.110
 and people need it because it's so easy 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.110
 what a faster sachet 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.090
 but some people put a leaf to see 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.580
 a few more here with four sheets and 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.760
 they sell them there but they do not sell the leaf 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.810
 very small is not that they leave the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.299
 cob with a single turn and they are also 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.220
 very small but go on sale for 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.900
 that they deliberate there when imperious 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.239
 helmet 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.239

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.069

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.730
 inside how are the sheets where 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.730
 they wrap 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.010
 if not 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.590
 it is the last one 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.569

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.910
