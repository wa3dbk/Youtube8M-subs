 to the taste to go seasoning and well let's go 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.150
 to start with the filling we're going here 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.710
 sauté the onion a bit this we go 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.540
 company for the stuffing to go 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.430
 suffering the onion and taking advantage of 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.619
 sea time without filling us stay 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.600
 well well seasoned so I want to 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.910
 that our onions are golden brown 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.190
 slightly golden brown you also have to 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.290
 take to make a sauce too 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.650
 so it is very well seasoned because 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.110
 put a little oil and let's 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.780
 sauté this onion also I do not have it 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.400

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.490
 put in addition a piece of onion to 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.430
 it is browned slightly here in the oil is 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.260
 cause puts the onion also the garlic the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.000
 garlic also I do not have chopped then no 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.800
 it's going to burn as easy as other 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.320
 Sometimes I have a garlic finger , nothing more 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.250
 peeled let's put it to who in the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.370
 pot to go also browning 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.130
 respect and we're also going to add the 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.500
 chili pepper strip poblano everything so that if 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.630
 After suffering a few minutes here can 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.200
 liquefying with the cream so that our 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.690
 salsita was very crude everything as 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.550
 then leave it with the cream 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.489
 the filling we are going to leave a few minutes 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.220
 more here our onion that is that 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.690
 is frying and while this happens we are going to 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.489
 prepare our sauce from our 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.750
 our mix of crepes so is that 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.920
 let's put here in the blender 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.010
 milk 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.500
 let's also put the flour 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.379
 all complete the whole blender is super 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.410
 everything goes together let's put the 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.060
 eggs 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.489
 a little piece of 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.250
 already with this we have the mass of 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.260
 crepes to go preparing the crepes and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.270
 all we need is no 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.610
 special part just a good 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.380
 frying pan that has Teflon or has a 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.220
 good non-stick and with that we're going to 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.709
 to be our crepes 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.170
 wonderfully well how are we not going to 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.390
 move a little here so that we do not get 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.250
 go to burn let's leave other 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.490
 little minutes here on fire 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.360
 let's see our fill 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.530
 we have the onion that is suffering 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.600
 let's now add the flower of 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.210
 pumpkin let's also let it be 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.730
 suffered in the minutes before adding 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.710
 in cottage cheese this recipe is simple 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.570
 It seems very laborious and the truth is that 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.360
 it's quite simple the filling is done 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.460
 easily the sauce is easily done and 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.920
 the crepe mix is also made 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.310
 pretty simple we have the mixture 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.960
 for the crepes we have the pan 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.360
 hot that is not so so so 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.560
 hot because it was so hot what 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.200
 only thing that happens is that they are going to burn us 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.390
 the crepas if they burn the first 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.820
 sequence that maybe we leave everything 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.230
 Warming up a little while the first of 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.330
 the second creation are going to burn and 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.080
 then the pan is going to cool 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.720
 lightly and we will be able to prepare 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.700
 crepes with another ease let's put together a 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.770
 ladle cited not very large not very 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.440
 wide because this the table that 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.210
 let's put in the pan not be much 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.540
 let's go here to put some of this 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.540
 mixture 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.269
 we go 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.289
 expand as much as we can our 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.939
 mixture of crepes of Cuba the whole pan 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.250
 let's let them afford 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.020
 little minutes to then turn it over and 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.789
 start our crepas we are going to 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.430
 prepare nothing else before and they are not 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.439
 cut the sauce for the sauce and its 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.560
 presence we also have here a glass 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:43.190
 clean blender let's put 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.010
 Let the cream and pour what we already 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.630
 We offered in the pot that was the chile 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.230
 poblano with the onion and the garlic that already 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.620
 suffered a few minutes perfect is already 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.620
 ready 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.100
 let's go here a few minutes and we'll 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.800
 see it in the blender together with the cream 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.340
 with the help of some pizzas it's more 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.199
 sure so that we will not fall 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.620
 let's turn and our crackling 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.540
 is already ready 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.770
 we'll see 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:21.990
 also with a thin stick is going to be 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.100
 easier to take off well we flipped it 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.770
 let's see what is cooked on the other side 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.720
