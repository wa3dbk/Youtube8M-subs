00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 hello everyone as you saw earlier i'm on 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.929
 Internet ordered intermediate shaft and 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.590
 gearbox input shaft for 150 vat 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.110
 scooter 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.750
 but now it's time to put this one together 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.900
 scooter have you had such a misfortune 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.039
 you have broken gears in gear 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.650
 first of all you need everything well 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.800
 rinse ie all bearings get and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.869
 wash here i haven't washed anything yet but me 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.120
 It is necessary because this shaving which 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.370
 will remain after the old gears she 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 can quickly help you lose 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.030
 new gears this part I already washed 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 one more nuance 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.670
 due to the fact that it is in this scooter 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.230
 for some reason, relaxed 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.780
 the hair that is here I can hand 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.180
 I push the shaft except the primary shaft I 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.129
 he put on the hot did not have to buy 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.129
 new with new oil seals on 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.650
 let the whole thing remain though 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.650
 see what comes out 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.360
 the bearing fell into place and won but there 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.340
 the hole that goes out is 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.560
 the hole is made specially for you 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.960
 able to slow down if you grunts 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.960
 epiploon of a secondary shaft on a reducer 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:41.960
 gland is put on the back side 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:43.340
 there is not like this way oil seal works 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:54.110
 set now need to lubricate 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:57.670
 the inner edge can now be put 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.670
 intermediate shaft itself 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.729
 then install the secondary gear 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:11.600
 shaft 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:14.019
 Well, cover it all there is no 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.019
 slots 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.720
 and so I didn't have a sleeve that 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.340
 must stand here this crescent 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.270
 157 motor but there it is put in 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.210
 aluminum crankcase 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.110
 steel sleeve here i don't have it but 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.170
 but i found some bearing 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.990
 broke it and here I got it 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.600
 such a sleeve that is, it sits here 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.220
 ok but in the carter it doesn't fit then 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.500
 I have a little sharpen 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.500
 and then let's see what happens 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.609
 so the procedure is pouring oil into 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.519
 scooter gearbox in winter at minus 5 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.380
 degrees are very very fun and 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.740
 having fun on the fact that I have a syringe 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.610
 five oil is too thick and not necessary 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.610
 pour 100 grams 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.780
 Well, as seen 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.740
 the scooter will start up will still be very much 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:34.730
 works with plastic with wiring because 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:40.280
 see for yourself the wiring is well here 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:44.950
 let's say it was an ignition switch then 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:51.830
 here is something here I still imagine it 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:54.590
 wire some kind of cloth fabric in 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:59.900
 isolation that is such a hundred years already not 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.490
 do and he here here here stood so well in 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.060
 general 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.060
 to be continued
