there I've got one started here but I
want<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.819> get<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.060> there<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.450> put<00:02:58.690> some

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
want to get in there and put some

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.180 
want to get in there and put some
outlets<00:02:59.200> in<00:02:59.410> there<00:02:59.590> so<00:02:59.769> i<00:02:59.830> can<00:02:59.980> plug

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
outlets in there so i can plug

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:09.240 
outlets in there so i can plug
everything<00:03:00.519> in<00:03:00.819> I<00:03:07.470> think<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.560> next<00:03:08.590> project

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
everything in I think the next project

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.559 
everything in I think the next project
is<00:03:09.280> going<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.519> be<00:03:09.580> to<00:03:09.700> start<00:03:09.760> on<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.239> ceiling

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
is going to be to start on this ceiling

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.009 
is going to be to start on this ceiling
I<00:03:11.370> want<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.489> at<00:03:12.610> least<00:03:12.640> do<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.299> curved<00:03:13.660> part

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
I want to at least do this curved part

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:21.960 
I want to at least do this curved part
here<00:03:19.680> when<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.709> was<00:03:20.890> putting<00:03:21.099> this<00:03:21.310> cabinet<00:03:21.849> in

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
here when I was putting this cabinet in

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.729 
here when I was putting this cabinet in
I<00:03:22.090> thought<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.390> would<00:03:22.510> be<00:03:22.630> easier<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.290> put<00:03:23.500> the

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
I thought it would be easier to put the

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.910 
I thought it would be easier to put the
cabinet<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.310> first<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.110> then<00:03:26.110> trim<00:03:26.890> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
cabinet in first and then trim the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.180 
cabinet in first and then trim the
ceiling<00:03:27.400> out<00:03:27.549> around<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.940> cabinet<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.950> I

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
ceiling out around the cabinet but I

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.520 
ceiling out around the cabinet but I
found<00:03:30.579> that<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:30.910> was<00:03:31.209> pretty<00:03:31.840> difficult<00:03:32.049> to

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
found that that was pretty difficult to

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.069 
found that that was pretty difficult to
do<00:03:32.650> with<00:03:32.890> all<00:03:33.040> these<00:03:33.280> cross<00:03:34.090> bracing<00:03:34.690> pieces

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
do with all these cross bracing pieces

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.380 
do with all these cross bracing pieces
that<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.260> had<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.500> notch<00:03:35.739> for<00:03:36.070> then<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.090> had<00:03:37.269> to

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
that I had to notch for then I had to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.430 
that I had to notch for then I had to
build<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.980> ceiling<00:03:39.630> inside<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.870> cabinet<00:03:41.380> he

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
build a ceiling inside the cabinet he

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.330 
build a ceiling inside the cabinet he
offer<00:03:41.590> like<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.040> little<00:03:42.310> top<00:03:42.549> for<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:42.910> cabinet

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
offer like a little top for the cabinet

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.360 
offer like a little top for the cabinet
since<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.850> ceiling<00:03:46.209> wasn't<00:03:46.480> there<00:03:46.630> yet<00:03:46.840> and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
since the ceiling wasn't there yet and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
since the ceiling wasn't there yet and
I'm<00:03:48.370> going<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.519> have<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.670> get<00:03:48.819> up<00:03:48.910> in<00:03:49.060> there<00:03:49.239> and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
I'm going to have to get up in there and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.620 
I'm going to have to get up in there and
insulate<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:51.579> was<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.940> was<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.090> real<00:03:52.329> pain

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
insulate it was it was a real pain

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:02.460 
insulate it was it was a real pain
trying<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.109> build<00:03:53.350> this<00:03:59.400> you<00:04:00.400> can<00:04:00.579> see<00:04:01.470> it's

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
trying to build this you can see it's

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.250 
trying to build this you can see it's
got<00:04:02.620> its<00:04:02.799> own<00:04:02.889> separate<00:04:03.400> ceiling<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:05.440> there

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.180 

so<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.290> think<00:04:10.440> it's<00:04:10.620> going<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.830> be<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.950> lot<00:04:11.129> easier

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
so I think it's going to be a lot easier

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.759 
so I think it's going to be a lot easier
to<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.760> ceiling<00:04:12.000> first<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.260> shape<00:04:13.530> the

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
to the ceiling first and to shape the

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.830 
to the ceiling first and to shape the
cabinets<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.519> fit<00:04:15.450> like<00:04:15.900> on<00:04:16.079> this<00:04:16.260> next<00:04:16.530> side

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
cabinets to fit like on this next side

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.539 
cabinets to fit like on this next side
and<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:19.079> think<00:04:19.290> it<00:04:19.380> will<00:04:19.440> also<00:04:19.620> be<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.130> lot<00:04:20.519> easier

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
and I think it will also be a lot easier

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.590 
and I think it will also be a lot easier
building<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.359> cabinets<00:04:23.060> over<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.389> bed

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
building the cabinets over the bed

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.780 
building the cabinets over the bed
across<00:04:25.290> this<00:04:25.530> back<00:04:25.770> wall<00:04:26.040> if<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.400> ceilings

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
across this back wall if the ceilings

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.060 
across this back wall if the ceilings
already<00:04:27.150> in<00:04:27.270> place<00:04:30.229> so<00:04:31.229> that's<00:04:31.770> what<00:04:31.889> we'll<00:04:31.949> be

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
already in place so that's what we'll be

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.290 
already in place so that's what we'll be
doing<00:04:32.190> next<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.930> i'll<00:04:33.930> keep<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.260> updated
