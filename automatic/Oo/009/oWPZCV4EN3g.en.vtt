00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.749 
labs in and we I think we've proven over
the<00:01:54.200> course<00:01:54.409> of<00:01:54.529> the<00:01:54.679> number<00:01:55.459> of<00:01:55.549> months

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
the course of the number of months

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.279 
the course of the number of months
before<00:01:55.849> the<00:01:56.119> cup<00:01:56.270> final<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.810> cup<00:01:56.959> final

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
before the cup final and the cup final

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.929 
before the cup final and the cup final
ultimate<00:01:57.529> lay<00:01:57.679> that<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.459> type<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.700> football

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
ultimate lay that the type of football

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.339 
ultimate lay that the type of football
that<00:01:59.090> we<00:01:59.299> want<00:01:59.569> to<00:01:59.630> produce<00:01:59.749> for<00:02:00.049> going<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.289> a

that we want to produce for going to a
football<00:02:00.529> club<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:01.189> I<00:02:01.609> think<00:02:02.179> that<00:02:02.419> the<00:02:02.509> fans

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749

with it left off last season and

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.800 
with it left off last season and
hopefully<00:04:52.170> that<00:04:52.620> will<00:04:53.010> be<00:04:53.540> tugging<00:04:54.540> on<00:04:54.660> with

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
with the quality of Coulomb field and

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.690 
with the quality of Coulomb field and
clever<00:06:34.050> yeah<00:06:34.680> you<00:06:34.860> were<00:06:34.950> flying<00:06:35.250> high<00:06:35.490> low

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
season as the plane got overhead here so

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.020

that's<00:06:38.070> good<00:06:38.220> for<00:06:38.370> a<00:06:38.430> good<00:06:38.610> season<00:06:38.820> this
