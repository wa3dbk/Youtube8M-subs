00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
gorya there's been like a whole

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.300 
gorya there's been like a whole
resurgence<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.439> visionaries<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.070> United

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
resurgence of visionaries in the United

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.490 
resurgence of visionaries in the United
States<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> even<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.750> society<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
States and even in society we have a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.880 
States and even in society we have a
whole<00:01:49.740> big<00:01:50.070> thing<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.640> on

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.749 

I<00:01:53.840> think<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.960> good<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.350> try<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:56.729> some

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
I think it's good to try and use some

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.830 
I think it's good to try and use some
spiritual<00:01:57.509> discernment<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:59.909> simple<00:02:00.509> test

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
spiritual discernment and a simple test

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.429 
spiritual discernment and a simple test
would<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:02.329> is<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.570> consistent<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
would be is it consistent with the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.740 
would be is it consistent with the
scripture<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.850> hearing<00:02:06.119> weird<00:02:06.390> stuff

scripture or are you hearing weird stuff

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.050

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
well that doesn't pass the smell test

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.119

understand is that the vision is

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.920 
understand is that the vision is
advocating<00:02:28.980> conversion<00:02:29.489> in<00:02:29.579> prayer<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.120> would

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
at least maybe this program there have

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.180 
at least maybe this program there have
been<00:04:16.169> other<00:04:16.320> people<00:04:16.500> with<00:04:16.829> similar

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
experiences to you so just because it's

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.550 
experiences to you so just because it's
not<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.639> Bible<00:04:20.820> doesn't<00:04:21.239> mean<00:04:21.389> God<00:04:21.630> can't

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
not in the Bible doesn't mean God can't

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.770 
not in the Bible doesn't mean God can't
reach<00:04:22.740> out<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.040> say<00:04:23.130> look<00:04:23.370> wake<00:04:23.940> up<00:04:24.210> you're

reach out and say look wake up you're
going<00:04:25.050> down<00:04:25.260> that's<00:04:25.470> what<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.830> thought<00:04:26.160> is

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
going down that's what I thought is

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.280 
going down that's what I thought is
moving<00:04:26.790> in<00:04:26.910> powerful<00:04:27.240> ways<00:04:27.419> is<00:04:27.750> that<00:04:28.080> they

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
moving in powerful ways is that they

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.900 
moving in powerful ways is that they
told<00:04:28.350> me<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:28.949> was<00:04:29.160> a<00:04:29.220> time<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.639> great

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
told me that this was a time of great

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.969 
told me that this was a time of great
spiritual<00:04:30.690> awakening<00:04:30.780> because<00:04:31.290> God<00:04:31.620> does<00:04:31.830> not

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
spiritual awakening because God does not

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.640 
spiritual awakening because God does not
want<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.389> punish<00:04:33.389> us<00:04:33.690> or<00:04:33.960> condemn<00:04:34.290> us<00:04:34.440> God

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650

wants conversion to be the people of God

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.260 
wants conversion to be the people of God
that<00:04:37.770> God<00:04:38.070> created<00:04:38.340> us<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.490> be<00:04:38.729> so<00:04:38.910> God<00:04:39.120> is
