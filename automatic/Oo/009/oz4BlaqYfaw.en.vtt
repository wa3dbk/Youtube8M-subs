00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.900
 staff speaks the SIFAM I'm not 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.509
 and today I 'm going to take a fight well 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.830
 interesting how to save your 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.680
 contrabass 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.350
 although this answer seems very obvious 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.880
 believe it or not, save or 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.920
 accommodate our instrument requires 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.260
 attention and much affection 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.960
 after all we do not want on the channels 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.300
 then the instrument to respond 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.670
 this doubt and I will exemplify since 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.920
 There are several situations that surround us 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.110
 example how to store it while 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.460
 do not start the show or that break 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.879
 in the studio essay 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.879
 come on 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.500
 I'm going first and foremost it's important 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.760
 make clear and end some myths 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.350
 wait the instrument does not need 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.879
 that old story out of tune or 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.589
 loosen the ropes 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.239
 there is no indication of placing the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.790
 instrument with the strings down 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.479
 on some surface the same for 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.420
 top 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.950
 in fact there are situations and points 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.110
 to consider 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.690
 Let's first understand that you do not 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.520
 should do is important to know 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.950
 first because the arm of the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.759
 instrument does what it does for this 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.070
 problem 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.960
 they will understand the following about the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.280
 bridge from our base there is a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.190
 very large 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.840
 this pressure extends all over the arm 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.130
 when we put an instrument down 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.229
 an inclined 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.759
 this causes a strain on the arm 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.649
 generate training 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.909
 technically called mind ended to 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.220
 inside out 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.409
 you should never keep the instrument 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.530
 so unless it's a small 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.299
 time slot as I said earlier 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.280
 can be a most appropriate test 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.229
 during a break it is good to put the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.450
 instrument on a stand and if you do not 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.649
 a colloquium on the weg with the wheels 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.649
 facing the ground 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.560
 otherwise rates may move 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.270
 of tune instruments ever save the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.300
 instrument in very closed places 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 type on top of the wardrobe or 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.739
 anything like that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.470
 in these places besides the dirt in 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:13.430
 temperature variation impairs and 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.430
 very much your instrument 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.340
 the best way to save your 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.870
 double bass and using a stand 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.060
 various types and models 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 I advise support without that famous 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.840
 wagon had part here 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.370
 note that this model that I am 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.800
 indicating it does not have that claw that 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.290
 often ends up earning an arm due 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.980
 the way you have to withdraw is not 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.750
 cool 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.550
 with this support everything indicating you 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.220
 can accommodate an instrument in pauses 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.340
 studio or even in shows 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.020
 Look, the big balcony is you can 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.870
 also wait for the bass to bequeathed on 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.930
 he notes that the goal is to leave the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.820
 always free of any pressure 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.970
 now if you do not have 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.820
 worse at worst left low with berg standing 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.400
 but if inclined it can touch a 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.320
 wall or have to leave it between two 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.230
 objects that will force him to stay in 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.010
 standing foot without any force to 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.010
 pressure on the arm 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.300
 the wall mount are pretty cool to 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.160
 advantage of this size is usually to 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.080
 gain space and even to give 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.700
 that up in room 27 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.950
 but for the instrument is not the most 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.260
 indicated the instrument exposed during 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.959
 long time off beck will require 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.360
 I suggested that he will have some care to 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.300
 example I can use the support with 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.060
 hangs up your whole claw is pulled 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.790
 to the arm and in case any 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.450
 unexpected fall from the fear of 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.520
 fall 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.680
 if you have more instruments you 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.190
 you can purchase or customize support 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.440
 floor that accepts more than 3 300 are 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.140
 well cool too you can put 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.400
 both with beck or sindec in the market 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.970
 there are several models 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.040
 just search and consult its good use 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.660
 Guys, I hope to have helped with this doubt. 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.519
 I hope you have enjoyed continue 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.980
 Sending your doubts to us 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.540
 Good, but I'm going to stay here, bye. 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.540
 in london and until the next 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.780
 O
