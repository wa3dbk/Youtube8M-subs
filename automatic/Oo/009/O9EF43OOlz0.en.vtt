00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
remember my last video in which I

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.909 
remember my last video in which I
demonstrated<00:00:06.180> how<00:00:06.359> not<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.140> build<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.440> city<00:00:07.649> in

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
demonstrated how not to build a city in

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.730 
demonstrated how not to build a city in
Sim<00:00:08.250> City<00:00:08.660> now<00:00:09.660> some<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.170> might<00:00:10.290> be<00:00:10.349> saying

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
Sim City now some of you might be saying

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.370 
Sim City now some of you might be saying
you<00:00:11.280> could<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.460> done<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> lot<00:00:11.969> worse<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.809> you

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
you could have done a lot worse and you

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.530 
you could have done a lot worse and you
would<00:00:13.530> be<00:00:13.620> right<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.130> mean<00:00:14.880> just<00:00:15.150> look<00:00:15.330> at<00:00:15.450> all

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
would be right I mean just look at all

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.230 
would be right I mean just look at all
the<00:00:15.719> scenario<00:00:16.230> cities<00:00:17.090> scenarios<00:00:18.090> are

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the scenario cities scenarios are

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.179 
the scenario cities scenarios are
basically<00:00:18.630> cities<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.380> some<00:00:19.920> sort<00:00:20.130> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
basically cities that have some sort of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.060 
basically cities that have some sort of
problem<00:00:20.430> whether<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.240> be<00:00:21.390> crime<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:22.109> traffic

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
problem whether it be crime or traffic

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.140 
problem whether it be crime or traffic
jams<00:00:23.100> or<00:00:23.670> some<00:00:24.480> kind<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.750> impending<00:00:25.170> disaster

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
jams or some kind of impending disaster

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.099 
jams or some kind of impending disaster
basically<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.480> solve<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.900> city's

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
basically have to solve the city's

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.529 
basically have to solve the city's
problem<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.890> order<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> beat<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.090> scenario

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
problem in order to beat the scenario

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.630 
problem in order to beat the scenario
but<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:31.590> cities<00:00:31.890> tend<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.369> problems

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
but these cities tend to have problems

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.200 
but these cities tend to have problems
other<00:00:33.270> than<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> ones<00:00:33.989> identified<00:00:35.030> most<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
other than the ones identified most of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.299 
other than the ones identified most of
them<00:00:36.329> across<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.899> board<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:38.040> kind<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
them across the board have some kind of

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.850 
them across the board have some kind of
crime<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.910> traffic<00:00:39.300> congestion<00:00:39.719> issues<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
crime or traffic congestion issues so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
crime or traffic congestion issues so
it's<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.190> job<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.489> effectively<00:00:42.239> rebuild<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it's your job to effectively rebuild the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.770 
it's your job to effectively rebuild the
city<00:00:43.700> but<00:00:44.700> we'll<00:00:44.850> talk<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.300> about<00:00:45.360> scenarios

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
city but we'll talk more about scenarios

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.549 
city but we'll talk more about scenarios
another<00:00:46.289> time<00:00:47.570> I'm<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> show<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.230> how

another time I'm going to show you how

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860 
another time I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:49.620> build<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.250> thriving<00:00:50.579> attractive<00:00:51.420> city<00:00:51.629> in

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to build a thriving attractive city in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
to build a thriving attractive city in
this<00:00:52.050> video<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.520> obey<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.030> basic

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
this video if you obey the basic

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.450 
this video if you obey the basic
principles<00:00:54.899> outlined<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.800> video

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
principles outlined in this video

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
principles outlined in this video
you<00:00:57.000> should<00:00:57.210> experience<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> good<00:00:57.930> deal

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you should experience a good deal

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.139 
you should experience a good deal
success<00:00:58.620> maybe<00:00:59.430> you'll<00:00:59.640> even<00:00:59.730> attain

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
success maybe you'll even attain

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.359 
success maybe you'll even attain
megalopolis<00:01:00.989> status<00:01:01.699> man<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.030> sounds<00:01:03.390> nerdy

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
megalopolis status man that sounds nerdy

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.740 
megalopolis status man that sounds nerdy
so<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> first<00:01:05.729> step<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.090> building<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.510> great

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so the first step in building a great

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.000 
so the first step in building a great
city<00:01:07.049> its<00:01:07.439> giving<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.070> an<00:01:08.220> awesome<00:01:08.520> name<00:01:10.010> no

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
city its giving it an awesome name no

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.010 
city its giving it an awesome name no
I'm<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.430> kidding<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> couldn't<00:01:12.840> hurt<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
I'm just kidding but it couldn't hurt to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.390 
I'm just kidding but it couldn't hurt to
name<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> something<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.799> actually<00:01:14.100> like

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
name it something you actually like

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.770 
name it something you actually like
because<00:01:14.640> you're<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.180> looking<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
because you're going to be looking at it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.920 
because you're going to be looking at it
a<00:01:15.840> lot<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:17.640> first<00:01:17.970> thing<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.299> need<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
a lot the first thing you need to do is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.530 
a lot the first thing you need to do is
pick<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> good<00:01:20.040> map<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:21.000> will<00:01:21.270> largely

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
pick a good map this will largely

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.450 
pick a good map this will largely
determine<00:01:21.990> how<00:01:22.560> big<00:01:22.830> you'll<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.220> able<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
determine how big you'll be able to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
determine how big you'll be able to
build<00:01:23.729> your<00:01:23.909> population<00:01:24.710> pick<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> map<00:01:26.040> with

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
build your population pick a map with

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.340 
build your population pick a map with
lots<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.670> land<00:01:26.880> mass<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.960> water<00:01:28.140> as

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
lots of land mass and as little water as

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.730 
lots of land mass and as little water as
possible<00:01:29.009> although<00:01:29.960> rivers<00:01:30.960> lakes<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.560> ponds

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
possible although rivers lakes and ponds

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.069 
possible although rivers lakes and ponds
do<00:01:32.159> help<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.670> increase<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.150> land<00:01:33.509> value<00:01:33.869> of

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
do help to increase the land value of

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.620 
do help to increase the land value of
any<00:01:34.590> structures<00:01:35.070> next<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:36.600> are

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
any structures next to it there are

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.660 
any structures next to it there are
other<00:01:36.869> ways<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.259> increasing<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> land<00:01:38.280> value

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
other ways of increasing the land value

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.950 
other ways of increasing the land value
in<00:01:38.880> any<00:01:39.119> given<00:01:39.600> area<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.460> pick<00:01:41.460> map<00:01:41.759> number<00:01:42.060> 137

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
in any given area I pick map number 137

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.530 
in any given area I pick map number 137
in<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.320> example<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.729> has<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> river<00:01:45.270> running

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
in this example it has a river running

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.569 
in this example it has a river running
through<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.930> middle<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.189> lots<00:01:47.430> of

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
through the middle but it's got lots of

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.980 
through the middle but it's got lots of
land<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.090> developed<00:01:50.180> number<00:01:51.180> 2<00:01:51.390> don't

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
land to be developed number 2 don't

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.590 
land to be developed number 2 don't
bother<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.560> coal<00:01:52.799> power<00:01:53.180> build<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.299> nuclear

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
bother with coal power build a nuclear

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.690 
bother with coal power build a nuclear
power<00:01:54.930> plant<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.619> off<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> bat<00:01:56.130> because<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
power plant right off the bat because it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850 
power plant right off the bat because it
produces<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.420> energy<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.680> you're

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
produces more energy and if you're

industrial zones at the edges or corners
of<00:06:37.509> the<00:06:37.599> map<00:06:37.839> they<00:06:38.500> cause<00:06:38.770> a<00:06:38.800> lot<00:06:39.159> of<00:06:39.190> pollution

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
of the map they cause a lot of pollution

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.410 
of the map they cause a lot of pollution
but<00:06:39.969> the

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
but the

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.450 
but the
are<00:06:40.480> unnecessary<00:06:41.110> evil<00:06:41.200> so<00:06:42.010> it's<00:06:42.160> a<00:06:42.220> good<00:06:42.370> idea

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
are unnecessary evil so it's a good idea

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.810 
are unnecessary evil so it's a good idea
to<00:06:42.730> keep<00:06:43.030> their<00:06:43.270> hazards<00:06:43.750> to<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:43.960> minimum<00:06:44.820> build

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
to keep their hazards to a minimum build

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.670 
to keep their hazards to a minimum build
parks<00:06:46.210> around<00:06:46.510> them<00:06:46.750> to<00:06:46.900> keep<00:06:47.050> the<00:06:47.230> pollution

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
parks around them to keep the pollution

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.680 
parks around them to keep the pollution
from<00:06:47.710> reaching<00:06:48.160> the<00:06:48.970> commercial<00:06:49.540> and
