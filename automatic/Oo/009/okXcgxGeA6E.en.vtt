00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.919
 12 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.199
 the monthey chemical site 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.210
 the surface of a golf course more than 2,000 people employed by three 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.210
 behemoths of the international chemical industry 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.300
 since a few years 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.660
 the economic and ecological interest contact china a common project 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.330
 waste optimization 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.710
 two philosophies of revaluation that does not date from yesterday 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.570
 the association 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.200
 special waste with extra people from here to late 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.110
 September so distrust 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.020
 iran started with this agreement the french group for example the value 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.270
 this advert 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.729
 The UN chief does not have the power to create in the true sense of the term 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.140
 it is rather the wall the raw materials mark raw materials 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.640
 of talent will leave with their constitution 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.150
 the calamba remove some are waiting for this rank after edf to the materials 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.250
 first be for lightroom about form of fertilizer 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.900
 fgta-fo forms of raw materials waves 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 the Russian-made woman and on the site 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.660
 and then the techniques have refined 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.880
 today heat recovery equals 6-10 annual heating 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.000
 but we could do more 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.070
 see chemist 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.130
 in fact she kept her place with water vapor 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.789
 it was developed during trial responds still failed to 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:37.730
 recover 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.390
 but maybe it's a bit more we need to find that long term 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 career finally no value in this 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.420
 but nothing is lost nothing is created everything is transformed the spirit of the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.560
 third pair of modern chemistry hovers over the Montpellier site 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 good evening 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.490
 for the optimization of material flows and the facts they had 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.040
 been killed by 7% 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.480
 to a finite activity 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.000
 because we work with materials 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.210
 expensive 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.359
 difficult to extract 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.959
 from the start the interests 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.109
 economy 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.819
 these technologies 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.480
 it was for a long time site the most vital almost constant of materials and of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.169
 energy 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.749
 this chemical site that evokes a living organism 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.679
 this model of almost Soviet metabolic functioning 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.579
 bore a name the industrial ecology 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.449
 then the power of the economy over the sector 7 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:33.299
 more global approach 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.879
 we can go on vacation it was a look at the progress of the site itself 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.379
 how can we integrate other companies 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.469
 even for example district heating 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.069
 to value waste such as heat such as water that can 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.579
 still be usable 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.919
 why we optimize all resources not only at the scale 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.019
 from the manama site the chief of the region 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.949
 so the idea is simple we can learn from the operation of 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.019
 ecosystems like a forest for example 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.989
 to try to have an economic system that is 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.209
 sustainable in the long run 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.869
 and this is the ambition of the Canton of Valais who wish to disseminate this 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.119
 way of doing 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.209
 as far as possible when we are disappointed 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.959
 yes there are opportunities for synergies 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.009
 we can put in place when a project is colossal in clear the goal is 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.369
 really considering that what happens to near sursee my son has returned 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.169
 at home postponed to yesterday in the canton 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.169
 with the final objective of rhyming economy and ecology 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:34.839
 by putting in place models of economic synergies and more efficient
