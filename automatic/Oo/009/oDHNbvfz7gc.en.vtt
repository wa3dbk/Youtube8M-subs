control that 900 piece games without was
going<00:05:17.610> over<00:05:17.850> Xbox<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.480> think<00:05:18.780> we're<00:05:18.960> past<00:05:19.170> it<00:05:19.440> i

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
going over Xbox I think we're past it i

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.810 
going over Xbox I think we're past it i
mean<00:05:19.770> there's<00:05:20.010> gonna<00:05:20.190> be<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.400> couple<00:05:20.580> more

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
mean there's gonna be a couple more

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.920 
mean there's gonna be a couple more
games<00:05:20.970> that<00:05:21.180> are<00:05:21.270> gonna<00:05:21.360> come<00:05:21.600> out<00:05:21.720> like<00:05:21.870> that

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.920 
games that are gonna come out like that
but<00:05:22.560> i<00:05:22.590> think<00:05:22.680> once<00:05:23.100> we<00:05:23.190> hit<00:05:23.400> 2015<00:05:24.210> when<00:05:24.840> we

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
but i think once we hit 2015 when we

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.530 
but i think once we hit 2015 when we
start<00:05:25.200> seeing<00:05:25.380> these<00:05:25.590> on<00:05:26.000> next-gen<00:05:27.000> only

start seeing these on next-gen only
games<00:05:27.810> will<00:05:28.260> be<00:05:28.410> out<00:05:28.590> of<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:28.770> cycle<00:05:29.070> of<00:05:29.340> life

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490
