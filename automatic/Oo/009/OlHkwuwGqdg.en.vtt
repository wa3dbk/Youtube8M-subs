00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.139 
actually got a a v8 in it but and they
were<00:00:40.649> quite<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> bit<00:00:41.250> more<00:00:41.430> than<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
were quite a bit more than the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.869 
were quite a bit more than the
substantially<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.890> actually<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> quote

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
substantially as is actually the quote

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.180 
substantially as is actually the quote
then<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.289> expensive<00:00:46.710> than<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.920> six

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
then the more expensive than a six

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.760 
then the more expensive than a six
series<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> clean<00:00:49.320> title<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.739> a

the standard set of tools here this

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.090 
the standard set of tools here this
actually<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> little<00:02:18.840> more<00:02:18.930> extensive<00:02:19.530> due

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
actually is a little more extensive due

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.400 
actually is a little more extensive due
to<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> fact<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.390> some<00:02:21.600> ink<00:02:21.810> series<00:02:22.170> so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
to the fact that some ink series so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.510 
to the fact that some ink series so
there's<00:02:22.620> more<00:02:22.770> stuff<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.160> here<00:02:23.250> than<00:02:23.430> you

more<00:03:35.520> expensive<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:36.540> mean<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.810> looks<00:03:36.989> more

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
more expensive I mean it looks more

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.690 
more expensive I mean it looks more
