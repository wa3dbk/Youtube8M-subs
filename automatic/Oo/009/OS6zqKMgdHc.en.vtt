00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
little bit creepy or more lightweight in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030

that under-eye area that's really not

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.580 
that under-eye area that's really not
something<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.549> want<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> deal<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.299> all

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
something you want to deal with it all

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.440 
something you want to deal with it all
so<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:11.040> hoping<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.820> would<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.180> maybe

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so I was hoping that this would be maybe

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.289 
so I was hoping that this would be maybe
a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:13.049> more<00:01:13.260> lightweight<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.299> that's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
a little bit more lightweight and that's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
a little bit more lightweight and that's
exactly<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> turned<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
exactly what it turned out to be it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.010 
exactly what it turned out to be it
twists<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:20.820> much<00:01:21.090> product<00:01:21.479> in

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
twists up you get that much product in

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.310 
twists up you get that much product in
there<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.920> shade<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
there and the shade I have is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
there and the shade I have is
light/medium<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.710> lightest<00:01:26.400> shade<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.880> fair

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
light/medium the lightest shade was fair

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.719 
light/medium the lightest shade was fair
and<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.560> went<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.829> few<00:01:29.100> shades<00:01:29.340> deeper

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and then it went a few shades deeper

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.050 
and then it went a few shades deeper
than<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.829> basically<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.310> applied<00:01:32.729> this

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
than this so basically as I applied this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.480 
than this so basically as I applied this
I<00:01:33.329> felt<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.079> glided<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> skin

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
I felt like it really glided on the skin

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.480 
I felt like it really glided on the skin
really<00:01:35.759> easily<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.470> feel<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> sweeps

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
really easily I just feel like it sweeps

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.780 
really easily I just feel like it sweeps
on<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.360> nicely<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.560> very<00:01:40.890> low<00:01:41.159> effort<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
on so nicely and it's very low effort to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.710 
on so nicely and it's very low effort to
blend<00:01:42.060> in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
blend in

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.789

thick and
this<00:02:08.420> I<00:02:08.660> feel<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.050> it's<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.349> type<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.560> thing

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
this I feel like it's the type of thing

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.710 
this I feel like it's the type of thing
that<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.130> could<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.610> know<00:02:10.640> block<00:02:11.390> out<00:02:11.690> a

whole area and it's practically reminds

on your finger first and dot it on if
you<00:02:32.780> wanted<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.769> like<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.340> get<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.700> on

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
you wanted to but I like to get it on

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.640 
you wanted to but I like to get it on
there<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:35.600> take<00:02:35.810> my<00:02:35.840> finger<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.470> use

there and then take my finger and use

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.009 
there and then take my finger and use
the<00:02:36.830> warmth<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.280> my<00:02:37.340> finger<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:38.360> kind<00:02:38.599> of<00:02:38.690> Pat

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
the warmth of my finger to kind of Pat

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.470 
the warmth of my finger to kind of Pat
and<00:02:39.380> blend<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.760> little<00:02:41.030> bit<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.450> really

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
and blend just a little bit to really

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.720 
and blend just a little bit to really
get<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:41.989> going<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.440> my<00:02:42.620> under<00:02:42.890> eyes<00:02:43.069> so<00:02:43.489> I

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
get that going on my under eyes so I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.850 
get that going on my under eyes so I
guess<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.269> question<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.810> remains<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.590> how

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
guess the question that remains is how

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.180 
guess the question that remains is how
well<00:02:46.220> did<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.700> really<00:02:46.880> cover<00:02:47.360> my<00:02:48.019> circles<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.890> do

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
well did it really cover my circles I do

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.729 
well did it really cover my circles I do
not<00:02:49.430> think<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.390> most<00:02:51.290> heavy

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
not think this is the most heavy

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.190 
not think this is the most heavy
coverage<00:02:52.370> concealer<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.360> out<00:02:53.600> there<00:02:53.900> to

be used for under-eye I think like you

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420

lately and there's been lots of talk

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.400 
lately and there's been lots of talk
about<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:11.090> being<00:03:11.299> discontinued<00:03:12.140> which<00:03:12.290> is

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
about that being discontinued which is

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.199 
about that being discontinued which is
one<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.709> I<00:03:12.769> really<00:03:12.980> liked<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.910> thought<00:03:14.120> it

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
one that I really liked and I thought it

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.229 
one that I really liked and I thought it
was<00:03:14.329> creamy<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.870> good<00:03:15.019> coverage<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:16.239> this

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
was creamy and good coverage but this

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.090 
was creamy and good coverage but this
may<00:03:17.540> be<00:03:17.600> something<00:03:17.989> that<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.260> look<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.859> as<00:03:19.070> a

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
may be something that I look to as a

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.910 
may be something that I look to as a
drugstore<00:03:19.790> concealer<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:21.019> sort<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.530> replace

drugstore concealer to sort of replace

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.150 
drugstore concealer to sort of replace
that<00:03:22.250> it's<00:03:22.579> obviously<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> different<00:03:23.630> texture

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
that it's obviously a different texture

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.000 
that it's obviously a different texture
but<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.459> creamy<00:03:25.940> enough<00:03:26.600> -<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.200> feel<00:03:27.590> cover

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
but it is creamy enough - I feel cover

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.640 
but it is creamy enough - I feel cover
