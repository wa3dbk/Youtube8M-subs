bit<00:00:27.689> more<00:00:27.930> defensively<00:00:28.529> than<00:00:28.800> its

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
bit more defensively than its

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.220 
bit more defensively than its
counterpart<00:00:29.730> however<00:00:30.060> its<00:00:30.300> number<00:00:30.720> three<00:00:31.050> is

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
counterpart however its number three is

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530 
counterpart however its number three is
quite<00:00:31.890> nice<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.520> taking<00:00:32.880> down<00:00:33.059> groups<00:00:33.360> from

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
behind your shield so after that I

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
behind your shield so after that I
figured<00:00:35.820> why<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.329> try<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.930> new<00:00:37.170> le<00:00:37.380> Tron

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the parent sequence and the formula that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.350 
the parent sequence and the formula that
I<00:03:10.440> have<00:03:10.560> created<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.430> get<00:03:11.580> me<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.060> parent

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
I have created to get me to the parent

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.090 
I have created to get me to the parent
sequence<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.020> know<00:03:13.170> still<00:03:13.620> there<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.010> I'm

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
sequence you know still there and I'm

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.070 
sequence you know still there and I'm
gonna<00:03:14.460> end<00:03:14.700> up<00:03:14.880> at<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> parent<00:03:15.270> sequence<00:03:15.780> but

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
gonna end up at the parent sequence but

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.320 
gonna end up at the parent sequence but
I<00:03:16.290> don't<00:03:16.560> know<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:17.190> thought<00:03:17.700> maybe<00:03:17.970> they<00:03:18.210> would

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
be a little bit more underhanded or

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.980 
be a little bit more underhanded or
something<00:03:20.580> they<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:20.910> seem<00:03:21.360> really<00:03:21.810> really

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
something they just seem really really

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.200 
something they just seem really really
