set this to true a boolean value also

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.850 
set this to true a boolean value also
going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> turn<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.479> bugging<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
going to turn to bugging on and this is

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.679 
going to turn to bugging on and this is
really<00:01:23.100> useful<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.210> connecting<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
really useful if you are connecting to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.719 
really useful if you are connecting to
an<00:01:24.810> SMTP<00:01:25.409> server<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> first<00:01:26.250> time<00:01:26.549> but

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
an SMTP server for the first time but

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
an SMTP server for the first time but
you<00:01:26.820> might<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.090> having<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.390> few<00:01:27.600> problems<00:01:27.799> so

you might be having a few problems so
this<00:01:28.979> will<00:01:29.250> set<00:01:29.520> debugging<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.700> I'm

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
this will set debugging on and I'm

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.640 
this will set debugging on and I'm
setting<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.540> 2<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.470> give

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
setting this to 2 which is going to give

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.830 
setting this to 2 which is going to give
me<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.070> messages<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> set<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> 1

these so little easier to see
so<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:58.740> want<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.009> supply<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> username

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
so we now want to supply the username

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.560 
so we now want to supply the username
and<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:01.649> password<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.880> let's<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.240> fill<00:02:06.420> them

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and the password so let's just fill them

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.260 
and the password so let's just fill them
in<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:07.229> you're<00:02:07.530> using<00:02:07.860> SMTP<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:09.000> nee<00:02:09.209> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
in if you're using SMTP like nee to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.690 
in if you're using SMTP like nee to
authenticate<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.830> use<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> details

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
authenticate you can use all the details

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.380 
authenticate you can use all the details
like<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> host<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.810> pour

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
like the host and the pour

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.910 
like the host and the pour
we're<00:02:13.480> going<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.660> look<00:02:13.780> at<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.080> moment<00:02:14.530> and

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
we're going to look at in a moment and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.640 
we're going to look at in a moment and
also<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.490> secure<00:02:15.940> type<00:02:16.210> as<00:02:16.450> well<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:17.350> all

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
also that the secure type as well so all

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.470 
also that the secure type as well so all
you'll<00:02:17.920> need<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.220> do<00:02:18.370> here<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.850> replace<00:02:19.209> your

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
you'll need to do here is replace your

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.230 
you'll need to do here is replace your
Gmail<00:02:19.900> username<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.530> password<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.370> in<00:02:22.120> this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
Gmail username and password so in this

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.290 
Gmail username and password so in this
case<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.510> into<00:02:22.870> my<00:02:23.020> email<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.970> enter<00:02:25.209> my

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
case I into my email and I enter my

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.990 
case I into my email and I enter my
password<00:02:28.980> okay<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.310> next<00:02:30.520> thing<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.820> want

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
password okay so the next thing I want

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.590 
password okay so the next thing I want
to<00:02:31.120> do<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:32.310> set<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.340> secure<00:02:33.970> type<00:02:34.240> in<00:02:34.510> this

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
to do is set the secure type in this

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.300 
to do is set the secure type in this
case<00:02:34.840> it's<00:02:34.990> going<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.140> be<00:02:35.230> SSL<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.580> we<00:02:36.700> say<00:02:37.080> SMTP

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
case it's going to be SSL so we say SMTP

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.630 
case it's going to be SSL so we say SMTP
secure<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.750> using<00:02:41.050> SSL<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.920> what<00:02:42.520> we

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
secure and this is using SSL and what we

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.030 
secure and this is using SSL and what we
also<00:02:42.880> need<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.450> define<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:44.110> which<00:02:44.290> port<00:02:44.709> we're

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
also need to define is which port we're

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.120 
also need to define is which port we're
using<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:46.060> isn't<00:02:46.480> necessary<00:02:46.989> for<00:02:47.230> all<00:02:47.410> SMTP

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
using this isn't necessary for all SMTP

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.340 
using this isn't necessary for all SMTP
servers<00:02:48.610> but<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.150> case<00:02:49.420> we're<00:02:50.080> going<00:02:50.230> to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
servers but in this case we're going to

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.850 
servers but in this case we're going to
specify<00:02:51.010> which<00:02:51.489> port<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:51.970> want<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.269> use<00:02:52.480> here

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
specify which port you want to use here

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.979 
specify which port you want to use here
now<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.280> actually<00:02:54.430> all<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:55.600> need<00:02:55.810> to

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
now this is actually all that we need to

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.949 
now this is actually all that we need to
do<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.680> connect<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.340> our<00:02:57.370> SMTP<00:02:58.180> server<00:02:58.540> and

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
do to connect to our SMTP server and

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.580 
do to connect to our SMTP server and
start<00:02:59.709> sending<00:02:59.980> email<00:03:00.610> down<00:03:01.000> here<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:02.440> go

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
start sending email down here so go

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.580 
start sending email down here so go
ahead<00:03:02.680> find<00:03:03.010> your<00:03:03.160> details<00:03:03.580> apply<00:03:03.820> them<00:03:04.390> here

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
ahead find your details apply them here

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.660 
ahead find your details apply them here
and<00:03:05.590> we'll<00:03:05.739> go<00:03:05.860> ahead<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.070> look<00:03:06.250> at<00:03:06.310> sending

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
and we'll go ahead and look at sending

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.200 
and we'll go ahead and look at sending
emails<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.750> next<00:03:07.959> part
