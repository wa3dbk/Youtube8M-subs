00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
different I coulda did I feel like a lot

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.550 
different I coulda did I feel like a lot
of<00:04:08.650> times<00:04:08.890> I<00:04:09.040> go<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.460> match<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:10.440> whether<00:04:11.440> I

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
of times I go to a match and whether I

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.530 
of times I go to a match and whether I
want<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.070> lose<00:04:12.250> it's<00:04:12.610> just<00:04:12.760> like<00:04:12.970> there's<00:04:13.270> so

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
want to lose it's just like there's so

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.720 
want to lose it's just like there's so
many<00:04:13.690> things<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:14.170> was<00:04:14.380> something

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.490 

I<00:04:18.790> mean<00:04:19.450> it's<00:04:19.570> not<00:04:19.690> just<00:04:19.930> another<00:04:20.110> niche

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
I mean it's not just another niche

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.530 
I mean it's not just another niche
because<00:04:20.680> this<00:04:21.310> is<00:04:21.460> a<00:04:21.490> math<00:04:21.700> model<00:04:22.090> man<00:04:22.240> you

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
because this is a math model man you

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.120 
because this is a math model man you
know<00:04:22.630> if<00:04:23.020> we<00:04:23.200> lose<00:04:23.380> this<00:04:23.500> match<00:04:23.710> when<00:04:24.100> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
know if we lose this match when the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.460 
know if we lose this match when the
Nationals<00:04:24.610> that's<00:04:24.820> great<00:04:25.060> but<00:04:25.360> we<00:04:26.110> still<00:04:26.350> want

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
Nationals that's great but we still want

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.110 
Nationals that's great but we still want
with<00:04:26.710> this<00:04:26.830> match<00:04:27.040> this<00:04:27.280> is<00:04:27.460> very<00:04:27.700> important

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
with this match this is very important

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.970 
with this match this is very important
so<00:04:28.270> we're<00:04:28.780> going<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.020> train<00:04:29.230> the<00:04:29.380> same<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.620> can

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
so we're going to train the same I can

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.580 
so we're going to train the same I can
do<00:04:30.040> any<00:04:30.190> crazy<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:31.600> would<00:04:31.840> normally<00:04:32.020> do<00:04:32.350> but

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590

we are going to just want to

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.930 
we are going to just want to
I<00:04:34.690> would<00:04:35.140> really<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:36.190> know<00:04:36.280> play<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.580> in<00:04:36.760> today

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
I would really you know play it in today

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.540 
I would really you know play it in today
and<00:04:37.300> they<00:04:38.140> way<00:04:38.350> they<00:04:38.530> waited<00:04:38.920> in<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.280> cook

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
and they way they waited in and cook

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.370 
and they way they waited in and cook
their<00:04:39.700> one<00:04:39.910> opportunity<00:04:40.020> don't<00:04:41.020> think<00:04:41.230> got

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
their one opportunity don't think got

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.030 
their one opportunity don't think got
the<00:04:41.530> shot<00:04:41.770> where<00:04:42.070> we<00:04:42.550> will<00:04:42.700> take<00:04:42.880> 10<00:04:43.590> right<00:04:44.590> and

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
the shot where we will take 10 right and

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.460 
the shot where we will take 10 right and
we're<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:45.730> some<00:04:46.390> sense<00:04:46.600> I<00:04:46.690> think<00:04:46.720> we<00:04:46.990> just<00:04:47.080> we

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
we're in some sense I think we just we

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.260 
we're in some sense I think we just we
wore<00:04:47.680> ourselves<00:04:47.800> out<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.580> then<00:04:48.880> they<00:04:49.030> caught

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
wore ourselves out and then they caught

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.720 
wore ourselves out and then they caught
us<00:04:49.420> until<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.260> especially<00:04:51.220> those<00:04:51.550> clothes

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
us until it I especially those clothes

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.460 
us until it I especially those clothes
match<00:04:52.000> seems<00:04:52.390> like<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.750> that<00:04:53.260> must<00:04:53.410> be

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
match seems like that that must be

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.070 
match seems like that that must be
really<00:04:53.680> frustrating

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.770 

yeah<00:04:57.740> I<00:04:58.009> that<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:59.000> this<00:04:59.360> one<00:04:59.569> of<00:04:59.629> those<00:04:59.720> things

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
yeah I that and this one of those things

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.629 
yeah I that and this one of those things
gotta<00:05:00.080> learn<00:05:00.250> sometimes<00:05:01.250> it's<00:05:01.430> what<00:05:01.550> you

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
gotta learn sometimes it's what you

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.670 
gotta learn sometimes it's what you
gotta<00:05:01.789> do<00:05:01.939> to<00:05:01.970> beat<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.330> good<00:05:02.509> guys<00:05:02.689> it's<00:05:03.590> a

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.200 
gotta do to beat the good guys it's a
strat<00:05:03.949> it's<00:05:04.250> just<00:05:04.430> like<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.580> chess<00:05:04.849> master

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.969 
to be smart as well as disciplined and
aggressive<00:05:11.180> so<00:05:11.689> it's<00:05:12.169> combination<00:05:12.770> of<00:05:12.860> all

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
aggressive so it's combination of all

aggressive so it's combination of all
those<00:05:13.189> things<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:14.030> that's<00:05:14.840> what<00:05:15.050> we<00:05:15.139> gotta<00:05:15.319> do

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469 
those things and that's what we gotta do

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.679 
those things and that's what we gotta do
this<00:05:15.590> year<00:05:15.800> school<00:05:16.060> absolutely<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.180> know

you<00:05:39.289> can<00:05:39.560> match<00:05:39.710> up<00:05:39.949> there

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.450 

and<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:43.020> this<00:05:43.140> year<00:05:43.350> we've<00:05:43.800> got<00:05:43.950> a<00:05:43.980> different

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
and so this year we've got a different

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.100 
and so this year we've got a different
team<00:05:44.610> different<00:05:44.850> individuals<00:05:45.600> different

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
team different individuals different

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.040 
team different individuals different
situation<00:05:46.680> different<00:05:47.570> opportunity<00:05:48.570> realize

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
situation different opportunity realize

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.510 
situation different opportunity realize
in<00:05:49.230> my<00:05:49.320> philosophy<00:05:49.830> would<00:05:49.920> say<00:05:50.070> let's<00:05:50.280> go<00:05:50.400> out

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
in my philosophy would say let's go out

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.240 
in my philosophy would say let's go out
fight<00:05:50.730> these<00:05:50.910> guys<00:05:51.120> I<00:05:51.720> think<00:05:52.530> that<00:05:52.710> maybe<00:05:52.980> kind

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
fight these guys I think that maybe kind

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.670 
fight these guys I think that maybe kind
of<00:05:53.280> plays<00:05:53.490> right<00:05:53.730> into<00:05:53.760> their<00:05:54.650> philosophy<00:05:55.650> a

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
of plays right into their philosophy a

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.290 
of plays right into their philosophy a
little<00:05:55.920> bit<00:05:56.010> because<00:05:56.190> i'll<00:05:56.520> use<00:05:56.730> that<00:05:56.970> against

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
little bit because i'll use that against

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.330 
little bit because i'll use that against
you

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
you

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.520

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
and that just comes from my having

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.200
