just<00:00:13.650> like<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> was<00:00:14.280> highlighting<00:00:14.580> that

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
just like what I was highlighting that

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.150 
just like what I was highlighting that
sort<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> thing<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:16.289> basically<00:00:16.680> what's<00:00:16.949> going

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
sort of thing and basically what's going

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.179 
sort of thing and basically what's going
on<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.820> clip<00:00:18.560> if<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.650> think<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.039> little

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
on in the clip if I think it's a little

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.759 
on in the clip if I think it's a little
bit<00:00:20.279> harder<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.580> spot<00:00:21.289> and<00:00:22.289> people<00:00:22.560> may<00:00:22.680> have

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
bit harder to spot and people may have

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.279 
bit harder to spot and people may have
missed<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.420> first<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.689> got<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> intro

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
missed it first that we got the intro

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.890 
missed it first that we got the intro
which<00:00:25.650> changed<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> bunch<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.029> times<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.630> I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
which changed a bunch of times and I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.150 
which changed a bunch of times and I
finally<00:00:28.260> settled<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> pretty

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
finally settled for a pretty

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.060 
finally settled for a pretty
minimalistic<00:00:29.820> qaida<00:00:30.240> X<00:00:30.890> appearing<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
minimalistic qaida X appearing on the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.889 
minimalistic qaida X appearing on the
beat<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:33.710> old-time<00:00:34.710> song<00:00:35.390> from<00:00:36.390> Hydra<00:00:36.690> 8

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
beat of the old-time song from Hydra 8

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.560 
beat of the old-time song from Hydra 8
which<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.680> used<00:00:38.550> basically<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
which I used basically because of the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600 
which I used basically because of the
nostalgia<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.530> because<00:00:41.190> I'm<00:00:41.309> gonna<00:00:41.430> be

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
nostalgia of it and because I'm gonna be

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.510 
nostalgia of it and because I'm gonna be
using<00:00:41.790> some<00:00:41.910> 80<00:00:42.180> clips<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.950> thought<00:00:44.250> I'd<00:00:44.340> fit

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
using some 80 clips so I thought I'd fit

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.729 
using some 80 clips so I thought I'd fit
it<00:00:44.670> quite<00:00:44.850> well<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.899> transitioned<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it quite well it transitioned into the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.440 
it quite well it transitioned into the
song<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.070> decided<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.550> use<00:00:47.670> after<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
song I decided to use after that for the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.860 
song I decided to use after that for the
shadowfiend<00:00:48.989> knock<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:50.160> poly<00:00:50.520> clip<00:00:50.870> into

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
shadowfiend knock back on poly clip into

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.830 
shadowfiend knock back on poly clip into
shadow<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.230> Def<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.219> song<00:00:53.460> was

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
shadow at Def and that song was

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.670 
shadow at Def and that song was
influential<00:00:54.840> pass<00:00:55.199> by<00:00:55.500> MIT<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.079> I<00:00:58.079> used

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
influential pass by MIT is and I used

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.549 
influential pass by MIT is and I used
this<00:00:58.829> clip<00:00:59.070> first<00:00:59.280> because<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.809> pretty

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
this clip first because it was pretty

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.700 
this clip first because it was pretty
much<00:01:01.710> unseen<00:01:02.190> before<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.110> I<00:01:04.110> thought<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.619> was

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
much unseen before and I thought it was

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
much unseen before and I thought it was
a<00:01:04.799> good<00:01:04.920> clip<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.309> start<00:01:05.400> off<00:01:05.670> slow<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> then

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
a good clip to start off slow and then

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.210 
a good clip to start off slow and then
just<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> burst<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.619> adrenaline<00:01:07.740> with

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
just get like a burst of adrenaline with

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.880 
just get like a burst of adrenaline with
the<00:01:08.310> music<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.420> viewers<00:01:09.930> like

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the music and get the viewers like

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
the music and get the viewers like
pumped<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.400> about<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.820> was<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
pumped up about what was going on and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.469 
pumped up about what was going on and
what<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.020> coming<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:14.360> interrupted<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
what was coming up I interrupted the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
what was coming up I interrupted the
clip<00:01:15.689> pretty<00:01:15.900> abruptly<00:01:16.290> early<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.830> because

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
clip pretty abruptly early on because

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.980 
clip pretty abruptly early on because
the<00:01:18.150> rest<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> clip<00:01:18.659> wasn't<00:01:18.930> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the rest of the clip wasn't that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.149 
the rest of the clip wasn't that
interesting<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> didn't<00:01:19.680> want<00:01:19.799> people<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> get

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
interesting I didn't want people to get

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.010 
interesting I didn't want people to get
bored<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> start<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.509> reason<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
bored right at the start the reason I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.620 
bored right at the start the reason I
ended<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.100> abruptly<00:01:23.610> was<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.119> create<00:01:24.330> an

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
ended it so abruptly was to create an

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.160 
ended it so abruptly was to create an
atmosphere<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.549> kind<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.640> glitchy<00:01:26.900> editing<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
atmosphere of kind of glitchy editing to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.510 
atmosphere of kind of glitchy editing to
set<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> user<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> rest<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.369> maybe

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
set the user up for the rest and maybe

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.910 
set the user up for the rest and maybe
while<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> same<00:01:30.390> time<00:01:30.630> keeping<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.560> pretty

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
while at the same time keeping it pretty

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.810 
while at the same time keeping it pretty
minimalistic<00:01:33.079> which<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.320> how<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> edit<00:01:35.250> for

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
minimalistic which is how I edit for

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.030 
minimalistic which is how I edit for
most<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> rest<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> movie

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
most of the rest of the movie

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
most of the rest of the movie
so<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> first<00:01:38.340> clips<00:01:38.579> pretty<00:01:38.850> sure<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.420> an

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
so the first clips pretty sure it's an

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
so the first clips pretty sure it's an
RNP<00:01:40.110> mirror<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.530> blades<00:01:40.770> edge<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.790> mainly

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
RNP mirror on blades edge and it mainly

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
RNP mirror on blades edge and it mainly
features<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> mind<00:01:42.930> control<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.229> Raikou<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
features a mind control and Raikou and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.010 
features a mind control and Raikou and
then<00:01:45.090> me<00:01:45.240> running<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> whole<00:01:45.689> length<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.760 
bridge to get the kill on kuna and I
chose<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.799> clip<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:51.200> it's<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
chose this clip because it's not that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.280 
chose this clip because it's not that
fast<00:01:52.979> paced<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.579> start<00:01:53.909> off<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
fast paced to start off with but it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.609 
fast paced to start off with but it
still<00:01:55.560> shows<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> lot<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.100> good<00:01:56.250> stuff<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
still shows a lot of good stuff and I

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.450 
still shows a lot of good stuff and I
thought<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.740> was<00:01:58.829> generally<00:01:59.310> pretty

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
thought it was generally pretty

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.480 
thought it was generally pretty
entertaining<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.210> start<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> movie<00:02:00.840> with

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
entertaining to start out a movie with

entertaining to start out a movie with
so<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.000> me<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.420> throwing<00:02:03.630> out

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
so here you can see me just throwing out

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.209 
so here you can see me just throwing out
some<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.110> throwing<00:02:04.560> out<00:02:04.649> some<00:02:04.799> dispels

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
some you throwing out some dispels

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.069 
some you throwing out some dispels
trying<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> avoid<00:02:06.180> polymorphs<00:02:06.689> as<00:02:06.780> much<00:02:06.930> as

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
trying to avoid polymorphs as much as

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
trying to avoid polymorphs as much as
possible<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.799> getting<00:02:08.789> them<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.940> use<00:02:09.060> deep

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
possible and getting them to use deep

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.110 
possible and getting them to use deep
freeze<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.080> now<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.430> gets<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.730> free<00:02:11.910> poly

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
freeze to do it now you gets a free poly

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.540 
freeze to do it now you gets a free poly
without<00:02:12.390> deep<00:02:12.540> freezing<00:02:12.930> means<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.200> can

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
without deep freezing means you can

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.510 
without deep freezing means you can
offensively<00:02:14.060> for<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.050> dr<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.560> they<00:02:16.310> get<00:02:16.490> a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
offensively for that dr and they get a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.800 
offensively for that dr and they get a
lot<00:02:16.610> more<00:02:16.790> pressure<00:02:17.030> due<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.750> we

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
lot more pressure due to that and we

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.270 
lot more pressure due to that and we
have<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.930> use<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> lot<00:02:18.260> more<00:02:18.290> cooldowns<00:02:18.710> so

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
have to use a lot more cooldowns so

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.130 
have to use a lot more cooldowns so
here's<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.490> mind<00:02:19.700> control<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.750> no<00:02:20.840> but<00:02:20.990> just

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
here's a mind control for no but just

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.210 
here's a mind control for no but just
happens<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.440> Polly<00:02:21.680> um<00:02:21.770> at<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.920> same<00:02:22.040> time

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
happens to Polly um at the same time

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.930

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
that's okay and here I'm pairing the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.520 
that's okay and here I'm pairing the
camera<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.240> lot<00:02:26.390> because<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:26.990> want<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.290> see<00:02:27.380> when
