utilize<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.100> virtual<00:00:14.820> photo<00:00:15.180> studio<00:00:15.779> to

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
utilize a virtual photo studio to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.380 
utilize a virtual photo studio to
essentially<00:00:16.890> eliminate<00:00:17.240> environment<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
essentially eliminate environment and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.630 
essentially eliminate environment and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
here I have an automotive scene set up

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.419 
here I have an automotive scene set up
with<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.749> model<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.560> was<00:00:28.679> imported<00:00:29.070> using

different studio view sets one of which
has<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> camera<00:00:41.460> animation<00:00:41.760> applied<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.840> I

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.730 

also<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.240> a<00:00:51.270> ground<00:00:51.630> plane<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.320> clip<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
also have a ground plane to clip the

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.320 
also have a ground plane to clip the
tires<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:54.560> horizon<00:00:55.560> plane<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.460> reflections

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.270 

now<00:01:00.330> I<00:01:00.360> can<00:01:00.690> delete<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.290> existing<00:01:01.410> vehicle

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
now I can delete the existing vehicle

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.450 
now I can delete the existing vehicle
and<00:01:02.870> save<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.080> scene<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.619> use<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> starting

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and save the scene to use as a starting

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.429 
and save the scene to use as a starting
point<00:01:05.820> whenever<00:01:06.390> working<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:07.049> similar

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
point whenever working with similar

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.569 
point whenever working with similar
models<00:01:09.049> for<00:01:10.049> example<00:01:10.590> I'll<00:01:10.770> import<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.549> new

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
models for example I'll import a new

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.419 
models for example I'll import a new
model<00:01:12.179> adding<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> scene<00:01:13.259> using<00:01:14.189> heap

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
model adding to scene using heap

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.510 
model adding to scene using heap
original<00:01:14.969> size<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.869> material<00:01:16.409> template<00:01:16.890> so

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
original size and a material template so

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.840 
original size and a material template so
the<00:01:17.670> scene<00:01:17.909> requires<00:01:18.090> very<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:19.020> setup<00:01:19.850> now

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the scene requires very little setup now

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.539 
the scene requires very little setup now
I<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.329> toggle<00:01:21.600> between<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:22.229> view<00:01:22.469> sets<00:01:22.710> adding

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
I can toggle between my view sets adding

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:34.160 
I can toggle between my view sets adding
each<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> cue

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.530 

furthermore<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.400> camera<00:01:35.790> animation<00:01:36.330> is

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
furthermore the camera animation is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.899 
furthermore the camera animation is
still<00:01:36.900> present<00:01:37.440> and<00:01:37.560> ready<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> render<00:01:38.640> with
