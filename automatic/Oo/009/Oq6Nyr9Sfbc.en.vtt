00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
matchup and I think you know if West

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.660 
matchup and I think you know if West
gets<00:02:33.900> off<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> slow<00:02:34.470> start<00:02:34.500> or<00:02:35.070> fumbles<00:02:35.520> I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
gets off to a slow start or fumbles I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.729 
gets off to a slow start or fumbles I
think<00:02:35.910> his<00:02:36.090> lease<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.660> gonna<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:36.959> very<00:02:37.200> shorter

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
think his lease is gonna be very shorter

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.680 
think his lease is gonna be very shorter
than<00:02:37.890> throw<00:02:38.100> Ben<00:02:38.310> Tate<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.060> think

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
than throw Ben Tate in there I think

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.660 
than throw Ben Tate in there I think
there's<00:02:39.840> less<00:02:40.050> ?<00:02:40.530> surround<00:02:41.070> raining<00:02:41.430> i<00:02:41.520> would

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.720 
our forms last week about him before he
was<00:03:26.760> announced<00:03:27.239> being<00:03:27.980> deactivated<00:03:28.980> was

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.060

enacted<00:03:30.120> for<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.360> game<00:03:30.870> last<00:03:31.110> week<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.530> I

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
enacted for the game last week and I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.410 
enacted for the game last week and I
think<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.370> was<00:03:32.519> silly<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.880> think<00:03:33.000> about

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
think it was silly to think about

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.840 
think it was silly to think about
starting<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.959> then<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.280> still<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:35.760> it's

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
starting and then and I still think it's

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.130 
starting and then and I still think it's
kind<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.090> silly<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.390> think<00:03:36.510> about<00:03:36.750> starting<00:03:36.989> up

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
kind of silly to think about starting up

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.800 
kind of silly to think about starting up
now<00:03:37.200> even<00:03:37.769> now<00:03:37.799> he<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.250> going<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.790> play<00:03:39.000> it's

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
now even now he is going to play it's

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.390 
now even now he is going to play it's
too<00:03:40.110> risky<00:03:40.320> we<00:03:40.769> don't<00:03:40.890> know<00:03:41.100> what's<00:03:41.280> gonna

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
too risky we don't know what's gonna

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.640 
too risky we don't know what's gonna
happen<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:42.030> mean<00:03:42.209> they<00:03:42.750> could<00:03:42.989> he<00:03:43.320> might<00:03:43.500> get
