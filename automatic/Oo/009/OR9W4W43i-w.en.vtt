thick lashing thing so you can actually

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
thick lashing thing so you can actually
lash<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.730> down<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> pack<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.629> want<00:00:48.890> and

was<00:00:57.480> clanking<00:00:58.079> around<00:00:58.489> over<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.520> we<00:00:59.789> have

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
was clanking around over here we have

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.779 
was clanking around over here we have
our<00:01:00.090> latch<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.020> our<00:01:01.170> two<00:01:01.320> hinges

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
our latch here we have our two hinges

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.130 
our latch here we have our two hinges
here<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.090> our<00:01:03.270> pressure<00:01:03.719> equalization

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
here we have our pressure equalization

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500 
here we have our pressure equalization
valve<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:05.909> equalize<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> pressure

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
valve so that will equalize the pressure

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.690 
valve so that will equalize the pressure
if<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> plane<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.460> need

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
if you're on a plane so you do not need

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.340 
if you're on a plane so you do not need
to<00:01:08.820> worry<00:01:08.970> about<00:01:09.060> your<00:01:09.600> products<00:01:10.110> getting

to worry about your products getting
damaged<00:01:10.799> inside<00:01:11.600> because<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.810> pressure

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
damaged inside because of pressure

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.090 
damaged inside because of pressure
changes<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.340> air<00:01:15.350> on<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> bottom<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:17.070> just

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
changes in the air on the bottom we just

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.710 
changes in the air on the bottom we just
simply<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.150> plastic<00:01:18.689> case<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:21.630> you're

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
simply have a plastic case so if you're

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.350 
simply have a plastic case so if you're
going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.930> open<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.200> latch<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.619> very<00:01:22.830> strong

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
going to open the latch it's very strong

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.850 
going to open the latch it's very strong
if<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> go<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.810> open<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.619> will

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
if you go on and open this up this will

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
if you go on and open this up this will
stay<00:01:26.159> open<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> about<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
stay open as you can see up to about a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.179 
stay open as you can see up to about a
ninety<00:01:28.200> degree<00:01:28.320> angle<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.009> any

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
ninety degree angle if you go any

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:29.749 
ninety degree angle if you go any
further<00:01:29.340> than<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
further than that

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.550 
further than that
it<00:01:30.240> won't<00:01:30.450> balance<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.579> it<00:01:32.579> will<00:01:32.850> fall<00:01:33.560> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it won't balance and it will fall so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.899 
it won't balance and it will fall so
let's<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.890> leave<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.070> there<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:35.790> we

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
let's just leave it there and here we

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.380 
let's just leave it there and here we
have<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.650> this<00:01:37.650> actual<00:01:38.070> rubber<00:01:38.460> thing<00:01:39.180> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
have this this actual rubber thing and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.569 
have this this actual rubber thing and
it<00:01:39.479> acts<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> gasket<00:01:40.439> against<00:01:40.799> water<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
it acts as a gasket against water and

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.350 
it acts as a gasket against water and
also<00:01:42.030> acts<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:43.490> shock<00:01:44.490> resistant<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.210> all

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
also acts as a shock resistant with all

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.780 
also acts as a shock resistant with all
these<00:01:45.509> bumpy<00:01:46.049> pads<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
these bumpy pads as you can see here you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.429 
these bumpy pads as you can see here you
can<00:01:47.820> actually<00:01:48.210> remove<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.689> easily<00:01:49.079> just

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
can actually remove this easily just

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440 
can actually remove this easily just
peel<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.710> out<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> wouldn't<00:01:51.299> recommend

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
peel it out but I wouldn't recommend

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
peel it out but I wouldn't recommend
that<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.079> things<00:01:52.829> will<00:01:52.979> slide<00:01:53.220> around

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that because things will slide around

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.170 
that because things will slide around
and<00:01:53.700> also<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.000> won't<00:01:54.149> get<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.950> o-ring<00:01:56.820> seal

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and also you won't get the o-ring seal

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.300 
and also you won't get the o-ring seal
that<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.229> inside<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.280> I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that you get with this inside so I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.330 
that you get with this inside so I
actually<00:01:59.610> use<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.210> keep<00:02:00.540> all<00:02:01.170> my

that there
here<00:02:21.519> I<00:02:21.549> have<00:02:21.790> my<00:02:22.030> DIY<00:02:22.689> diffuser<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.239> will

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
here I have my DIY diffuser and I will

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.929 
here I have my DIY diffuser and I will
just<00:02:25.689> go<00:02:25.870> ahead<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.519> roll<00:02:27.519> this<00:02:27.730> up<00:02:32.549> here<00:02:33.549> and

just go ahead and roll this up here and

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.559 
just go ahead and roll this up here and
this<00:02:34.390> fits<00:02:34.689> in<00:02:34.900> well<00:02:35.470> like<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.569> then

this fits in well like that and then

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.979

less<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.290> even<00:02:38.530> put<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:39.040> lens<00:02:39.280> pin<00:02:39.549> in<00:02:39.700> there

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
less I can even put a lens pin in there

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.720 
less I can even put a lens pin in there
and<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.109> should<00:02:41.349> all<00:02:41.500> close<00:02:41.769> perfectly<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.670> if

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and it should all close perfectly so if

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.349 
and it should all close perfectly so if
you<00:02:42.819> do<00:02:42.939> this

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
you do this

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.420 
you do this
things<00:02:44.109> won't<00:02:44.260> shake<00:02:44.530> around<00:02:44.650> too<00:02:44.920> much<00:02:45.129> and

things won't shake around too much and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.610 
things won't shake around too much and
if<00:02:46.209> it's<00:02:46.420> perfectly<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.019> everything's<00:02:47.409> nice

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
if it's perfectly and everything's nice

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.679
