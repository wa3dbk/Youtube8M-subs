right<00:00:03.810> okay<00:00:04.259> so<00:00:04.319> I've<00:00:04.770> got<00:00:04.980> something<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.609> bit

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
right okay so I've got something a bit

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.789 
right okay so I've got something a bit
different<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.660> show<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:06.899> today<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
different to show you today with the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.790 
different to show you today with the
Samsung<00:00:08.040> Galaxy<00:00:08.250> Note<00:00:08.760> 10.1<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and that is a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.669 
Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and that is a
paintbrush<00:00:11.519> called<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.509> flown<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.530> has

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
paintbrush called the flown that has

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.829 
paintbrush called the flown that has
been<00:00:13.920> designed<00:00:14.340> specifically<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.089> tablets

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
been designed specifically for tablets

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.320 
been designed specifically for tablets
and<00:00:15.990> smartphones<00:00:17.000> there's<00:00:18.000> actually<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
and smartphones there's actually a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.570 
and smartphones there's actually a
Kickstarter<00:00:18.960> project<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> bought<00:00:20.369> is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
Kickstarter project that I bought is

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.099 
Kickstarter project that I bought is
quite<00:00:21.029> while<00:00:21.240> ago<00:00:21.480> now<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.750> probably<00:00:21.960> at<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
quite while ago now it's probably at the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.300 
quite while ago now it's probably at the
end<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.320> last<00:00:22.500> year<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:24.619> it<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.769> perfect<00:00:26.189> for

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
end of last year and it is perfect for

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.130 
end of last year and it is perfect for
the<00:00:26.369> note<00:00:26.519> 10.1<00:00:26.849> because<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.779> its<00:00:27.900> pressure

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the note 10.1 because of its pressure

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.950 
the note 10.1 because of its pressure
sensitivity<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:30.060> brush<00:00:30.269> works<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.840> well

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
sensitivity the brush works really well

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.729 
sensitivity the brush works really well
with<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.850> did<00:00:32.850> give<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> try<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.739> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
with it I did give it a try with the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
with it I did give it a try with the
original<00:00:34.890> note<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> does<00:00:35.880> work<00:00:36.090> well<00:00:36.120> with

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
original note and it does work well with

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.900 
original note and it does work well with
that<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.410> note<00:00:37.559> 10.1<00:00:37.829> bigger<00:00:38.610> surface

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that but the note 10.1 bigger surface

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.450 
that but the note 10.1 bigger surface
area<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.960> pressure<00:00:40.200> sensitivity<00:00:40.770> has<00:00:41.219> been

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
area the pressure sensitivity has been

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.459 
area the pressure sensitivity has been
improved<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.050> better<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.440> general

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
improved so it's just better in general

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.810 
improved so it's just better in general
for<00:00:43.920> using<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> paintbrush<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> I've

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
for using the paintbrush with so I've

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.330 
for using the paintbrush with so I've
got<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.090> little<00:00:48.300> tennis<00:00:49.200> Android<00:00:49.829> figurine

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
got this little tennis Android figurine

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.479 
got this little tennis Android figurine
that<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> paint<00:00:50.969> today<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:52.489> I'm

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
that I'm going to paint today and I'm

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.180 
that I'm going to paint today and I'm
using<00:00:53.820> an<00:00:54.239> app<00:00:54.510> called<00:00:54.930> markers<00:00:55.590> which<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
using an app called markers which is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.889 
using an app called markers which is
actually<00:00:56.399> created<00:00:57.030> by<00:00:57.120> google<00:00:57.390> employee

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
actually created by google employee

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.010 
actually created by google employee
called<00:00:58.199> Daniel<00:00:58.890> Sandler<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.870> it's<00:01:00.870> probably

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
called Daniel Sandler and it's probably

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.439 
called Daniel Sandler and it's probably
one<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> best<00:01:01.620> painting<00:01:02.399> apps<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.910> I've

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
one of the best painting apps that I've

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.149 
one of the best painting apps that I've
come<00:01:03.750> across<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.170> Android<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.920> pressure

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
come across for Android the pressure

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.260 
come across for Android the pressure
sensitivity<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.030> very<00:01:06.270> good<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.340> yet

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
sensitivity is very good on it and yet

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.300 
sensitivity is very good on it and yet
it<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.630> works<00:01:10.020> very<00:01:10.260> well<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.130> brass

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it just works very well with the brass

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.130 
it just works very well with the brass
wit<00:01:11.549> even<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> stylus<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.720> finger

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
wit even with a stylus with your finger

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.460 
wit even with a stylus with your finger
it<00:01:14.130> works<00:01:14.280> very<00:01:14.490> well<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
it works very well so just going to do a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.190 
it works very well so just going to do a
quick<00:01:16.680> size<00:01:17.189> comparison<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> stylus

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
quick size comparison with the stylus

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.429 
quick size comparison with the stylus
that<00:01:19.380> comes<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> note<00:01:20.220> 10.1<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> there<00:01:22.350> you

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that comes with a note 10.1 so there you

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.350 
that comes with a note 10.1 so there you
can<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.729> s-pen<00:01:24.150> that's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
can see that that's the s-pen that's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.289 
can see that that's the s-pen that's
included<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.049> note<00:01:25.229> 10.1<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:26.670> this

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
included with a note 10.1 and then this

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.600 
included with a note 10.1 and then this
is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.509> flow<00:01:27.900> which<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.829> weighted<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.520> same

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
is the flow which is weighted the same

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.960 
is the flow which is weighted the same
as<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> normal<00:01:30.060> paintbrush<00:01:30.750> same<00:01:31.020> size<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:32.100> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
as a normal paintbrush same size if you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.640 
as a normal paintbrush same size if you
picked<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.659> would<00:01:34.110> think<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.500> was<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
picked it up you would think it was a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
picked it up you would think it was a
normal<00:01:34.829> paintbrush<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.729> you've<00:01:35.880> got<00:01:36.030> these

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
normal paintbrush but you've got these

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.280 
normal paintbrush but you've got these
bristles<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.759> used<00:01:38.960> for<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> touch

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
bristles that are used for the touch

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.260 
bristles that are used for the touch
screen<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.360> does<00:01:42.509> work<00:01:42.540> very<00:01:42.780> well<00:01:43.079> so

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
screen and it does work very well so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
screen and it does work very well so
even<00:01:45.270> selecting<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> tools<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.649> markers

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
even selecting the tools in the markers

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.800 
even selecting the tools in the markers
up<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.970> need<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.240> use<00:01:48.360> your<00:01:48.540> finger

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
up you don't need to use your finger

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.330 
up you don't need to use your finger
it's<00:01:48.899> sensitive<00:01:49.259> enough<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:49.890> pick<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it's sensitive enough to just pick up a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.969 
it's sensitive enough to just pick up a
touch<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> paintbrush<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.799> get

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
touch of the paintbrush so just get

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.560 
touch of the paintbrush so just get
started<00:01:53.280> sketching<00:01:53.729> out<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.030> little<00:01:54.299> android

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
started sketching out the little android

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.149 
started sketching out the little android
man

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.569 

so<00:02:02.060> this<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:02.719> is<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.049> thinnest<00:02:03.890> i've<00:02:04.249> got

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
so this is this is the thinnest i've got

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:11.039 
so this is this is the thinnest i've got
it<00:02:04.700> on<00:02:04.819> so<00:02:05.119> i<00:02:05.149> just<00:02:06.579> make<00:02:07.579> it<00:02:07.609> a<00:02:07.789> bit<00:02:07.999> thicker

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.630 

and<00:02:12.049> not<00:02:12.290> got<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> solid<00:02:12.709> fill<00:02:13.069> their<00:02:13.280> actually

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
and not got a solid fill their actually

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.820 
and not got a solid fill their actually
would<00:02:13.819> just<00:02:14.000> change<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.049> filter<00:02:15.440> solid<00:02:17.830> now

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
would just change the filter solid now

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.229 
would just change the filter solid now
you<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:19.069> see<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.340> starting<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.760> sketch<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.030> out

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
you can see it starting to sketch it out

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.509 
you can see it starting to sketch it out
a<00:02:20.299> bit<00:02:20.360> better<00:02:20.629> so<00:02:21.349> it's<00:02:21.590> very<00:02:21.739> sensitive<00:02:22.099> to

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
a bit better so it's very sensitive to

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.869 
a bit better so it's very sensitive to
the<00:02:22.640> touch<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.090> brush<00:02:24.519> which<00:02:25.519> makes<00:02:25.760> it

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
the touch of the brush which makes it

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.170 
the touch of the brush which makes it
easy<00:02:26.060> for<00:02:26.180> sketching<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.670> markers<00:02:28.670> app<00:02:28.849> comes

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
easy for sketching the markers app comes

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.150 
easy for sketching the markers app comes
with<00:02:29.390> several<00:02:29.810> different<00:02:30.260> thickness<00:02:30.709> sizes

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
with several different thickness sizes

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.770 
with several different thickness sizes
so<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.370> can<00:02:31.670> change<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.120> quite<00:02:32.330> easily<00:02:32.510> if<00:02:32.690> you

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
so you can change it quite easily if you

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.660 
so you can change it quite easily if you
want<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.049> feel<00:02:33.260> more<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.650> surface<00:02:34.069> area<00:02:34.430> so

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
want to feel more of the surface area so

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.309 
want to feel more of the surface area so
here<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.700> go<00:02:37.819> my<00:02:38.599> painting<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.170> drawing

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
here we go my painting and drawing

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.890 
here we go my painting and drawing
skills<00:02:39.680> don't<00:02:39.980> really<00:02:40.310> do<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:41.120> brush<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.720> the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
skills don't really do the brush and the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.819 
skills don't really do the brush and the

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
note 10.1 combination justice so there

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.880

to use a solid feel you can make it a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.550 
to use a solid feel you can make it a
bit<00:03:38.150> translucent<00:03:38.540> which<00:03:39.020> means<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.350> can

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
bit translucent which means you can

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.530 
bit translucent which means you can
layer<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:39.860> so<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.850> know<00:03:40.970> if<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.120> did<00:03:41.300> want<00:03:41.420> to

paint flesh tones and you can build up a
bit<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.900> color<00:03:45.110> profile
