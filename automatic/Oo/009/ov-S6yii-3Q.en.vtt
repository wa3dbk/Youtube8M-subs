00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hi how are you I hope that very well this 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.509
 I'll make a video in defense to one of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.719
 the greatest heroes of all 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.190
 that's how I talk about superman 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.440
 warrior who fights for the good and the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.880
 justice and revolutionized the concept of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.000
 well against evil and the hero that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.770
 protects and helps the weakest I am 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 making this video since lately 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.060
 there is a wave of sandy that offend 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.189
 unfairly being that if superman 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.859
 there would not be the world of heroes 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.689
 it would be the same as we know it in 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.120
 First you should know that 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.340
 superman is the most recognized superhero 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.780
 in reference to comics besides being 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.239
 source of inspiration for many 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 authors of comics and even sleeves and today 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.680
 in day it is recognized as an icon 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.690
 world and an example to follow 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.460
 Below I will put a list of the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.770
 why superman deserves respect and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.379
 refute the silly arguments that tend 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.079
 use the superman hackers one 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.539
 Superman is a symbol of us as 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.390
 rubs us the flag of the USA in the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 This is one face of the arguments more 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.899
 fools that can be used since in 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.700
 First place has nothing wrong with 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.810
 feel proud of your country and in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.909
 second place 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.979
 it was Captain America which if 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.979
 completely rubs us the flag of 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.360
 us as if it were the maximum 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.850
 representative of america since in case 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.570
 Americans do not know America 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.880
 it is a continent not a country two superman 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.920
 it lacks good plot sense this 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.750
 it's not too bad since there are times in 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.000
 those that superman does not raise more than a 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.100
 building but in other versions it moves 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.720
 planets but it happens and it turns out that 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.700
 all the superman comics are 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.619
 inconsistent since that depends on the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.600
 story line and writer who 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.819
 bring the story to superman now 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.009
 often there are inconsistencies since 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.479
 superman suffers ugly nerdy constants for 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.630
 Do not fall for the ridiculous 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.830
 now they will ask what is an ugly nerd 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.929
 consists of limiting and weakening 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.349
 skills of a character very levels 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:58.530
 completely different from the original 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:00.689
 goku example in the crossovers as well 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.819
 we know goku is able to defeat very 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.039
 easily to torrico and to lutfi but in 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.020
 an ugly crossover sener to the character to 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.330
 that the combat is more even and no 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.519
 humble character to the other or also to 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.100
 give it a better argument and not fall 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.410
 in the ridiculous the same 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.240
 with superman 3 the stories of 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.460
 superheroes and superman are already very 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.290
 boring as they lack history what 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.390
 of now is the anime and the manga this 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.340
 argument is already a matter of likes and 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.350
 that there are comics that are very good but 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.420
 there are also comics that are very bad and 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.340
 there are also very good sleeves like 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.260
 there are also others that are bad that already 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.290
 It depends on the reader if he liked or 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.980
 not well to conclude this issue put on 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.870
 to think 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.300
 worth insulting a being 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.890
 supposes is dedicated to doing good helping 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.840
 to the weak and defeat beings 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.200
 malignant that threaten to kill beings 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.630
 innocent of course not a being so 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.760
 kind and with very good stories besides 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.090
 to be charismatic and generous deserves 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.090
 respect
