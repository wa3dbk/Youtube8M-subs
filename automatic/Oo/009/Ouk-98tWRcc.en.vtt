00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.429
 I do not tip you here today. 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:11.130
 indicates that many people are asking me 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.160
 touch showing only the bottom of the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.220
 stove because the tip of today I will not 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.880
 talk about the intensity of the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.640
 calls when we compare the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.939
 homemade broth at home anyone 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.310
 always recommend a very low fire 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.380
 very very very low 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.300
 We need a baking or not. 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.640
 bed too slow 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:51.020
 so here O this flame that you are 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:51.020
 watching how it is was not turning off the fire 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.370
 high heat tiny little mouth and 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.820
 now here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.600
 we will regulate like any stove the fire 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.600
 fire ax download in the rain the third 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.310
 low fire 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.560
 only this low fire is still not low 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.549
 enough to prepare our car 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.250
 from the housekeeper 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.790
 we need the fire even lower 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.329
 almost disconnected and there it has 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.759
 a cool tip I'll show 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.070
 now for you to discover with a student 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.030
 I also learn a lot in my 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.600
 classrooms 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.960
 we're here too on low heat 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:47.549
 I'll even focus on Nuno Bothell 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.530
 and then I show the Olympic flame to the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.549
 normal low fire is that you have 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.549
 what to play but light here turns high fire 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:05.119
 Then you 'll pretend you're going 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.460
 turn off the stove is pretending 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.530
 It will turn off only doing too much. 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.470
 slowly that did not come back like hold 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.300
 the button and the flame here I want to show 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.380
 For you, how am I doing super? 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.390
 slowly 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.310
 then focus on two things make 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.550
 turn off the chimney name is there 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.550
 also 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:37.040
 Now you call it to be tiny to 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.810
 realize how well she was not only lacking 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.970
 to do this here is our ideal flame 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.019
 for the slow cooking not only of broth 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.440
 of meat 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.400
 we had a load of panela in the ground 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.700
 beans it is clear that cooking in a 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.160
 Your little flame is going to be much more 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.350
 slow will be more time consuming but we 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.150
 either our tasty and 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.420
 healthy because you leave this 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.120
 knowledge is to protect a 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.030
 series of things good substances in the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.430
 your food you do not destroy the food 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:23.180
 understood that his food was charred 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.489
 now I'm going to make such was the high and 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.319
 Remember how I'll say it back very slowly. 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:33.380
 as if I were going to turn off your account 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:37.010
 gmail slowly slowly 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.340
 it also begins to decrease the team in the 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.959
 state is that flame you can 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.970
 to realize the video is still a bit 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:49.400
 mouth then did not talk for 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:52.040
 Up just making you here got super 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.560
 low hugo so this is the fire that the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.660
 people want our call here or not summer 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.690
 the note 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.060
 cook the rice is but look at the pan 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.230
 the chicken broth and look at the 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.120
 broth 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.960
 that alongside the others they are 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.500
 So much, then, this slow fire is 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.560
 cool because it will not even let the broth 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.330
 tv you will realize from this the broth 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:23.170
 your beans the meat of the pot the toninho 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:26.260
 You will have taken a raised boil. 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.040
 but after boiling it is this 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:34.180
 fire that has to stay for several hours 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:38.640
 until you get ready there when you leave 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:43.050
 in this language look here, the high fire 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:46.090
 This is almost out of here. 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.910
 this super soft little one is how he has to 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.070
 To be the people this tip the staff was 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.420
 stopping for some time 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.000
 Let's see if they can do it. 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.340
 I really enjoyed it. 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.610
 this tip because I always liked myself 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.760
 of using the flame diffuser between the flame 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.360
 and the preparation pan of the car but the diffuser 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.330
 Flame rose from the market has no more 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.520
 so we do not have a thing to 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.080
 People have to find another way to 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.390
 do what we need to 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.390
 get what we need right
