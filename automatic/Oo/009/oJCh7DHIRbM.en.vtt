00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.350
 last resort we ourselves reception again 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.869
 right edge my opponent starts your 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.860
 the most important task at this moment is not 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.170
 be afraid 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.369
 and meet his right straight back 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.220
 his left hand 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.500
 that is, he hits me with my left hand just 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.869
 I take aside the whole remained point 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.680
 with my left hand I take away his right side and 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.280
 at the same time running my right hand to him for 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.220

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.330
 right straight he falls lonely 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.610

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.670
 endures it just remains to bring down and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.430
 go here to him i do tack and 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.490
 Immediately in the open case the sun is yours 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.640

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.140
 you can 3 can be one and then just him 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.630
 stutter and girl 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.000
 he lies on the floor in what plus he lies on 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.430
 semi head stones to head near me 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.830
 legs there and if necessary you can immediately 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.660
 bounce you off so extreme 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.870
 the enemy axis case is greater 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.310
 and you need to immediately when to work for 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.770
 order to go to the next 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.830
 I will show the enemy from this side 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.120
 right straight kill i left hand done 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.550

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.000
 I get his right hand 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.130
 I will keep my right hand on one side 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.230
 pick another holds 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.130
 he cannot take the corps from him 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.670
 fully open and 1-2 knees of the most powerful 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.100
 in the edge 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.740
 insert the sun and then do 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.590
 just twist to the floor. 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.530
 good series but rather complicated 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.690
 how to understand not to be afraid and make this 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.810
 back with the capture right knees already 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.090
 Further what just Yasin such a second 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.090
 moment protection is very effective on 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.850
 when he is already standing in the street 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.070
 direct blows this simple elementary 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.230
 elbowing 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.260
 such a favorite thai part 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.870
 forsen ie from any blow you stand 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.840
 in stock most punches substitute it 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.209
 you put in front of your face that is and 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.910

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.970
 inserted and right or left 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.660
 put out with a point and just put up 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.550
 elbows you always cover your face 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.400
 Naturally we do not always get on 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.560
 fist and he doesn't always get on the boat but 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.170
 even if he blows yes there will pass 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.860
 some kind of coming down he will kill or into the corps 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.380
 or further flies away but we donâ€™t 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.160
