hey<00:00:00.570> everyone<00:00:01.050> in<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.410> video<00:00:01.680> I'm<00:00:02.129> going<00:00:02.340> to

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hey everyone in this video I'm going to

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey everyone in this video I'm going to
show<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.270> test<00:00:03.629> your<00:00:03.780> aquarium<00:00:04.170> water

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
show you how to test your aquarium water

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.330 
show you how to test your aquarium water
if<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:05.220> have<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.549> freshwater<00:00:06.060> fish<00:00:06.690> tank<00:00:07.340> so

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
if you have a freshwater fish tank so

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.209 
if you have a freshwater fish tank so
I'm<00:00:08.639> using<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.179> API<00:00:09.599> master<00:00:10.260> test<00:00:10.500> kit<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.010> it

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
I'm using the API master test kit and it

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.150 
I'm using the API master test kit and it
comes<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.610> an<00:00:11.940> ammonia<00:00:12.450> test<00:00:13.160> nitrite

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
comes with an ammonia test nitrite

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.620 
comes with an ammonia test nitrite
nitrate<00:00:15.049> pH<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.529> then<00:00:16.920> high<00:00:17.310> range<00:00:17.640> pH<00:00:18.150> test

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
nitrate pH and then high range pH test

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.859 
nitrate pH and then high range pH test
and<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:20.070> find<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.430> really<00:00:20.460> helpful<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.300> use<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and I find it really helpful to use a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.650 
and I find it really helpful to use a
syringe<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.769> fill<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.250> tubes<00:00:23.519> with<00:00:23.820> because

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
syringe to fill the tubes with because

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.990 
syringe to fill the tubes with because
otherwise<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> take<00:00:25.529> each<00:00:26.000> test

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
otherwise you have to take each test

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.910 
otherwise you have to take each test
tube<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.599> dip<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.109> tank<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.680> try<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
tube and dip it in the tank and try to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.669 
tube and dip it in the tank and try to
hit<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.189> 5<00:00:29.699> milliliter<00:00:30.210> mark<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.990> that's

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
hit that 5 milliliter mark and that's

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.700 
hit that 5 milliliter mark and that's
just<00:00:32.099> kind<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.790> tough<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.559> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
just kind of tough to do you have to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.620 
just kind of tough to do you have to
like<00:00:34.920> pour<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> try<00:00:35.880> again<00:00:36.149> over<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
like pour it out and try again over and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.069 
like pour it out and try again over and
over<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:38.129> makes<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.820> lot<00:00:39.000> easier<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
over so this makes it a lot easier and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.530 
over so this makes it a lot easier and
also<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.340> avoids<00:00:41.640> cross-contamination

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
also it avoids cross-contamination

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.260 
also it avoids cross-contamination
because<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.250> multiple<00:00:44.610> tanks<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
because if you have multiple tanks and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
because if you have multiple tanks and
you're<00:00:45.450> dipping<00:00:45.870> these<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.500> each<00:00:46.770> tank<00:00:47.070> here

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you're dipping these in each tank here

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.779 
you're dipping these in each tank here
obviously<00:00:48.410> cross<00:00:49.410> contaminating<00:00:50.190> every<00:00:50.520> tank

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
obviously cross contaminating every tank

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.080 
obviously cross contaminating every tank
so<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.800> syringe<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.550> each<00:00:53.699> tank

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so if you have one syringe for each tank

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.139 
so if you have one syringe for each tank
you<00:00:54.390> avoid<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:56.100> normally<00:00:56.610> what<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you avoid that so normally what I do is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
you avoid that so normally what I do is
take<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> syringe<00:00:58.320> over<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> tank<00:00:59.129> drop

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
take the syringe over to the tank drop

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.090 
take the syringe over to the tank drop
the<00:00:59.820> water<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:00.629> fill<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.859> test

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the water and then fill up the test

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.850 
the water and then fill up the test
tubes<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> purposes<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.500> video

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
tubes but for the purposes of this video

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
tubes but for the purposes of this video
I<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> little<00:01:05.880> jar<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.330> water<00:01:06.750> from

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
I just have a little jar of water from

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.969 
I just have a little jar of water from
my<00:01:07.500> tank<00:01:07.860> sitting<00:01:08.220> here<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.619> filming<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
my tank sitting here so filming this is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.910 
my tank sitting here so filming this is
easier<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.930> always<00:01:13.170> start<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
easier and I always start with the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.380 
easier and I always start with the
ammonia<00:01:14.520> test<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.540> what<00:01:15.900> you'll<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:17.390> get

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
ammonia test so what you'll do is get

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.190 
ammonia test so what you'll do is get
some<00:01:18.600> water<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.990> your<00:01:19.110> test<00:01:19.500> tube<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
some water in your test tube and you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.109 
some water in your test tube and you
want<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> fill<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.250> 5<00:01:23.580> milliliter

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
want to fill it up to this 5 milliliter

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
want to fill it up to this 5 milliliter
mark<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.200> look<00:01:25.409> closely<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> test

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
mark if you look closely at the test

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.609 
mark if you look closely at the test
tube<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.720> see<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> surface<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
tube you can see the surface of the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.640 
tube you can see the surface of the
water<00:01:28.829> forms<00:01:29.460> kind<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.060> dip<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
water forms kind of a dip down in the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
water forms kind of a dip down in the
middle<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.180> called<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> meniscus

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
middle and this is called the meniscus

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.410 
middle and this is called the meniscus
it's<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.430> water<00:01:35.640> clings<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
it's just because the water clings to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.819 
it's just because the water clings to
the<00:01:36.450> surface<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> glass<00:01:37.290> where<00:01:37.680> it's

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the surface of the glass where it's

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.850 
the surface of the glass where it's
touching<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.460> glass<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.020> want<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.650> make

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
touching the glass so you want to make

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.960 
touching the glass so you want to make
sure<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> bottom<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.689> meniscus<00:01:43.380> is

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
sure that the bottom of this meniscus is

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
sure that the bottom of this meniscus is
touching<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> 5<00:01:45.299> milliliter<00:01:45.840> mark<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.530> not

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
touching the 5 milliliter mark and not

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.859 
touching the 5 milliliter mark and not
the<00:01:47.070> top<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.299> ammonia<00:01:48.720> test<00:01:48.990> has<00:01:49.770> two

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
the top so the ammonia test has two

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.350 
the top so the ammonia test has two
bottles<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.680> use<00:01:52.920> bottle<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.729> first<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
bottles you use bottle one first and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.749 
bottles you use bottle one first and
then<00:01:54.420> bottle<00:01:54.810> two<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.890> add<00:01:56.070> eight<00:01:56.460> drops

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
then bottle two and you add eight drops

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:06.670 
then bottle two and you add eight drops
of<00:01:57.090> each<00:01:57.360> one

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.900 

and<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.040> important<00:02:08.550> when<00:02:08.729> you're

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and it's really important when you're

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.210 
and it's really important when you're
adding<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.690> drops<00:02:09.960> that<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.350> hold<00:02:10.710> every

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
adding the drops that you hold every

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.160 
adding the drops that you hold every
bottle<00:02:11.460> straight<00:02:12.090> up<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.540> down<00:02:12.600> like<00:02:12.750> this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
bottle straight up and down like this

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.620 
bottle straight up and down like this
rather<00:02:13.590> than<00:02:13.860> tilting<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.460> does<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.420> make

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
rather than tilting it does that make

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.950 
rather than tilting it does that make
sure<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.920> each<00:02:17.070> drops<00:02:17.460> are<00:02:17.960> the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
sure that the that each drops are the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.630 
sure that the that each drops are the
same<00:02:19.260> size<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:21.320> then<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.440> cap<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.220> I

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
same size so then you cap it and I

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.210 
same size so then you cap it and I
usually<00:02:23.850> take<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> paper<00:02:24.600> towel<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.320> put<00:02:26.070> it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
usually take a paper towel and put it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.680 
usually take a paper towel and put it
over<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.610> cap<00:02:26.820> because<00:02:27.180> sometimes<00:02:27.540> when

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
over the cap because sometimes when

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.140 
over the cap because sometimes when
you're<00:02:27.810> shaking<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.290> they<00:02:28.500> leak<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.150> then

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
you're shaking it they leak and then

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.380 
you're shaking it they leak and then
just<00:02:30.450> press<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.870> down<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.500> shake<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.160> for<00:02:32.850> five

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
just press it down and shake it for five

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.990 
just press it down and shake it for five
seconds<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:35.220> once<00:02:35.610> you're<00:02:35.760> done<00:02:35.790> with

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
seconds and then once you're done with

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.020 
seconds and then once you're done with
that<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.720> set<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.080> aside<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:38.520> has

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
that you can just set that aside it has

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.620 
that you can just set that aside it has
to<00:02:39.270> sit<00:02:39.600> out<00:02:40.350> for<00:02:40.980> five<00:02:41.550> minutes<00:02:41.940> before<00:02:42.300> you

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
to sit out for five minutes before you

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.980 
to sit out for five minutes before you
can<00:02:42.870> match<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.070> up<00:02:44.160> with<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.520> color<00:02:44.760> card<00:02:45.120> to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
can match it up with the color card to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.550 
can match it up with the color card to
read<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:47.610> then<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.570> nitrite<00:02:49.140> test

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
read it so then I do the nitrite test

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.190 
read it so then I do the nitrite test
start<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.400> same<00:02:50.610> way<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:51.210> add<00:02:51.420> water<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
start the same way just add water to the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.410 
start the same way just add water to the
five<00:02:52.410> milliliter<00:02:52.860> mark<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:54.240> one's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
five milliliter mark and this one's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.930 
five milliliter mark and this one's
pretty<00:02:54.600> easy<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.290> add<00:02:55.710> five<00:02:56.130> drops<00:02:56.160> and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
pretty easy you just add five drops and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:06.199 
pretty easy you just add five drops and
it<00:02:57.000> only<00:02:57.120> has<00:02:57.420> one<00:02:57.740> solution<00:02:58.740> bottle<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:05.209> then

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
it only has one solution bottle and then

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.350 
it only has one solution bottle and then
again<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.780> shake<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.200> for<00:03:07.350> five<00:03:07.590> seconds<00:03:08.360> so

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
again you shake it for five seconds so

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.780 
again you shake it for five seconds so
next<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.020> nitrate<00:03:10.530> test<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.730> a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
next is the nitrate test this one is a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.690 
next is the nitrate test this one is a
little<00:03:12.030> bit<00:03:12.300> more<00:03:12.890> involved<00:03:13.890> than<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.430> other

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
little bit more involved than the other

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.380 
little bit more involved than the other
ones<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:16.500> also<00:03:16.739> has<00:03:17.130> two<00:03:17.459> test<00:03:17.850> solution

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
ones it also has two test solution

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.229 
ones it also has two test solution
bottles<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:20.310> add<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.580> first<00:03:20.820> one<00:03:21.030> first

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
bottles and you add the first one first

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.740 
bottles and you add the first one first
and<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.050> second<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.750> add

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
and it's like a one second and you add

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.770 
and it's like a one second and you add
ten<00:03:25.110> drops<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.590> each<00:03:28.790> but<00:03:29.790> then<00:03:30.030> before<00:03:30.660> you

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
ten drops of each but then before you

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.780 
ten drops of each but then before you
add<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.470> from<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.890> second<00:03:32.280> bottle<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.760> have

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
add the from the second bottle you have

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.130 
add the from the second bottle you have
to<00:03:33.090> shake<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.360> for<00:03:33.930> 30<00:03:34.230> seconds<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:36.330> you

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
to shake it for 30 seconds and you

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.120 
to shake it for 30 seconds and you
should<00:03:37.350> also<00:03:37.530> cap<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:39.260> just<00:03:40.260> invert<00:03:40.920> it

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
should also cap this and just invert it

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.470 
should also cap this and just invert it
a<00:03:41.250> few<00:03:41.519> times<00:03:41.900> shake<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.019> up<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.200> little<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:45.239> make

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
a few times shake it up a little to make

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.449 
a few times shake it up a little to make
sure<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:48.680> drops<00:03:49.680> from<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.160> first

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
sure that the drops from the first

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.560 
sure that the drops from the first
bottle<00:03:50.970> are<00:03:51.239> mixed<00:03:52.019> evenly<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:54.269> don't<00:03:54.450> need

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
bottle are mixed evenly you don't need

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.030 
bottle are mixed evenly you don't need
to<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.780> with<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.110> ammonia<00:03:55.320> test<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:56.010> you

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
to do that with the ammonia test but you

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.620 
to do that with the ammonia test but you
do<00:03:56.250> need<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.430> do<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.730> with<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.030> nitrate<00:03:57.420> test

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
do need to do it with the nitrate test

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.270 
do need to do it with the nitrate test
for<00:03:58.110> some<00:03:58.260> reason

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.490 

all<00:04:02.280> right<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.670> then<00:04:02.819> cap<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.230> one

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
all right and then cap that and this one

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.740 
all right and then cap that and this one
you<00:04:04.680> have<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.040> shake<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:05.580> for<00:04:06.239> one<00:04:06.480> full

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
you have to shake for for one full

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.440 
you have to shake for for one full
minute<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:08.310> when<00:04:08.549> you're<00:04:08.670> done<00:04:08.790> shaking<00:04:09.299> that

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
minute so when you're done shaking that

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.809 
minute so when you're done shaking that
set<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.170> one<00:04:10.349> side<00:04:10.739> as<00:04:11.099> well<00:04:11.340> with<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
set that one side as well with the

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.289 
set that one side as well with the
others<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.590> now<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.129> pH<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.790> left<00:04:15.030> the

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
others and now just the pH is left the

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.520 
others and now just the pH is left the
pH<00:04:15.599> ones<00:04:15.900> are<00:04:16.049> really<00:04:16.320> easy<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:18.229> it<00:04:19.229> comes

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
pH ones are really easy and it comes

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.330 
pH ones are really easy and it comes
with<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:20.010> regular<00:04:20.790> pH<00:04:21.209> test<00:04:21.690> which<00:04:22.590> tests<00:04:23.070> from

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
with a regular pH test which tests from

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.909 
with a regular pH test which tests from
6.0<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.510> 7.6<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.970> high<00:04:27.180> range<00:04:27.510> which<00:04:28.320> tests

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
6.0 to 7.6 and a high range which tests

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.750 
6.0 to 7.6 and a high range which tests
from<00:04:29.150> 7.4<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.330> 8.8<00:04:31.430> so<00:04:32.430> if<00:04:32.490> you've<00:04:32.639> never

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
from 7.4 to 8.8 so if you've never

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.340 
from 7.4 to 8.8 so if you've never
tested<00:04:33.300> your<00:04:33.389> water<00:04:33.600> before<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.169> don't

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
tested your water before and you don't

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.590 
tested your water before and you don't
know<00:04:34.470> what<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.710> pH<00:04:34.919> is<00:04:35.039> going<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.400> be<00:04:35.600> you

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
know what the pH is going to be you

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.159 
know what the pH is going to be you
should<00:04:37.050> use<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.220> regular<00:04:38.639> one<00:04:38.820> first<00:04:39.180> all

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
should use the regular one first all

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.279 
should use the regular one first all
right<00:04:40.229> so<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.770> just<00:04:40.979> add<00:04:41.370> three<00:04:41.729> drops<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.570> the

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
right so you just add three drops of the

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:51.379 
right so you just add three drops of the
solution<00:04:49.039> and<00:04:50.039> you<00:04:50.669> don't<00:04:50.850> need<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.060> shake

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
solution and you don't need to shake

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.830 
solution and you don't need to shake
these<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.990> just<00:04:52.970> invert<00:04:53.970> them<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.240> few<00:04:54.539> times

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
these you just invert them a few times

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.640 
these you just invert them a few times
to<00:04:55.139> get<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.380> mixed<00:04:55.770> evenly<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.930> pH<00:04:58.320> ones

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
to get it mixed evenly and the pH ones

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.560 
to get it mixed evenly and the pH ones
can<00:04:59.130> actually<00:04:59.610> be<00:04:59.760> read<00:05:00.000> right<00:05:00.240> away<00:05:00.510> you

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
can actually be read right away you

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.150 
can actually be read right away you
don't<00:05:00.840> have<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.199> wait<00:05:01.350> five<00:05:01.620> minutes

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
don't have to wait five minutes

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.020 
don't have to wait five minutes
so<00:05:03.000> my<00:05:03.690> pH<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.500> my<00:05:04.830> water<00:05:05.070> is<00:05:05.370> always<00:05:05.669> really

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
so my pH of my water is always really

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.270 
so my pH of my water is always really
high<00:05:06.240> as<00:05:06.630> you<00:05:07.229> can<00:05:07.380> see<00:05:07.590> it's<00:05:07.770> reading<00:05:08.130> at

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
high as you can see it's reading at

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.100 
high as you can see it's reading at
seven<00:05:08.669> point<00:05:08.849> six<00:05:09.150> right<00:05:09.479> now<00:05:09.630> which<00:05:09.870> is<00:05:09.990> the

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
seven point six right now which is the

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.950 
seven point six right now which is the
highest<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:10.680> test<00:05:10.979> will<00:05:11.190> go<00:05:11.400> so<00:05:12.270> if<00:05:12.599> you<00:05:12.720> get

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
highest this test will go so if you get

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.930 
highest this test will go so if you get
this<00:05:13.349> reading<00:05:13.800> that's<00:05:14.190> an<00:05:14.340> indication<00:05:14.729> that

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
this reading that's an indication that

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.520 
this reading that's an indication that
you<00:05:15.150> should<00:05:15.360> definitely<00:05:15.479> check<00:05:16.050> with<00:05:16.080> the

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
you should definitely check with the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.029 
you should definitely check with the
high<00:05:17.160> range<00:05:17.430> pH<00:05:17.849> as<00:05:18.060> well<00:05:18.360> just<00:05:19.289> in<00:05:19.440> case<00:05:19.650> it's

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
high range pH as well just in case it's

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.480 
high range pH as well just in case it's
actually<00:05:20.700> above<00:05:21.150> seven<00:05:21.630> point<00:05:21.870> six<00:05:22.370> so<00:05:23.370> now

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
actually above seven point six so now

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.400 
actually above seven point six so now
I'm<00:05:23.610> going<00:05:23.789> to<00:05:23.849> test<00:05:24.060> with<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.479> high<00:05:24.630> range<00:05:24.960> pH

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
I'm going to test with the high range pH

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.520 
I'm going to test with the high range pH
test<00:05:25.919> this<00:05:26.700> one<00:05:27.000> is<00:05:27.300> easy<00:05:27.660> as<00:05:27.900> well<00:05:28.139> you<00:05:28.349> just

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
test this one is easy as well you just

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:35.450 
test this one is easy as well you just
add<00:05:28.800> five<00:05:29.160> drops<00:05:32.330> and<00:05:33.770> invert<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.979> bottle<00:05:35.130> a

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
add five drops and invert the bottle a

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.600 
add five drops and invert the bottle a
few<00:05:35.700> times<00:05:36.030> to<00:05:36.960> get<00:05:37.080> it<00:05:37.430> mixed<00:05:38.430> evenly<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:40.610> my

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
few times to get it mixed evenly and my

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.719 
few times to get it mixed evenly and my
pH<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.510> reading<00:05:43.050> at<00:05:43.229> eight<00:05:43.530> point<00:05:43.830> four<00:05:44.039> all

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
pH is reading at eight point four all

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.680 
pH is reading at eight point four all
right<00:05:44.789> so<00:05:45.150> now<00:05:45.419> it<00:05:45.720> has<00:05:45.750> been<00:05:46.200> five<00:05:47.099> minutes

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
right so now it has been five minutes

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.610 
right so now it has been five minutes
and<00:05:48.690> we<00:05:49.500> can<00:05:49.740> read<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.370> results<00:05:50.849> from<00:05:51.030> these

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
and we can read the results from these

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.680 
and we can read the results from these
the<00:05:52.620> ammonia<00:05:52.919> is<00:05:53.250> at<00:05:53.400> zero<00:05:53.729> which<00:05:54.240> is<00:05:54.419> good

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
the ammonia is at zero which is good

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.629 
the ammonia is at zero which is good
nitrite<00:05:55.650> is<00:05:55.800> also<00:05:56.099> at<00:05:56.220> zero

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
nitrite is also at zero

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.390 
nitrite is also at zero
you<00:05:57.330> always<00:05:57.510> want<00:05:57.900> ammonia<00:05:58.530> nitrite<00:05:59.070> to<00:05:59.099> be

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
you always want ammonia nitrite to be

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.580 
you always want ammonia nitrite to be
zero<00:05:59.699> in<00:05:59.970> a<00:06:00.060> cycle<00:06:00.419> aquarium<00:06:00.900> they<00:06:01.289> always

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
zero in a cycle aquarium they always

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.500 
zero in a cycle aquarium they always
should<00:06:01.800> be

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
should be

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.230 
should be
and<00:06:03.080> nitrate<00:06:04.010> is<00:06:04.250> five<00:06:05.000> which<00:06:05.420> is<00:06:05.450> pretty<00:06:06.320> good

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
and nitrate is five which is pretty good

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.230 
and nitrate is five which is pretty good
for<00:06:08.240> goldfish<00:06:08.750> I<00:06:09.160> usually<00:06:10.160> never<00:06:10.520> let<00:06:10.910> the

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
nitrate get any higher than twenty but

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.140 
nitrate get any higher than twenty but
typically<00:06:15.410> it<00:06:15.710> only<00:06:15.920> gets<00:06:16.130> to<00:06:16.400> ten<00:06:16.670> before<00:06:16.910> I

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
typically it only gets to ten before I

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.960 
typically it only gets to ten before I
do<00:06:17.240> a<00:06:17.360> water<00:06:17.570> change<00:06:17.660> that's<00:06:18.410> just<00:06:18.970> my
