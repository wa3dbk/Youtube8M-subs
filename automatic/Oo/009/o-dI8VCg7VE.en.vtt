may have a paper me think not sure about
them<00:02:53.840> but<00:02:54.319> I<00:02:54.380> think<00:02:54.650> with<00:02:54.800> Lee<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.010> now<00:02:55.340> we've

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
them but I think with Lee and now we've

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:56.979 
them but I think with Lee and now we've
got<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.030> added<00:02:56.150> pressure<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.540> potentially

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
got the added pressure of potentially

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.449 
got the added pressure of potentially
both<00:02:57.140> losing<00:02:57.500> their<00:02:57.620> houses<00:02:57.769> if<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.280> don't

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
confident of his own ability and you see

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.280 
confident of his own ability and you see
him<00:03:31.730> come<00:03:31.910> out<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.150> himself<00:03:32.299> over<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.079> coming

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
going to find it a little bit more

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.620
