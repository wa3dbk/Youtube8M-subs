00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.810
 1 minute 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.970
 Brother and I am happy to say this movie is coach 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.200
 Five 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:20.390
 It is a child of the number series 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.390
 Come here too and transform into a mechanism 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.700
 It is each line of sochil which is very interesting 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.130
 Then I want to transform 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.789
 At first 1 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.789
 I will 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.570
 Then I 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.970
 Expand a little 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 It is fine while returning the shifted place 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.530
 Rotate to cross 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.870
 Completely deployed 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.870
 It is open cut 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 Then Cho 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.290
 It is part of the car number 5-1 which is enough here 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 It has been open since then 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.710
 Chizuru 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.760
 It is the completion of the undercarriage 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.659
 Here 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.300
 If it spreads by bending 90 degrees and crime spreads 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.800
 It becomes like before 1 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.030
 Polish the part of the father 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.740
 Head 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.750
 If you put this out 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.750
 Nice design comes out face 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.150
 It is a self-propelled version humanoid mechanism 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.150
 Further surprise gimmicks press the button inside 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.990
 I will scatter the body while there 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.760
 I am quite noisy 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.670
 I think and did not kana said 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.670
 I Come of it was a way that flies do not know well-fragrant 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.500
 I'm just a little bit noisy 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.840
 Here also it's really good that say variations that do not bear other types same prototype but 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 The sound when you press the button is really so 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.790
 I would be glad if it was something a little different 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.810
 The design of the face was there for I mean the other is a little hope committed 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.810
 Was happy to say that more than 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.560
 me 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.830
 Hmm
