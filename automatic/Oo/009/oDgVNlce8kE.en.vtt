00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.980
 hi there, you were on tv on the channel and with 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.929
 I'm 701 by you and today, under the heading 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.720
 x factor we'll talk about one of the most 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.230
 the best in my opinion medium tanks 7 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.800
 panzar level well or panther and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 classics of the genre first talk about 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.859
 tactical and technical characteristics 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.840
 booking body in the forehead 85 board 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.760
 50-40 so-so booking if still 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 take into account our dimensions but at the same time 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.129
 sometimes it turns out to tank opponents 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.920
 lower level tower armor in the forehead 120 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.230
 millimeters solid such tsiferka board 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.420
 and feed on 60 but at the same time solid 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.820
 The tsiferka does not give us that armor 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.579
 we wanted it because rational 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.399
 armor slope angles are n't about us 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.010
 Yes, and the turret of the commander is quite strong 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.559
 bulges so the towers don't tank 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.309
 will always turn to go to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.350
 maneuverability tank weight 45 and 18 hundredths 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.720
 700 horsepower engine ton 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.880
 forces again not complex calculations 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.159
 managed to find out what 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.110
 power density is 15 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.570
 half horsepower per ton 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.970
 This is to transcendental indicator but how 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 you could already guess the German tanks 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.040
 it's not about speed though max. 55 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.920
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.740
 typing pretty confident sorry that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.600
 only from the hill but at the same time our 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.150
 maneuverability is enough to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.770
 spin most heavy tanks 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.829
 which we can meet 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.799
 what else do you need for a medium tank and more 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.780
 we need i think the most important part in 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.509
 any tank is a weapon 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.210
 the words German gun has already become 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.549
 synonymous to the word sniper guns and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.930
 here it appears probably like nowhere 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.850
 First accuracy information 032 33 times 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.420
 seconds while not quite bad 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.130
 stabilization since we are still not strong 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.229
 fast driving rate 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.869
 eleven and a half shots at 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.910
 minute level of course 160 is 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.310
 standard score for most 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.910
 medium tanks of this level and vodka 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.709
 average armor penetration in 198 already 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.170
 millimeters allows us to easily 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.660
 punch almost everyone who can us 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.410
 meet well the first stage 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.400
 review already passed I successfully read 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.440
 tactical and technical characteristics and 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.720
 expressed his opinion on this 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.360
 Now I think it's worth telling how 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.030
 just need to use panther 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.269
 optimal battle tactics will be 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.819
 oddly enough cover our allied 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.340
 medium tanks you drive to the same position 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.280
 where all your medium tanks go 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.069
 allies but on the second line 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.660
 thereby use your dpm on and 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.720
 exact and penetrating weapon will be 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.420
 much more convenient without harm to their 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.120
 hit points such a support tank which 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.310
 at any time can break the chain and 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.739
 bypass opponents from the flank of the other 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.320
 tactics of warfare may be 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.570
 calm and measured shooting 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.880
 opponents on long distances 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.579
 most often use this tactic is 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.220
 when there is no other medium in your team 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.620
 tanks and pt are present , etc. 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.900
 in this case, it is recommended to occupy 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.090
 positions away from their heavy 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.540
 tanks and cover them well in handy 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.239
 moment 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.760
 bypass opponents from the flank and enter 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.400
 im in the rear is the main thing in using this 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.100
 techniques not to stand until the end of the battle 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.530
 when all your allies are already 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.930
 will kill by another use of it 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.989
 tank can be called perhaps aggressive 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.870
 the game but again with the note that 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.510
 It means aggressive play on any panther 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.180
 in no case need to go alone 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.780
 to play panther aggressively needed 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.480
 platoon and here unfortunately with no exceptions 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.420
 otherwise, on a lonely 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.350
 pretty cardboard panther fast 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.450
 opponents will fall out and 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.480
 destroy such an aggressive look 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.880
 gameplay also requires considerable skill 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.500
 as well as the skills of the game but at the same 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.380
 you get pleasure from it 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.010
 much more I want to say in 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.230
 completing an abundance of tactics and methods 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.750
 panther applications are probably one of 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.040
 biggest among other medium 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.580
 level 7 tanks 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.170
 that's why i consider panther 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.250
 universal and the best car on 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.130
 your level 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.530
 certainly among medium tanks and what about 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.110
 This machine think you write in 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.810
 comments, I will read them with pleasure 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.940
 and on this today everyone thanks for all 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.740
