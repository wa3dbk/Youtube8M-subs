00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
actually pretty small the openings

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740 
actually pretty small the openings
pretty<00:01:04.619> small<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.970> when<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.240> look<00:01:06.479> further

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
pretty small but when you look further

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.410 
pretty small but when you look further

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
something in the trunk

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.020 
something in the trunk
it<00:01:59.119> may<00:01:59.509> look<00:01:59.720> like<00:01:59.899> a<00:01:59.960> guitar<00:02:00.229> case<00:02:00.909> but<00:02:01.909> it's

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
it may look like a guitar case but it's

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.850 
it may look like a guitar case but it's
actually<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.539> plastic<00:02:03.020> cover<00:02:03.289> so<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.590> don't

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
actually the plastic cover so you don't

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:22.780 
actually the plastic cover so you don't
get<00:02:03.950> gunk<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.580> bugs<00:02:04.909> on<00:02:05.330> your<00:02:15.760> let's<00:02:16.760> see<00:02:16.940> how

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.199 

so<00:02:23.540> when<00:02:23.659> you<00:02:23.810> start<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.170> car<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:26.269> gauges
