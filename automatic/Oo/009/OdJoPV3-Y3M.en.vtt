as<00:01:02.789> well<00:01:03.019> I'm<00:01:04.019> gonna<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.769> back<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.900> we<00:01:06.900> have

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
as well I'm gonna go back so I we have

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.300 
as well I'm gonna go back so I we have

not been able to confirm that but i
think<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.640> assumption<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.510> will

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720

think the assumption is that they will
they're<00:01:10.320> obviously<00:01:10.710> selling<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> whole<00:01:11.220> lot<00:01:11.369> of

they're<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> five<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> half

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
they're going to do a five and a half

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.170 
they're going to do a five and a half
inch<00:01:25.920> screen<00:01:26.220> that's<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.850> more<00:01:27.090> of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
inch screen that's going to be more of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
inch screen that's going to be more of
the<00:01:27.270> phablet<00:01:27.810> product<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the phablet product they are going to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.100 
the phablet product they are going to
keep<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.369> 5s<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> production<00:01:30.420> line<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
keep the 5s on the production line and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.480 
keep the 5s on the production line and
they're<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.770> keep<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> five<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
they're going to keep the five in the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.710 
they're going to keep the five in the
production<00:01:32.759> line<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.329> don't<00:01:33.540> believe

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
production line but we don't believe

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.630 
production line but we don't believe
they<00:01:33.930> continue<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.439> make<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> 4s<00:01:35.070> anymore<00:01:35.490> we

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
they continue to make the 4s anymore we

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.039 
they continue to make the 4s anymore we
believe<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> product<00:01:36.390> actually<00:01:36.540> goes<00:01:36.900> away

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
believe that product actually goes away

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.950 
believe that product actually goes away
with<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.500> next<00:01:37.710> product<00:01:38.009> cycle<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:39.210> 4s<00:01:39.659> but

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
with this next product cycle the 4s but

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.999 
with this next product cycle the 4s but

4-inch screen the 4-inch screen is

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.149 
4-inch screen the 4-inch screen is
actually<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.680> now<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
actually what you see right now in the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.190 
actually what you see right now in the
five<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.549> five<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> 5<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.420> 5s<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
five and five at the 5 and 5s so that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.139 
five and five at the 5 and 5s so that
will<00:01:49.380> remain<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> older<00:01:50.310> 4s<00:01:50.700> which<00:01:50.909> was

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
will remain but the older 4s which was

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.520 
will remain but the older 4s which was
still<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.600> smaller<00:01:52.020> three<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> half

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
still on that smaller three and a half

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.469 
still on that smaller three and a half
inch<00:01:52.799> screen<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.250> goes<00:01:53.460> away<00:01:53.729> completely<00:01:53.970> Oh

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
inch screen that goes away completely Oh

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.660 
inch screen that goes away completely Oh
got<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.890> wonder<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.340> terms<00:01:56.579> of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
got it so you know I wonder in terms of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.920 
got it so you know I wonder in terms of
Bill<00:01:56.850> materials<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.600> does<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.780> really

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
Bill materials and what does this really

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
Bill materials and what does this really
mean<00:01:58.079> for<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.530> cost<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.250> phone<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
mean for the cost of the phone of the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.880 
mean for the cost of the phone of the
development<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.079> costs<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.590> lot

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
development we know that the costs a lot

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.260 
development we know that the costs a lot
of<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.070> components<00:02:02.490> tend<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> drop<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
of the components tend to drop but the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.539 
of the components tend to drop but the
glass<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> battery<00:02:04.439> costs<00:02:04.950> maybe<00:02:05.280> don't

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
glass and the battery costs maybe don't

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.880 
glass and the battery costs maybe don't
drop<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.909> much<00:02:06.090> Brian<00:02:06.829> absolutely<00:02:07.829> absolutely

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
drop as much Brian absolutely absolutely

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
drop as much Brian absolutely absolutely
especially<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.000> screen<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> screen<00:02:09.569> will

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
especially the screen the screen will

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.540 
especially the screen the screen will
definitely<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.289> more<00:02:10.440> expensive<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
definitely be more expensive but the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.979 
definitely be more expensive but the
good<00:02:11.700> thing<00:02:11.730> for<00:02:11.970> Apple<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> lot<00:02:12.840> of

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
good thing for Apple is that a lot of

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.000 
good thing for Apple is that a lot of
the<00:02:13.080> key<00:02:13.260> components

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the key components

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.949 
the key components
we'll<00:02:14.099> still<00:02:14.400> be<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.790> same<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.299> so<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.870> know

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
we'll still be the same and so you know

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.600 
we'll still be the same and so you know
those<00:02:16.230> will<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:16.590> declined<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.159> price<00:02:17.400> over

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
those will have declined in price over

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.569 
those will have declined in price over
the<00:02:17.819> last<00:02:18.000> year<00:02:18.299> I<00:02:18.480> typically<00:02:19.049> think<00:02:19.260> about

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
the last year I typically think about

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.559 
the last year I typically think about
semiconductor<00:02:20.579> price<00:02:20.849> erosion<00:02:21.030> at<00:02:21.390> about

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
semiconductor price erosion at about

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.330 
semiconductor price erosion at about
fifteen<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:21.989> twenty<00:02:22.319> percent<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.799> year<00:02:22.829> that

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
fifteen to twenty percent a year that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.640 
fifteen to twenty percent a year that
can<00:02:23.489> change<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:24.000> volume<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:25.049> those<00:02:25.470> are

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
can change with volume but those are

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.050 
can change with volume but those are
going<00:02:25.890> down<00:02:26.069> but<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> cost<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.819> glass

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
going down but the cost of the glass

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.759 
going down but the cost of the glass
definitely<00:02:27.629> more<00:02:27.810> expensive<00:02:28.349> particularly

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
definitely more expensive particularly

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.380 
definitely more expensive particularly
on<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.920> five<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.310> half<00:02:29.340> inch<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.329> the

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
now one of the things I'm wondering is

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.240 
now one of the things I'm wondering is
do<00:02:39.060> they<00:02:39.209> raise<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.780> price<00:02:40.109> of<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.890> entry

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
do they raise that price of the entry

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.550 
do they raise that price of the entry
level<00:02:41.280> five<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:42.000> half<00:02:42.030> inch<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:43.079> a<00:02:43.170> product

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
level five and a half inch in a product

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.720 
level five and a half inch in a product
whatever<00:02:43.709> they<00:02:43.920> end<00:02:44.010> up<00:02:44.099> calling<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.670> I

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
whatever they end up calling it and I

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.009 
whatever they end up calling it and I
think<00:02:44.790> there's<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.120> great<00:02:45.269> possibility<00:02:45.480> of

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
think there's a great possibility of

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.330 
think there's a great possibility of
that<00:02:46.200> because<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> higher<00:02:46.829> price<00:02:47.040> point

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
that because of the higher price point

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.390 
that because of the higher price point
you<00:02:48.329> don't<00:02:48.420> really<00:02:48.569> know<00:02:48.780> about<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:50.190> sort<00:02:50.310> of

you don't really know about this sort of

you don't really know about this sort of
a<00:02:50.459> market<00:02:50.849> for<00:02:51.000> these<00:02:51.120> phones<00:02:51.359> I'm<00:02:51.659> not<00:02:51.989> just

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
a market for these phones I'm not just

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.479 
a market for these phones I'm not just
sort<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.650> where<00:02:52.859> they<00:02:53.010> could<00:02:53.159> sell<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.370> but

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
sort of where they could sell in but

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.009 
sort of where they could sell in but
where<00:02:53.639> people<00:02:53.909> are<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.150> terms<00:02:54.329> of<00:02:54.450> contracts

we're particularly in the US the upgrade

we're particularly in the US the upgrade
cycle<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.500> waiting<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.040> come<00:02:59.190> next<00:02:59.430> well<00:03:00.180> I

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
cycle is is waiting to come next well I

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.379 
cycle is is waiting to come next well I
mean<00:03:00.420> if<00:03:00.569> there's<00:03:01.139> clearly<00:03:02.000> just<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.090> lot<00:03:03.269> of

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
mean if there's clearly just a lot of

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.960 
mean if there's clearly just a lot of
demand<00:03:03.690> for<00:03:03.780> these<00:03:03.959> larger<00:03:04.319> phones<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.940> I

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
demand for these larger phones so I

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.809 
demand for these larger phones so I
think<00:03:06.329> this<00:03:06.599> is<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.989> big<00:03:07.349> enough<00:03:07.560> change<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.489> in

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
think this is a big enough change in in

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.759 
think this is a big enough change in in
the<00:03:09.030> product<00:03:09.420> line<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:10.440> lot<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.680> people

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
the product line that a lot of people

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.580 
the product line that a lot of people
are<00:03:11.010> going<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.190> going<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.790> move<00:03:11.940> up<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:13.019> mean<00:03:13.470> in

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
are going to going to move up I mean in

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.180 
are going to going to move up I mean in
Asia<00:03:14.400> forty<00:03:14.940> percent<00:03:15.299> of<00:03:15.620> Android<00:03:16.620> phones<00:03:16.889> are

Asia forty percent of Android phones are

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.449 
Asia forty percent of Android phones are
of<00:03:17.489> this<00:03:17.670> 4.7<00:03:18.569> or<00:03:18.690> larger<00:03:19.109> screen<00:03:19.709> size<00:03:19.739> really

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
of this 4.7 or larger screen size really

of this 4.7 or larger screen size really
yeah<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.810> think<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:22.799> DC's<00:03:23.099> numbers<00:03:23.430> are

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
yeah and I think I DC's numbers are

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.879 
yeah and I think I DC's numbers are
something<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.389> know<00:03:24.419> five<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.169> five

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
something like you know five and five

because<00:03:38.699> Samsung<00:03:39.000> has<00:03:39.750> been<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.230> number<00:03:40.889> one

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
part of that reason is because Samsung

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.920 
part of that reason is because Samsung

these larger screens which really seemed

these larger screens which really seemed
kind<00:03:50.699> of<00:03:50.790> silly<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.660> lot<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.840> people<00:03:51.930> at<00:03:52.199> the

kind of silly to a lot of people at the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.900 
kind of silly to a lot of people at the
time<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.160> turns<00:03:53.340> out<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.669> is<00:03:53.790> what

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
time but it turns out this is what

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.280 
time but it turns out this is what
consumers<00:03:54.329> have<00:03:54.480> really<00:03:54.720> wanted<00:03:54.930> for<00:03:55.109> the

consumers have really wanted for the
last<00:03:55.470> several<00:03:55.709> years<00:03:56.099> we've<00:03:56.609> seen<00:03:56.909> that<00:03:57.090> you

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
last several years we've seen that you

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.399 
last several years we've seen that you
mentioned<00:03:57.449> this<00:03:57.510> forty<00:03:57.810> percent<00:03:58.049> number<00:03:58.199> in

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
mentioned this forty percent number in

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.710 
mentioned this forty percent number in
China<00:03:58.680> everywhere<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.519> go<00:03:59.579> in<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.909> world<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.359> see

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
China everywhere I go in the world I see

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.509 
China everywhere I go in the world I see
I<00:04:00.959> see<00:04:01.139> people<00:04:01.379> you<00:04:01.709> know<00:04:01.799> using<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.190> larger

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
I see people you know using the larger

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.189 
I see people you know using the larger
screens<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.239> Apple<00:04:03.510> has<00:04:03.599> been<00:04:03.690> kind<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.989> behind

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
screens so Apple has been kind of behind

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.899 
screens so Apple has been kind of behind
in<00:04:04.379> this<00:04:04.440> regard<00:04:04.829> but<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.579> really

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
in this regard but this is a really

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.280 
in this regard but this is a really
critical<00:04:06.030> piece<00:04:06.419> of<00:04:06.540> their<00:04:06.629> strategy<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.260> I

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
critical piece of their strategy and I

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.809 
critical piece of their strategy and I
think<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:07.590> going<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.739> be<00:04:07.859> important<00:04:08.370> to

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
think it's going to be important to

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.250 
think it's going to be important to
their<00:04:09.030> volumes<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.659> the<00:04:09.720> back<00:04:09.870> half<00:04:10.049> of<00:04:10.169> the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
their volumes in the back half of the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.170 
their volumes in the back half of the
year<00:04:10.500> because<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:11.010> lot<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.400> people<00:04:11.519> don't<00:04:11.940> want

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
year because a lot of people don't want

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.909 
year because a lot of people don't want
these<00:04:12.299> smaller<00:04:12.540> screen<00:04:12.870> sizes<00:04:13.109> so<00:04:13.470> Apple<00:04:13.799> is

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
these smaller screen sizes so Apple is

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.710 
these smaller screen sizes so Apple is
going<00:04:14.159> to<00:04:14.250> see<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> think<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.849> big<00:04:15.090> surge<00:04:15.419> in

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
going to see I think a big surge in

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.319 
going to see I think a big surge in
demand<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:17.159> know<00:04:17.280> internationally<00:04:18.180> because

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
demand you know internationally because

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.909 
demand you know internationally because
of<00:04:18.539> these<00:04:18.599> nouveau<00:04:18.959> these<00:04:19.289> new<00:04:19.409> screen<00:04:19.680> sizes

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
of these nouveau these new screen sizes

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.050 
of these nouveau these new screen sizes
and<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.489> think<00:04:20.639> they're<00:04:20.729> going<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.880> they're

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
and I think they're going to they're

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.460 
there crow to be eaten here you know
what<00:05:49.479> I<00:05:49.510> think<00:05:49.810> there<00:05:49.930> is<00:05:50.050> a<00:05:50.080> little<00:05:50.350> bit

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
what I think there is a little bit

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.810 
what I think there is a little bit
because<00:05:50.650> Apple<00:05:51.130> you<00:05:51.400> know<00:05:51.490> Apple<00:05:51.729> is

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
because Apple you know Apple is

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.400 
because Apple you know Apple is
definitely<00:05:52.240> being<00:05:52.360> reactive<00:05:52.870> in<00:05:52.960> this<00:05:53.080> regard

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
definitely being reactive in this regard

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
including myself would have expected

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.260 
including myself would have expected
Apple<00:05:56.979> to<00:05:57.100> address<00:05:57.550> this<00:05:57.760> segment<00:05:58.120> of<00:05:58.180> the

Apple to address this segment of the

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.360 
Apple to address this segment of the
market<00:05:58.360> for<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.750> while<00:05:58.990> I<00:05:59.290> mean<00:05:59.650> every<00:05:59.979> time<00:06:00.130> you

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
know even the note 3 which is very large

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.370 
know even the note 3 which is very large
at<00:06:02.500> you<00:06:02.950> know<00:06:03.040> that<00:06:03.220> it's<00:06:04.120> about<00:06:04.300> 5.7<00:06:04.960> inches

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
at you know that it's about 5.7 inches

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.110 
at you know that it's about 5.7 inches
they<00:06:05.770> sold<00:06:06.040> 10<00:06:06.310> million<00:06:06.610> units<00:06:06.880> of<00:06:06.910> that<00:06:07.060> in

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
they sold 10 million units of that in

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.640 
they sold 10 million units of that in
the<00:06:07.180> first<00:06:07.390> 60<00:06:07.630> days<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:08.169> apples<00:06:08.410> really<00:06:08.620> i

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
the first 60 days and apples really i

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.260 
the first 60 days and apples really i
think<00:06:08.740> ignored<00:06:09.310> that<00:06:09.430> so<00:06:09.790> there<00:06:09.940> is<00:06:10.030> a<00:06:10.060> little

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
think ignored that so there is a little

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.730 
think ignored that so there is a little
crow<00:06:10.450> to<00:06:10.510> be<00:06:10.630> eaten<00:06:10.870> because<00:06:11.440> this<00:06:11.620> is

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
crow to be eaten because this is

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.260 
crow to be eaten because this is
reactive<00:06:12.220> by<00:06:12.370> Apple<00:06:12.700> but<00:06:12.880> apple<00:06:13.120> doesn't

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
reactive by Apple but apple doesn't

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.270 
reactive by Apple but apple doesn't
always<00:06:13.540> have<00:06:13.660> to<00:06:13.720> move<00:06:13.900> first<00:06:14.229> they<00:06:14.950> just<00:06:15.160> have

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
always have to move first they just have

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.770 
always have to move first they just have
to<00:06:15.400> do<00:06:15.550> it<00:06:15.669> eventually<00:06:15.760> in<00:06:16.210> address<00:06:16.479> consumer

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
to do it eventually in address consumer

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.850 
to do it eventually in address consumer
demand<00:06:17.169> and<00:06:17.320> I<00:06:17.350> think<00:06:17.500> they're<00:06:17.590> going<00:06:17.710> to<00:06:17.770> be

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
demand and I think they're going to be

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.610 
demand and I think they're going to be
successful<00:06:18.370> with<00:06:18.460> this
