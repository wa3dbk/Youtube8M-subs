time to insert some new ones all right I

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.000 
time to insert some new ones all right I
have<00:02:54.630> finished<00:02:54.780> installing<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.380> bulbs<00:02:55.799> and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
have finished installing the bulbs and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.039 
have finished installing the bulbs and
to<00:02:56.819> put<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.060> back<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.450> it's<00:02:57.600> basically<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
to put it back in it's basically the

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.559 
to put it back in it's basically the
same<00:02:58.200> thing<00:02:58.260> as<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.769> would<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.819> to<00:03:00.269> take<00:03:00.510> it

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
same thing as you would do to take it

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.059 
same thing as you would do to take it
out<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.900> guess<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.170> reverse<00:03:01.470> process<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.950> it

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
out I guess the reverse process of it

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.039 
out I guess the reverse process of it
what<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.549> do<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.880> when<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.180> push<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.569> in<00:03:03.690> you

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
what you do is when you push it in you

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.930 
what you do is when you push it in you
will<00:03:04.230> see<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.620> lever<00:03:05.069> back<00:03:05.340> here<00:03:05.549> start<00:03:05.850> to

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
will see this lever back here start to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.699 
will see this lever back here start to
move<00:03:06.120> away<00:03:06.329> from<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.959> you're<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.470> going

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
move away from you and you're just going

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.160 
move away from you and you're just going
to<00:03:07.739> push<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.579> assist<00:03:09.359> with<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.690> lever<00:03:09.900> at<00:03:10.139> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
to push and assist with the lever at the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.920
