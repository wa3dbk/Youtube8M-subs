00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:19.920
 how to download a program to put 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.920

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:30.320

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:35.090

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:39.760

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.760
 and we put here again 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.300
 but what do I know 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:52.400
 download this 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:55.450
 short short I give way to the video 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.360
 good is already back 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.360
 that's what we have here 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.930
 and we mess with 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:18.100
 and we have that on the desk or in 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.100
 folder what you want is worth 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.380
 ah 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.270
 we do not open to execute 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.270
 valech and will be installed 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.649
 of you will come you have to start 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:49.780
 then we put data atp percentage 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.780
 percentage without people 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.870
 and that folder is eliminated 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.410
 to be deleted 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.410
 ah 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.300
 OK 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:14.019
 is already at home we can not close and this 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:18.800
 when it can be loaded I return good 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:22.120
 it's already here we are again 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.120
 to see here 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.370
 we can uncheck the more than not 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.210
 want these are mandatory worth 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.960
 example 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.960
 ah 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.610
 this I do not want it for example and this one 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.650
 neither in this nor in this nor in this 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.129
 so the moment is worth 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.689
 and how are we going to delete the pp folder 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.689
 data we install 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.780
 it is here that the modes will be installed 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.980
 for the whole day when I finish in volvo 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.490
 let's say photo that when it finishes it will leave you 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.490
 ready 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:21.200
 agree and we can close or minimize 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.200
 what you want and we can open it 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.740
 and it took a lot 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.370
 so with 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:47.299

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.610

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.300

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.260

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.319
 the modes 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.989

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.540

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.709
