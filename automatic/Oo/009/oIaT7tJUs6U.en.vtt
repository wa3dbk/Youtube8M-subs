00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
that well doesn't have a whole lot of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.810 
that well doesn't have a whole lot of
flavor<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:34.070> especially<00:00:35.070> for<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> roast<00:00:35.579> beef

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
flavor so especially for a roast beef

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.220 
flavor so especially for a roast beef
you<00:00:35.969> want<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.600> flavor<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
you want to have a little flavor to it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.650 
you want to have a little flavor to it
nothing<00:00:38.070> wrong<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.579> putting<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> piece<00:00:39.450> of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
nothing wrong with putting a piece of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.920 
nothing wrong with putting a piece of
beef<00:00:39.930> fat<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> top<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:42.270> tying<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.809> up

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
beef fat on the top and tying it up

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
beef fat on the top and tying it up
because<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.350> happens<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.160> fat

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
because what happens is that the fat

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.900 
because what happens is that the fat
hydrolyzes<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> heat<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.780> base<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.670> meat

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
hydrolyzes in the heat in base the meat

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.170 
hydrolyzes in the heat in base the meat
give<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.270> great<00:00:48.450> flavor<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
give it a great flavor so I just do that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.840 
give it a great flavor so I just do that
because<00:00:51.559> well<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.250> way<00:00:53.370> chef<00:00:53.610> Marc

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
because well that's the way chef Marc

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.220 
because well that's the way chef Marc
does<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.600> how<00:00:54.750> we're<00:00:54.899> learning<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
does it so that's how we're learning to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
does it so that's how we're learning to
cook<00:00:55.379> method<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.100> actually<00:00:57.030> solved<00:00:57.480> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
cook method I actually solved it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.639 
cook method I actually solved it
underneath<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.559> meat<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.780> I've<00:01:00.780> tied

your last sue or a bowline and then you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.480 
your last sue or a bowline and then you
just<00:01:11.330> invert<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.830> pull<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> snug<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.580> tight

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
just invert it pull it snug in tight

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
just invert it pull it snug in tight
invert<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.580> swine<00:01:18.030> back<00:01:18.360> through<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
invert that swine back through see that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.969 
invert that swine back through see that
line<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.070> up<00:01:20.189> nice<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.490> tight<00:01:21.710> that's<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
line it up nice and tight that's kind of

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.920 
line it up nice and tight that's kind of
a<00:01:23.040> roast<00:01:23.430> tie<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.060> better<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.360> its<00:01:24.479> sections

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
a roast tie it's better for its sections

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.210 
a roast tie it's better for its sections
of<00:01:25.140> meat<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.979> has<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> flap<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:29.100> other

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
of meat it has a flap to it so the other

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
of meat it has a flap to it so the other
reason<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> keep<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.329> fat<00:01:30.659> on

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
reason is it's going to keep my fat on

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.160 
reason is it's going to keep my fat on
there<00:01:31.110> which<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.470> want<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:33.659> roast<00:01:33.930> with

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
there which I want that to roast with

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.640 
there which I want that to roast with
the<00:01:34.290> fat<00:01:34.590> cap<00:01:35.159> fat<00:01:35.670> side<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.530> remember<00:01:37.530> without

the fat cap fat side up remember without

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.609 
the fat cap fat side up remember without
fat<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.310> don't<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> whole<00:01:38.850> lot<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> flavor
