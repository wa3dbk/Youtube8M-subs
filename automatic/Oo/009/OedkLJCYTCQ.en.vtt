00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it the at least they left it there for

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.130 
it the at least they left it there for
you<00:01:32.549> guys<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.030> still<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> older

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
you guys that still have the older

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.499 
you guys that still have the older
devices<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.979> it'll<00:01:35.549> also<00:01:35.700> display<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> warning

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
devices and it'll also display a warning

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
devices and it'll also display a warning
they<00:01:36.840> say<00:01:37.049> um<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.159> selected<00:01:38.400> here

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
they say um when it's get selected here

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.300 
they say um when it's get selected here
also<00:01:39.210> realms<00:01:40.020> will<00:01:40.259> only<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.770> generated<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
also realms will only be generated to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.120 
also realms will only be generated to
like<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> smaller<00:01:42.390> size<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.470> probably

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
like a smaller size it will probably

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.300 
like a smaller size it will probably
most<00:01:44.369> likely<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:45.060> 80%<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.590> larger<00:01:47.040> than<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
most likely for 80% be larger than the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
most likely for 80% be larger than the
small<00:01:47.579> worlds<00:01:47.909> were<00:01:48.000> given<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
small worlds were given now but the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.510 
small worlds were given now but the
reason<00:01:49.619> they're<00:01:49.680> not<00:01:49.829> doing<00:01:50.100> realms<00:01:50.399> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
reason they're not doing realms is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.969 
reason they're not doing realms is
infinite<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.619> they<00:01:52.619> don't<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:52.920> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
infinite is because they don't want to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.530 
infinite is because they don't want to
have<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> host<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.579> ton<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.820> infinite<00:01:54.299> worlds

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
have to host a ton of infinite worlds

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.910 
have to host a ton of infinite worlds
where<00:01:54.630> people<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.020> walking<00:01:55.229> around<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
where people are just walking around and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.639 
where people are just walking around and
they'd<00:01:56.310> rather<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> limited<00:01:57.329> um<00:01:57.649> limited

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
they'd rather have a limited um limited

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.240 
they'd rather have a limited um limited
world<00:01:58.770> size<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.869> server<00:02:00.869> hosting<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
world size for for server hosting so the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.459 
world size for for server hosting so the
new<00:02:02.430> biomes<00:02:03.000> these<00:02:03.719> guys<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:04.110> talking<00:02:04.320> about

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
new biomes these guys are talking about

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
new biomes these guys are talking about
adding<00:02:04.680> new<00:02:04.860> biomes<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.460> well<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> they're

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
adding new biomes as well and they're

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.690 
adding new biomes as well and they're
saying<00:02:06.420> all<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> PC<00:02:07.500> biomes<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.160> version

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
saying all of the PC biomes as a version

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.440 
saying all of the PC biomes as a version
1.7<00:02:09.660> which<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.709> ridiculous<00:02:11.400> now<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
1.7 which is ridiculous now it's not the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.230 
1.7 which is ridiculous now it's not the
new<00:02:12.660> update

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
new update

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.140 
new update
where<00:02:13.360> they<00:02:13.480> have<00:02:13.630> about<00:02:13.930> 80<00:02:14.230> volumes<00:02:14.860> now

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
where they have about 80 volumes now

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.590 
where they have about 80 volumes now
it's<00:02:16.150> got<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> lot<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.900> new<00:02:17.050> ones<00:02:17.260> though<00:02:17.440> so

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
it's got a lot of the new ones though so

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.060 
it's got a lot of the new ones though so
it<00:02:19.600> may<00:02:19.810> not<00:02:19.960> have<00:02:20.200> jungles<00:02:20.680> though<00:02:20.800> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
it may not have jungles though and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.430 
it may not have jungles though and
roofed<00:02:21.310> for<00:02:21.580> us<00:02:21.670> because<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.900> reason<00:02:23.260> they're

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
roofed for us because the reason they're

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.980 
roofed for us because the reason they're
gonna<00:02:23.560> struggle<00:02:24.130> with<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.730> just<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.390> the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
gonna struggle with this is just the the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.540 
gonna struggle with this is just the the
stuff<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:26.830> see<00:02:27.070> through<00:02:27.310> or

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
stuff that you can see through or

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.970 
stuff that you can see through or
invisible<00:02:28.270> or<00:02:28.630> transparent<00:02:29.410> textures<00:02:29.770> like

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
invisible or transparent textures like

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.510 
invisible or transparent textures like
tall<00:02:30.310> grass<00:02:30.640> or<00:02:31.030> leaves<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:32.080> fancy<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:33.280> that's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
tall grass or leaves on fancy so that's

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.920 
tall grass or leaves on fancy so that's
the<00:02:33.730> reason<00:02:34.000> they<00:02:34.090> may<00:02:34.240> not<00:02:34.360> be<00:02:34.510> able<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.780> put

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
the reason they may not be able to put

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.570 
the reason they may not be able to put
in<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.230> lot<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.410> these<00:02:35.560> bonds<00:02:35.890> with<00:02:36.010> trees<00:02:36.280> but

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
in a lot of these bonds with trees but

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.640 
in a lot of these bonds with trees but
they<00:02:37.000> say<00:02:37.210> anything<00:02:37.750> less<00:02:37.990> with<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.200> normal

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
they say anything less with the normal

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.410 
they say anything less with the normal
vegetation<00:02:39.280> or<00:02:39.550> normal<00:02:40.060> amount<00:02:40.330> of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
vegetation or normal amount of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.080 
vegetation or normal amount of
transparent<00:02:41.380> blocks<00:02:41.620> there<00:02:42.610> should<00:02:42.820> be<00:02:42.910> no

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
transparent blocks there should be no

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.120 
transparent blocks there should be no
problem<00:02:43.570> porting<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:43.990> in<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:44.830> may<00:02:45.070> see

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
problem porting it in so we may see

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.510 
problem porting it in so we may see
stuff<00:02:45.670> like<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.180> mega<00:02:46.450> taiga<00:02:46.990> Mesa<00:02:47.800> which

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
stuff like the mega taiga Mesa which

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.640 
stuff like the mega taiga Mesa which
which<00:02:48.850> would<00:02:49.090> include<00:02:49.330> clay<00:02:50.110> blocks<00:02:50.380> and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
which would include clay blocks and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.320 
which would include clay blocks and
being<00:02:50.860> included<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.430> game<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:52.090> may<00:02:52.270> see

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
being included to the game we may see

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.110 
being included to the game we may see
birch<00:02:52.750> forests<00:02:53.290> deep<00:02:53.650> oceans<00:02:54.100> savanna<00:02:54.850> or

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
birch forests deep oceans savanna or

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.110 
birch forests deep oceans savanna or
taiga<00:02:55.510> biomes<00:02:55.990> which<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.800> just<00:02:57.220> awesome<00:02:57.460> along

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
taiga biomes which is just awesome along

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.550 
taiga biomes which is just awesome along
of<00:02:58.330> course<00:02:58.390> with<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.900> biomes<00:02:59.290> we<00:02:59.410> have

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
of course with the biomes we have

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.710 
of course with the biomes we have
already<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.730> mate<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.090> rivers<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.660> all

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
already and mate like rivers and all

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.570 
already and mate like rivers and all
that<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.110> that'll<00:03:02.290> be<00:03:02.500> really<00:03:02.890> really<00:03:03.130> cool<00:03:03.370> if

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
that so that'll be really really cool if

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.020 
that so that'll be really really cool if
if<00:03:04.330> this<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.080> all<00:03:05.230> true<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.770> I'm<00:03:06.550> pretty<00:03:06.790> sure

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
if this is all true and I'm pretty sure

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.090 
if this is all true and I'm pretty sure
it's<00:03:07.540> going<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:07.930> because<00:03:08.470> they're<00:03:09.010> gonna

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
it's going to be because they're gonna

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.390 
it's going to be because they're gonna
say<00:03:09.370> they<00:03:09.550> said<00:03:09.790> all<00:03:10.030> blinds<00:03:10.750> as<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:11.100> PC<00:03:12.100> version

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
say they said all blinds as a PC version

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.070 
say they said all blinds as a PC version
1.7<00:03:12.850> that's<00:03:13.180> what<00:03:13.330> we're<00:03:13.420> getting<00:03:13.510> guys<00:03:13.810> so

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
1.7 that's what we're getting guys so

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.860 
1.7 that's what we're getting guys so
roofed<00:03:14.620> forest<00:03:14.880> isn't<00:03:15.880> gonna<00:03:16.210> be<00:03:16.390> on<00:03:16.630> there

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
roofed forest isn't gonna be on there

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.900 
roofed forest isn't gonna be on there
they're<00:03:17.320> saying<00:03:17.590> but<00:03:18.130> megataiga

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
they're saying but megataiga

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.130 
they're saying but megataiga
maybe<00:03:19.180> because<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.630> doesn't<00:03:19.810> have<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:19.960> lot<00:03:20.110> of

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
maybe because it doesn't have a lot of

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.440 
maybe because it doesn't have a lot of
leaves<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:21.340> birch<00:03:21.550> forests<00:03:22.030> probably

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
leaves the birch forests probably

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.510 
leaves the birch forests probably
probably<00:03:22.840> will<00:03:23.140> as<00:03:23.320> well<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.710> Mesa<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.310> sure

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
probably will as well the Mesa for sure

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.880 
probably will as well the Mesa for sure
if<00:03:24.730> if<00:03:25.720> they're<00:03:25.990> willing<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.320> add<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.680> clay

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
if if they're willing to add the clay

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.380 
if if they're willing to add the clay
blocks<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.400> deep<00:03:27.580> ocean<00:03:27.940> obviously<00:03:28.300> is

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
blocks the deep ocean obviously is

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.580 
blocks the deep ocean obviously is
pretty<00:03:28.570> much<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> same<00:03:28.930> thing<00:03:29.110> as<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.320> ocean

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
pretty much the same thing as the ocean

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.710 
pretty much the same thing as the ocean
just<00:03:29.620> deeper<00:03:30.130> on<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.790> savanna<00:03:31.180> which<00:03:31.570> is

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
just deeper on the savanna which is

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.050 
just deeper on the savanna which is
awesome<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.520> will<00:03:33.520> have<00:03:33.640> different<00:03:33.970> like

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
awesome and will have different like

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.550 
awesome and will have different like
grass<00:03:34.300> colors<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.990> that's<00:03:35.110> gonna<00:03:35.260> be<00:03:35.380> pretty

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
grass colors and that's gonna be pretty

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.470 
grass colors and that's gonna be pretty
cool<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.310> think<00:03:36.520> this<00:03:36.610> will<00:03:36.850> evolve<00:03:37.120> into

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
cool and I think this will evolve into

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.750 
cool and I think this will evolve into
adding<00:03:37.930> horses<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.500> get<00:03:38.680> around<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.190> I'm<00:03:39.370> not

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
adding horses to get around but I'm not

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.460 
adding horses to get around but I'm not
sure<00:03:40.000> if<00:03:40.090> that's<00:03:40.210> gonna<00:03:40.390> be<00:03:40.480> anytime<00:03:40.810> even

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
sure if that's gonna be anytime even

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.280 
sure if that's gonna be anytime even
remotely<00:03:42.100> soon<00:03:42.490> so<00:03:42.850> that's<00:03:43.300> pretty<00:03:43.570> cool<00:03:43.870> also

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
remotely soon so that's pretty cool also

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.820 
remotely soon so that's pretty cool also

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
a version exploit exclusive biome found

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.250 
a version exploit exclusive biome found
at<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> edge<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.520> non<00:03:48.790> infinite<00:03:49.330> worlds<00:03:49.660> I'm

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
at the edge of non infinite worlds I'm

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.470 
at the edge of non infinite worlds I'm
not<00:03:50.620> sure<00:03:50.890> what<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.100> means<00:03:51.250> really<00:03:51.970> but<00:03:52.360> it's

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
not sure what that means really but it's

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.510 
not sure what that means really but it's
saying<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.870> here<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.350> update<00:03:53.620> log<00:03:53.830> so

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
saying that here in the update log so

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.030 
saying that here in the update log so
I'm<00:03:54.670> assuming<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.240> it's<00:03:55.660> it's<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.410> saw<00:03:57.010> a

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
I'm assuming that it's it's a saw a

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.860 
I'm assuming that it's it's a saw a
biome<00:03:57.550> that's<00:03:57.790> gonna<00:03:58.210> be<00:03:58.360> exclusive

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
biome that's gonna be exclusive

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.260 
biome that's gonna be exclusive
proposition<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.770> at<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.550> edge<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:01.060> non

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
proposition and at the edge of non

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.080 
proposition and at the edge of non
infinite<00:04:01.870> worlds<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:03.070> that'll<00:04:03.460> be<00:04:03.580> like<00:04:03.820> if

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
infinite worlds so that'll be like if

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.370 
infinite worlds so that'll be like if
it's<00:04:04.360> not<00:04:04.510> infinite<00:04:04.780> there's<00:04:05.050> gonna<00:04:05.200> be

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
it's not infinite there's gonna be

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.260 
it's not infinite there's gonna be
something<00:04:05.590> at<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:05.920> edge<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.640> I'm<00:04:06.760> assuming<00:04:07.210> is

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
something at the edge so I'm assuming is

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.460 
something at the edge so I'm assuming is
going<00:04:07.300> to<00:04:07.480> be<00:04:07.540> like<00:04:07.690> mushroom<00:04:08.080> barn<00:04:08.260> where

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
going to be like mushroom barn where

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.320 
going to be like mushroom barn where
sometimes<00:04:08.680> it'll<00:04:09.070> be<00:04:09.130> at<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.340> end<00:04:09.550> but<00:04:10.240> I'm

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
sometimes it'll be at the end but I'm

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.210 
sometimes it'll be at the end but I'm
not<00:04:10.480> too<00:04:10.630> sure<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:11.320> would<00:04:11.770> be<00:04:11.800> pretty<00:04:11.980> cool

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
not too sure that would be pretty cool

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.650 
not too sure that would be pretty cool
to<00:04:12.280> see<00:04:12.370> what<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.790> where<00:04:13.030> that<00:04:13.180> turns<00:04:13.390> out<00:04:13.540> to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
to see what that where that turns out to

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.630 
to see what that where that turns out to
be<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:14.410> yeah<00:04:14.620> that's<00:04:15.040> gonna<00:04:15.160> be<00:04:15.250> pretty

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
be so yeah that's gonna be pretty

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.820 
be so yeah that's gonna be pretty
awesome

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
awesome

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.710 
awesome
so<00:04:17.830> this<00:04:18.010> will<00:04:18.190> only<00:04:18.220> apply<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:18.970> new<00:04:19.359> worlds

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
so this will only apply to new worlds

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.090 
so this will only apply to new worlds
all<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:20.049> cool<00:04:20.290> stuff<00:04:20.350> will<00:04:20.680> only<00:04:20.799> apply<00:04:21.070> to

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
all this cool stuff will only apply to

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.159 
all this cool stuff will only apply to
new<00:04:21.400> worlds<00:04:21.729> older<00:04:22.360> worlds<00:04:22.690> will<00:04:22.840> still

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
new worlds older worlds will still

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.320 
new worlds older worlds will still
expand<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.770> become<00:04:23.860> infinite<00:04:24.490> but<00:04:24.940> have<00:04:25.150> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
expand to become infinite but have the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.030 
expand to become infinite but have the
old<00:04:25.510> terrain<00:04:25.900> generation<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:26.650> there<00:04:26.800> won't

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
old terrain generation so there won't

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.100 
old terrain generation so there won't
caves<00:04:27.370> or<00:04:27.580> tall<00:04:27.760> grass<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.570> if<00:04:28.690> you're<00:04:28.840> looking

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
caves or tall grass so if you're looking

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.630 
caves or tall grass so if you're looking
to<00:04:29.230> keep<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.590> world<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:29.920> have<00:04:30.070> unfortunate

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
to keep the world you have unfortunate

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.830 
to keep the world you have unfortunate
it's<00:04:30.760> not<00:04:30.880> gonna<00:04:30.970> get<00:04:31.150> any<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.600> cool<00:04:31.780> new

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
it's not gonna get any of the cool new

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.750 
it's not gonna get any of the cool new
features<00:04:32.440> because<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.040> just<00:04:33.220> won't<00:04:33.340> pour<00:04:33.700> it

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
features because it just won't pour it

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.610 
features because it just won't pour it
over<00:04:34.000> well<00:04:34.210> if<00:04:34.390> they<00:04:34.540> add<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.900> new<00:04:35.020> generation

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
over well if they add the new generation

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.770 
over well if they add the new generation
on<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.010> Edit<00:04:36.280> it'll<00:04:36.580> just<00:04:36.820> it'll<00:04:37.030> just<00:04:37.600> not

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
on to the Edit it'll just it'll just not

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.230 
on to the Edit it'll just it'll just not
just<00:04:38.710> not<00:04:38.830> be<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.100> clean<00:04:39.340> generation<00:04:39.940> so<00:04:40.090> that's

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
just not be a clean generation so that's

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.880 
just not be a clean generation so that's
why<00:04:40.450> they're<00:04:40.660> deciding<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:41.050> do<00:04:41.170> it<00:04:41.290> at<00:04:41.830> least

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
why they're deciding to do it at least

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.320 
why they're deciding to do it at least
you<00:04:42.220> have<00:04:42.370> infinite<00:04:42.790> worlds<00:04:43.030> in<00:04:43.120> your<00:04:43.150> old

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
you have infinite worlds in your old

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.940 
you have infinite worlds in your old
ones<00:04:43.510> as<00:04:43.630> well<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.290> know<00:04:44.380> that's<00:04:44.530> all<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:44.830> can

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
ones as well you know that's all you can

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.100 
ones as well you know that's all you can
really<00:04:45.010> ask<00:04:45.250> for<00:04:45.700> so<00:04:46.270> as<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.750> said<00:04:46.990> they're

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
really ask for so as I said they're

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.480 
really ask for so as I said they're
gonna<00:04:47.200> have<00:04:47.440> some<00:04:47.590> new<00:04:47.710> toggles<00:04:48.220> they're

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
gonna have some new toggles they're

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.790 
gonna have some new toggles they're
gonna<00:04:48.580> have<00:04:48.790> toggles<00:04:49.300> for<00:04:49.540> caves<00:04:49.780> tall<00:04:50.500> grass

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
gonna have toggles for caves tall grass

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.560 
gonna have toggles for caves tall grass
and<00:04:51.130> different<00:04:51.550> world<00:04:51.700> sizes<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.240> those<00:04:52.450> are

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
and different world sizes that those are

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.480 
and different world sizes that those are
the<00:04:52.660> new<00:04:52.840> tweaks<00:04:53.740> they're<00:04:53.920> adding<00:04:54.160> into<00:04:54.400> the

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
the new tweaks they're adding into the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.000 
the new tweaks they're adding into the
options<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.570> additions<00:04:56.170> they're<00:04:56.740> not<00:04:56.890> gonna

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
options so additions they're not gonna

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.950 
options so additions they're not gonna
be<00:04:57.220> adding<00:04:57.490> too<00:04:57.640> many<00:04:57.790> blocks<00:04:58.120> obviously<00:04:58.750> the

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
be adding too many blocks obviously the

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.810 
be adding too many blocks obviously the
ones<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.830> ones<00:05:00.010> that<00:05:00.130> correspond<00:05:00.760> with

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
ones that the ones that correspond with

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.070 
ones that the ones that correspond with
the<00:05:00.970> biomes<00:05:01.330> are<00:05:01.450> adding<00:05:01.630> which<00:05:01.750> we<00:05:01.900> haven't

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
the biomes are adding which we haven't

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.080 
the biomes are adding which we haven't
really<00:05:02.230> confirmed<00:05:02.740> yet<00:05:02.980> but<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.700> can<00:05:03.850> almost

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
really confirmed yet but you can almost

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.530 
really confirmed yet but you can almost
see<00:05:04.480> anything<00:05:05.020> that's<00:05:05.380> in<00:05:05.730> 1.7<00:05:06.730> so<00:05:07.270> like<00:05:07.420> the

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
see anything that's in 1.7 so like the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.440 
see anything that's in 1.7 so like the
Mesa<00:05:07.780> I'm<00:05:08.350> pretty<00:05:08.740> sure<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.250> make<00:05:09.490> it<00:05:09.670> there's

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
Mesa I'm pretty sure and make it there's

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.730 
Mesa I'm pretty sure and make it there's
a<00:05:10.510> good<00:05:10.660> chance<00:05:10.870> it'll<00:05:11.080> be<00:05:11.170> added<00:05:11.380> because<00:05:11.470> it

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
a good chance it'll be added because it

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.260 
a good chance it'll be added because it
doesn't<00:05:12.040> have<00:05:12.190> any<00:05:12.220> transparent<00:05:12.880> blocks<00:05:13.060> it's

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
doesn't have any transparent blocks it's

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.850 
doesn't have any transparent blocks it's
just<00:05:13.390> the<00:05:13.480> kind<00:05:13.630> of<00:05:13.660> clay<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.440> maybe<00:05:14.680> they'll

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
just the kind of clay so maybe they'll

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.770 
just the kind of clay so maybe they'll
be<00:05:14.950> adding<00:05:15.130> clay<00:05:15.310> but<00:05:15.520> for<00:05:15.730> sure<00:05:15.970> they<00:05:16.600> have

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
be adding clay but for sure they have

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.690 
be adding clay but for sure they have
confirmed<00:05:17.290> they're<00:05:17.830> adding<00:05:18.130> tall<00:05:18.430> grass

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
confirmed they're adding tall grass

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.880 
confirmed they're adding tall grass
which<00:05:18.940> is<00:05:18.970> sweet<00:05:19.420> just<00:05:19.960> really<00:05:20.200> spices<00:05:20.650> up<00:05:20.800> the

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
which is sweet just really spices up the

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.760 
which is sweet just really spices up the
look<00:05:21.070> of<00:05:21.190> things<00:05:21.370> also<00:05:22.360> they<00:05:22.930> may<00:05:23.230> be<00:05:23.290> adding

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
look of things also they may be adding

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
I'm not too positive but I think it's I

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.080 
I'm not too positive but I think it's I
think<00:05:35.500> they're<00:05:35.860> gonna<00:05:35.980> be<00:05:36.040> there<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:36.520> yeah<00:05:36.880> so
