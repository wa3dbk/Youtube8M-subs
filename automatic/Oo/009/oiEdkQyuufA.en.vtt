00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
successful run we just have to make a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
this reason our corporation opponents

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
this reason our corporation opponents
are<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.789> smart<00:01:00.359> about<00:01:00.510> how

are going to have to be smart about how

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.869

encounter the first piece of ice and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.359 
encounter the first piece of ice and
then<00:01:51.030> Jack<00:01:51.420> out<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.590> ran<00:01:52.890> against<00:01:53.159> this

pup<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:54.000> example<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:55.020> could<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.380> pay<00:01:55.619> the
