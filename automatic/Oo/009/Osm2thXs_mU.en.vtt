00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.070 
lot of people have said that it gives
some<00:02:27.870> lines<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.410> really<00:02:29.680> defines<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.099> little

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
some lines it really defines the little

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.750 
some lines it really defines the little
wrinkles<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.530> stuff<00:02:32.800> around<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.250> eye<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:33.700> I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
wrinkles and stuff around the eye but I

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.589

make it work whether it be using you

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.570

know<00:02:43.510> something<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.319> moisturize<00:02:44.680> running<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
know something to moisturize running the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.030 
know something to moisturize running the
eye<00:02:45.610> before<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.390> apply<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.750> on<00:02:46.989> or<00:02:47.170> using<00:02:47.920> your

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
eye before you apply it on or using your

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.140 
eye before you apply it on or using your
finger<00:02:48.400> or<00:02:48.610> brush<00:02:48.640> or<00:02:49.360> whatever<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:51.670> can

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
finger or brush or whatever this can

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
finger or brush or whatever this can
definitely<00:02:52.330> work<00:02:52.810> okay<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:54.370> one<00:02:54.610> has<00:02:55.170> light

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
definitely work okay this one has light

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.650 
definitely work okay this one has light
reflectance<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:59.160> it<00:03:00.160> basically<00:03:00.700> just<00:03:01.360> makes

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
reflectance so it basically just makes

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.270 
reflectance so it basically just makes
it<00:03:01.780> look<00:03:01.840> lighter<00:03:02.349> like<00:03:02.739> it's<00:03:02.890> got<00:03:03.040> light

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
it look lighter like it's got light

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.780 
it look lighter like it's got light
reflex<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:03.910> it<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:05.160> don't<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.430> can't<00:03:06.700> really

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
reflex in it so I don't I can't really

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.420 
reflex in it so I don't I can't really
explain<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.239> but<00:03:07.620> for<00:03:08.620> underneath<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.250> eye<00:03:09.280> I

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
explain it but for underneath the eye I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.839 
explain it but for underneath the eye I
find<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.150> that<00:03:10.360> isn't<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.900> very<00:03:11.079> good<00:03:11.230> idea

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
find that that isn't a very good idea

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.039 
find that that isn't a very good idea
overall<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:12.880> good<00:03:13.120> concealer<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.599> I<00:03:13.750> will

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
overall a good concealer that I will

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.949 
overall a good concealer that I will
definitely<00:03:14.340> purchase<00:03:15.340> again<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.480> next<00:03:16.690> year

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
definitely purchase again the next year

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.390 
definitely purchase again the next year

creamy<00:03:24.730> like<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.329> studio<00:03:25.810> finish<00:03:26.380> however<00:03:26.980> I

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
creamy like the studio finish however I

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.949 
creamy like the studio finish however I
would<00:03:27.370> say<00:03:27.639> it's<00:03:27.760> more<00:03:27.880> like<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> moose<00:03:28.569> I

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
would say it's more like a moose I

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.670 
would say it's more like a moose I
wouldn't<00:03:29.709> say<00:03:29.769> it's<00:03:30.160> like<00:03:30.540> more<00:03:31.540> fluid<00:03:32.049> or

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
wouldn't say it's like more fluid or

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.440 
wouldn't say it's like more fluid or
anything<00:03:33.130> like<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.400> was<00:03:33.670> expecting<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.329> to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
anything like that I was expecting it to

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.210 
anything like that I was expecting it to
be<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.630> lot<00:03:34.870> more<00:03:34.900> creamier<00:03:35.620> people<00:03:35.950> also

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
be a lot more creamier people also

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.280 
be a lot more creamier people also
creamy<00:03:36.670> but<00:03:37.000> nori<00:03:37.269> it's<00:03:37.450> not<00:03:37.660> really<00:03:37.959> creamy

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
creamy but nori it's not really creamy

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.280 
creamy but nori it's not really creamy
it's<00:03:38.530> still<00:03:38.859> thick<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:40.630> will<00:03:40.870> still<00:03:41.170> be

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
it's still thick and you will still be

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.990 
it's still thick and you will still be
getting<00:03:41.560> fine<00:03:41.859> lines<00:03:42.130> around<00:03:42.310> your<00:03:42.519> eyes<00:03:42.609> if

you don't apply it properly okay now in

you don't apply it properly okay now in
my<00:03:45.519> foundation<00:03:46.329> application<00:03:46.480> videos<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.910> i

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
my foundation application videos like i

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.910 
my foundation application videos like i
said<00:03:49.090> i<00:03:49.239> was<00:03:49.480> using<00:03:49.810> this<00:03:50.079> one<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.590> studio

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
said i was using this one the studio

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.460 
said i was using this one the studio
sculpt<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:52.450> was<00:03:52.600> only<00:03:52.750> like<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.019> second

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
sculpt and it was only like the second

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.520 
sculpt and it was only like the second
time<00:03:53.709> i<00:03:53.739> had<00:03:54.160> used<00:03:54.459> it<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.790> in<00:03:55.030> comparison<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.840> I

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
time i had used it and in comparison I I

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.069 
time i had used it and in comparison I I
thought<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.819> studio<00:03:58.209> finish<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.870> the

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
thought that the studio finish and the

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.750 
thought that the studio finish and the
studio<00:03:59.440> sculpt<00:04:00.010> didn't<00:04:00.370> have<00:04:00.519> much

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
studio sculpt didn't have much

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.270 
studio sculpt didn't have much
differences<00:04:01.450> except<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.829> one<00:04:03.069> was<00:04:03.220> a

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
differences except that this one was a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.599 
differences except that this one was a
bit<00:04:03.489> darker<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.560> was<00:04:05.709> more<00:04:06.280> moose

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
bit darker and that it was more moose

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.199 
bit darker and that it was more moose
like<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.299> then<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:08.079> wasn't<00:04:08.349> until<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:09.280> took

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
like and then it wasn't until I took

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.550 
like and then it wasn't until I took
some<00:04:10.660> photos<00:04:10.959> of<00:04:12.060> myself<00:04:13.139> afterwards<00:04:14.139> and

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
some photos of myself afterwards and

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.650 
some photos of myself afterwards and
uploaded<00:04:15.280> them<00:04:15.310> onto<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.760> computer<00:04:15.819> how<00:04:16.450> much

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
uploaded them onto the computer how much

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.469 
uploaded them onto the computer how much
of<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.870> difference<00:04:17.349> is<00:04:17.560> made<00:04:18.209> underneath<00:04:19.209> my

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
of a difference is made underneath my

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.449 
of a difference is made underneath my
underneath<00:04:20.410> my<00:04:20.590> eyes<00:04:20.709> usually<00:04:21.099> I<00:04:21.310> would

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
underneath my eyes usually I would

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.969 
underneath my eyes usually I would
always<00:04:21.789> have<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.750> like<00:04:22.930> Photoshop<00:04:23.710> these

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
always have to like Photoshop these

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.550 
always have to like Photoshop these
lines<00:04:24.310> out<00:04:24.610> but<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.389> lot<00:04:25.720> of<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.900> times<00:04:26.169> I<00:04:26.349> don't

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
lines out but a lot of the times I don't

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.529 
lines out but a lot of the times I don't
have<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:27.070> when<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.340> have<00:04:27.640> this<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:28.180> mean<00:04:28.330> they're

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
have to when I have this I mean they're

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.620 
have to when I have this I mean they're
gone

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.560 

how<00:04:31.860> amazing<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.250> that<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.940> think<00:04:34.360> this<00:04:34.510> is

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
how amazing is that I think this is

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.660 
how amazing is that I think this is
because<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.200> doesn't<00:04:35.500> have<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.680> light

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
because it doesn't have the light

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.760 
because it doesn't have the light
reflectance<00:04:37.300> well<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:37.900> don't<00:04:38.170> think<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.590> does

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
let cover up one I think it's called

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.540 
let cover up one I think it's called
I've<00:05:12.700> never<00:05:13.150> tried<00:05:13.480> it<00:05:13.540> but<00:05:13.900> that<00:05:14.890> is<00:05:15.160> a<00:05:15.220> lot

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
I've never tried it but that is a lot

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.050 
I've never tried it but that is a lot
better<00:05:15.700> for<00:05:16.090> under<00:05:16.900> eye<00:05:17.380> lines<00:05:18.310> and<00:05:18.850> stuff

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
better for under eye lines and stuff

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.500 
better for under eye lines and stuff
like<00:05:19.450> it<00:05:19.660> doesn't<00:05:19.960> really<00:05:20.280> show<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.510> however

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
like it doesn't really show it however

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.200 
like it doesn't really show it however
it<00:05:23.020> doesn't<00:05:23.230> have<00:05:23.530> full<00:05:23.800> coverage<00:05:24.100> so<00:05:25.060> if

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
it doesn't have full coverage so if

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.880 
it doesn't have full coverage so if
you're<00:05:25.420> someone<00:05:25.840> like<00:05:25.900> me<00:05:26.080> who<00:05:26.440> does<00:05:26.650> have

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
you're someone like me who does have

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.070 
you're someone like me who does have
those<00:05:27.040> dominant<00:05:27.490> lines<00:05:27.700> you<00:05:28.360> will<00:05:28.630> need<00:05:28.810> full

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
those dominant lines you will need full

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.810 
those dominant lines you will need full
coverage<00:05:29.560> I<00:05:29.770> mean<00:05:29.920> there's<00:05:30.100> no<00:05:30.220> point<00:05:30.640> of

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
coverage I mean there's no point of

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.140 
coverage I mean there's no point of
using<00:05:31.630> a<00:05:31.840> concealer<00:05:32.080> that<00:05:32.910> doesn't<00:05:33.910> cover

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
using a concealer that doesn't cover

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.190 
using a concealer that doesn't cover
really<00:05:35.140> so<00:05:36.090> yeah<00:05:37.090> like<00:05:37.330> I<00:05:37.480> said<00:05:37.690> it's<00:05:37.840> just<00:05:37.900> the

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
really so yeah like I said it's just the

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.630 
really so yeah like I said it's just the
technique<00:05:38.650> or<00:05:38.800> finding<00:05:39.130> out<00:05:39.250> what<00:05:39.400> works

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
technique or finding out what works

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.060 
technique or finding out what works
better<00:05:39.910> for<00:05:40.150> you<00:05:40.770> presentation-wise<00:05:41.770> I

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.610 
definitely prefer this to us gold with
the<00:05:44.860> studio<00:05:45.370> finish<00:05:46.080> just<00:05:47.080> because<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.470> think

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
the studio finish just because I think

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.820 
the studio finish just because I think
that<00:05:47.860> this<00:05:48.130> one's<00:05:48.430> like<00:05:49.360> I<00:05:49.780> don't<00:05:50.410> know<00:05:50.590> it

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
that this one's like I don't know it

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.960 
that this one's like I don't know it
looks<00:05:51.010> a<00:05:51.130> lot<00:05:51.280> better<00:05:51.460> it's<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.820> lot<00:05:51.940> more

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
looks a lot better it's a lot more

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.180 
looks a lot better it's a lot more
classic<00:05:52.450> because<00:05:52.600> it's<00:05:52.780> glass<00:05:53.100> whereas<00:05:54.100> this

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
classic because it's glass whereas this

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.740 
classic because it's glass whereas this
one's<00:05:54.400> just<00:05:54.490> plastic<00:05:55.090> and<00:05:55.270> I<00:05:55.330> think<00:05:55.510> it<00:05:55.600> looks

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
one's just plastic and I think it looks

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.530 
one's just plastic and I think it looks
kind<00:05:55.990> of<00:05:56.050> ugly<00:05:56.170> but<00:05:57.040> you<00:05:57.340> know<00:05:57.850> it's<00:05:58.180> kind<00:05:58.390> of

kind of ugly but you know it's kind of

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.090
