tutorial<00:00:05.460> this<00:00:05.819> tutorial<00:00:06.210> number<00:00:06.690> 13<00:00:07.500> so<00:00:08.400> now

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
tutorial this tutorial number 13 so now

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.690 
tutorial this tutorial number 13 so now
we<00:00:09.360> start<00:00:09.599> with<00:00:09.750> tutorial<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.710> tutorial<00:00:11.219> will

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
we start with tutorial the tutorial will

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.560 
we start with tutorial the tutorial will
be<00:00:11.880> about<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.630> objects<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.400> use<00:00:14.639> physics

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
be about the objects that we use physics

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.830 
be about the objects that we use physics
like<00:00:15.990> code<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.310> use<00:00:17.520> maybe<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.480> plane

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
like code so you can use maybe a plane

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.859 
like code so you can use maybe a plane
as<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> flag<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.460> not<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> couple<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.240> things<00:00:21.480> or

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
as a flag and not a couple of things or

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.630 
as a flag and not a couple of things or
all<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> objects<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.070> may<00:00:23.340> want<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
all the objects that you may want to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.990 
all the objects that you may want to
change<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.529> your<00:00:25.529> prying<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.789> use

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
change on your prying that you can use

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.779 
change on your prying that you can use
them<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.420> win<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.590> move<00:00:28.740> around<00:00:28.949> maybe

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
them with win so I can move around maybe

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.970 
them with win so I can move around maybe
a<00:00:29.880> cave<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:30.480> something<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> superhero<00:00:31.859> or

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
a cave or something for a superhero or

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.120 
a cave or something for a superhero or
something<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.200> star<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
something like so the star that is the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.950 
something like so the star that is the
cube<00:00:36.980> let's<00:00:37.980> create<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.610> plane<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.780> will

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
cube let's create a plane that we will

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.250 
cube let's create a plane that we will
use<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> floor<00:00:40.710> scale<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.850> now<00:00:42.690> i'm<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
use a floor scale this now i'm going to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.920 
use a floor scale this now i'm going to
the<00:00:43.290> materials<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> moment<00:00:44.750> and<00:00:45.750> i'm

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the materials here for a moment and i'm

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
the materials here for a moment and i'm
going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> insert<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.100> material<00:00:47.670> i'm<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
going to insert a material i'm going to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.450 
going to insert a material i'm going to
create<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:48.480> i'm<00:00:49.200> gonna<00:00:49.379> choose<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> color<00:00:50.010> here

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
create one i'm gonna choose a color here

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.650 
create one i'm gonna choose a color here
it's<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.180> dark<00:00:51.449> color<00:00:51.980> we<00:00:52.980> go<00:00:53.660> tends

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
it's going to be dark color we go tends

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's going to be dark color we go tends
to<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.899> particular<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.100> one<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to be particular is gonna be one and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.849 
to be particular is gonna be one and
hardness<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:59.270> there<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> now<00:01:01.800> we

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
hardness and be there we go so now we

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
hardness and be there we go so now we
need<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> physics<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.750> can

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
need to go to the physics here so we can

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.859 
need to go to the physics here so we can
choose<00:01:04.140> collision<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> flag<00:01:06.119> goes

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
choose collision so when the flag goes

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.390 
choose collision so when the flag goes
down<00:01:06.930> or<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:09.090> Cape<00:01:09.330> whatever<00:01:09.810> Ukraine<00:01:10.799> goes

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
down or the Cape whatever Ukraine goes

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.380 
down or the Cape whatever Ukraine goes
down<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:12.420> drops<00:01:12.840> into<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> floor<00:01:13.680> of

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
down just drops into the floor of

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.710 
down just drops into the floor of
another<00:01:15.390> way<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.950> plane<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.450> let's

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
another way into this plane so now let's

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.870 
another way into this plane so now let's
create<00:01:18.840> another<00:01:18.990> plane<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.670> going

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
create another plane here that's going

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.460 
create another plane here that's going
to<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.840> will<00:01:22.020> use<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
to be the one that we will use with a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.390 
to be the one that we will use with a
cloak<00:01:22.740> rest<00:01:23.729> galen<00:01:25.070> little<00:01:26.070> bit<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> little

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
cloak rest galen little bit a little

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.260 
cloak rest galen little bit a little
take<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.930> 40<00:01:28.290> degrees<00:01:28.740> only

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
take this one for the 40 degrees only

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.859 
take this one for the 40 degrees only
I'm<00:01:30.270> gonna<00:01:30.540> sort<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.020> color<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.860> gonna<00:01:32.130> be

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
I'm gonna sort of color so it's gonna be

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.640 
I'm gonna sort of color so it's gonna be
red<00:01:36.049> yeah<00:01:37.049> right<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.890> good<00:01:38.070> okay<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
red yeah right it's good okay so for the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.749 
red yeah right it's good okay so for the
intensity<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.720> want<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
intensity of this one so we want to

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.740 
intensity of this one so we want to
spend<00:01:44.759> 10<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> harness<00:01:46.170> there<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.220> go<00:01:47.750> so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
spend 10 for the harness there we go so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.109 
spend 10 for the harness there we go so
now<00:01:51.170> we<00:01:52.170> need<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.320> divide<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.430> plane<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
now we need to divide the plane so I

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.810 
now we need to divide the plane so I
have<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.630> couple<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.439> parts<00:01:55.950> different<00:01:56.520> parts

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
have a couple of parts different parts

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.690 
have a couple of parts different parts
dividing<00:01:57.450> all<00:01:57.659> clean<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
dividing all clean so we're going to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.840 
dividing all clean so we're going to
that<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> mole<00:02:00.210> present<00:02:00.689> AB<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:02.369> your

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that the mole present AB and on your

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.510 
that the mole present AB and on your
left<00:02:02.990> properties<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.320> we're<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
left properties here we're going to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.160 
left properties here we're going to
choose<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.180> divine<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:07.170> right<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:07.649> 1<00:02:08.220> 2<00:02:08.700> 3

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
choose so divine it's right here 1 2 3

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.619 
choose so divine it's right here 1 2 3
only<00:02:10.170> three<00:02:10.770> times<00:02:11.069> old<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:12.120> now<00:02:12.239> let's<00:02:12.480> get

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
only three times old so now let's get

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.940 
only three times old so now let's get
out<00:02:12.780> from<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> elmo<00:02:13.500> person

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
out from the elmo person

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.500 
out from the elmo person
tab<00:02:14.270> now<00:02:15.270> let's<00:02:15.840> go<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.170> our<00:02:16.940> modifiers<00:02:17.940> let's

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
tab now let's go to our modifiers let's

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.800 
tab now let's go to our modifiers let's
add<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> new<00:02:18.989> modifier<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.739> this<00:02:19.920> plane<00:02:20.340> here

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
add a new modifier to this plane here

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.210 
add a new modifier to this plane here
it's<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:21.989> be<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> subdivision<00:02:22.530> surface

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
it's going to be a subdivision surface

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.670 
it's going to be a subdivision surface
so<00:02:23.550> we<00:02:23.580> can<00:02:23.760> look<00:02:23.940> smoother<00:02:24.540> way<00:02:25.440> much<00:02:25.650> better

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
so we can look smoother way much better

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.610 
so we can look smoother way much better
and<00:02:26.269> now<00:02:27.269> let's<00:02:27.569> go<00:02:27.690> toward<00:02:27.989> physics<00:02:28.410> and

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
and now let's go toward physics and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.620 
and now let's go toward physics and
let's<00:02:28.890> choose<00:02:29.250> clothes<00:02:30.410> now<00:02:32.180> for<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.269> plane

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
let's choose clothes now for this plane

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.960 
let's choose clothes now for this plane
on<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.080> floor<00:02:34.319> let's<00:02:34.860> choose<00:02:35.130> collision<00:02:35.849> on

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
on the floor let's choose collision on

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.150 
on the floor let's choose collision on
the<00:02:36.060> physics<00:02:36.480> oh<00:02:36.720> ok<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.769> have<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.069> already

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the physics oh ok we have it already

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.580 
the physics oh ok we have it already
alright<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.599> let's<00:02:39.810> hit<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.049> place<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.500> we

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
alright so now let's hit the place so we

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.050 
alright so now let's hit the place so we
can<00:02:40.709> see<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.040> will<00:02:41.160> have<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:43.489> there<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.519> go<00:02:44.610> as

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
can see you will have it there you go as

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.820 
can see you will have it there you go as
you<00:02:45.239> can<00:02:45.330> see<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:45.840> move<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:46.349> smooth

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
you can see it's not move as smooth

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.960 
you can see it's not move as smooth
enough<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.720> work<00:02:48.930> with<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.970> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
enough so we have to work with that and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.000 
enough so we have to work with that and
we<00:02:51.269> choose<00:02:51.810> our<00:02:52.079> plane<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:53.610> for<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.560> physics

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
we choose our plane and for the physics

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.710 
we choose our plane and for the physics
for<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.700> physics<00:02:57.230> close<00:02:58.700> well<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.760> fires<00:03:00.030> on

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
for the physics close well the fires on

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.470 
for the physics close well the fires on
the<00:03:00.780> view<00:03:01.049> unsub<00:03:01.799> so<00:03:02.310> divisions<00:03:02.760> we<00:03:03.030> need<00:03:03.209> to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
the view unsub so divisions we need to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.190 
the view unsub so divisions we need to
choose<00:03:03.690> at<00:03:03.989> least<00:03:04.019> two<00:03:04.579> and<00:03:05.579> let's<00:03:06.180> move<00:03:06.480> this

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
choose at least two and let's move this

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.059 
choose at least two and let's move this
one<00:03:07.709> from<00:03:08.220> here<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:09.000> Left<00:03:09.299> panel<00:03:09.569> also

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
one from here on the Left panel also

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.030 
one from here on the Left panel also
like<00:03:11.069> three<00:03:11.940> times<00:03:12.269> Mary<00:03:12.720> now<00:03:13.560> let's<00:03:13.860> see<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
like three times Mary now let's see the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.640 
like three times Mary now let's see the
plate<00:03:16.430> there<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.579> go<00:03:17.760> now<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.480> looks<00:03:18.810> way

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
plate there we go now that looks way

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.020 
plate there we go now that looks way
much<00:03:20.010> better<00:03:20.569> now<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.600> want<00:03:22.109> to<00:03:22.170> add<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:23.030> peril

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
much better now I want to add a peril

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.410 
much better now I want to add a peril
maybe<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.569> vortex<00:03:25.380> see<00:03:25.950> if<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.700> goes<00:03:27.000> up<00:03:27.239> or

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
maybe a vortex see if it goes up or

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.390 
maybe a vortex see if it goes up or
something<00:03:27.840> or<00:03:28.139> maybe<00:03:28.170> moves<00:03:28.680> around<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.220> little

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
something or maybe moves around a little

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.670 
something or maybe moves around a little
bit<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:30.389> I'm<00:03:30.720> going<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.019> choose<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.410> force

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
bit so I'm going to choose the force

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.509 
bit so I'm going to choose the force
field<00:03:32.069> I'm<00:03:32.880> going<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.180> choose<00:03:33.329> our<00:03:33.660> vortex

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
field I'm going to choose our vortex

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.860 
field I'm going to choose our vortex
let's<00:03:35.519> scale<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.180> one<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> little<00:03:36.690> bit<00:03:38.870> and

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
let's scale this one a little bit and

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:52.280 
let's scale this one a little bit and
for<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.260> strength<00:03:40.620> owner<00:03:41.190> put<00:03:47.209> put<00:03:50.840> 33<00:03:51.840> let's

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
for the strength owner put put 33 let's

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.360 
for the strength owner put put 33 let's
try<00:03:52.440> with<00:03:52.680> 3<00:03:53.010> only<00:03:53.190> we<00:03:54.709> go<00:03:55.709> let's<00:03:56.010> hit<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
try with 3 only we go let's hit the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:06.050 
try with 3 only we go let's hit the
plane<00:04:00.170> in<00:04:01.310> there<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.670> go<00:04:03.829> so<00:04:04.829> that<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.370> part<00:04:05.819> of

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
plane in there you go so that is part of

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.150 
plane in there you go so that is part of
the<00:04:06.329> animation<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:07.019> was<00:04:07.049> supposed<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.769> do<00:04:07.889> so

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
the animation that was supposed to do so

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.580 
the animation that was supposed to do so
you<00:04:08.190> can<00:04:08.609> maybe<00:04:09.120> create<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.540> flag<00:04:09.780> start<00:04:10.470> moving

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
you can maybe create a flag start moving

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.460 
you can maybe create a flag start moving
around<00:04:10.970> with<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.000> 21<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.690> something<00:04:13.290> like<00:04:13.319> that

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
around with a 21 and something like that

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:22.490 
around with a 21 and something like that
oh<00:04:15.229> let's<00:04:16.229> put<00:04:16.530> five<00:04:16.829> on<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.220> train

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.930 

I<00:04:23.180> think<00:04:24.180> that's<00:04:24.420> how<00:04:24.630> much<00:04:25.400> strength<00:04:26.400> for<00:04:26.790> it

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
I think that's how much strength for it

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.350 
I think that's how much strength for it
virtually<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:32.010> it's<00:04:32.400> not<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.790> goes<00:04:33.030> i'm<00:04:33.330> a

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
virtually and it's not that goes i'm a

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:41.540 
virtually and it's not that goes i'm a
little<00:04:33.570> short<00:04:34.140> three<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:41.130> that's<00:04:41.340> way

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
little short three of you so that's way

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.100 
little short three of you so that's way
much<00:04:41.760> better<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:44.400> i<00:04:44.430> think<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:45.390> will<00:04:45.840> cover

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
much better so i think that will cover

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.890 
much better so i think that will cover
