00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 megamamute gave his full vacation and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.180
 check out our offers show us 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.240
 Here we declare our love several times. 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.309
 by the way those very nice little things 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.690
 played as a kid is now the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.320
 there is a channel that I do not 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.210
 I knew the face of a zazi flame in the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 chin using ours so 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 hence they always do something very 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.500
 cool this time they made their bids 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.449
 they were this strong team weapon printed 3d 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.960
 I do not really know, everyone made guns. 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.099
 are filming turning O having many 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 times that page 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.100
 so look at it the cars used two 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.690
 thousand and three hundred regular lego pieces talego 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.700
 technician we have only took a slight 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.110
 global cassoulet from what I saw it goes 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.899
 have many pieces we only have a light 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.309
 technicians then too much mass was 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.649
 perfectly equal to the weapon of the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 fortress 2 and there are other things I 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.660
 I want to announce to you, for example, 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.340
 area 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.899
 it seems very simple to do this. 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.660
 gun in the terrarium looks lonely 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.420
 but it's very cool and the expression 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.339
 look it is very good looking only looks 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 really is with pixel art business 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.210
 in hand and this was done with light 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.000
 normal not light the technician was totally 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.930
 square is part of the structure. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.390
 do not fall 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.810
 Of course you will not use this in combat 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.470
 but it was very well done look what mass 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.259
 sure that if you do something 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.869
 minecraft also because it is total style 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.750
 pixel art is in caps also improvements 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.729
 that they made sticks and also in 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.200
 boston on the beach has no disadvantage is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.479
 very strange it was so it seems that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.759
 from there to the assembly but not the same parts 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.909
 of lego there with his champagne pixels of 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.090
 beach is very well done and also small 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 until it was bigger and another showed 6 is 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.590
 sea under who needs minecraft 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.960
 look at this castle the same as the manifesto 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.540
 to fantasize equal wines created looks only 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.219
 our base but everything is made up of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.560
 Lake took enough to draw the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.899
 people liked minecraft now 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.990
 they did that lev game that is the same 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.450
 to the flash that took a lot but our 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.550
 just too much there as got out 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.390
 the head to have a range of minecraft 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.980
 So we got the head you want. 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.640
 which takes the number 7 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.069
 whoever is much mass looks then just okay 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.760
