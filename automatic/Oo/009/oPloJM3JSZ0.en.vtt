00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello friends welcome to a new appointment 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.500
 with our beloved chess we have a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.750
 position in which there is issue of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.550
 deviation by White and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.340
 on Black's part whether they 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.970
 touch move to one side as if it touches them 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.520
 move to another voucher for the video and try 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 to solve this exercise by yourself 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 OK 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.599
 If you touch them black will move as the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:35.780
 play would be bishop by horse and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:40.129
 now if at last for bishop phil for efe 5 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.129
 Well, great lady sacrifice for 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.129
 divert 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.860
 to the defense tower of the first 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.460
 row now yes towers per lady we see that 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.640
 the one in the first row has been 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.850
 weakened and white is not left 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.000
 more remedy than f1 tower and the black re 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.610
 material with tower by f1 checkmate 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.320
 because this box is covered by 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.690
 pawn of h3 vale 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.690
 we return to the initial position 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.480
 OK 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.560
 touching them to move to white as 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.850
 there is a spectacular play of 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.120
 deviation and start with a sacrifice 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.570
 of lady 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:44.750
 Lady for 5 Lady sacrifice 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:49.370
 we divert the black lady from the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.610
 column f now you will see how it looks 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.920
 open for 100 to enter our 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.740
 horse combo 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:05.310
 tower and bishop and give them a spectacular 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.869
 diamond in four moves starting with 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.869
 horse that is check 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.890

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.380
 tower 8 check 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.890

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.440

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.400

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.400

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.549

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.499
