when mobs get damaged and it seems like

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.160 
when mobs get damaged and it seems like
when<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> get<00:01:33.450> close<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.810> them<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.079> gets

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
when you get close to them it gets

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.810 
when you get close to them it gets
darker<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.829> when<00:01:35.159> you're<00:01:35.280> further<00:01:35.549> away<00:01:35.790> from

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
darker and when you're further away from

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760 
darker and when you're further away from
them<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.270> looks<00:01:36.450> more<00:01:36.689> red<00:01:36.930> maybe<00:01:37.409> that's<00:01:37.650> just

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
them it looks more red maybe that's just

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.679 
them it looks more red maybe that's just
a<00:01:37.950> rendering<00:01:38.369> glitch<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.150> yeah<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.540> see

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
a rendering glitch but yeah you can see

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.109 
a rendering glitch but yeah you can see
piles<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.140> blood<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> ground<00:01:41.490> there<00:01:41.759> just

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
piles of blood on the ground there just

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.060 
piles of blood on the ground there just
adds<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.540> bit<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.780> realism<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.740> maybe<00:01:43.920> if

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
adds a little bit of realism so maybe if

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.740 
adds a little bit of realism so maybe if
I<00:01:44.130> hit<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> pig<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.360> some<00:01:45.540> blood

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
I hit a pig you can see some blood

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.240 
I hit a pig you can see some blood
particles<00:01:46.049> coming<00:01:46.350> off<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> mob<00:01:46.740> directly

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
particles coming off the mob directly

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
particles coming off the mob directly
when<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> hit<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.579> look<00:01:47.880> at<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.360> also

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
when I hit it look at that and also

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
when I hit it look at that and also
we've<00:01:49.409> got<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:49.649> blood<00:01:49.799> particles<00:01:50.280> left<00:01:50.490> on

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
we've got some blood particles left on

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.819 
we've got some blood particles left on
the<00:01:50.759> ground<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.689> remnants<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.619> mob

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the ground like the remnants of the mob

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
the ground like the remnants of the mob
when<00:01:53.159> self<00:01:53.399> killed<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.659> now<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:54.840> gonna

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
when self killed it but now I'm gonna

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.510 
when self killed it but now I'm gonna
move<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> next<00:01:55.680> kind<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.070> particle

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
move on to the next kind of particle

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.310 
move on to the next kind of particle
effect<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.060> mod<00:01:57.270> adds<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.170> is

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
effect that this mod adds and that is

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080 
effect that this mod adds and that is
that<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.920> blown<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.640> damaged

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that when you get blown up and damaged

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090 
that when you get blown up and damaged
by<00:02:00.299> TNT<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.229> I'm<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.439> gonna<00:02:01.530> detonate<00:02:01.770> this

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
by TNT so I'm just gonna detonate this

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.490 
by TNT so I'm just gonna detonate this
TNT<00:02:02.399> here<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.420> damaged<00:02:03.810> by<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.049> I'm<00:02:04.409> just

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
TNT here if I get damaged by it I'm just

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.260 
TNT here if I get damaged by it I'm just
gonna<00:02:04.649> stand<00:02:04.890> right<00:02:04.950> next<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.280> TNT<00:02:05.579> that's<00:02:06.090> not

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
gonna stand right next to TNT that's not

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.700 
gonna stand right next to TNT that's not
recommended<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.409> look<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:07.619> that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
recommended for you but look at that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.680 
recommended for you but look at that
I've<00:02:07.860> got<00:02:07.979> dust<00:02:08.250> particle<00:02:08.700> effects<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.209> over

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
I've got dust particle effects all over

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990 
I've got dust particle effects all over
my<00:02:09.840> screen<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:10.560> there<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:11.280> cool<00:02:11.610> let's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
my screen right there really cool let's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.280 
my screen right there really cool let's
just<00:02:12.209> do<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:12.569> more<00:02:12.690> time<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.170> can

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
just do that one more time so you can

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.730 
just do that one more time so you can
see<00:02:13.440> it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
see it

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980 
see it
and<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.250> does<00:02:14.400> gradually<00:02:14.820> fade<00:02:15.090> away<00:02:15.390> after<00:02:15.960> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
and it does gradually fade away after a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.720 
and it does gradually fade away after a
certain<00:02:16.350> amount<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.560> time<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.190> let's<00:02:17.580> just

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
certain amount of time so let's just

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.310 
certain amount of time so let's just
blow<00:02:17.910> myself<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.390> again<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.780> should<00:02:19.140> probably

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
blow myself up again I should probably

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.050 
blow myself up again I should probably
have<00:02:19.560> blocked<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.040> my<00:02:20.190> sword<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.670> we've

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
have blocked with my sword and we've

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.430 
have blocked with my sword and we've
also<00:02:21.180> got<00:02:21.390> some<00:02:21.420> blood<00:02:21.780> particles<00:02:22.290> as<00:02:22.410> well

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
also got some blood particles as well

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.650 
also got some blood particles as well
but<00:02:23.100> look<00:02:23.220> at<00:02:23.280> those<00:02:23.430> dust<00:02:23.700> particles<00:02:24.210> very

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
but look at those dust particles very

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.320 
but look at those dust particles very
realistic<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.700> real<00:02:26.940> life<00:02:27.150> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
realistic just like if in real life you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.730 
realistic just like if in real life you
stood<00:02:27.540> by<00:02:27.690> an<00:02:27.780> explosion<00:02:28.110> you're<00:02:28.530> gonna<00:02:28.620> get

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
stood by an explosion you're gonna get

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.590 
stood by an explosion you're gonna get
dust<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.340> your<00:02:29.370> face<00:02:29.820> although<00:02:30.450> you'll

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
dust in your face although you'll

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.850 
dust in your face although you'll
probably<00:02:30.720> be<00:02:30.990> dead<00:02:31.020> if<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.380> stood<00:02:31.650> too<00:02:31.830> close

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
probably be dead if you stood too close

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.490 
probably be dead if you stood too close
to<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.370> don't<00:02:33.360> do<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.690> at<00:02:33.840> home<00:02:33.870> don't<00:02:34.290> stand

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
to it don't do that at home don't stand

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.990 
to it don't do that at home don't stand
in<00:02:34.590> front<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.830> explosions<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.640> bad<00:02:35.850> idea

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
in front of explosions it's a bad idea

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.210 
in front of explosions it's a bad idea
but<00:02:36.690> yes<00:02:36.900> there's<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.200> final<00:02:37.500> thing<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.950> wanted

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
but yes there's one final thing I wanted

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.340 
but yes there's one final thing I wanted
to<00:02:38.280> test<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.270> whether<00:02:39.540> creepers<00:02:40.200> are

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
to test and that is whether creepers are

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.370 
to test and that is whether creepers are
deemed<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:41.100> explosions<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.990> creeper

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
deemed like explosions so is a creeper

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.680 
deemed like explosions so is a creeper
the<00:02:43.470> same<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:43.740> TNT<00:02:43.920> yes<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.150> look<00:02:45.420> at<00:02:45.570> that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the same as TNT yes it is look at that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.540 
the same as TNT yes it is look at that
I've<00:02:45.930> got<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.440> particles<00:02:46.800> all<00:02:47.070> over<00:02:47.430> my

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
I've got just particles all over my

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.870 
I've got just particles all over my
screen<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.120> yeah<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.440> creepers<00:02:50.010> TNT<00:02:50.520> same

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
screen and yeah so creepers TNT same

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.460 
screen and yeah so creepers TNT same
thing<00:02:51.210> but<00:02:51.630> yeah<00:02:51.810> guys<00:02:51.990> that's<00:02:52.200> pretty<00:02:52.290> much
