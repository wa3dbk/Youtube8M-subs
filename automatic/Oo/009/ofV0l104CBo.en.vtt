00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.420
 hello together we come another 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.960
 euro went to management of me this time 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.800
 in German 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.230
 on request of many users this time 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.849
 with the assist 790 pro gamer motherboard 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.220
 I went out next game 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.710
 pressed the remote button and you 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.730
 look at this beautiful survey 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.170
 you see i never use 747 90k and 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.689
 this system works but also 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.730
 analogous to all other sockets use 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:37.760
 50 teams with free multiplier 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.290
 means 46 90k or 47 70 km 46 70 k s 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.690
 See also I used schieÃŸl 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.809
 RAM today four gigabytes per 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.059
 module a total of eight gigabytes and we 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.430
 go now in the extended mode 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.530
 in which we press f7 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.930
 That's where you come from , too 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.379
 Survey and next we go to 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.379
 kicker there we do the whole 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.839
 settings for server klocke today 45 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.850
 ghz should be with most cpu it 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.860
 be possible 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.930
 i'll say every cpu react a bit 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.820
 different but I will give you now 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.320
 will work before 90 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.790
 percent more problems has easy 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.150
 comment on the video and I help 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.570
 you then okay first georg lackner 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.720
 we post on xmp on this message 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.670
 Click here to see it here 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.659
 the xmp profile is loaded with me 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.760
 it is 2400 cc 1 65 volt and 12 5 volt 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.470
 system agent thereby becomes the amish 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.700
 cocaine is completely set in that 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.020
 at the memory nothing at all 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.390
 then gold is down please 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.900
 to the cpu core ratio here we set up 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.250
 supercross that means all 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.870
 The CPU cores are synchronized 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.790
 does not matter what I put here 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.890
 all cores have the same at any time 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.180
 same clock we are setting up here now 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:03.440
 45 multiplier of 45 with the basecap 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.690
 of 100 gives a total core total 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.250
 Kernel clock of 4,500 megahertz, see here 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.460
 above 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.890
 Okay, let's go back down then 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.230
 Do you have the mint cache view here? 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.210
 we put that on 40 of the caches in the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.820
 principle a connection between the 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.870
 core and memory 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.540
 or the internal memory 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.300
 the cpu and the system agent i give it 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.790
 not in detail on it 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.730
 Also helps that up to the top 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.970
 that would mean 41 or 42 would clock 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.590
 a slightly higher performance 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.550
 But the result is the performance 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.739
 it is not that small 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.180
 worth it you have problems because it is very 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.900
 that is, it will be installed quickly 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.220
 easy to leave 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.480
 then continue to roll down the whole 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.209
 You do not need attitude at all 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.000
 normally then we go now 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.970
 Kernspannung tells my cpu and 10 34 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.709
 standard voltage and occupy the 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.630
 shortcomings fashion so that we are over the tension 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:05.180
 has is change we can put that 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:10.760
 now here at 1.25 volts and the cash 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.290
 tension on men and 115 important 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.720
 Of course, that's a cpu-cooler 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.480
 used the reasonably reasonable 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.959
 performance has with the intel center box 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.110
 You will not get far sooner 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.610
 ok then cpu input voltage we put 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.299
 still at 18 is about the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.190
 By default you count 17 200 the 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.650
 tension is already set correctly 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.829
 on 165 we can leave that is 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.380
 also by the xmp that would be it 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.750
 actually overclock even for the for 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.110
 in itself and you just have to 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.890
 advanced cpu configuration very much 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.890
 scroll down cpu power management 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.590
 intel speedstep disabled and cpu estate 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.079
 also the sable thereby deactivated the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.610
 all power modes of the cpu then 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.230
 did not grab those guys anymore 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.060
 which one is the full performance and a 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.200
 bit stable wemmer stronger 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.440
 overclocked then we can do it now 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.370
 if you do all the stuff here 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.879
 just did it as a profile 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.590
 sometimes that helps to save it 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:21.270
 could now just a lot of name 4500 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.320
 megahertz call profile five save 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.940
 you see five here at profile five 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.680
 saved then everyone could 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.150
 time would be charged if we did not do something 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.020
 To work properly you have to be a virus 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.090
 make a reset 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.979
 there you can just load it again 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.610
 do not do it all over again okay that 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.810
 It was time to press f10 next 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.729
 Do you see all the settings again 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.970
 we did 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:46.570
 which are taken over and ok 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:52.450
 take over and then we go now 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:55.419
 windows we can see I am now 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:05:00.520
 in windows you need three tools at 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:04.470
 95 cpu-z and core temp core temp reads 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.910
 you the temperature of the cpu from cpu z 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.800
 shows you all sorts of details of her 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:15.190
 system 47 90k cpu we see here 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.840
 core voltage about 12 5 volt 4500 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.430
 megahertz at all core if you are with 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.130
 clicked the right mouse button you see 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.160
 again all individually displayed 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:28.300
 the clock is the same everywhere 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:31.330
 mainboards sz 7 90 per gamer and at 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.160
 ram 8 gb here you see again the 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.710
 cache clocks we have set means 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.190
 a little bit different is the same 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:42.960
 and at the frequency 1200 we have 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:46.479
 2400 in the bios set because of drv 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.669
 ddr as double data rate only reads here 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.320
 the half out of that is 1200 it fits 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.710
 and here are the individual timings 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.669
 even then the palms 590 vote 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:00.360
 with this tool we test the cpu 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.840
 Simply open stability 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.840
 custom 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:11.330
 1344 here in 1944 45 this in place 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.090
 Click and then the whole should be for 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.620
 run a school 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.310
 the important thing is that the temperature 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.409
 with cord helmet does not rise above 90 degrees 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.830
 if the tempi when the temperature is over 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.150
 90 degrees test abort and the 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.219
 lower the core voltage 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.310
 if the whole thing then no longer stable 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:36.340
 might have to run synonymous 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.340
 multiplier at lower to 44 in the bios 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.500
 you see here is what pushes ok then 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:44.389
 the temperature increases relatively strongly 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.610
 I say everything to 90 degrees absolutely no 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.860
 subject theoretically up to even 100 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.330
 grad the cpu is actually almost not 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.990
 he does not need to be broken 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.789
 to worry about 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.849
 but I just do not recommend over 90 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.560
 So just go and see 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.460
 core temp clean the maximum 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.529
 temperature 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.879
 if that works now everything is fine 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:03.560
 After an hour then you can just 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.279
 play games and watch games 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.529
 still stable 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:08.150
 if it is unstable and breaks 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:10.569
 just the core voltage one more 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.310
 Raise a little bit if you still 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:14.479
 headroom is at temperature when 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.610
 you have no room left at the 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.800
 temperature just measures the 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.150
 Lower multiplier to 44 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.879
 everything laughs that was the time when you 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:27.729
 you just ask the comment 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:27.729
 video and I help on
