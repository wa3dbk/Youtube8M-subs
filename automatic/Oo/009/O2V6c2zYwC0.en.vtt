00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:03.799
 today we are going to make a basic melody of the state is 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.719
 first we lowered the time to about 128 like this 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:12.739
 here we have already prepared kicks 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.199
 the next thing is to put 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.689
 oscar 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.509
 In the third 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.509
 of each group of four 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.390
 they are areas and 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 camps 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.620
 p 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.749
 eleven 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:39.080
 two effect 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 to the kits to make it stronger 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.910
 I put you says 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.910
 they shook hands and put it in the middle 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.560
 incomprehension have talked, nothing has to be done or we left there as is 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.220
 is 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.220
 2 2 consciences 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.020
 sources 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.020
 araud we go with the clear 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 i the good thing is at the beginning of this way 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.120
 two 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.440
 3 3 3 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.590
 3 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.820
 3 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.690
 it would seem a bit like establishing a little different 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.040
 putting him 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.690
 others 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.360
 6 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.280
 that not only very strong i 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.750
 short 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.330
 right button 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
 all this fact 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.260
 I know it's a bit different 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.190
 even so 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.190
 another Syrian change 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.569
 the last 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.769
 of the series of four 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.419
 in the last 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.419
 chopped series 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:29.650
 two 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.650
 p 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.589
 yesterday scenes of a little different 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:41.009
 it will leave 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:45.979
 now let's go with the pacs pairs we add bombs 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.699
 a guy 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.989
 gil added 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.989
 moleta abás to the maximum 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:56.879
 the minimum 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.609
 this mechanics 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.609
 up to make a quick basic bad idea 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.149
 This is not like this 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.549
 3 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:44.819
 it is a little different from the majorities 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.919
 and if you are lying recently what they do 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.489
 so it is worth 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.809
 it is as if I had known 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.809
 the notes that we have placed 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.399
 Juan his serial based our month of April tipán 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.399
 we see her with 13 x 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.889
 worth this sound if the idea is 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.889
 most of before 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.719
 says I hope tomorrow we will not change that fear for it 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.569
 we choose 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.129
 this type of wave 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.219
 in the three 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:32.370
 ok was 1 to 2 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.090
 the one in question 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.259
 aa here they have left me but it is still a piece of shit 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:41.490
 this new stage 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.490
 rs we download it only in the first 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.340
 balkans year 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.590
 even so that's not a little explained 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.569
 let's go to the mister 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.569
 we walk inserts this sound 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.629
 we add the effect 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.949
 already played son who always said this plague sound 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.089
 important is that I have 25 here and here 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:16.249
 3com 1 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.999
 more or less 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.999
 you will see how it changes known now 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.069
 we come here a piece of paper agreed in addition 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:35.939
 themselves 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.069
 it's also important let's say amis the insect a shame we have not put 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.650
 the kicks 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.740
 and now that we have inserted this sound ladies and made in touristic track 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.719
 of the week half more or less 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
 it's like the kick will fit now tell me 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:10.999
 and is that they are below 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:15.469
 let's add 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.119
 my uncle my mind 

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:20.740
 how and here they catch us this 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.499
 it is not this 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:25.499
 and without more 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.400
 so in homage to his idol 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.400
 is the wood can change 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.809
 they simply change 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.809
 it's time that different 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:10.029
 ens we are again 

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:04.999

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:07.999
 Maria Matute Real 

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:12.080
 more complex bulky things 

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.610
