00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.120
 I have this week was primary 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.960
 i wanted to get my street race off before 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 the company of about the rebuild in a wrc 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.570
 rallye car should look new 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.890
 get wheels and couple modification 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.199
 art a series of what I look here 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.570
 The body has changed 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.830
 is only just get away because as a troublemaker 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.320
 Therapy is then I have the back 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.110
 the body age away because the for 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.050
 The new body does not fit as well 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.050
 The front body halter is unnecessary 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.050
 and also the wheels 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.149
 I do not want that 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.160
 instead I will be off-road later 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.110
 Use tires a bit better 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.230
 regulator I wanted very quickly 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:05.880
 today in the river rubber dive around the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.799
 really waterproof so then 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.420
 we have several screws out of the car 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.150
 it removes the body 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.770
 stop there are no more inside I have 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.119
 I screw the people fall so as 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.740
 next, I have a little one 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.590
 problem because the control arm is a small one 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:32.159
 have games here 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:38.090
 in the new chassis small bracket the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.900
 I'm between the electric ones 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.220
 springs holder 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.820
 causing this game to fail as 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.350
 next, I have a little tip 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.240
 namely you can see the left here 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.400
 the left clinker is slightly higher than 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.840
 the right of the right is pretty much 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.290
 deep why that is so here is one 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.320
 we have such limited ones 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.690
 screws that are now attached here 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.580
 I have on the right side the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.950
 screw now removed on the left 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.930
 is she still in there you can see that 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.910
 rectangle wellink has a lot deeper sitting 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.590
 which makes the whole car a bit higher 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.810
 will lie on the street and on 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.360
 I would reach it with gravel 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.050
 is going to be as a ford car 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.150
 I did the same thing in the back 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.480
 He also sits much deeper because 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.240
 I have the shock absorbers with it deeper 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 this puts the whole car 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.480
 a little deeper next comes one 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.250
 new body 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.950
 Here, a small problem has since I 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.890
 I did not know how the body 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.989
 However, I would come to the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.610
 idea the body holder 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:07.660
 cut through in the middle whereby 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:10.239
 I have two long and two short ones 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.180
 body holder of hold now 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.920
 Can I use the three length cat holder 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.070
 At the rear of the damper, bridge easily 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.940
 fasten as well as in front 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.030
 That's why I already have my third 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.519
 the holder so i hope you have pastor 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.209
 to watch and will be back later 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.590
 Switch off and see how the car 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.319
 looks all over again with new tires 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.150
 on it with new build regulator and new 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.180
 painted body that is namely 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.989
 lacquered today and that can look like 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.790
 her later then in a new video 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.909
 I hope to admire the next one 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.909
 times
