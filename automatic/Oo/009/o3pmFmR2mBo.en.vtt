00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.550 
episode I'm going to show you guys how
to<00:00:16.410> regenerate<00:00:17.130> blocks<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.449> were<00:00:18.630> destroyed

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
to regenerate blocks that were destroyed

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.900 
to regenerate blocks that were destroyed
in<00:00:19.859> an<00:00:20.039> explosion

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
in an explosion

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.519 
in an explosion
now<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> guys<00:00:21.539> already<00:00:21.930> know<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.439> if

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
now you guys already know that if

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
now you guys already know that if
someone<00:00:22.859> actually<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.640> know<00:00:23.760> breaks<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.359> block

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
someone actually you know breaks a block

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.710 
someone actually you know breaks a block
you<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.230> use<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> block<00:00:26.820> break<00:00:27.210> event<00:00:27.570> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
you can use a block break event and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.689 
you can use a block break event and
cancel<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> event<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.189> stop<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.580> from

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
cancel the event to stop it from

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.230 
cancel the event to stop it from
happening

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
happening

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.970 
happening
but<00:00:30.990> today<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:31.650> show<00:00:31.830> you

but today I'm going to actually show you

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.120 
but today I'm going to actually show you
how<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:33.000> regenerate<00:00:33.870> blocks<00:00:34.200> after<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.920> have

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
how to regenerate blocks after they have

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.459 
how to regenerate blocks after they have
been<00:00:35.340> destroyed<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:36.059> an<00:00:36.480> explosion<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.260> order

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
been destroyed in an explosion in order

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.160 
been destroyed in an explosion in order
to<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> use<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.180> entity

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
to do this we're going to use the entity

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930 
to do this we're going to use the entity
explode<00:00:40.800> event<00:00:41.190> which<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.489> called<00:00:41.730> whenever

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
explode event which is called whenever

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.690 
explode event which is called whenever
an<00:00:42.120> entity<00:00:42.540> explodes<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.800> could<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> creeper

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
an entity explodes it could be a creeper

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.279 
an entity explodes it could be a creeper
which<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.539> we're<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> use<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
which is what we're going to use it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.440 
which is what we're going to use it
could<00:00:46.440> also<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.710> TNT<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.789> anything<00:00:48.090> else<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
could also be TNT or anything else a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600 
could also be TNT or anything else a
call<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.989> causes<00:00:49.379> an<00:00:49.469> explosion<00:00:49.710> would

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
call that causes an explosion would

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.360 
call that causes an explosion would
cause<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.600> event<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.199> cold<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.280> we

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
cause this event to be cold and then we

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
cause this event to be cold and then we
can<00:00:53.489> actually<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.969> ahead<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.379> regenerate<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
can actually go ahead and regenerate the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740 
can actually go ahead and regenerate the
blocks<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.129> let's<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:56.579> ahead<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.879> first<00:00:57.360> write

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
blocks so let's go ahead and first write

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.880 
blocks so let's go ahead and first write
out<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.399> method<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.210> an<00:01:00.750> event<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
out the method so this is an event and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.050 
out the method so this is an event and
we're<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.579> call<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.600> entity

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
we're going to just call it a on entity

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.990 
we're going to just call it a on entity
explode<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> an<00:01:07.560> entity<00:01:08.010> explode

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
explode and this is an entity explode

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.960 
explode and this is an entity explode
event<00:01:09.740> we're<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> call<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.250> B<00:01:11.490> make<00:01:11.820> sure

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
event we're going to call it B make sure

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.330 
event we're going to call it B make sure
to<00:01:12.000> import<00:01:12.450> everything<00:01:13.070> now<00:01:14.070> what<00:01:14.220> we're

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to import everything now what we're

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.830 
to import everything now what we're
going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.760> inside<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.780> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
going to do inside of here is if you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
going to do inside of here is if you
take<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> look<00:01:16.140> at<00:01:16.290> e<00:01:16.500> dot<00:01:16.799> notice<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> first

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
take a look at e dot notice the first

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.640 
take a look at e dot notice the first
thing<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.060> shows<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.659> block<00:01:18.990> list<00:01:19.350> which

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
thing that shows up is block list which

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.499 
thing that shows up is block list which
gives<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> list<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.180> blocks

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
gives you a list of all of the blocks

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.929 
gives you a list of all of the blocks
that<00:01:21.840> were<00:01:22.229> involved<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.130> explosion<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that were involved in the explosion and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.340 
that were involved in the explosion and
obviously<00:01:24.330> since<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.930> deal<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
obviously since we want to deal with the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.530 
obviously since we want to deal with the
blocks<00:01:25.619> that's<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> important<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.360> us

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
blocks that's what is important to us

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
blocks that's what is important to us
we're<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.350> ahead<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:29.250> an<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.579> for

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
we're going to go ahead and do an a for

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600 
we're going to go ahead and do an a for
loop<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.180> Block<00:01:30.750> B<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.320> eat<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.100> block<00:01:32.369> list

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
loop for Block B in eat up block list

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.429 
loop for Block B in eat up block list
we're<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.420> through<00:01:33.689> all<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.170> blocks

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
we're going through all of the blocks

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.990 
we're going through all of the blocks
that<00:01:34.619> were<00:01:34.799> involved<00:01:35.250> make<00:01:35.460> sure<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.670> import

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that were involved make sure to import

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.819 
that were involved make sure to import
the<00:01:36.180> bucket<00:01:36.570> block<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.140> not<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> Minecraft

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the bucket block and not the Minecraft

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.800 
the bucket block and not the Minecraft
block<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.729> we're<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:38.970> through<00:01:39.090> every<00:01:39.360> block

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
block so we're going through every block

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.069 
block so we're going through every block
that<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.200> involved<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.040> explosion<00:01:42.079> first

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
that was involved in the explosion first

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.170 
that was involved in the explosion first
thing<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.320> need<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.770> say<00:01:43.950> final<00:01:44.490> block

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
thing we need to do is say final block

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.240 
thing we need to do is say final block
state<00:01:45.570> state<00:01:46.460> block<00:01:47.460> state<00:01:47.869> state<00:01:49.009> equal<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
state state block state state equal to

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.899 
state state block state state equal to
not<00:01:50.579> new<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.119> equal<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> B<00:01:51.689> dot<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.380> state<00:01:53.130> we

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
not new is equal to B dot get state we

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.510 
not new is equal to B dot get state we
need<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.210> save<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.049> state<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.950> block<00:01:56.219> so

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
need to save the state of the block so

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.999 
need to save the state of the block so
that<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.909> use<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.450> again<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.110> little<00:01:58.710> bit

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that we can use it again a little bit

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.520 
that we can use it again a little bit
later<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.850> next<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.930> optional<00:02:01.439> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
later the next one this is optional it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.950 
later the next one this is optional it
depends<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:01.890> whether<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.969> would<00:02:03.119> want<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.600> use

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
depends on whether you would want to use

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020 
depends on whether you would want to use
it<00:02:04.110> or<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> go<00:02:05.579> ahead<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.880> say

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
it or not but if you go ahead and say

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.520 
it or not but if you go ahead and say
set<00:02:06.360> type<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.899> material<00:02:07.970> dot<00:02:08.970> air<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:10.349> this

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
set type to material dot air what this

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.890 
set type to material dot air what this
will<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.099> um<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.780> us

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
will do is um if this is going to us

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.069 
will do is um if this is going to us
top<00:02:14.040> item<00:02:15.040> drops<00:02:15.700> from<00:02:16.239> spawning<00:02:18.480> spawning<00:02:19.480> so

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
top item drops from spawning spawning so

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.740 
top item drops from spawning spawning so
if<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.319> set<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.829> to<00:02:21.129> be<00:02:21.670> air<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.569> going<00:02:22.689> to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
if you set this to be air it's going to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.899 
if you set this to be air it's going to
make<00:02:22.959> all<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.349> blocks<00:02:23.590> air<00:02:23.860> before<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
make all of the blocks air before the

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.420 
make all of the blocks air before the
explosion<00:02:25.659> actually<00:02:26.049> happens<00:02:26.439> so<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:27.040> when

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
explosion actually happens so that when

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.449 
explosion actually happens so that when
they<00:02:28.090> explode<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.799> know<00:02:29.829> nothing<00:02:30.310> will

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
they explode you know nothing will

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.670 
they explode you know nothing will
actually<00:02:30.879> drop<00:02:31.239> if<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.870> remove<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.409> line

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
actually drop if you remove that line

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.130 
actually drop if you remove that line
then<00:02:33.189> any<00:02:33.519> block<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:34.090> explodes<00:02:34.480> will<00:02:34.750> drop

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
then any block that explodes will drop

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.220 
then any block that explodes will drop
its<00:02:35.409> droppings<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.519> normal<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.930> if<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.079> want

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
its droppings like normal so if you want

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.860 
its droppings like normal so if you want
to<00:02:38.260> stop<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.739> item<00:02:39.040> drops<00:02:39.450> from<00:02:40.450> spawning

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
to stop the item drops from spawning

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.449 
to stop the item drops from spawning
then<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.290> would<00:02:41.439> set<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.859> be<00:02:41.980> air<00:02:42.189> if<00:02:42.340> you

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
then you would set it to be air if you

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.280 
then you would set it to be air if you
want<00:02:42.760> them<00:02:42.939> to<00:02:42.970> still<00:02:43.299> show<00:02:43.569> up<00:02:43.599> but<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.049> just

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
want them to still show up but you just

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.960 
want them to still show up but you just
want<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.620> regeneration<00:02:45.189> then<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.849> would

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
want the regeneration then you would

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.670 
want the regeneration then you would
remove<00:02:46.299> that<00:02:46.510> line<00:02:46.750> I'll<00:02:46.930> leave<00:02:47.109> the<00:02:47.260> comments

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
remove that line I'll leave the comments

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
remove that line I'll leave the comments
in<00:02:47.769> there<00:02:47.859> so<00:02:48.010> if<00:02:48.069> you're<00:02:48.190> looking<00:02:48.340> at<00:02:48.549> the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
in there so if you're looking at the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.559 
in there so if you're looking at the
code<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.569> can<00:02:49.720> easily<00:02:49.930> be<00:02:50.170> able<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.620> tell<00:02:51.569> next

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
code you can easily be able to tell next

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.080 
code you can easily be able to tell next
we're<00:02:52.690> going<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.930> actually<00:02:53.349> go<00:02:53.440> ahead<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:54.090> put

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
we're going to actually go ahead and put

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.940 
we're going to actually go ahead and put
in<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.359> delay<00:02:55.690> because<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.109> want<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.319> have<00:02:56.470> a

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
in the delay because you want to have a

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.929 
in the delay because you want to have a
little<00:02:57.400> bit<00:02:57.639> of<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.819> delay<00:02:58.180> before<00:02:58.689> the<00:02:59.939> before

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
little bit of a delay before the before

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.910 
little bit of a delay before the before
the<00:03:01.209> block<00:03:01.389> actually<00:03:01.900> shows<00:03:02.200> up<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.799> don't

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
the block actually shows up you don't

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.250 
the block actually shows up you don't
really<00:03:03.189> want<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.060> instantaneous<00:03:04.480> or

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
really want it to be instantaneous or

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.500 
really want it to be instantaneous or
else<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:06.459> could<00:03:06.670> be<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.760> little<00:03:06.970> bit<00:03:07.060> confusing

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
else it could be a little bit confusing

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.819 
else it could be a little bit confusing
and<00:03:07.689> there<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.900> one<00:03:08.200> important<00:03:08.680> thing<00:03:08.709> that

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
and there is one important thing that

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.589 
and there is one important thing that
you'll<00:03:09.040> see<00:03:09.280> in<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.459> second<00:03:09.879> that<00:03:10.209> we<00:03:10.329> need<00:03:10.480> to

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
you'll see in a second that we need to

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.729 
you'll see in a second that we need to
do<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.109> we're<00:03:11.200> going<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.349> go<00:03:11.470> ahead<00:03:11.530> and

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
do so we're going to go ahead and

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.520 
do so we're going to go ahead and
declare<00:03:11.829> an<00:03:12.579> int<00:03:12.849> delay<00:03:13.599> which<00:03:14.200> we'll<00:03:14.379> set

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
declare an int delay which we'll set

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.770 
declare an int delay which we'll set
equal<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.829> 20<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.519> going<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.819> be<00:03:15.939> in<00:03:16.150> ticks

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
equal to 20 this is going to be in ticks

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.349 
equal to 20 this is going to be in ticks
so<00:03:17.409> right<00:03:17.769> now<00:03:17.919> the<00:03:17.980> delay<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.430> 1<00:03:18.699> second<00:03:19.239> if

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
so right now the delay is 1 second if

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.900 
so right now the delay is 1 second if
you<00:03:19.720> wanted<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.109> make<00:03:20.319> it<00:03:20.470> take<00:03:20.709> 15<00:03:21.430> seconds

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
you wanted to make it take 15 seconds

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.420 
you wanted to make it take 15 seconds
you<00:03:22.060> would<00:03:22.180> do<00:03:22.299> 20<00:03:22.720> times<00:03:22.900> 15<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.799> then<00:03:24.310> that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
you would do 20 times 15 and then that

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.479 
you would do 20 times 15 and then that
would<00:03:24.519> be<00:03:24.549> 4<00:03:24.790> 15<00:03:25.180> seconds<00:03:25.750> but<00:03:26.709> one<00:03:26.949> important

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
would be 4 15 seconds but one important

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.129 
would be 4 15 seconds but one important
thing<00:03:27.549> is<00:03:27.819> any<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.359> blocks<00:03:28.629> that<00:03:28.870> have<00:03:28.930> to

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
thing is any of the blocks that have to

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.259 
thing is any of the blocks that have to
do<00:03:29.260> with<00:03:29.379> physics<00:03:29.919> we<00:03:30.549> need<00:03:30.699> to<00:03:30.790> actually<00:03:31.150> do

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
do with physics we need to actually do

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.339 
do with physics we need to actually do
something<00:03:31.449> a<00:03:31.569> little<00:03:31.629> bit<00:03:31.840> special

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
something a little bit special

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.899 
something a little bit special
so<00:03:32.620> you're<00:03:32.709> going<00:03:32.859> to<00:03:32.889> say<00:03:33.069> if<00:03:33.280> B<00:03:33.940> get<00:03:34.510> type<00:03:35.909> or

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
so you're going to say if B get type or

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.129 
so you're going to say if B get type or
is<00:03:37.209> equal<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.949> material<00:03:38.949> dots<00:03:39.159> and<00:03:39.699> up<00:03:40.209> settle

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
is equal to material dots and up settle

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:49.729 
is equal to material dots and up settle
sand<00:03:41.889> or<00:03:45.120> B<00:03:46.120> dot<00:03:46.419> get<00:03:46.989> type<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:48.430> equal<00:03:48.879> to

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
sand or B dot get type is equal to

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.819 
sand or B dot get type is equal to
Tyrael<00:03:50.739> dot<00:03:51.459> gravel<00:03:52.449> because<00:03:53.199> these<00:03:53.560> are<00:03:53.709> the

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
Tyrael dot gravel because these are the

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.219 
Tyrael dot gravel because these are the
two<00:03:54.069> blocks<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.299> are<00:03:55.359> actually<00:03:55.900> involved

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
two blocks that are actually involved

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.619 
two blocks that are actually involved
with<00:03:56.739> physics<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:58.030> we<00:03:58.150> need<00:03:58.299> to<00:03:58.419> make<00:03:58.599> sure

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
with physics so we need to make sure

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.860 
with physics so we need to make sure
that<00:03:58.870> we<00:03:59.349> take<00:04:00.280> care<00:04:00.340> of<00:04:00.639> these<00:04:01.090> I'm<00:04:01.389> just

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
that we take care of these I'm just

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.420 
that we take care of these I'm just
going<00:04:02.019> to<00:04:02.049> go<00:04:02.139> ahead<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.590> add<00:04:02.769> one<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:03.129> the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
going to go ahead and add one to the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.920 
going to go ahead and add one to the
delay<00:04:03.760> so<00:04:04.359> it's<00:04:04.479> going<00:04:04.629> to<00:04:04.690> take<00:04:05.500> one<00:04:05.889> extra

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
delay so it's going to take one extra

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.050 
delay so it's going to take one extra
one<00:04:07.930> tick<00:04:08.470> or<00:04:08.709> one<00:04:08.919> twentieth<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.489> a<00:04:09.609> second

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
one tick or one twentieth of a second

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.659 
one tick or one twentieth of a second
and<00:04:10.180> that's<00:04:10.720> important<00:04:11.319> for<00:04:11.530> just<00:04:12.430> letting

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
and that's important for just letting

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.839 
and that's important for just letting
you<00:04:13.239> know<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.720> other<00:04:14.620> blocks<00:04:15.099> like<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.609> block

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
you know the other blocks like the block

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.490 
you know the other blocks like the block
that's<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.389> know<00:04:16.510> under<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.139> generate

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
that's you know under it to generate

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.300 
that's you know under it to generate
first<00:04:18.599> so<00:04:19.599> that's<00:04:19.900> just<00:04:20.530> don't<00:04:21.039> worry<00:04:21.190> about

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
first so that's just don't worry about

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.339 
first so that's just don't worry about
it<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.639> is<00:04:21.820> important<00:04:22.330> though<00:04:22.479> now<00:04:23.200> we're

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
it it is important though now we're

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.080 
it it is important though now we're
going<00:04:23.440> to<00:04:23.500> actually<00:04:23.620> go<00:04:23.889> ahead<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.159> schedule

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
going to actually go ahead and schedule

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.580 
going to actually go ahead and schedule
the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.980 
the
delayed<00:04:27.040> tasks<00:04:30.360> actually<00:04:31.360> meant<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.810> do

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
delayed tasks actually meant to do

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.439 
delayed tasks actually meant to do
bucket<00:04:32.350> bucket<00:04:32.530> server<00:04:33.160> get<00:04:33.730> scheduler<00:04:34.240> and

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
bucket bucket server get scheduler and

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:35.400 
bucket bucket server get scheduler and
then<00:04:34.780> we're<00:04:34.870> going<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.020> go<00:04:35.110> ahead<00:04:35.199> and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
then we're going to go ahead and

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.370 
then we're going to go ahead and
schedule<00:04:35.650> async<00:04:36.430> delayed<00:04:37.030> tasks<00:04:37.389> plugin<00:04:38.260> is

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
schedule async delayed tasks plugin is

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.280 
schedule async delayed tasks plugin is
this<00:04:38.680> going<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.460> go<00:04:39.520> ahead<00:04:39.960> excuse<00:04:40.960> me<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.110> make

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
this going to go ahead excuse me I make

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.670 
this going to go ahead excuse me I make
a<00:04:41.320> new<00:04:41.590> runnable<00:04:42.250> that's<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.300> public<00:04:43.810> void<00:04:44.169> run

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
a new runnable that's a public void run

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.760 
a new runnable that's a public void run
and<00:04:45.040> then<00:04:45.639> the<00:04:45.910> long<00:04:46.240> is<00:04:46.570> going<00:04:46.870> or<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.199> the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
and then the long is going or the the

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.400 
and then the long is going or the the
delay<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.430> going<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.790> be<00:04:48.880> this<00:04:49.150> delay<00:04:49.600> if<00:04:49.900> you

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
delay is going to be this delay if you

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.170 
delay is going to be this delay if you
don't<00:04:50.680> want<00:04:50.949> to<00:04:51.070> have<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.220> delay<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.580> could<00:04:51.910> set

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
don't want to have a delay you could set

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.820 
don't want to have a delay you could set
it<00:04:52.300> equal<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.570> zero<00:04:52.960> but<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.290> still<00:04:53.590> need<00:04:53.740> to

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
it equal to zero but you still need to

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.620 
it equal to zero but you still need to
add<00:04:53.979> one<00:04:54.280> for<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.639> sand<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.060> gravel<00:04:55.389> that<00:04:55.510> is

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
add one for the sand and gravel that is

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.750 
add one for the sand and gravel that is
important<00:04:56.169> so<00:04:56.470> make<00:04:57.280> sure<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.639> do<00:04:57.729> that

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
important so make sure that you do that

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.280 
important so make sure that you do that
but<00:04:57.940> otherwise<00:04:58.240> you're<00:04:58.449> fine<00:04:58.720> then<00:04:59.020> we<00:04:59.139> just

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
but otherwise you're fine then we just

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.379 
but otherwise you're fine then we just
need<00:04:59.350> to<00:04:59.500> call<00:04:59.680> state<00:05:00.070> update<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:01.270> we're

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
need to call state update and we're

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.340 
need to call state update and we're
going<00:05:01.510> to<00:05:01.540> use<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.780> one<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:01.930> has<00:05:02.139> two

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
going to use the one that has two

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.690 
going to use the one that has two
boolean<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:02.919> we're<00:05:03.040> going<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.220> give<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.340> true

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
boolean and we're going to give it true

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.240 
boolean and we're going to give it true
and<00:05:03.970> false<00:05:04.780> so<00:05:05.229> we<00:05:05.320> needed<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.680> save<00:05:05.979> that

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
and false so we needed to save that

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.219 
and false so we needed to save that
block<00:05:06.669> state<00:05:07.000> so<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.270> we<00:05:07.360> can<00:05:07.479> still<00:05:07.810> have<00:05:08.020> it

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
block state so that we can still have it

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.409 
block state so that we can still have it
because<00:05:08.530> you<00:05:09.250> know<00:05:09.340> we're<00:05:09.520> setting<00:05:09.880> this<00:05:10.030> type

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
because you know we're setting this type

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.640 
because you know we're setting this type
to<00:05:10.660> be<00:05:10.780> err

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
to be err

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.500 
to be err
ah<00:05:11.710> so<00:05:12.160> you<00:05:12.220> know<00:05:12.430> we<00:05:12.610> need<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.000> save<00:05:13.270> this

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
ah so you know we need to save this

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.090 
ah so you know we need to save this
state<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.050> then<00:05:14.169> we're<00:05:14.290> updating<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.889> state

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
state and then we're updating the state

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.980 
state and then we're updating the state
so<00:05:15.280> it'll<00:05:15.460> actually<00:05:15.729> you<00:05:16.150> know<00:05:16.270> revert<00:05:16.720> to<00:05:16.900> the

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
so it'll actually you know revert to the

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.560 
so it'll actually you know revert to the
state<00:05:17.260> as<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:18.010> was<00:05:18.039> before<00:05:18.340> and<00:05:18.850> it<00:05:19.000> won't<00:05:19.210> be

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
state as it was before and it won't be

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.510 
state as it was before and it won't be
air<00:05:19.840> anymore<00:05:20.289> so<00:05:20.410> that's<00:05:20.560> very<00:05:20.740> important<00:05:21.370> and

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
air anymore so that's very important and

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.279 
air anymore so that's very important and
I<00:05:22.210> believe<00:05:22.450> that's<00:05:22.570> all<00:05:22.810> make<00:05:23.050> sure<00:05:23.169> you're

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
I believe that's all make sure you're

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.140 
I believe that's all make sure you're
registering<00:05:23.740> your<00:05:23.919> events<00:05:24.400> of<00:05:24.550> course<00:05:24.850> and

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
registering your events of course and

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.180 
registering your events of course and
let's<00:05:25.900> actually<00:05:26.020> go<00:05:26.289> ahead<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:26.500> export<00:05:27.070> this

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
let's actually go ahead and export this

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.779 
let's actually go ahead and export this
and<00:05:27.699> give<00:05:28.570> it<00:05:28.660> a<00:05:28.720> try<00:05:29.190> so<00:05:30.190> go<00:05:30.340> ahead<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.520> start

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
and give it a try so go ahead and start

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.750 
and give it a try so go ahead and start
up<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.180> server<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.440> as<00:05:33.280> soon<00:05:33.430> as<00:05:33.520> that's

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
up the server and as soon as that's

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.450 
up the server and as soon as that's
ready<00:05:34.060> I<00:05:34.150> am<00:05:34.389> ready<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:35.139> join<00:05:35.530> into<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:36.280> server

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
join and I got some creeper eggs spawn

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.510 
join and I got some creeper eggs spawn
eggs<00:05:47.560> right<00:05:48.220> here<00:05:49.080> so<00:05:50.080> let's<00:05:50.229> go<00:05:50.470> ahead<00:05:50.860> and

eggs right here so let's go ahead and

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.310 
eggs right here so let's go ahead and
spawn<00:05:51.849> so<00:05:52.090> I'm<00:05:52.150> in<00:05:52.270> survival<00:05:52.750> mode<00:05:52.780> so<00:05:53.080> I<00:05:53.139> can

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
spawn so I'm in survival mode so I can

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.129 
spawn so I'm in survival mode so I can
make<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.560> creeper<00:05:53.889> angry<00:05:54.310> and<00:05:54.490> oh<00:05:55.240> he

make the creeper angry and oh he
exploded<00:05:56.680> and<00:05:57.010> as<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.430> can<00:05:57.490> see<00:05:57.550> one<00:05:57.880> second

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
exploded and as you can see one second

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.950 
exploded and as you can see one second
later<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:59.169> terrain<00:05:59.760> regenerated<00:06:00.760> itself<00:06:00.960> so

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
later the terrain regenerated itself so

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.690 
later the terrain regenerated itself so
let's<00:06:02.050> go<00:06:02.289> ahead<00:06:02.410> and<00:06:02.830> first<00:06:03.070> I<00:06:03.280> got<00:06:03.400> to<00:06:03.490> heal

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
let's go ahead and first I got to heal

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.360 
let's go ahead and first I got to heal
myself<00:06:03.910> and<00:06:04.530> now<00:06:05.530> let's<00:06:05.740> go<00:06:05.860> ahead<00:06:05.919> and<00:06:06.070> spawn

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
myself and now let's go ahead and spawn

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.830 
myself and now let's go ahead and spawn
one<00:06:06.639> get<00:06:06.910> out<00:06:06.940> of<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.240> way

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
one get out of the way

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.629 
one get out of the way
well<00:06:08.260> we<00:06:08.380> got<00:06:08.500> to<00:06:08.620> make<00:06:08.950> him<00:06:09.070> angry<00:06:09.220> but<00:06:09.520> it's

and<00:06:13.419> as<00:06:13.960> you<00:06:14.080> can<00:06:14.169> see<00:06:14.380> one<00:06:14.620> second<00:06:15.130> later<00:06:15.370> the

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
and as you can see one second later the

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.120 
and as you can see one second later the
terrain<00:06:16.360> did<00:06:17.050> reset<00:06:17.410> itself<00:06:17.740> and<00:06:17.889> there<00:06:18.010> were

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
terrain did reset itself and there were

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.850 
terrain did reset itself and there were
no<00:06:18.310> item<00:06:18.729> drops<00:06:19.000> because<00:06:19.450> we<00:06:19.630> did<00:06:19.810> that<00:06:20.020> set

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
no item drops because we did that set

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.820 
no item drops because we did that set
the<00:06:20.979> type<00:06:21.190> to<00:06:21.400> be<00:06:21.550> err<00:06:21.789> so<00:06:22.180> there<00:06:22.510> were<00:06:22.630> no<00:06:23.470> item

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
the type to be err so there were no item

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.760 
the type to be err so there were no item
drops<00:06:24.099> and<00:06:24.520> let's<00:06:24.700> come<00:06:24.970> down<00:06:25.000> here<00:06:25.210> and<00:06:25.770> make

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
drops and let's come down here and make

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.710 
drops and let's come down here and make
him<00:06:26.889> explode<00:06:27.370> see<00:06:28.120> if<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.270> can<00:06:28.419> do<00:06:28.479> without

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
him explode see if I can do without

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.690 
him explode see if I can do without
dying

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
dying

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.159 
dying
alright<00:06:30.700> and<00:06:30.880> then<00:06:31.180> as<00:06:31.330> you<00:06:31.479> can<00:06:31.599> see<00:06:31.810> even<00:06:31.990> on

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
alright and then as you can see even on

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.020 
alright and then as you can see even on
the<00:06:32.289> ice<00:06:32.470> it's<00:06:32.800> still<00:06:33.190> one<00:06:33.490> second<00:06:33.880> later

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
the ice it's still one second later

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.760 
the ice it's still one second later
immediately<00:06:34.719> fix<00:06:35.380> itself

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
immediately fix itself

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.380 
immediately fix itself
you<00:06:36.070> could<00:06:36.280> of<00:06:36.400> course<00:06:36.580> make<00:06:36.669> the<00:06:36.849> delay<00:06:37.180> as<00:06:37.240> I

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
you could of course make the delay as I

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.240 
you could of course make the delay as I
said<00:06:37.599> later<00:06:38.020> if<00:06:38.289> you<00:06:38.409> wanted<00:06:38.650> to<00:06:38.710> take<00:06:38.890> more

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
said later if you wanted to take more

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.650 
said later if you wanted to take more
than

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
than

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.050 
than
I can<00:06:39.840> to<00:06:39.990> come<00:06:40.200> back<00:06:40.530> I<00:06:40.890> suppose<00:06:41.520> you<00:06:41.940> will

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
I can to come back I suppose you will

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.630 
I can to come back I suppose you will
also<00:06:42.270> need<00:06:42.630> to<00:06:42.690> be<00:06:42.930> careful<00:06:43.170> with<00:06:44.130> if<00:06:44.340> a<00:06:44.430> player

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
also need to be careful with if a player

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.580 
also need to be careful with if a player
were<00:06:44.880> to<00:06:44.940> go<00:06:45.210> into<00:06:45.510> the<00:06:45.690> explosion<00:06:46.290> they<00:06:46.410> might

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
were to go into the explosion they might

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.100 
were to go into the explosion they might
get<00:06:46.890> trapped<00:06:47.340> in<00:06:47.670> the<00:06:48.150> explosion<00:06:48.750> I'm<00:06:48.930> not

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
get trapped in the explosion I'm not

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.780 
get trapped in the explosion I'm not
completely<00:06:49.440> sure<00:06:49.590> and<00:06:50.100> I<00:06:50.460> don't<00:06:50.610> know<00:06:50.670> if<00:06:50.730> I

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
completely sure and I don't know if I

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.010 
completely sure and I don't know if I
can<00:06:50.850> get<00:06:51.030> in<00:06:51.180> there<00:06:51.270> fast<00:06:51.480> enough<00:06:51.690> to<00:06:51.900> actually

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
can get in there fast enough to actually

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.590 
can get in there fast enough to actually
try<00:06:52.380> it<00:06:52.410> out<00:06:52.620> but<00:06:52.800> you<00:06:53.040> would<00:06:53.850> probably<00:06:54.390> want

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
try it out but you would probably want

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.570 
try it out but you would probably want
to<00:06:54.720> be<00:06:54.810> careful<00:06:55.080> with<00:06:55.380> that<00:06:55.620> so<00:06:56.310> that's<00:06:56.460> all

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
to be careful with that so that's all

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.070 
to be careful with that so that's all
for<00:06:56.730> this<00:06:56.820> video<00:06:56.970> this<00:06:57.240> was<00:06:57.480> a<00:06:57.510> requested

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
for this video this was a requested

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.980 
for this video this was a requested
video<00:06:58.350> so<00:06:58.500> I<00:06:58.530> wanted<00:06:58.830> to<00:06:58.890> do<00:06:59.370> it<00:06:59.490> of<00:06:59.580> course

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
video so I wanted to do it of course

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.460 
video so I wanted to do it of course
this<00:07:00.990> is<00:07:02.300> this<00:07:03.300> is<00:07:03.510> automatically

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
this is this is automatically

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.590 
this is this is automatically
regenerating<00:07:05.250> blocks<00:07:05.610> that<00:07:05.910> were<00:07:06.060> destroyed

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
regenerating blocks that were destroyed

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.630 
regenerating blocks that were destroyed
in<00:07:06.900> an<00:07:07.140> explosion<00:07:07.590> you<00:07:07.830> know<00:07:07.890> how<00:07:08.100> to<00:07:08.160> do<00:07:08.370> it<00:07:08.520> if

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
in an explosion you know how to do it if

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.670 
in an explosion you know how to do it if
the<00:07:08.790> block<00:07:09.030> is<00:07:09.270> broken<00:07:09.630> out<00:07:10.170> of<00:07:10.410> the<00:07:10.500> block

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
the block is broken out of the block

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.230 
the block is broken out of the block
explodes<00:07:11.280> and<00:07:11.580> you<00:07:11.640> got<00:07:11.760> to<00:07:11.880> do<00:07:11.940> something<00:07:12.120> a

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
explodes and you got to do something a

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.450 
explodes and you got to do something a
little<00:07:12.270> bit<00:07:12.450> more<00:07:12.570> special<00:07:13.500> you<00:07:14.040> could<00:07:14.220> also

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
little bit more special you could also

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.210 
little bit more special you could also
do<00:07:15.050> you<00:07:16.050> know<00:07:16.080> rigged<00:07:16.380> up<00:07:16.470> a<00:07:16.620> little<00:07:16.830> system

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
do you know rigged up a little system

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.770 
do you know rigged up a little system
where<00:07:17.430> it'll<00:07:17.610> actually<00:07:17.790> regenerate<00:07:18.450> the

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
where it'll actually regenerate the

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.440 
where it'll actually regenerate the
blocks<00:07:19.050> one<00:07:19.440> block<00:07:19.800> at<00:07:19.980> a<00:07:20.070> time<00:07:20.100> and<00:07:20.700> then<00:07:21.360> you

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450 
blocks one block at a time and then you

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.760 
blocks one block at a time and then you
have<00:07:21.570> it<00:07:21.660> generate<00:07:21.840> a<00:07:21.990> couple<00:07:22.350> blocks<00:07:22.530> a

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
have it generate a couple blocks a

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.680 
have it generate a couple blocks a
second<00:07:23.250> so<00:07:23.700> it<00:07:23.820> almost<00:07:23.940> looks<00:07:24.180> like<00:07:24.420> the

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
terrain is rebuilding itself which could

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.940 
terrain is rebuilding itself which could
be<00:07:26.370> pretty<00:07:26.610> cool<00:07:26.870> as<00:07:27.870> always<00:07:28.230> subscribe<00:07:28.470> if
