 This was half a cup of water here. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.410

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:59.630

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.750
 our butterbeer, let's go 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.060

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.480
 Let's try to cool this down in some 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.580
 minutes in the refrigerator can not be 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.500
 there can be no business overload the 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.360
 cold at the obligatory stop 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.060

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.609

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.120
 You did it in your career but we do it. 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:26.950

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.050

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.720

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:45.220
 to use with this is the full lava is to 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.790
 to make in the linen cloth, people will pick up 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.860

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:53.020

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.070

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.070
 do what the crematorium 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.729
 we see who is who assumes it is 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.139
 so sugar is missing as much as 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.750
 sugar 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.750
 to boot sugar in morale 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:20.309
 was when the now headline this with 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:24.209
 firmness and firmness benefit 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:26.009
 this is our whipped cream that 

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:30.629
 I'll get it and I'll put it a little bit 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:33.089
 from ours and let's hit it harder 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:35.189
 Now we're going to get this beer that 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:38.039
 It's a beer as it even calls beer. 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:39.899
 Because it's that honey beer. 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:44.839
 So we'll get it and put the 

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:44.839
 equivalent to a chip 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:10.070
 ready our buttery beer 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.070

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:31.740
 the plate with breakfast taste to the 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.040
 wide potato 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:41.070

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:43.200

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:48.229

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.680

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.220
