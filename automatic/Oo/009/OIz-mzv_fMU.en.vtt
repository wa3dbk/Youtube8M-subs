updates is you first of all if you have

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.340 
updates is you first of all if you have
new<00:00:46.710> versions<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.600> Google<00:00:48.809> Apps<00:00:49.079> I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
new versions of all of the Google Apps I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.200 
new versions of all of the Google Apps I
was<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> mow<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.250> tea<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.460> new<00:00:50.640> page<00:00:50.940> in

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
was going to mow my tea a new page in

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.810 
was going to mow my tea a new page in
here<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.719> think<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> looks<00:00:52.710> exactly<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.399> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
here I think it looks exactly like this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.779 
here I think it looks exactly like this
of<00:00:54.239> course<00:00:54.510> minor<00:00:54.899> bug<00:00:55.230> tweaks<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.070> elements

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
of course minor bug tweaks and elements

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.779 
of course minor bug tweaks and elements
and<00:00:56.910> things<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.420> across<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.370> UI<00:00:59.670> I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and things like that across the the UI I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.729 
and things like that across the the UI I
also<00:01:00.180> heard<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> call<00:01:01.260> quality<00:01:01.500> should

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
also heard that the call quality should

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.429 
also heard that the call quality should
be<00:01:01.890> way<00:01:02.100> better<00:01:02.390> they<00:01:03.390> seem<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.899> adding<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
be way better they seem to be adding a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.670 
be way better they seem to be adding a
clearer<00:01:04.710> image<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.570> said<00:01:06.689> updated<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
clearer image and as I said updated the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
clearer image and as I said updated the
most<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> Google<00:01:08.310> Apps<00:01:08.400> should<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.880> using

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
most of the Google Apps should be using

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.899 
most of the Google Apps should be using
the<00:01:09.600> latest<00:01:09.840> version<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:11.040> which<00:01:11.280> definitely

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the latest version here which definitely

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.039 
the latest version here which definitely
is<00:01:12.240> quite<00:01:12.780> nice<00:01:13.580> nuke<00:01:14.580> older<00:01:15.060> calibration<00:01:15.750> for

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
is quite nice nuke older calibration for

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
is quite nice nuke older calibration for
the<00:01:16.110> screen<00:01:16.619> maybe<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.820> go<00:01:18.030> into

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the screen maybe you can go into

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
the screen maybe you can go into
settings<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.479> then<00:01:22.040> tweak<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.500 

and<00:01:30.220> I'm<00:01:30.430> not<00:01:30.580> very<00:01:30.729> sure<00:01:30.820> it's<00:01:31.120> probably<00:01:31.479> a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
and I'm not very sure it's probably a

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.260 
and I'm not very sure it's probably a
little<00:01:31.630> bit<00:01:31.780> hard<00:01:32.050> to<00:01:32.110> see<00:01:32.200> here<00:01:32.740> but

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
little bit hard to see here but

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.180 
little bit hard to see here but
definitely<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.900> difference<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.979> will

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
definitely is a difference that you will

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.500 
definitely is a difference that you will
see<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.820> first<00:01:36.970> time<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.680> check<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.190> out<00:01:39.510> some

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
see the first time you check it out some

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.060 
see the first time you check it out some
other<00:01:40.630> things<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.050> proximity<00:01:41.470> sensor

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
other things the proximity sensor

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.820 
other things the proximity sensor
prevents<00:01:42.550> no<00:01:42.729> activation<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.750> off<00:01:44.350> screen

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
prevents no activation of off screen

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.310 
prevents no activation of off screen
gestures<00:01:45.400> while<00:01:45.820> in<00:01:46.000> your<00:01:46.150> pocket<00:01:46.570> and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
gestures while in your pocket and

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.380 
gestures while in your pocket and
capacitive<00:01:48.009> touch<00:01:48.190> keys<00:01:48.460> supported<00:01:49.119> in

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
capacitive touch keys supported in

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.719 
capacitive touch keys supported in
recovery<00:01:50.229> mode<00:01:50.410> so<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.220> can<00:01:51.310> definitely<00:01:51.430> be

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
recovery mode so that can definitely be

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.560 
recovery mode so that can definitely be
nice<00:01:51.970> if<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.420> do<00:01:52.630> use<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:53.200> lot<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:55.240> then

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
nice if you do use that a lot and then

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.660 
nice if you do use that a lot and then
of<00:01:55.869> course<00:01:55.900> we<00:01:56.830> do<00:01:57.070> have<00:01:57.100> some<00:01:57.369> other<00:01:57.460> updates

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
of course we do have some other updates

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.440 
of course we do have some other updates
here<00:01:58.330> increase<00:01:59.259> after<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.040> button

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
here increase after the button

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.680 
here increase after the button
illumination<00:02:01.450> so<00:02:02.440> let's<00:02:02.680> see<00:02:02.800> here<00:02:03.690> these

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
illumination so let's see here these

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.940 
illumination so let's see here these
buttons<00:02:05.140> down<00:02:05.350> here<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:06.820> had<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.090> pretty<00:02:07.330> poor

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
buttons down here they had a pretty poor

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.280 
buttons down here they had a pretty poor
pretty<00:02:08.950> poor<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.850> was<00:02:10.000> hard<00:02:10.269> to<00:02:10.330> see<00:02:10.630> them<00:02:10.810> so

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
pretty poor it was hard to see them so

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.400 
pretty poor it was hard to see them so
maybe<00:02:11.500> they<00:02:11.739> have<00:02:11.950> changed<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:14.080> button

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
maybe they have changed that the button

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:28.680 
maybe they have changed that the button
should<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:14.709> in<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.400> somewhere

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.400 

hmm<00:02:29.380> buttons<00:02:30.330> maybe<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.080> button

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
hmm buttons maybe this is not the button

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.570 
hmm buttons maybe this is not the button
in<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.800> ball<00:02:33.010> okay<00:02:33.460> there<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:33.700> go<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:36.040> let's<00:02:36.070> see
