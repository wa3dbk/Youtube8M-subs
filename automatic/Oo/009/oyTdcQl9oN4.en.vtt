00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
Jack Moffett your brain unsound

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.610 
Jack Moffett your brain unsound
everybody<00:00:05.740> so<00:00:06.460> your<00:00:06.880> brain<00:00:07.149> is<00:00:07.620> what

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
everybody so your brain is what

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.470 
everybody so your brain is what
processes<00:00:09.429> all<00:00:09.580> the<00:00:09.610> stuff<00:00:10.059> that<00:00:10.240> you<00:00:10.299> get

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
processes all the stuff that you get

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.659 
processes all the stuff that you get
through<00:00:10.660> your<00:00:10.780> ears<00:00:11.049> and<00:00:11.320> it<00:00:12.160> seems<00:00:12.459> really

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:12.669 
through your ears and it seems really

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.400 
through your ears and it seems really
simple<00:00:12.969> you<00:00:13.269> hear<00:00:13.509> things<00:00:13.780> that<00:00:14.049> happen<00:00:14.320> in

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
simple you hear things that happen in

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.260 
simple you hear things that happen in
the<00:00:14.499> world<00:00:14.620> air<00:00:14.950> vibrates<00:00:15.519> it<00:00:15.730> vibrates<00:00:16.090> your

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
the world air vibrates it vibrates your

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.030 
the world air vibrates it vibrates your
ear<00:00:16.450> your<00:00:16.690> brain<00:00:16.869> hears<00:00:17.140> it<00:00:17.290> but<00:00:17.440> it's<00:00:17.830> really

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
ear your brain hears it but it's really

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.740 
ear your brain hears it but it's really
like<00:00:18.250> magic<00:00:18.520> there's<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:18.970> lot<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.180> weird<00:00:19.420> stuff

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
like magic there's a lot of weird stuff

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.570 
like magic there's a lot of weird stuff
that<00:00:19.810> goes<00:00:20.080> on<00:00:20.260> now<00:00:21.070> I'm<00:00:21.130> going<00:00:21.250> to<00:00:21.340> talk<00:00:21.400> about

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
that goes on now I'm going to talk about

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.310 
that goes on now I'm going to talk about
some<00:00:21.790> of<00:00:21.820> those<00:00:22.000> things<00:00:22.060> so<00:00:22.480> the<00:00:22.900> first<00:00:23.140> thing

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
some of those things so the first thing

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.350 
some of those things so the first thing
is<00:00:23.530> you<00:00:24.190> have<00:00:24.220> a<00:00:24.310> limited<00:00:24.670> range<00:00:24.730> of<00:00:25.120> what<00:00:25.270> you

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
is you have a limited range of what you

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.000 
is you have a limited range of what you
can<00:00:25.540> hear<00:00:25.840> so<00:00:26.050> it<00:00:26.170> starts<00:00:26.410> about<00:00:26.500> 20<00:00:26.860> Hertz

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
can hear so it starts about 20 Hertz

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.590 
can hear so it starts about 20 Hertz
goes<00:00:27.280> up<00:00:27.430> to<00:00:27.520> about<00:00:27.580> 20<00:00:27.910> kilohertz<00:00:28.180> and<00:00:28.510> then

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
goes up to about 20 kilohertz and then

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.970 
goes up to about 20 kilohertz and then
you're<00:00:28.720> into<00:00:28.930> dog-whistle<00:00:29.320> range<00:00:29.680> and<00:00:29.890> then

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
you're into dog-whistle range and then

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.790 
you're into dog-whistle range and then
afterwards<00:00:30.400> all<00:00:30.580> kinds<00:00:30.820> of<00:00:30.880> crazy<00:00:31.120> stuff<00:00:31.420> and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
afterwards all kinds of crazy stuff and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.660 
afterwards all kinds of crazy stuff and
outside<00:00:32.800> of<00:00:32.829> that<00:00:32.950> you<00:00:33.160> can't<00:00:33.339> really<00:00:33.519> hear

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
outside of that you can't really hear

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.040 
outside of that you can't really hear
anything<00:00:33.699> but<00:00:34.210> inside<00:00:34.510> of<00:00:34.629> that<00:00:34.719> you<00:00:34.899> can

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
anything but inside of that you can

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.380 
anything but inside of that you can
pretty<00:00:35.260> much<00:00:35.350> hear<00:00:35.589> stuff<00:00:35.859> I'm<00:00:36.280> one<00:00:37.239> of<00:00:37.329> the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
pretty much hear stuff I'm one of the

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.329 
pretty much hear stuff I'm one of the
cool<00:00:37.570> things<00:00:37.780> your<00:00:37.899> brain<00:00:38.079> can<00:00:38.289> do<00:00:38.440> is<00:00:38.499> called

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
cool things your brain can do is called

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.549 
cool things your brain can do is called
the<00:00:39.429> cocktail<00:00:39.640> party<00:00:40.120> trick<00:00:40.329> basically<00:00:41.170> if

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
the cocktail party trick basically if

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.169 
the cocktail party trick basically if
you're<00:00:41.829> at<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.159> cocktail<00:00:42.399> party<00:00:42.909> and<00:00:42.969> you<00:00:43.059> hear

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
you're at a cocktail party and you hear

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.509 
you're at a cocktail party and you hear
multiple<00:00:43.359> people<00:00:43.929> talking<00:00:44.109> because<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:45.370> have

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
multiple people talking because you have

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:46.979 
multiple people talking because you have
two<00:00:45.670> microphones<00:00:46.269> essentially<00:00:46.749> you<00:00:46.839> hear

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
two microphones essentially you hear

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.259 
two microphones essentially you hear
each<00:00:47.170> voice<00:00:47.379> differently<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:48.399> each<00:00:48.489> year<00:00:48.730> you

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
each voice differently in each year you

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.720 
each voice differently in each year you
can<00:00:49.890> disambiguate<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.010> voices<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.519> you<00:00:51.609> can

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
can disambiguate the voices and you can

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.029 
can disambiguate the voices and you can
hear<00:00:51.909> distinct<00:00:52.390> people<00:00:52.690> talking<00:00:53.079> another

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
hear distinct people talking another

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.880 
hear distinct people talking another
thing<00:00:54.280> that's<00:00:54.719> kind<00:00:55.719> of<00:00:55.809> funny<00:00:56.050> is<00:00:56.229> tinnitus

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
thing that's kind of funny is tinnitus

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.040 
thing that's kind of funny is tinnitus
if<00:00:57.699> you<00:00:57.879> have<00:00:57.999> hearing<00:00:58.329> damage<00:00:58.479> you'll

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
if you have hearing damage you'll

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.299 
if you have hearing damage you'll
actually<00:00:59.229> hear<00:00:59.559> ringing<00:00:59.769> in<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.100> same

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
actually hear ringing in the same

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.219 
actually hear ringing in the same
frequency<00:01:00.550> range<00:01:00.850> as<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.359> damage<00:01:01.569> is<00:01:01.839> in<00:01:01.989> so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
frequency range as the damage is in so

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.229 
frequency range as the damage is in so
whenever<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.339> hear<00:01:03.519> your<00:01:03.639> ears<00:01:03.879> ringing<00:01:04.059> it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
whenever you hear your ears ringing it

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.179 
whenever you hear your ears ringing it
actually<00:01:04.570> means<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.170> cells<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:05.890> are

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
actually means that the cells that are

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:07.620 
actually means that the cells that are
the<00:01:06.340> neurons<00:01:06.729> that<00:01:06.850> used<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.149> process<00:01:07.509> that

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
the neurons that used to process that

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.609 
the neurons that used to process that
frequency<00:01:07.990> are<00:01:08.200> dead<00:01:08.409> oh<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:10.090> also<00:01:10.619> your

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
frequency are dead oh you also your

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.350 
frequency are dead oh you also your
brain<00:01:11.890> really<00:01:12.369> likes<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.820> react<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.210> things

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
brain really likes to react to things

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.109 
brain really likes to react to things
and<00:01:13.630> seek<00:01:14.409> out<00:01:14.560> things<00:01:14.799> so<00:01:15.040> phone<00:01:15.579> ringer<00:01:15.880> for

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
and seek out things so phone ringer for

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.810 
and seek out things so phone ringer for
example<00:01:16.539> are<00:01:16.750> all<00:01:17.259> in<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.860> same<00:01:17.890> audio<00:01:18.520> range

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
example are all in the same audio range

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.240 
example are all in the same audio range
is<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.119> human<00:01:19.360> voice<00:01:19.860> between<00:01:20.860> 2<00:01:21.009> and<00:01:21.130> 4

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
is the human voice between 2 and 4

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.010 
is the human voice between 2 and 4
kilohertz<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.820> your<00:01:22.360> brain<00:01:22.570> really<00:01:22.780> looks

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
kilohertz and your brain really looks

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.959 
kilohertz and your brain really looks
for<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.259> signal<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:23.740> if<00:01:24.009> you<00:01:24.219> ever<00:01:24.549> hear<00:01:24.820> your

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
for the signal so if you ever hear your

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.370 
for the signal so if you ever hear your
phone<00:01:25.149> ring<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.509> you<00:01:25.750> look<00:01:25.899> down<00:01:26.079> it's<00:01:26.259> not

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
phone ring and you look down it's not

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.719 
phone ring and you look down it's not
really<00:01:26.560> ringing<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:27.130> was<00:01:27.280> probably<00:01:27.460> what<00:01:27.640> it

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
really ringing that was probably what it

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.529 
really ringing that was probably what it
was<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.490> first<00:01:30.969> things<00:01:31.240> I'm<00:01:31.390> going<00:01:31.479> to

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
was one of the first things I'm going to

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:32.760 
was one of the first things I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:31.719> is<00:01:32.109> called<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.500> missing

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
demonstrate is called the missing

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.410 
demonstrate is called the missing
fundamental<00:01:33.250> so<00:01:33.369> all<00:01:33.520> sounds<00:01:34.000> are<00:01:34.090> made<00:01:34.210> up<00:01:34.329> of

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
fundamental so all sounds are made up of

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.420 
fundamental so all sounds are made up of
sine<00:01:34.659> waves<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:35.049> group<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.380> them<00:01:35.530> there's<00:01:36.369> a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
sine waves a group of them there's a

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.830 
sine waves a group of them there's a
fundamental<00:01:36.939> one<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.270> gives<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.659> pitch

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
fundamental one that gives you the pitch

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.920 
fundamental one that gives you the pitch
and<00:01:38.079> then<00:01:38.289> some<00:01:38.560> other<00:01:38.710> ones<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.930> essentially

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
and then some other ones and essentially

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.359 
and then some other ones and essentially
what<00:01:41.079> happens<00:01:41.409> is<00:01:41.530> if<00:01:41.740> you<00:01:41.770> delete<00:01:42.189> the

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
what happens is if you delete the

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.969 
what happens is if you delete the
fundamental<00:01:42.850> pitch<00:01:43.060> you're<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.079> keep<00:01:44.829> all

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
fundamental pitch you're and keep all

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.639 
fundamental pitch you're and keep all
the<00:01:45.189> rest<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.490> them<00:01:45.640> your<00:01:45.909> brain<00:01:46.649> actually

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
the rest of them your brain actually

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.440 
the rest of them your brain actually
will<00:01:47.829> fill<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.640> fundamental<00:01:49.090> pitch<00:01:49.240> for

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
will fill in the fundamental pitch for

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.209 
will fill in the fundamental pitch for
you<00:01:49.570> I'm<00:01:50.380> not<00:01:50.530> going<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.740> be<00:01:50.799> able<00:01:50.859> to<00:01:50.950> make<00:01:51.100> it

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
you I'm not going to be able to make it

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.819 
you I'm not going to be able to make it
over<00:01:51.399> there<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.880> time<00:01:52.060> for<00:01:52.179> that<00:01:52.329> slide

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
over there and the time for that slide

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.929 
over there and the time for that slide
but<00:01:53.829> it<00:01:54.009> doesn't<00:01:54.340> change<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.609> pitch<00:01:54.759> you

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
but it doesn't change the pitch you

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:55.649 
but it doesn't change the pitch you
would<00:01:55.060> think<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.329> you<00:01:55.390> would<00:01:55.479> hear<00:01:55.630> a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
would think that you would hear a

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.149 
would think that you would hear a
different<00:01:55.990> thing<00:01:56.079> but<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.320> don't<00:01:56.350> now<00:01:56.979> this

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
different thing but you don't now this

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.230 
different thing but you don't now this
one<00:01:57.340> I'm<00:01:57.429> going<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.640> make<00:01:57.759> it<00:01:57.850> over<00:01:57.999> here<00:01:58.030> and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
one I'm going to make it over here and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:15.140 
one I'm going to make it over here and
I'm<00:01:58.299> going<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.450> show<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.600> what<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:58.899> is

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.430 

that<00:02:16.150> sounds<00:02:16.420> like<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.660> continually<00:02:17.230> going

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
that sounds like it's continually going

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.290 
that sounds like it's continually going
down<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.100> will<00:02:18.250> keep<00:02:18.370> going<00:02:18.640> forever<00:02:18.819> but

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
down and it will keep going forever but

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.090 
down and it will keep going forever but
actually<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.900> looot<00:02:20.110> short<00:02:20.470> loop<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.920> so

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
actually it's a looot short loop you so

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.710 
actually it's a looot short loop you so
your<00:02:21.250> treat<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.090> tricks<00:02:22.330> your<00:02:22.480> brain<00:02:22.600> into

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
your treat the it tricks your brain into

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.990 
your treat the it tricks your brain into
thinking<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.560> forever<00:02:24.310> decreasing<00:02:24.880> in

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
thinking that it's forever decreasing in

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.920 
thinking that it's forever decreasing in
pitch<00:02:25.209> um<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:26.440> also<00:02:26.590> have<00:02:27.660> continuity<00:02:28.660> of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
pitch um you also have continuity of

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.860 
pitch um you also have continuity of
pitch<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.320> if<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.530> hear<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.830> pitch<00:02:30.870> continuing

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
pitch so if you hear a pitch continuing

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.360 
pitch so if you hear a pitch continuing
to<00:02:31.990> rise<00:02:32.170> but<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.560> has<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> hole<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.160> middle

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
to rise but it has a hole in the middle

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.100 
to rise but it has a hole in the middle
so<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.640> actually<00:02:33.790> stops<00:02:34.209> if<00:02:34.840> there's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
so it actually stops if there's

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.690 
so it actually stops if there's
something<00:02:35.440> masking<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.010> hole<00:02:36.250> like<00:02:36.489> some

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
something masking that hole like some

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.370 
something masking that hole like some
noise<00:02:36.940> like<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.209> short<00:02:37.480> burst<00:02:37.690> you'll<00:02:38.170> actually

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
noise like a short burst you'll actually

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.190 
noise like a short burst you'll actually
continue<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:38.980> hear<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.570> pitch<00:02:40.750> rising

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
continue to hear the the pitch rising

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.810 
continue to hear the the pitch rising
your<00:02:41.440> ear<00:02:41.590> will<00:02:41.770> just<00:02:41.950> completely<00:02:42.370> fill<00:02:42.640> in

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
your ear will just completely fill in

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.160 
your ear will just completely fill in
all<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> missing<00:02:43.510> information<00:02:43.989> even

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
all of the missing information even

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.479 
all of the missing information even
though<00:02:44.320> it's<00:02:44.440> not<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.190> happens

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
though it's not there and this happens

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:46.770 
though it's not there and this happens
all<00:02:45.610> sorts<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:45.940> ways<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.360> can<00:02:46.480> have<00:02:46.750> a

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
all sorts of ways so you can have a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.990 
all sorts of ways so you can have a
continuously<00:02:47.380> rising<00:02:47.620> pitch<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.220> one<00:02:48.820> that's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
continuously rising pitch and one that's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.180 
continuously rising pitch and one that's
going<00:02:49.209> down<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.750> middle<00:02:49.989> one<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.200> has<00:02:51.160> a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
going down and the middle one is has a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.890 
going down and the middle one is has a
hole<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.790> you'll<00:02:52.180> still<00:02:52.480> fill<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.810> in

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
hole in it and you'll still fill it in

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.380 
hole in it and you'll still fill it in
it's<00:02:53.500> actually<00:02:53.980> pretty<00:02:54.130> crazy<00:02:54.430> another<00:02:55.209> one

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
it's actually pretty crazy another one

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.630 
it's actually pretty crazy another one
in<00:02:55.540> 1839<00:02:56.230> they<00:02:56.560> found<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.100> thing<00:02:57.160> called<00:02:57.489> the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
someone tuna piano if you have two sort

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.050 
someone tuna piano if you have two sort
of<00:03:01.930> notes<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.519> octave<00:03:03.880> and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
of notes they like that octave and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.220 
of notes they like that octave and
they're<00:03:04.209> slightly<00:03:04.480> out<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.840> pitch<00:03:05.019> they'll

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
they're slightly out of pitch they'll

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.509 
they're slightly out of pitch they'll
face<00:03:05.440> together<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:05.980> you'll<00:03:06.070> hear<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.340> sort

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
face together and you'll hear the sort

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.160 
face together and you'll hear the sort
of<00:03:06.550> beating<00:03:06.760> sound<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.720> normal<00:03:07.959> beats

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
happens on headphones you play one

who<00:03:21.970> comes<00:03:22.209> up<00:03:22.360> with<00:03:22.480> all<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.690> these<00:03:22.900> audio

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
who comes up with all of these audio

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.170 
who comes up with all of these audio
allusions<00:03:23.709> one<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.010> them<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.790> glissando

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
allusions one of them is the glissando

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.960 
allusions one of them is the glissando
illusion<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.709> glissando<00:03:27.220> illusion<00:03:27.790> is

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
illusion and the glissando illusion is

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.750 
illusion and the glissando illusion is
another<00:03:28.450> one<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.810> need<00:03:29.019> two<00:03:29.170> speakers<00:03:29.760> you

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
another one you need two speakers you

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.759 
another one you need two speakers you
play<00:03:30.970> an<00:03:31.120> oboe<00:03:31.450> for<00:03:31.480> instance<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.200> constant

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
play an oboe for instance a constant

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.650 
play an oboe for instance a constant
pitch<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.760> swap<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.360> between<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
pitch and you swap it between the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.360 
pitch and you swap it between the
speakers<00:03:34.959> over<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.260> over<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:35.410> over<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.739> then

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
speakers over and over and over and then

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.970 
speakers over and over and over and then
on<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.880> other<00:03:36.910> speaker<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.900> oboe<00:03:38.200> you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
on the other speaker of the oboe you

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.740 
on the other speaker of the oboe you
have<00:03:39.160> something<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.730> goes<00:03:40.150> up<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.600> pitch

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
have something that goes up and pitch

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.180 
have something that goes up and pitch
and<00:03:40.989> down<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.320> pitching<00:03:41.590> up<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.890> pitch<00:03:42.040> and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
and down and pitching up and pitch and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.380 
and down and pitching up and pitch and
down<00:03:42.280> in<00:03:42.370> pitch<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.640> those<00:03:42.760> are<00:03:42.880> swapping<00:03:43.090> and

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
down in pitch and those are swapping and

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.560 
down in pitch and those are swapping and
your<00:03:43.840> brain<00:03:44.079> will<00:03:44.470> actually<00:03:45.239> though<00:03:46.239> you'll

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
your brain will actually though you'll

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.120 
your brain will actually though you'll
hear<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.900> oboe<00:03:47.140> switching<00:03:47.590> but<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:47.920> won't

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
hear the oboe switching but you won't

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.259 
hear the oboe switching but you won't
hear<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> other<00:03:48.519> one<00:03:48.579> switching<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.150> you'll

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
hear the other one switching and you'll

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.990 
hear the other one switching and you'll
actually<00:03:49.630> it'll<00:03:49.840> be<00:03:50.019> spatially<00:03:50.670> oriented<00:03:51.670> so

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
actually it'll be spatially oriented so

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.890 
actually it'll be spatially oriented so
you'll<00:03:52.150> see<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.510> sort<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.959> go<00:03:54.570> another<00:03:55.570> one<00:03:55.750> is

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
you'll see it sort of go another one is

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.819 
you'll see it sort of go another one is
the<00:03:56.019> McGurk<00:03:56.320> effect

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
the McGurk effect

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.530 
the McGurk effect
this<00:03:57.040> one's<00:03:57.280> really<00:03:57.549> weird<00:03:57.730> if<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.150> want<00:03:58.420> if

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
this one's really weird if you want if

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.970 
this one's really weird if you want if
you<00:03:58.660> take<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.870> TV<00:03:59.230> recording<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.739> someone

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
you take a TV recording of someone

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.580 
you take a TV recording of someone
talking<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:01.150> dub<00:04:01.510> out<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.959> sound<00:04:02.260> and

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
talking and you dub out the sound and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.710 
talking and you dub out the sound and
put<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.459> different<00:04:03.670> sound<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.329> since<00:04:04.570> since

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
put in a different sound so since since

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.410 
put in a different sound so since since
they<00:04:04.870> say<00:04:05.019> bah<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.950> dub<00:04:06.160> in<00:04:06.310> goth<00:04:06.640> then

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
they say bah and you dub in goth then

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.569 
they say bah and you dub in goth then
the<00:04:07.600> person<00:04:07.959> will<00:04:08.049> actually<00:04:08.170> hear<00:04:08.560> dah<00:04:08.950> it's

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
the person will actually hear dah it's

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.539 
the person will actually hear dah it's
crazy<00:04:10.209> how<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.660> multimodal<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.680> brain<00:04:12.070> is<00:04:12.280> in

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
crazy how the multimodal the brain is in

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.550 
crazy how the multimodal the brain is in
respect<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:12.940> hearing<00:04:13.299> on<00:04:14.019> all<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.440> these

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
respect to hearing on all of these

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.500 
respect to hearing on all of these
tricks<00:04:14.920> make<00:04:15.459> it<00:04:15.609> possible<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:16.030> do<00:04:16.209> audio

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
tricks make it possible to do audio

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.500 
tricks make it possible to do audio
compression<00:04:17.080> so<00:04:17.470> files<00:04:18.190> are<00:04:18.459> big<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.299> takes

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
compression so files are big it takes

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.390 
compression so files are big it takes
like<00:04:19.660> 50<00:04:19.989> megabytes<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.500> store<00:04:20.739> 4<00:04:20.979> minutes<00:04:21.280> of

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
like 50 megabytes to store 4 minutes of

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.750 
like 50 megabytes to store 4 minutes of
audio

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
audio

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.240 
audio
but<00:04:22.390> if<00:04:22.660> we<00:04:22.930> delete<00:04:23.260> everything<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:24.130> the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
but if we delete everything that the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.190 
but if we delete everything that the
brain<00:04:24.460> can't<00:04:24.760> hear<00:04:25.090> we<00:04:25.570> can<00:04:25.750> make<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.990> files

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
brain can't hear we can make the files

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.080 
brain can't hear we can make the files
much<00:04:26.440> smaller<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.190> one<00:04:27.340> way<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.550> do<00:04:27.730> this<00:04:27.880> is

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
much smaller so one way to do this is

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.910 
much smaller so one way to do this is
called<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.810> absolute<00:04:29.050> threshold<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.650> hearing

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
called the absolute threshold of hearing

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.890 
called the absolute threshold of hearing
or<00:04:30.040> equal<00:04:30.310> loudness<00:04:30.430> curves<00:04:30.910> basically<00:04:31.510> this

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
or equal loudness curves basically this

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.330 
or equal loudness curves basically this
is<00:04:32.080> how<00:04:32.200> well<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:32.470> can<00:04:32.770> hear<00:04:32.920> at<00:04:33.040> different

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
is how well you can hear at different

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.890 
is how well you can hear at different
ranges<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:33.880> can<00:04:34.120> hear<00:04:34.270> really<00:04:34.420> well<00:04:34.600> at

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
ranges so you can hear really well at

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.630 
ranges so you can hear really well at
this<00:04:34.990> bottom<00:04:35.380> part<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:35.740> at<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.310> low<00:04:36.430> end<00:04:36.610> and

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
this bottom part and at the low end and

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.770 
this bottom part and at the low end and
the<00:04:36.730> high<00:04:36.790> end<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.120> can't<00:04:37.360> hear<00:04:37.510> very<00:04:37.720> well

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
the high end you can't hear very well

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.140 
the high end you can't hear very well
well<00:04:38.410> at<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.560> certain<00:04:38.890> point<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.700> can<00:04:39.850> delete

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
well at a certain point you can delete

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.340 
well at a certain point you can delete
all<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.480> those<00:04:40.570> things<00:04:40.810> that<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.020> can't<00:04:41.200> hear

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
all of those things that you can't hear

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.600 
all of those things that you can't hear
very<00:04:41.380> well<00:04:41.740> because<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.100> can't<00:04:42.280> hear<00:04:42.460> them

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
very well because you can't hear them

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.020 
very well because you can't hear them
anyway

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
anyway

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.280 
anyway
there's<00:04:43.720> also<00:04:44.130> masking<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:45.640> in<00:04:46.390> masking<00:04:46.810> you

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
there's also masking and in masking you

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.670 
there's also masking and in masking you
have<00:04:47.500> sounds<00:04:48.370> we'll<00:04:48.810> just<00:04:49.810> hide<00:04:50.020> other<00:04:50.290> sounds

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
have sounds we'll just hide other sounds

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.840 
have sounds we'll just hide other sounds
so<00:04:50.800> for<00:04:50.950> instance<00:04:51.190> if<00:04:51.340> yours<00:04:51.490> paddle

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
so for instance if yours paddle

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.700 
so for instance if yours paddle
scratching<00:04:52.210> on<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> post<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.870> you<00:04:53.410> can<00:04:53.440> hear

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
scratching on a post and you can hear

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.990
