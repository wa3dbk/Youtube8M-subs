technic<00:01:16.210> models<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:25.330> leave<00:01:25.479> us<00:01:25.600> Lana<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:26.050> big

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.880 
technic models we leave us Lana of big
kids<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.520> we<00:01:27.909> try<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.179> test<00:01:28.600> our<00:01:28.960> more<00:01:29.590> than<00:01:29.770> our

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
kids so we try to test our more than our

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.669 
kids so we try to test our more than our
own<00:01:30.069> way<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:31.270> when<00:01:31.509> we<00:01:31.690> got<00:01:31.840> outside<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.350> try

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
own way and when we got outside and try

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.559 
own way and when we got outside and try
to<00:01:32.740> push<00:01:33.039> as<00:01:33.220> much<00:01:33.250> snow<00:01:33.700> as<00:01:33.819> we<00:01:34.000> can<00:01:34.330> with<00:01:34.539> a

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
to push as much snow as we can with a

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.290 
to push as much snow as we can with a
border<00:01:34.960> or<00:01:35.319> then<00:01:36.130> we<00:01:36.280> go<00:01:36.399> inside<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:37.060> try<00:01:37.240> to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
border or then we go inside and try to

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.899 
border or then we go inside and try to
see<00:01:37.479> how<00:01:37.630> much<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.960> can<00:01:38.050> actually<00:01:38.200> pull<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:39.520> we

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
see how much it can actually pull so we

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:53.119 
see how much it can actually pull so we
have<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.060> lot<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.210> fun<00:01:40.479> building<00:01:41.200> these<00:01:41.350> models

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:53.129 

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:55.440 

when<00:01:54.129> we<00:01:54.250> finalize<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.789> model<00:01:55.060> we<00:01:55.179> built<00:01:55.360> a

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
when we finalize the model we built a

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.930 
when we finalize the model we built a
model<00:01:55.629> over<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.080> over<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:57.039> over<00:01:57.190> again<00:01:57.489> it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
model over and over and over again it

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.449 
model over and over and over again it
has<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.179> be<00:01:58.239> perfect<00:01:59.009> first<00:02:00.009> when<00:02:00.250> every

has to be perfect first when every

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:06.419 
has to be perfect first when every
