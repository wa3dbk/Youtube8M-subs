00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
to do LightScribe let's start with

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.299 
to do LightScribe let's start with
opening<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> program<00:00:48.899> called<00:00:49.230> DVD<00:00:49.770> shrink<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
opening a program called DVD shrink I

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.720 
opening a program called DVD shrink I
have<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> copied<00:00:51.530> labeled<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.800> copies<00:00:53.340> DVDs
