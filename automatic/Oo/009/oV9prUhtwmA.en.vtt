00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.269
 munich within a year to wait before 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.790
 this commissioning scheduled for 10 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.799

 sophie rolland charland and neighborhood one 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.019
 tgv conquering the east 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.830
 a first but this train rolls on a 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.750
 classical way 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.780
 the new line is still in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.059
 construction is in June 2007 that the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.790
 tgv will put 2 hours 20 instead of 4 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.230
 hours to connect paris and strasbourg 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.640
 five to reims an hour and a half and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.309
 not 2 hours 45 minutes for metz and nancy 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.030
 the tgv will go to the heart of the cities because the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.090
 new line is connected oise en ciel 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.160
 our will is + 2/3 of 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 attendance means almost 4 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.420
 millions more travelers for 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.500
 reach the fateful number of 11 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.019
 millions of people 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.739
 but it's not only the east and the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.320
 Parisian region 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.130
 it's also luxembourg swiss and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.049
 germany 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.970
 but this the regions of France since 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.590
 the tgv is coming from the east for 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.049
 go to lille to go to reindeer 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.460
 nantes and burgundy to go to bordeaux 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.560
 or nantes even faster 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.390
 three guys are under construction on the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.090
 new line like that of lorraine 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.830
 which is located in the middle of the blow 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.020
 some local elected officials want in 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.710
 build another 15 kilometers in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.829
 uphill 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.229
 where there is a connection with the ter 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.780
 the SNCF is already working on reconversion 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.439
 from this station that will have cost nine 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.079
 millions of euros 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.970
 there is volume there is space for 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.690
 by its structure these two guys there can 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.720
 evolve 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.540
 industrial building 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.370
 tertiary industry between the new line 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.530
 high speed stops here at baudre 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.050
 course she connects strasbourg thanks to the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.220
 classical voice misses 100 km which 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.140
 would win the capital 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.390
 European in one hour five years more 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.980
 2h20 challenges of this second tranche 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.890
 without opening to the east 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.300
 the second stretch of the tgv it is 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.729
 essential to better serve 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.160
 germany austria hungary 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.560
 that's the meaning of a big Paris line 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.690
 budapest in the heart of europe for better 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.740
 connect the Europeans all those and 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.760
 everyone who lives in the big 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.410
 cities in major cities 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.880
 European 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.710
 but the finance talks 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.650
 world this is second phase do not have 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.510
 still completed in June 2007 the tgv 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.550
 will arrive in Strasbourg in a caries 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.550
 bad but still at low speed
