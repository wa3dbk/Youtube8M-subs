Indian Wells I think I played poorly to
say<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> least<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.350> didn't<00:01:01.800> start<00:01:02.010> off

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
say the least and I didn't start off

say the least and I didn't start off
well<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.570> tournament<00:01:04.019> progressed

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
well here and as a tournament progressed

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.960 
well here and as a tournament progressed
you<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> started<00:01:06.330> regaining<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.840> form<00:01:07.290> and
