here<00:00:05.650> is<00:00:06.250> one<00:00:06.520> of<00:00:06.550> my<00:00:06.730> newest<00:00:07.150> models<00:00:07.600> the

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
here is one of my newest models the

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.070 
here is one of my newest models the
Mantis<00:00:08.680> and<00:00:08.950> this<00:00:09.400> Mantis<00:00:09.940> actually<00:00:10.420> the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
Mantis and this Mantis actually the

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.080 
Mantis and this Mantis actually the
urban<00:00:11.530> definition<00:00:12.130> of<00:00:12.250> Mantis<00:00:12.610> is<00:00:12.790> something

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
urban definition of Mantis is something

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.109 
urban definition of Mantis is something
to<00:00:13.150> get<00:00:13.240> excited<00:00:13.300> about<00:00:13.780> and<00:00:14.139> this<00:00:14.590> board<00:00:14.860> is

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:15.119 
to get excited about and this board is

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.090 
to get excited about and this board is
incredibly<00:00:16.119> fun<00:00:16.480> and<00:00:16.750> probably<00:00:17.619> one<00:00:17.890> of<00:00:17.920> my

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
incredibly fun and probably one of my

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.150 
incredibly fun and probably one of my
favorite<00:00:18.460> boards<00:00:18.580> in<00:00:18.970> in<00:00:19.480> my<00:00:19.660> lineup<00:00:19.930> but<00:00:20.529> the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
favorite boards in in my lineup but the

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.130 
favorite boards in in my lineup but the
way<00:00:21.310> that<00:00:21.550> I<00:00:21.580> have<00:00:21.940> this<00:00:22.180> board<00:00:22.510> set<00:00:22.779> up<00:00:22.810> as

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
way that I have this board set up as

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.590 
way that I have this board set up as
well<00:00:23.680> as<00:00:23.830> the<00:00:24.010> st.<00:00:24.520> that<00:00:24.760> actually<00:00:25.330> these<00:00:25.449> are

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
well as the st. that actually these are

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.269 
well as the st. that actually these are
all<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:25.869> same<00:00:26.050> board<00:00:26.380> I<00:00:26.560> just<00:00:26.830> have<00:00:26.949> them<00:00:27.070> set

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
all the same board I just have them set

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.210 
all the same board I just have them set
up<00:00:27.400> differently<00:00:27.730> is<00:00:27.970> a<00:00:28.720> very<00:00:29.410> very<00:00:29.710> versatile

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
up differently is a very very versatile

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.339 
up differently is a very very versatile
board<00:00:30.460> and<00:00:30.699> I<00:00:31.119> know<00:00:31.449> a<00:00:31.539> lot<00:00:31.720> of<00:00:31.779> you<00:00:31.960> guys<00:00:32.079> are

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
board and I know a lot of you guys are

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.040 
board and I know a lot of you guys are
fans<00:00:32.649> of<00:00:32.860> little<00:00:33.489> winged<00:00:33.790> swallow<00:00:34.210> boards<00:00:34.809> but

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
fans of little winged swallow boards but

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.860 
fans of little winged swallow boards but
you<00:00:35.470> know<00:00:35.590> this<00:00:35.829> board<00:00:36.160> has<00:00:36.399> a<00:00:36.430> real<00:00:37.000> radical

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
you know this board has a real radical

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.290 
you know this board has a real radical
bottom-heavy<00:00:38.860> concave<00:00:39.460> down<00:00:39.730> in<00:00:39.880> the<00:00:39.969> bottom

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
bottom-heavy concave down in the bottom

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.209 
bottom-heavy concave down in the bottom
actually<00:00:40.840> a<00:00:40.899> slight<00:00:41.260> curve<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:41.680> it<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.130> when

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
actually a slight curve to it and when

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.150 
actually a slight curve to it and when
you<00:00:42.309> slightly<00:00:42.730> curved<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.840> really<00:00:44.559> not<00:00:44.920> only

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
you slightly curved it really not only

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.760 
you slightly curved it really not only
creates<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:46.180> venturi<00:00:46.690> effect<00:00:46.809> but<00:00:47.379> actually

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
creates that venturi effect but actually

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.920 
creates that venturi effect but actually
helps<00:00:48.219> in<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.460> arc<00:00:48.730> of<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.030> turn<00:00:49.300> when<00:00:49.840> you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
helps in the arc of the turn when you

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.930 
helps in the arc of the turn when you
curve<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.440> channel<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:51.280> way<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.610> I<00:00:51.640> have

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
curve the channel the way that I have

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.450 
curve the channel the way that I have
this<00:00:52.149> fin<00:00:52.390> setup<00:00:52.660> right<00:00:52.899> here<00:00:53.289> is<00:00:53.410> this<00:00:54.399> is

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
this fin setup right here is this is

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.430 
this fin setup right here is this is
actually<00:00:54.910> what<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.059> call<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.480> Mantis<00:00:55.899> setup<00:00:56.289> is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
actually what I call the Mantis setup is

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.689 
actually what I call the Mantis setup is
I've<00:00:56.860> got<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.840> five<00:00:59.079> fin<00:00:59.469> and<00:00:59.710> you'll<00:01:00.460> find

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
I've got this five fin and you'll find

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.220 
I've got this five fin and you'll find
that<00:01:00.820> my<00:01:01.000> nub<00:01:01.210> stirs<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.480> little<00:01:01.780> different<00:01:02.140> in

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
that my nub stirs a little different in

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.079 
that my nub stirs a little different in
this<00:01:02.379> one<00:01:02.590> and<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.860> reason<00:01:02.890> being<00:01:03.579> is<00:01:03.820> when

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
this one and the reason being is when

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.599 
this one and the reason being is when
you<00:01:04.210> pull<00:01:04.509> in<00:01:04.689> a<00:01:04.839> tail<00:01:05.109> on<00:01:05.139> a<00:01:05.379> board<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:06.100> has

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
you pull in a tail on a board it has

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.459 
you pull in a tail on a board it has
hold<00:01:07.060> in<00:01:07.240> itself<00:01:07.600> especially<00:01:07.899> when<00:01:08.350> you've

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
hold in itself especially when you've

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.289 
hold in itself especially when you've
got<00:01:08.619> a<00:01:08.649> tip<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.069> a<00:01:09.159> swallow<00:01:09.429> that<00:01:09.670> bites<00:01:09.999> in<00:01:10.179> the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
got a tip of a swallow that bites in the

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.539 
got a tip of a swallow that bites in the
water<00:01:10.539> but<00:01:11.139> what<00:01:11.319> I've<00:01:11.439> done<00:01:11.619> is<00:01:11.859> if<00:01:12.069> you<00:01:12.399> could

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
water but what I've done is if you could

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.809 
water but what I've done is if you could
visualize<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.719> pizza<00:01:14.229> around<00:01:14.740> pizza<00:01:15.249> and<00:01:15.459> you

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
visualize a pizza around pizza and you

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:19.499 
visualize a pizza around pizza and you
slice<00:01:16.149> it<00:01:16.389> up<00:01:16.509> in<00:01:17.369> smaller<00:01:18.369> slices<00:01:18.999> you're

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
slice it up in smaller slices you're

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:20.969 
slice it up in smaller slices you're
going<00:01:19.659> to<00:01:19.719> find<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.079> you<00:01:20.259> can<00:01:20.439> have<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.770> same

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
going to find that you can have the same

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.120 
going to find that you can have the same
amount<00:01:21.249> of<00:01:21.399> fin<00:01:21.670> area<00:01:21.880> by<00:01:22.270> slicing<00:01:22.599> up<00:01:22.869> these

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
amount of fin area by slicing up these

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.499 
amount of fin area by slicing up these
these<00:01:24.130> parts<00:01:24.609> and<00:01:24.789> distribute<00:01:25.420> it

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
these parts and distribute it

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.139 
these parts and distribute it
distributing<00:01:26.229> them<00:01:26.409> differently<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.880> it

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
distributing them differently that it

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.109 
distributing them differently that it
actually<00:01:28.389> has<00:01:28.840> a<00:01:28.869> whole<00:01:29.319> different<00:01:29.529> feel<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
actually has a whole different feel to

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.050 
actually has a whole different feel to
it<00:01:31.359> and<00:01:31.599> the<00:01:31.990> way<00:01:32.229> that<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.529> responds<00:01:33.060> what

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
it and the way that it responds what

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.149 
it and the way that it responds what
I've<00:01:34.209> done<00:01:34.389> here<00:01:34.719> instead<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.079> having<00:01:35.529> a<00:01:35.679> twin

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
I've done here instead of having a twin

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.980 
I've done here instead of having a twin
fin<00:01:36.459> with<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:36.789> small<00:01:37.149> center<00:01:37.539> fin<00:01:37.810> I've

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
fin with a small center fin I've

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.359 
fin with a small center fin I've
actually<00:01:38.669> triangulated<00:01:39.669> between<00:01:40.630> front<00:01:40.990> fin

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
actually triangulated between front fin

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.659 
actually triangulated between front fin
the<00:01:42.369> quad<00:01:43.149> fin<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:43.779> the<00:01:44.409> rear<00:01:44.590> fin<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.189> say

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:45.669 
the quad fin and the rear fin and say

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:46.800 
the quad fin and the rear fin and say
when<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:46.090> waves<00:01:46.239> are<00:01:46.419> small

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
when the waves are small

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.229 
when the waves are small
I'll<00:01:47.020> cluster<00:01:47.709> these<00:01:47.859> guys<00:01:48.130> or<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:48.429> can<00:01:49.060> move

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.239 
I'll cluster these guys or I can move

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.909 
I'll cluster these guys or I can move
them<00:01:49.419> back<00:01:49.599> because<00:01:50.020> they're<00:01:50.169> sink<00:01:50.499> single
