do that to lose the weight for her is

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.840 
do that to lose the weight for her is
the<00:04:22.630> motivation<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.500> really<00:04:23.889> it<00:04:24.070> does<00:04:24.550> good

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
the motivation and really it does good

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.269 
the motivation and really it does good
for<00:04:25.090> my<00:04:25.710> health<00:04:26.710> also

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
not sure which one it was

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.340 
not sure which one it was
but<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:20.910> was<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:21.360> know<00:05:21.390> you<00:05:21.510> look<00:05:21.840> pretty<00:05:21.870> cool

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
but it was you know you look pretty cool

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.010 
but it was you know you look pretty cool
I<00:05:22.650> really<00:05:23.070> really<00:05:24.030> like<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.480> I<00:05:24.510> don't<00:05:24.720> think

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
I really really like that I don't think

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.100 
I really really like that I don't think
it<00:05:25.080> has<00:05:25.230> this<00:05:25.380> much<00:05:25.620> storage<00:05:25.950> as<00:05:26.220> mine<00:05:26.430> does

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
it has this much storage as mine does

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.420 
it has this much storage as mine does
but<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:28.800> know<00:05:28.890> that's<00:05:29.070> one<00:05:29.190> of<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.310> main

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
but you know that's one of the main

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.910 
but you know that's one of the main
reasons<00:05:29.850> why<00:05:30.000> I've<00:05:30.120> got<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:31.170> big<00:05:31.380> maxi

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
reasons why I've got the big maxi

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.480 
reasons why I've got the big maxi
scooter<00:05:32.160> because<00:05:32.430> of<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.820> storage<00:05:33.830> and

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.270 

I<00:05:37.520> think<00:05:38.180> it<00:05:38.270> really<00:05:38.390> has<00:05:38.600> that<00:05:38.810> much<00:05:39.280> storage

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
I think it really has that much storage

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.960 
I think it really has that much storage
on<00:05:41.150> it<00:05:41.800> but<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:42.860> like<00:05:43.070> it<00:05:43.190> I<00:05:43.250> like<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:43.460> styling

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
on it but I like it I like the styling

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.280 
on it but I like it I like the styling
of<00:05:44.120> it<00:05:44.150> I<00:05:44.300> think<00:05:44.420> it's<00:05:44.600> a<00:05:44.660> pretty<00:05:44.810> neat<00:05:45.020> looking

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
of it I think it's a pretty neat looking

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.379
