commentary<00:00:05.430> today<00:00:05.640> mainly<00:00:06.029> because<00:00:06.299> it's<00:00:06.810> a

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
commentary today mainly because it's a

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.750 
commentary today mainly because it's a
little<00:00:07.140> easier<00:00:07.460> basically<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.610> we're<00:00:08.730> doing

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
little easier basically what we're doing

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.640 
little easier basically what we're doing
is<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.120> back<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.540> time<00:00:09.719> glitch<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.320> if<00:00:10.500> you'll

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
is a back in time glitch and if you'll

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.230 
is a back in time glitch and if you'll
notice<00:00:10.710> if<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.280> have<00:00:11.610> your<00:00:11.759> short<00:00:12.059> horizontal

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
notice if you have your short horizontal

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.599 
notice if you have your short horizontal
here<00:00:13.130> it's<00:00:14.130> easy<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.670> show<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:16.010> know<00:00:17.010> exactly

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
here it's easy to show like know exactly

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.170 
here it's easy to show like know exactly
when<00:00:17.820> you're<00:00:18.029> going<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.300> be<00:00:18.420> doing<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.869> trick

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
when you're going to be doing this trick

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.179 
when you're going to be doing this trick
you<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.539> over<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.199> any<00:00:22.560> endless

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
you can do this over like any endless

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.320 
you can do this over like any endless
void<00:00:23.460> over<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.859> born<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.010> bridge<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.430> good<00:00:26.640> but

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
void over the born on bridge is good but

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.150 
void over the born on bridge is good but
basically<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.140> warps<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> title

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
basically this warps you to the title

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.830 
basically this warps you to the title
screen<00:00:29.310> where<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.760> run<00:00:30.060> around<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.630> such

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
screen where you can run around and such

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.000 
screen where you can run around and such
like<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.560> leads<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.980> different<00:00:32.510> like

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
like that this leads to a different like

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.940 
like that this leads to a different like
batch<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.460> glitches<00:00:36.079> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.260> like<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> basic

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
batch of glitches this is like the basic

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
batch of glitches this is like the basic
there's<00:00:38.190> back<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.640> time<00:00:38.850> back<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.329> time

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
there's back in time back in time

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.630 
there's back in time back in time
equipped<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.829> also<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> back<00:00:41.489> in

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
equipped and you can also have a back in

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.959 
equipped and you can also have a back in
time<00:00:41.790> game<00:00:42.059> file<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.379> save<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:44.250> five

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
time game file this can save like five

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.029 
time game file this can save like five
or<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.629> minutes<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.289> speed<00:00:46.530> run<00:00:46.710> which<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
or so minutes and a speed run which is

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.069 
or so minutes and a speed run which is
quite<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.520> time<00:00:47.809> for<00:00:48.809> speedran<00:00:51.079> when

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
quite a lot of time for speedran when

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.350 
quite a lot of time for speedran when
you<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.559> back<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.829> time<00:00:53.160> before<00:00:53.550> getting<00:00:54.210> any

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you do back in time before getting any

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.220 
you do back in time before getting any
items<00:00:55.879> or<00:00:56.879> basically<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> game<00:00:57.660> does<00:00:57.870> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
items or basically what the game does is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.569 
items or basically what the game does is
it<00:00:58.859> when<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.640> start<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> game<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:02.370> you

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
it when you start up the game like you

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.609 
it when you start up the game like you
see<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> opening<00:01:03.180> cutscene<00:01:03.390> that's<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.290> dummy

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
see the opening cutscene that's a dummy

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.520 
see the opening cutscene that's a dummy
game<00:01:05.040> file<00:01:05.430> used<00:01:05.880> by<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.689> real<00:01:06.900> time<00:01:07.110> cutscene

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
game file used by the real time cutscene

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.870 
game file used by the real time cutscene
engine<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.010> plays<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> opening<00:01:08.670> sequence

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
engine that plays the opening sequence

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.320 
engine that plays the opening sequence
um<00:01:10.220> when<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.250> back<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.610> time<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.970> performed

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
um when the back in time is performed

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
um when the back in time is performed
successfully<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.080> dummy<00:01:13.650> file<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.520> loaded

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
successfully the dummy file is loaded

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.630 
successfully the dummy file is loaded
when<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> game<00:01:15.420> attempts<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> respond<00:01:16.320> link

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
when the game attempts to respond link

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.980 
when the game attempts to respond link
thus<00:01:17.640> why<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.030> don't<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.420> any<00:01:18.570> items<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
thus why you don't have any items you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.800 
thus why you don't have any items you
just<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> organ<00:01:19.860> sword<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:23.810> pot

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
just have the organ sword and the pot

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.280 
just have the organ sword and the pot
the<00:01:24.960> shield<00:01:25.729> so<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.600> some<00:01:27.689> reason<00:01:27.720> opponent

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the shield so for some reason opponent

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
the shield so for some reason opponent
doesn't<00:01:28.939> respond<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.420> tune<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:32.250> horse<00:01:33.090> grass

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
doesn't respond or tune the horse grass

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.870 
doesn't respond or tune the horse grass
but<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.930> still<00:01:34.229> read<00:01:34.439> her<00:01:34.590> around<00:01:34.880> this

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
but you can still read her around this

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.280 
but you can still read her around this
area<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.390> quite<00:01:36.570> large<00:01:37.200> for

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
area is quite large for

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.720 
area is quite large for
a<00:01:39.910> dummy<00:01:40.910> area<00:01:41.450> basically<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:42.740> extends<00:01:43.660> to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
a dummy area basically it extends to

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.260 
a dummy area basically it extends to
quite<00:01:46.730> a<00:01:46.760> long<00:01:46.970> way<00:01:47.240> outside<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.080> hydrofoil

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
quite a long way outside of a hydrofoil

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.290 
quite a long way outside of a hydrofoil
you<00:01:50.270> can<00:01:50.480> this<00:01:51.350> will<00:01:51.530> be<00:01:51.620> showing<00:01:51.830> like<00:01:52.370> just<00:01:53.000> a

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
you can this will be showing like just a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.530 
you can this will be showing like just a
bunch<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.870> your<00:01:54.170> stuff<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.650> can<00:01:54.800> do<00:01:54.980> like

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
bunch of your stuff you can do like

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.270 
bunch of your stuff you can do like
floating<00:01:56.540> over<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.930> ground<00:01:57.170> going<00:01:58.130> out<00:01:58.250> of

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
floating over the ground going out of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.969 
floating over the ground going out of
bounds<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.760> such<00:01:58.910> like<00:01:58.940> that<00:02:02.500> how<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.560> do<00:02:03.770> this

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
bounds and such like that how to do this

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.960 
bounds and such like that how to do this
as<00:02:04.220> you<00:02:04.310> go<00:02:04.460> over<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.000> endless<00:02:05.360> void<00:02:06.940> do<00:02:07.940> a

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
as you go over and the endless void do a

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.850 
as you go over and the endless void do a
jump<00:02:08.450> attack<00:02:08.570> and<00:02:09.020> if<00:02:09.110> your<00:02:09.259> sword<00:02:09.590> as

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
jump attack and if your sword as

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.790 
jump attack and if your sword as
horizontal<00:02:10.280> with<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.030> screen<00:02:11.390> then<00:02:12.110> you'll

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
horizontal with the screen then you'll

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.710 
horizontal with the screen then you'll
know<00:02:12.950> you've<00:02:13.130> done<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.459> right<00:02:13.600> what<00:02:14.600> you're

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
know you've done it right what you're

this<00:06:33.360> down<00:06:33.419> I<00:06:34.430> think<00:06:35.430> the<00:06:35.490> controllers<00:06:35.970> are

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
this down I think the controllers are

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.390 
this down I think the controllers are
more<00:06:36.360> tolerable<00:06:37.050> you<00:06:37.560> can<00:06:37.740> do<00:06:37.860> spin<00:06:38.070> attacks

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
more tolerable you can do spin attacks

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.159 
more tolerable you can do spin attacks
