00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.899
 a curiosity of human beings is that we live in huge and sophisticated 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.960
 societies with large building complexes we call that 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.960
 civilization 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.710
 for this reason many people detest the idea that everything has been started 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.710
 by the aliens 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.559
 in the center of the theory is the suggestion that the other beings 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:31.099
 planet they built the first big buildings in the remote past 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 and that's fine except that believers have difficulties 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.720
 to explain why the aliens did all this 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.720
 They would be trying to impress us 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.580
 not according to what this man says here we have him hiding 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.830
 in st-onge years 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.750
 according to scientists these facts was built three thousand years before 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.580
 Christ 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.240
 it is believed that the five-ton stones were dragged 274 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.340
 miles by the ancient British to venerate the sun which is very 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.170
 interesting 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.770
 but it is not interesting enough to dedicate who presides the signature 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.939
 that is a census could be a supply station for 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:13.820
 gas 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.260
 for the aliens of antiquity he proposed this interesting theory then 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.440
 that he discovered what he claims are mysterious energy lines he believes that 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.340
 the earth is covered by these invisible lines of a strange network 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.079
 and if all this sounds unlikely 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.620
 at least it has a good name 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.350
 maya energetic world 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.560
 Mayan world proposal is an intelligent geometric pattern of the earth and 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.810
 of your energies 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.280
 owen a ball of sunlight hits the earth and wraps it like a ball of 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.380
 linear energies thus generating the energy grid 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.830
 As can be supposed, no scientist believes in this mesh with the energy that 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.900
 apparently contains 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.260
 according to sanchez and the rest this is because they are too skeptical 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.760
 for convenience the aliens nevertheless knew about this mesh of 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.009
 energy and marked it 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.399
 obviously building monuments at the key intersections of the mesh 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.750
 portuense locating megalithic monuments along the Maya 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.940
 the UFOs could then take the energy they needed from it danced 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.650
 and even in some points like for example st-onge plugged in from behind the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.320
 spacecraft could face on these energy points still not 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.099
 I am reading energy from these points to replenish Christmas 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.980
 being that does not explain why these gigantic service stations 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.139
 they were built with large blocks of stone 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.249
 and we could use that energy today 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.889
 of course not 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.979
 of inditex pleads why not 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:56.559
 but I know that for many people it can be difficult to imagine this mesh 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.289
 energetic around the planet although it is quite similar to a track of 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.219
 careers 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.029
 but they have made this race track we have a geometric formation of 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.009
 she that is totally interconnected pd 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.259
 and the vehicles run along this greater energy 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:17.709
 but if a single stretch of this race track is disconnected voice is bankrupt 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.499
 No more vehicles will run out of energy and can no longer travel 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:24.609
 none of its sections 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.790
 bad thing 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.249
 because ancient monuments like this a census 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.969
 they are nothing but ruins and the world energy maya would be broken 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.809
 there is no free energy then but do not believe that the aliens used the 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:39.459
 monuments just to feed on energy the other many of the 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.529
 megalithic monuments including the pyramids and huston films could be 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.129
 antennas used by UFOs 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.889
 how about this before it was not just a Monday meeting place maybe 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.790
 the ancient aliens used it to call home 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.009
 one 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.009
 they are all from another planet 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.469
 for the house or not 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.469
 where did these aliens from antiquity come from 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.909
 a man who should know 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.909
 the excess up 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.039
 vips 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.039
 the alien intelligence search group in it 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.229
 is a scientific team has been observed constellations for 20 years 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.319
 trying to pick up radio signals from any form of extraterrestrial life 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.659
 it turns out that many scientists believe that life can exist in some other 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:34.250
 place 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.130
 apart from the earth after all the universe hosts trillions and trillions 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.599
 of stars 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.099
 ap 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.329
 sergio strack has dedicated his life to being the first to prove it 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.419
 and the universe is huge and most of the stars have planets that's why 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.869
 there must be other worlds as fit for life as the earth 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:00.869
 question is whether life arose already on those planets 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.680
 ap as 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.279
 Moscow 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.180
 do not 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.400
 he knows how to find those alien if there were any or how to look for them, not the 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.160
 we have found yet but we can look for radio signals that can 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.290
 come from other worlds and for that we build these devices 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.139
 so far not even a whisper has been heard from another galaxy 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.020
 so you can not see where the aliens live 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:37.699
 and it is not going to stop until it receives the signal there is I think there is great passivity 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.479
 for discovering that this planet is not the only one even within our system 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.349
 solar in which some form of biology has developed my presumption 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.349
 is that we will find a signal from another world 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:53.520
 if science can not sign 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.700
 where the aliens live and where they could have come from 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:00.309
 it does not mean that there are no suggestions 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.790
 the UFO believers have some safest and favorite places 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.669
 attention these are the three most likely homes of the aliens in the 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.669
 antiquity 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.949
 in third place is the star of the dog sirius crazy place ilo with men 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:25.500
 is the closest star to the solar system are many hieroglyphics 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:28.319
 Egyptian and is mixed with folklore 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.199
 as in this African tribe in which there is an ancient myth that speaks of 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:37.860
 gods with frogs face that came from space in a spiral ship of 6 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.090
 he decided and they taught them sacred rituals 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.840
 were these visitors our alien astronauts or just one 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.240
 mission
