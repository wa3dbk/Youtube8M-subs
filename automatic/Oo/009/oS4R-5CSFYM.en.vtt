00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.790 
you know come to think of the theme you
wonder<00:04:59.200> why<00:04:59.290> they<00:04:59.440> weren't<00:04:59.620> in<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.740> original

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
wonder why they weren't in the original

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.370 
wonder why they weren't in the original
deck<00:05:00.370> but<00:05:00.580> hey<00:05:00.730> angels<00:05:01.330> are<00:05:01.450> here<00:05:01.600> now<00:05:01.810> they

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
deck but hey angels are here now they

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.260 
deck but hey angels are here now they
can<00:05:02.590> move<00:05:02.740> through<00:05:02.800> other<00:05:03.100> cards<00:05:03.610> because

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
can move through other cards because

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.960 
can move through other cards because
they<00:05:04.390> can<00:05:04.540> fly<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.830> cavalry<00:05:06.340> Knights<00:05:06.640> and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
they can fly and the cavalry Knights and

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.660 
they can fly and the cavalry Knights and
instead<00:05:07.450> of<00:05:07.600> moving<00:05:07.990> them<00:05:08.560> normally<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.520> can

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
instead of moving them normally you can

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.910 
instead of moving them normally you can
move<00:05:09.760> them<00:05:09.880> up<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.000> seven<00:05:10.420> clear<00:05:10.690> spaces<00:05:11.680> away

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
move them up to seven clear spaces away

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.690 
move them up to seven clear spaces away
so<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.870> Vanguard<00:05:13.870> now<00:05:14.110> moves<00:05:14.500> up<00:05:14.740> in<00:05:14.920> a<00:05:14.950> speed

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
so the Vanguard now moves up in a speed

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.760 
so the Vanguard now moves up in a speed
