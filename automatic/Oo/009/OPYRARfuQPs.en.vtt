we're<00:00:04.710> going<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.190> introduce<00:00:05.520> today<00:00:06.649> iPad<00:00:07.649> 2

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
we're going to introduce today iPad 2

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:17.269 
we're going to introduce today iPad 2
the<00:00:08.970> second<00:00:09.450> generation<00:00:09.840> iPad<00:00:14.540> so<00:00:16.160> what<00:00:17.160> is

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
the second generation iPad so what is

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.429 
the second generation iPad so what is
iPad<00:00:17.699> 2<00:00:17.940> what<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.449> learned<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.260> we

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
iPad 2 what have we learned what can we

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.320 
iPad 2 what have we learned what can we
improve<00:00:20.029> well<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:22.020> an<00:00:22.230> all-new<00:00:22.949> design<00:00:23.330> it

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
improve well it is an all-new design it

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.620 
improve well it is an all-new design it
is<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> tweak<00:00:25.170> design<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:26.039> not<00:00:26.160> got

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
is not a tweak design it's not got

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.029 
is not a tweak design it's not got
marginal<00:00:27.630> improvements<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.439> completely

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
marginal improvements it's a completely

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.410 
marginal improvements it's a completely
new<00:00:29.849> design<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:31.769> first<00:00:32.040> thing<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.579> it's

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
new design and the first thing is it's

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.639 
new design and the first thing is it's
dramatically<00:00:34.260> faster<00:00:35.809> we<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> new<00:00:37.320> chip

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
dramatically faster we have a new chip

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.240 
dramatically faster we have a new chip
we<00:00:38.460> call<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:39.110> 5-hour<00:00:40.110> chip<00:00:40.469> wizards<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:41.040> come

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
we call a 5-hour chip wizards have come

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.020 
we call a 5-hour chip wizards have come
up<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.649> it's<00:00:43.649> great<00:00:44.070> its

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
up with this and it's great its

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.990 
up with this and it's great its
dual-core<00:00:45.629> processors<00:00:46.760> alright<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
dual-core processors alright to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.479 
dual-core processors alright to
processors<00:00:48.660> inside<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
processors inside and so we get up to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.350 
processors inside and so we get up to
twice<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.120> fast<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.780> CPU<00:00:52.620> performance<00:00:53.360> but

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
twice as fast on CPU performance but

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.299 
twice as fast on CPU performance but
we've<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:55.140> gone<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
we've really gone all out on the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.660 
we've really gone all out on the
graphics<00:00:56.820> performance<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:58.649> nine<00:00:59.010> times

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
graphics performance up to nine times

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.049 
graphics performance up to nine times
faster<00:01:00.329> graphics<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:02.309> graphics<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.910> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
faster graphics the graphics on this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.270 
faster graphics the graphics on this
thing<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.420> wonderful<00:01:05.930> same<00:01:06.930> low<00:01:07.200> power<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.799> a4

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
thing are wonderful same low power as a4

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.390 
thing are wonderful same low power as a4
we<00:01:09.119> don't<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> give<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.840> any<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
we don't want to give up any of that

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.780 
we don't want to give up any of that
legendary<00:01:11.400> battery<00:01:11.909> life<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:13.460> even<00:01:14.460> though

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
legendary battery life and even though

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
legendary battery life and even though
others<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.360> starting<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> ship<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.530> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
others are starting to ship I think this

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.350 
others are starting to ship I think this
is<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> first<00:01:17.460> dual-core

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
is going to be the first dual-core

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.940 
is going to be the first dual-core
tablet<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.960> ship<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.350> volume<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.820> 5<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
tablet to ship in volume so a 5 is a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
tablet to ship in volume so a 5 is a
really<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> quite<00:01:23.610> an<00:01:23.759> achievement<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
really a quite an achievement and is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
really a quite an achievement and is
going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> give<00:01:25.200> us<00:01:25.320> something<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
going to give us something that's up to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.480 
going to give us something that's up to
twice<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.880> fast<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.659> CPU<00:01:28.080> performance<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.189> 9

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
twice as fast on CPU performance up to 9

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.149 
twice as fast on CPU performance up to 9
times<00:01:29.820> faster<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.600> graphics<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.920> first

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
times faster on graphics and the first

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.069 
times faster on graphics and the first
iPad<00:01:32.640> was<00:01:33.000> no<00:01:33.180> slouch<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.549> lot<00:01:36.299> faster<00:01:36.840> with

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
iPad was no slouch so a lot faster with

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.920 
iPad was no slouch so a lot faster with
a<00:01:37.229> 5<00:01:38.479> second<00:01:39.860> we've<00:01:40.860> built<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:42.420> cameras

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
a 5 second we've built in some cameras

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.670 
a 5 second we've built in some cameras
for<00:01:43.770> video<00:01:44.299> we've<00:01:45.299> got<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> rear<00:01:45.869> camera<00:01:45.899> out

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
for video we've got a rear camera out

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.700 
for video we've got a rear camera out
the<00:01:46.979> back<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.689> we've<00:01:48.689> got<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> front<00:01:49.229> facing

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the back and we've got a front facing

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.660 
the back and we've got a front facing
camera<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.060> front<00:01:52.280> we'll<00:01:53.280> talk<00:01:53.490> more

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
camera out the front we'll talk more

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.749 
camera out the front we'll talk more
about<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> few<00:01:54.420> minutes<00:01:55.490> we've<00:01:56.490> also

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
about that in a few minutes we've also

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.719 
about that in a few minutes we've also
built<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.290> gyroscope<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.549> in

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
built in the gyroscope that we have in

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.289 
built in the gyroscope that we have in
the<00:01:59.820> iPhone<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.770> iPod<00:02:01.770> touch

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.470 

now<00:02:06.530> having<00:02:07.530> built<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.250> all<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.000> stuff

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
now having built in all of this stuff

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.470 

one<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.319> most<00:02:12.610> startling<00:02:13.610> things<00:02:14.090> about

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
one of the most startling things about

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.790 
one of the most startling things about
the<00:02:14.660> iPad<00:02:15.110> 2<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.940> dramatically<00:02:17.900> thinner

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
the iPad 2 is it is dramatically thinner

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.880 
the iPad 2 is it is dramatically thinner
not<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.830> little<00:02:22.250> bit<00:02:22.430> thinner<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:23.260> third<00:02:24.260> thinner

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
not a little bit thinner a third thinner

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.740 
not a little bit thinner a third thinner
33%<00:02:27.890> thinner<00:02:28.480> that's<00:02:29.480> what<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.810> looks<00:02:29.990> like<00:02:31.750> so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
33% thinner that's what it looks like so

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.360 
33% thinner that's what it looks like so
if<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.020> look<00:02:33.260> at<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.500> numbers<00:02:36.100> when<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:37.220> look

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
if you look at the numbers when you look

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.570 
if you look at the numbers when you look
at<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.610> numbers<00:02:38.290> go<00:02:39.290> on<00:02:39.380> from<00:02:39.620> thirteen<00:02:40.190> point

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
at the numbers go on from thirteen point

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.729 
at the numbers go on from thirteen point
four<00:02:40.850> millimeters<00:02:41.120> down<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.900> eight<00:02:42.140> point

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
four millimeters down to eight point

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.970 
four millimeters down to eight point
eight<00:02:42.920> millimeters<00:02:43.850> thick<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.980> dramatic

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
eight millimeters thick it's dramatic

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.150 
eight millimeters thick it's dramatic
and<00:02:46.510> for<00:02:47.510> those<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.350> iPhone

again that's over a month of standby so

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.850 
again that's over a month of standby so
ten<00:04:49.460> hours<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:49.850> battery<00:04:50.030> life<00:04:50.390> again<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> lot<00:04:51.710> of

ten hours of battery life again a lot of
these<00:04:51.950> other<00:04:52.190> guys<00:04:52.430> are<00:04:52.640> coming<00:04:52.940> out<00:04:53.060> with

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.520 
tried and tested by every reviewer iPads
get<00:05:01.040> 10<00:05:01.370> hours<00:05:01.730> of<00:05:01.760> battery<00:05:01.880> life<00:05:02.260> so<00:05:03.260> we're

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
get 10 hours of battery life so we're

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.640 
get 10 hours of battery life so we're
really<00:05:03.740> happy<00:05:04.130> to<00:05:04.310> keep<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.380> never<00:05:06.380> let

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
really happy to keep that and never let

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.650 
really happy to keep that and never let
that<00:05:06.830> go<00:05:08.860> now<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.070> addition<00:05:10.400> to<00:05:10.670> preserving

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
that go now in addition to preserving

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.280 
that go now in addition to preserving
the<00:05:11.840> battery<00:05:12.320> life<00:05:13.360> when<00:05:14.360> we<00:05:14.540> add<00:05:14.780> all<00:05:15.080> this

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
the battery life when we add all this

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.860 
the battery life when we add all this
stuff<00:05:15.730> we've<00:05:16.730> also<00:05:17.210> preserved<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:18.680> price<00:05:19.070> and

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
stuff we've also preserved the price and

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.409 
stuff we've also preserved the price and
so<00:05:20.870> we're<00:05:21.440> going<00:05:21.620> to<00:05:21.710> keep<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.190> same<00:05:22.580> exact

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
so we're going to keep the same exact

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.020 
so we're going to keep the same exact
prices<00:05:24.160> starting<00:05:25.160> at<00:05:25.370> just<00:05:25.400> $4.99<00:05:27.610> same<00:05:28.610> exact
