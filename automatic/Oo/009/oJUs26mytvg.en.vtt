to demonstrate just how you can make
more<00:00:25.529> shots<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.369> all<00:00:27.330> kinds<00:00:27.900> by<00:00:28.590> utilizing<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
more shots of all kinds by utilizing the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.830 
more shots of all kinds by utilizing the
revolutionary<00:00:30.449> oven<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.940> most<00:00:32.940> shots<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.630> you

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
revolutionary oven in most shots are you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.410 
revolutionary oven in most shots are you
the<00:00:33.989> short<00:00:34.350> or<00:00:34.590> long<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.160> therefore<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> up

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the short or long and therefore the up

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.440 
the short or long and therefore the up
and<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.719> helps<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.770> develop<00:00:38.210> consistency<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and in helps to develop consistency and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.190 
and in helps to develop consistency and
the<00:00:39.510> two<00:00:40.500> most<00:00:41.040> critical<00:00:41.760> components<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the two most critical components of the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.940 
the two most critical components of the
shop<00:00:43.440> are<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.690> distance<00:00:45.690> here's<00:00:46.440> why<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
shop are and distance here's why this is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.459 
shop are and distance here's why this is
what<00:00:47.250> helped<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.450> set<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.870> thing<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.260> shoot

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
what helped you set this thing and shoot

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.690 
what helped you set this thing and shoot
through<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.770> thing<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> shooter

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
through this thing and the shooter

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.860 
through this thing and the shooter
learns<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.500> proper<00:00:53.010> muscle<00:00:53.340> memory<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.629> shoot

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
learns the proper muscle memory to shoot

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.470 
learns the proper muscle memory to shoot
that<00:00:55.020> ball<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:56.039> by<00:00:56.340> having<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.910> shoot<00:00:57.149> through

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that ball so by having to shoot through

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.139 
that ball so by having to shoot through
the<00:00:57.539> target<00:00:58.440> area<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> top<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.850> oven

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the target area at the top of the oven

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.950 
the target area at the top of the oven
end<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:01.020> forces<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.039> shoot<00:01:03.000> correctly<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
end it forces you to shoot correctly and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.980 
end it forces you to shoot correctly and
therefore<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:05.519> times<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.000> shoot<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
therefore the more times you shoot the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
therefore the more times you shoot the
better<00:01:07.200> chance<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.310> develop<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
better chance you have to develop a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.260 
better chance you have to develop a
consistent

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
consistent

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.010

shooter is consistently making shots I

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.749 
shooter is consistently making shots I
think<00:01:32.049> any<00:01:32.200> shooter<00:01:32.679> that<00:01:32.860> has<00:01:33.069> enough<00:01:33.459> power

think any shooter that has enough power

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.850 
think any shooter that has enough power
to<00:01:34.179> get<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.630> ball<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.170> rim<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:35.709> we
