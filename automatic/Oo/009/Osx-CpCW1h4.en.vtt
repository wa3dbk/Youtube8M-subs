to<00:00:07.319> make<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> racecar<00:00:07.980> go<00:00:08.160> fast<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.940> need<00:00:09.120> lots

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
to make a racecar go fast you need lots

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.900 
to make a racecar go fast you need lots
of<00:00:09.630> grip<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.110> for<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:11.010> need<00:00:11.040> good<00:00:11.639> tires

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
of grip and for that you need good tires

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.120 
of grip and for that you need good tires
and<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.420> good<00:00:12.570> suspension<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.799> keep<00:00:13.950> those

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
and a good suspension and to keep those

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.499 
and a good suspension and to keep those
both<00:00:14.340> working<00:00:14.759> well<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.120> need<00:00:15.299> good

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
both working well you need good

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.870 
both working well you need good
suspension<00:00:16.080> geometry<00:00:16.340> now<00:00:17.340> when<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.580> lower<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
suspension geometry now when you lower a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.700 
suspension geometry now when you lower a
car<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.570> actually<00:00:18.930> start<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.140> hurt<00:00:19.470> that

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
car you actually start to hurt that

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.310 
car you actually start to hurt that
geometry<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.699> fix<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.119> white<00:00:22.109> line

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
geometry and to fix that white line

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.490 
geometry and to fix that white line
makes<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:23.000> hump<00:00:24.000> steer<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.779> roll<00:00:25.289> center

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
makes this hump steer and roll center

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.210 
makes this hump steer and roll center
correction<00:00:25.980> kit<00:00:26.930> starting<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.349> lower

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
correction kit starting with this lower

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.910 
correction kit starting with this lower
control<00:00:29.580> arm<00:00:29.849> ball<00:00:30.750> joint<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.439> basically

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
control arm ball joint which basically

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.180 
control arm ball joint which basically
acts<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> shim<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.800> raises<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> control

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
acts as a shim and raises the control

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.360 
acts as a shim and raises the control
arm<00:00:35.370> back<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.630> correct<00:00:36.899> position

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
arm back up into the correct position

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.920 
arm back up into the correct position
what<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.520> does<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.850> prevent<00:00:38.969> too<00:00:39.540> much<00:00:39.719> body

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
what that does is prevent too much body

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.420 
what that does is prevent too much body
roll<00:00:40.050> believe<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.070> lower<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
roll believe it or not when you lower a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.400 
roll believe it or not when you lower a
car<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> geometries<00:00:42.420> get<00:00:42.570> bad<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.230> get

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
car and the geometries get bad you get

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.959 
car and the geometries get bad you get
more<00:00:43.620> body<00:00:43.920> roll<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.340> less<00:00:44.520> body<00:00:44.760> roll

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
more body roll not less body roll

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.319 
more body roll not less body roll
so<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.690> fix<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> tough<00:00:46.170> problem<00:00:47.329> vitals

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so this fix is tough problem vitals

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.790 
so this fix is tough problem vitals
obviously<00:00:48.750> bad<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.590> you're

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
obviously bad because you're

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.939 
obviously bad because you're
destabilizing<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> car<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.059> reducing<00:00:51.420> grip

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
destabilizing the car and reducing grip

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
destabilizing the car and reducing grip
these<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.280> tie<00:00:53.730> rods<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.210> correct<00:00:54.539> bump<00:00:54.840> steer

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
these are tie rods to correct bump steer

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.139 
these are tie rods to correct bump steer
and<00:00:55.320> again<00:00:56.100> they're<00:00:56.309> using<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.699> ball<00:00:56.879> joint

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and again they're using a ball joint

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.869 
and again they're using a ball joint
that<00:00:57.270> puts<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.010> steering<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.250> angle<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.760> this

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that puts the steering the angle of this

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.720 
that puts the steering the angle of this
arm<00:01:00.090> back<00:01:00.329> into<00:01:00.629> factory<00:01:01.440> spec<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
arm back into factory spec what that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.690 
arm back into factory spec what that
does<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.149> dialogue<00:01:04.080> bump<00:01:04.470> steer<00:01:04.650> bump<00:01:05.549> steer

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
does is dialogue bump steer bump steer

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.370 
does is dialogue bump steer bump steer
happens<00:01:06.090> when<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.659> suspension<00:01:06.990> compresses

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
happens when the suspension compresses

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920 
happens when the suspension compresses
the<00:01:07.799> tire<00:01:08.010> wants<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.369> turn<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.210> tends<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the tire wants to turn out that tends to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.140 
the tire wants to turn out that tends to
cross<00:01:10.080> understeer<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:11.610> only<00:01:11.700> happening<00:01:12.000> on

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
cross understeer it's only happening on

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
cross understeer it's only happening on
the<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.390> side<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> car<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.530> makes<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the one side of the car so it makes the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.260 
the one side of the car so it makes the
car<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.400> less<00:01:14.640> stable

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
car a less stable

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.719 
car a less stable
so<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.990> corrects<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.890> less<00:01:17.250> bump<00:01:17.520> speed

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so this corrects that so less bump speed

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.140 
so this corrects that so less bump speed
let's<00:01:18.150> bump<00:01:18.420> steer<00:01:18.659> less<00:01:19.409> body<00:01:19.680> roll<00:01:19.770> all<00:01:20.729> good

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
let's bump steer less body roll all good

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
let's bump steer less body roll all good
more<00:01:21.630> grip<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.740> well<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.009> might<00:01:23.189> say

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
more grip or as well I might say

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.249 
more grip or as well I might say

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.420 
up and by stiffening everything up
you've<00:01:47.970> reduced<00:01:48.810> movement<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.700> this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
you've reduced movement in all of this

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.550 
you've reduced movement in all of this
and<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.180> gives<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.570> more<00:01:52.990> consistent

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
and that gives you more consistent

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.590 
and that gives you more consistent
performance<00:01:53.740> from<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.520> tire<00:01:54.700> it's<00:01:54.940> it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
performance from the tire it's it's

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.990 
performance from the tire it's it's
really<00:01:55.810> not<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:56.350> complicated<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.220> these

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
really not that complicated and these

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.900 
really not that complicated and these
are<00:01:58.120> quite<00:01:58.900> a<00:01:59.170> bit<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.440> work<00:01:59.680> to<00:01:59.710> to<00:02:00.340> install<00:02:00.700> to

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
are quite a bit of work to to install to

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.640 
are quite a bit of work to to install to
be<00:02:01.000> honest<00:02:01.270> we<00:02:01.390> have<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:01.570> press<00:02:01.810> them<00:02:02.020> in<00:02:02.140> so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
be honest we have to press them in so
