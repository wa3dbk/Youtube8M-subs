00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.800
 a tire is not eternal we all know 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.989
 he suffers the incessant disappointment attack around after lap 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.060
 think of the eraser 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.749
 + is used as quickly as wear 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:27.059
 this shows a fundamental law of tibet scrolling minds jenny 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.059
 wear 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.620
 during use the tires are subject to sliding 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.080
 this can only happen by contact with the road as desired 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.380
 to demonstrate 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.970
 already you will tell me that the rubber blocks that succeed one another in the area of 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.250
 contact with the bulldozer tracks do not slide on the road 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.030
 but when leaving the contact area an item is gradually discharged from the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.260
 crushing weight 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.900
 because of its elastic properties the dream assumes its form 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.980
 initially up then slides for a fraction of a second this 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.360
 slight rubbing is sufficient to generate wear 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.690
 bad weather this explains the wear on a tire that is not subject to 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.500
 stresses such as a tire that runs freely on one 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.350
 straight line if in fact the tire is subjected to stresses such as the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.040
 acceleration and braking hollister chat 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.630
 Lust is amplified and as you can see under stress the scholars are putting themselves 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.730
 more and more therefore what was foreseeable atm 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.320
 when the stress can no longer be compensated by the bending i 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.810
 blocks slip on the ground and when slipping it slips and slips 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.460
 of the order of a millimeter may seem small but must be kept 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.230
 present that this happens on each of the 25 million rotations that one 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.560
 tire with traveling for 50 thousand kilometers 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.640
 we are considering the average life of a tire cake are numerous factors 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.430
 that affect the sea 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.350
 weather conditions night game - 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.020
 for example prefecture pneumatic measurements 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.790
 increases if I suspect that the road is dry 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.110
 because there is more grip 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.750
 generally the nature of the road surface conditions largely sure 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.729
 other vehicle-related criteria must also be taken into consideration 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.769
 the power 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.859
 the regulation of parallelism even if I have a strong influence 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.439
 to note that the driving wheels being subjected to a greater effort yes 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.749
 they wear out more quickly similarly in identical conditions wheels of diameter 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.309
 smaller that wear out faster 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:36.689
 because the contents turn to cover the same distance the parameters related to ab 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.489
 utilization are determined 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.459
 a winding mountain road generates more wear than a straight road 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.249
 flat path that glitters constantly 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.619
 driving style is the key factor 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:52.419
 wear speed can cut from 1 to 10 between a normal drive and a crisis 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.590
 finally the quality of the tires and their maintenance are important for the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.839
 their life span 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.309
 un-corrected pressure is a cause of wear and racket 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.959
 generally the wear resistance of the tread depends directly on the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.620
 its composition 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.060
 reinforcing agents such as carbon black scilicet are incorporated in mine 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.370
 shoes without them which tires would last only a few hundred 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.329
 Pine tree 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.529
 moreover the wear resistance depends on the shape of the tire and its 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:26.339
 architecture 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.339
 as well as the design of the rubber blocks 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.959
 michelin and immaterial research in architecture and sculptures by 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.160
 remarkable results in terms of duration of 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.169
 tire life 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:46.129
 michelin painting tires are 15% to 20% higher than the average 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.019
 of the 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.489
 40% discounts for camper tires 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.099
 clearly a better way to breed reports 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.879
 michelin offers its consumers tires that last longer 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.599
 and therefore consume less raw materials 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.949
 producing tires that last longer is another world to take care of 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.949
 environment 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.609
 Milan 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.139
 the best way to move forward
