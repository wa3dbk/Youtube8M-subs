00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
really liked Yakko because he was so

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.400 
really liked Yakko because he was so
spunky<00:04:18.800> but<00:04:19.340> he<00:04:19.550> was<00:04:19.640> also<00:04:19.790> cool<00:04:20.630> on<00:04:21.080> his<00:04:21.230> own

spunky but he was also cool on his own

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.190 
spunky but he was also cool on his own
cuz<00:04:21.680> usually<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.760> child<00:04:23.090> characters<00:04:23.900> can

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
cuz usually the the child characters can

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.950 
cuz usually the the child characters can
be<00:04:24.230> pretty<00:04:24.650> obnoxious<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.810> don't

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
be pretty obnoxious and I don't

necessarily<00:04:27.280> usually<00:04:28.280> like<00:04:28.700> them<00:04:28.970> because

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
necessarily usually like them because

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.880 
necessarily usually like them because
they're<00:04:29.690> kind<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.960> played<00:04:30.230> unrealistically

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
they're kind of played unrealistically

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.870
