00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
basically stuck there you keep spawning

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.799 
basically stuck there you keep spawning
there<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:50.879> once<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.449> turn<00:00:51.600> off<00:00:51.719> your

process again so as you can see here it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.709 
process again so as you can see here it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
is definitely added as an official

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.630 
is definitely added as an official
location<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.739> there's<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.370> thing<00:00:59.520> I'm

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
location now there's one thing I'm

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.099 
location now there's one thing I'm
wondering<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.359> see<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.809> checked

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
wondering as you can see it is checked

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.959 
wondering as you can see it is checked
off<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> says<00:01:01.890> North<00:01:02.100> Yankton<00:01:02.309> obviously

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
off and it says North Yankton obviously

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.670 
off and it says North Yankton obviously
and<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> top<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> list<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:04.619> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and it's at the top of the list now I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.109 
and it's at the top of the list now I
can<00:01:04.890> think<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.339> reasons<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> might

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
can think of two reasons that it might

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.609 
can think of two reasons that it might
be<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> top<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> list<00:01:06.869> either<00:01:07.140> because

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
be at the top of the list either because

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.870 
be at the top of the list either because
when<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.920> select<00:01:08.189> an<00:01:08.430> option<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
when you select an option it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.490 
when you select an option it
automatically<00:01:09.390> goes<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.110> top<00:01:10.320> so

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
automatically goes right to the top so

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380 
automatically goes right to the top so
you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you can see it or it's that that is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
you can see it or it's that that is
since<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> downloaded<00:01:13.740> item<00:01:14.070> it's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
since that is a downloaded item it's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
since that is a downloaded item it's
automatically<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> top<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:15.990> see

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
automatically at the top as you can see

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.539 
automatically at the top as you can see
the<00:01:16.290> rest<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> locations<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> Alamo

top of the list it's an add-on and it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.069 
top of the list it's an add-on and it's
not<00:01:29.009> an<00:01:29.159> official<00:01:29.549> part<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> same<00:01:30.479> map<00:01:30.840> of

not an official part of the same map of
you<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.860> rest<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.250> Los<00:01:32.430> Santos<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.540> my

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
you know the rest of Los Santos so in my

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.749 
you know the rest of Los Santos so in my
opinion<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.560> confirmation<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.729> a

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
opinion this is confirmation that a

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.850 
opinion this is confirmation that a
North<00:01:36.210> Yankton<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.110> DLC<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
North Yankton is going to be DLC in the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.100 
North Yankton is going to be DLC in the
future<00:01:38.159> however<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.090> i<00:01:39.329> guess<00:01:39.689> i<00:01:39.810> can't<00:01:39.990> say

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
future however it's i guess i can't say

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.080 
future however it's i guess i can't say
legitimate<00:01:40.770> legitimate<00:01:41.090> confirmation

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
legitimate legitimate confirmation

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.880 
legitimate legitimate confirmation
because<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.899> only<00:01:43.110> confirmed<00:01:43.590> once<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
because it is only confirmed once a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.219 
because it is only confirmed once a
rockstar<00:01:44.250> confirms<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> us<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.570> i<00:01:45.780> guess

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
rockstar confirms it to us so i guess

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.810 
rockstar confirms it to us so i guess
that<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> true<00:01:46.920> definition<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.430> confirmed

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that is the true definition of confirmed

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.550 
that is the true definition of confirmed
for<00:01:48.149> now<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.479> still<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.990> guess<00:01:49.170> technically

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
for now it's still I guess technically

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.710 
for now it's still I guess technically
speculation<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.399> my<00:01:50.520> opinion<00:01:50.640> that's<00:01:51.360> as

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
speculation but in my opinion that's as

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.050 
speculation but in my opinion that's as
good<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.990> proof<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.380> any<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.759> list<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
good a proof as any it is on the list of

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060 
good a proof as any it is on the list of
locations<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.500> things<00:01:55.680> there

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
locations and you can do things there

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.649 
locations and you can do things there
and<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.549> said<00:01:56.670> these<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:56.969> races<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.540> this

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
and like I said these are races in this

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.450 
and like I said these are races in this
case<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.110> I'm<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:58.740> excited<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.340> what

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
case so I'm really excited to see what

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.730 
case so I'm really excited to see what
Rockstar<00:01:59.729> decides<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.360> do<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.840> North

detailed and to fleshed out to only be

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.429 
detailed and to fleshed out to only be
using<00:02:05.969> two<00:02:06.270> missions<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.200> too

using two missions you know it's too
cool<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.770> an<00:02:07.860> area<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.759> not<00:02:08.910> allow<00:02:09.179> us<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.509> go

cool of an area to not allow us to go

online I
I really<00:02:10.770> hope<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> rocks<00:02:11.190> are<00:02:11.340> allows<00:02:11.790> us<00:02:11.970> to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
I really hope the rocks are allows us to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880 
I really hope the rocks are allows us to
do<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.780> that's<00:02:13.170> that's<00:02:13.500> what<00:02:13.770> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
do that and that's that's what it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.770 
do that and that's that's what it
appears<00:02:14.190> that's<00:02:14.310> going<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.580> be<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.630> is

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
