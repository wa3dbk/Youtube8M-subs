00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.780
 hey hello that as friends are my 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.790
 name is young and good 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.129
 I have not posted a video because 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.709
 my microphone had been damaged and it 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:13.139
 little I bought a pair of new hearing aids and 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.020
 well I will try to start to follow 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.150
 with the videos that I come to diego that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.100
 I bring you in this opportunity that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.020
 you know that many people in this 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.150
 channel are subscribed here by the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.010
 tutorials that I do dentice and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 universe online but unfortunately to 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.120
 from that good moment starting from 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.009
 not long ago that moment to stop 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.370
 play in de santis universe online ' 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.559
 because I do not like it at all lately 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.010
 with the latest updates that have 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.550
 taken out they have seemed to me like a garbage 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.230
 total first, I do not like that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.679
 take out a new power and every time 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.749
 take out a new power that is better than 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:56.249
 the others as for example to the dps 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:59.100
 so that it is better than the other powers 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.989
 I did not like that very much and that's what 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.780
 I was watching but I had not borrowed 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.280
 much attention since the dlc came out 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.310
 origin crisis is that when you see the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.829
 power this which 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.490
 then came the power this the heavenly 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.689
 and now the raje and that I do not like for 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.610
 nothing because we are seeing there that is 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.170
 a clear propaganda for you to go 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.710
 seven changes in power country ten 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.920
 dollars and you buy the fucking power of 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.810
 shit I also did not like this from the guru 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.310
 of the wef a master and I do not know if I am 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.640
 saying well and the truth is that I do not 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.920
 it matters but it's extremely boring 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.009
 and now the skill points that you 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.280
 you had, I guess you had 150 of 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.250
 150 scripts now it may be they are not going to 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.720
 reach radiant because it seemed to me that 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.729
 I was in Moors and maybe some 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.770
 obviously like it but I am 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.280
 leaving my opinion about it and I do not 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.039
 like anything besides this dlc 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.970
 that they got out of the Amazonian fury 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.610
 that looks like a fucking disgust it seems that already 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.189
 they finished the imagination to the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.899
 programmers or the designers or the 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.240
 Creative director, I do not know what the 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.600
 thing and how it is organized but they are 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.100
 the imagination has finished first it was 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.960
 with this lcd 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.450
 that the war of the lanterns that I 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.300
 it seemed a total disgust rights 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.270
 extremely boring good is a 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.970
 total shit and now with this ls that 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.440
 I thought they were going to bring rights or not 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.630
 matter that it does not bring rights but that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.960
 bring something new not something that is what 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.780
 same but disguised practically in 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.580
 The s the world war of the light it 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.830
 what they did was to take a metropolis and 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.530
 they put a more gray color and that is 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.180
 the new dlc a new city only 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.090
 they throw me in the same city 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.940
 he just left the environment or the weather 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.050
 different what the fuck is this good 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.370
 guys it's a shame the truth that at 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.320
 better something some will not like 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.560
 this and they will want to subscribe to the 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.530

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.660
 accompanying me in the videos are going to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.450
 laugh that I assure you 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.100
 even though my voice is like this all serious 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.740
 Well, I also have a little bit of humor, 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.600
 I know if you have seen my videos of the ucla 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.880

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.830
 I invite you to see it also my 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.840
 friends since some have already left 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.960
 and well I 'm not going to stay there when 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.630
 only the truth is that it's a shame because 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.180
 I have very nice memories of this 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.310
 game of the online universe when I started 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.560
 to play because I had a great time here 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.720
 before the game was really worth it 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.700
 but lately it is being seen that a 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.770
 they only care about the money 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.320
 fill your pockets for giving us 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.720
 shit me the truth is that I say 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.060

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.920
