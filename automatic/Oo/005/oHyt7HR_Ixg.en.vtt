00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.839 
probably have a minimum whole length of
the<00:02:17.879> server<00:02:18.390> five<00:02:18.810> seconds<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.590> infinity<00:02:20.370> R<00:02:20.610> P

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the server five seconds on infinity R P

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.650 
the server five seconds on infinity R P
so<00:02:21.019> I<00:02:22.019> said<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.380> five<00:02:22.590> seconds<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.390> take<00:02:24.390> all

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
so I said it's five seconds I take all

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.520 
so I said it's five seconds I take all
of<00:02:24.690> these

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
of these

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.670 
of these
just<00:02:26.190> because<00:02:26.579> done<00:02:26.819> by<00:02:27.030> -<00:02:27.380> now<00:02:28.380> you've<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.650> a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
just because done by - now you've got a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.670 
just because done by - now you've got a
set<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> four<00:02:29.340> digit<00:02:29.549> code<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.470> do

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
set a four digit code so if I just do

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.110 
set a four digit code so if I just do
eight<00:02:31.950> five<00:02:32.310> eight<00:02:32.670> five<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:35.910> place

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
eight five eight five now if we place

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.319 
eight five eight five now if we place
the<00:02:36.329> keypad<00:02:36.690> down<00:02:37.250> here<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.519> type<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.030> eight

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
the keypad down here the type is eight

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.960 
the keypad down here the type is eight
five<00:02:40.200> eight<00:02:40.940> five<00:02:42.110> okay<00:02:43.579> gone<00:02:44.579> through

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
five eight five okay gone through

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.660 
five eight five okay gone through
because<00:02:45.629> it's<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.049> toggle<00:02:46.260> door<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:47.099> won't<00:02:47.370> hold

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
because it's a toggle door it won't hold

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.479 
because it's a toggle door it won't hold
for<00:02:48.000> five<00:02:48.209> seconds<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:49.110> will<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.379> toggle<00:02:49.680> on

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
for five seconds it will just toggle on

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.089 
for five seconds it will just toggle on
and<00:02:51.500> off<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.739> take<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.069> code<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.579> gap

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
and off I take the code in the gap

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.089 
and off I take the code in the gap
of<00:02:55.310> support<00:02:55.999> because<00:02:56.359> I<00:02:56.480> did<00:02:56.659> it<00:02:56.689> Ross<00:02:57.099> eight

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
of support because I did it Ross eight

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.319 
of support because I did it Ross eight
five<00:02:58.549> eight<00:02:58.909> five<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.959> know<00:03:00.739> close<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.150> can

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
five eight five I know close so I can

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.770 
five eight five I know close so I can
have<00:03:02.480> one<00:03:02.749> outside<00:03:03.969> understood<00:03:04.969> get<00:03:05.329> in
