it all on a chalk line it's going to tip

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.720 
it all on a chalk line it's going to tip
and<00:00:52.470> you're<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> lose<00:00:52.949> your<00:00:53.510> level<00:00:54.510> site

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
and you're going to lose your level site

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.110

with<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.880> hanging<00:00:57.120> man<00:00:58.070> what<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.309> does<00:00:59.610> it's

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
with the hanging man what this does it's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.380 
with the hanging man what this does it's
technically<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.780> lap<00:01:01.079> age<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:02.730> recommended

strip off of a full sheet of sight in
this<00:02:16.990> case<00:02:17.260> I've<00:02:17.560> cut<00:02:17.920> my<00:02:18.190> inch<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.180> an<00:02:19.270> eighth

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
this case I've cut my inch and an eighth

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
an eighth of an inch this will prevent

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.610 
an eighth of an inch this will prevent
water<00:02:27.160> from<00:02:27.340> running<00:02:28.150> across<00:02:28.510> underneath<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
water from running across underneath it

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.180 
water from running across underneath it
will<00:02:29.860> create<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.310> drip<00:02:30.610> edge<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.500> i'm<00:02:32.830> going<00:02:33.100> to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
will create a drip edge so i'm going to

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.100 
will create a drip edge so i'm going to
put<00:02:33.460> three<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.820> these<00:02:33.970> up<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.780> i'm<00:02:34.930> going<00:02:35.050> to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
put three of these up and i'm going to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.020 
put three of these up and i'm going to
install<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.470> starter<00:02:35.980> strip<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.850> will

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
install a starter strip and that will

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.690 
install a starter strip and that will
give<00:02:37.240> me<00:02:37.390> my<00:02:37.600> basis<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.680> start<00:02:38.980> hanging<00:02:39.400> site

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
give me my basis to start hanging site

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.810 
give me my basis to start hanging site
so<00:02:40.480> I'll<00:02:40.540> down
