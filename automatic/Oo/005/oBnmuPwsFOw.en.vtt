and right where we want to end it we're

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.690 
and right where we want to end it we're
gonna<00:02:45.550> take<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.390> ends<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.430> loop<00:02:48.430> them

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
gonna take the ends and loop them

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.490 
gonna take the ends and loop them
through<00:02:49.270> like<00:02:50.020> this<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.750> take<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.170> ends

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
through like this so you take the ends

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.520 
through like this so you take the ends
and<00:02:56.620> put<00:02:56.769> them<00:02:56.950> through<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.310> little<00:02:57.610> loop<00:02:57.640> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
and put them through the little loop and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.449 
and put them through the little loop and
you<00:02:59.530> pull<00:02:59.800> it<00:02:59.830> tight<00:03:00.390> really<00:03:01.390> tight<00:03:02.430> then<00:03:03.430> you

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
you pull it tight really tight then you

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.449 
you pull it tight really tight then you
go<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.849> opposite<00:03:04.569> direction<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.980> you

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
go in the opposite direction and you

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.300 
go in the opposite direction and you
just<00:03:06.700> keep<00:03:06.970> winding<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:08.230> winding<00:03:08.560> and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
just keep winding and winding and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:31.010 
just keep winding and winding and
winding<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:10.330> winding<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.319> winding

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.370 

now<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.680> need<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.040> knot<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.900> separate

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
now I need to knot it so you separate

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.980 
now I need to knot it so you separate
the<00:03:34.590> two<00:03:35.630> pieces<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.660> thread<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.780> make<00:03:39.960> a

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
the two pieces of thread and you make a

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:52.240 
the two pieces of thread and you make a
knot

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.250 

kind<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.459> you're<00:03:53.640> tying<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.150> shoe<00:03:54.390> you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
kind of like you're tying a shoe you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.400 
kind of like you're tying a shoe you
start<00:03:55.680> tying<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.160> shoe<00:03:56.310> at<00:03:56.519> least<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:58.110> that

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
start tying a shoe at least like that

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.830 
start tying a shoe at least like that
oops

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.300 

try<00:04:03.840> not<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.230> break<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.950> just<00:04:04.980> did

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
try not to break it like I just did

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.309 
try not to break it like I just did
that's<00:04:06.209> what<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.480> should<00:04:06.510> look<00:04:06.780> like<00:04:06.840> at<00:04:07.200> the

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
that's what it should look like at the

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:18.370 
that's what it should look like at the
end

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.260 

and<00:04:19.380> now<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:19.620> need<00:04:19.920> to<00:04:20.070> do<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.340> twice

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
and now you need to do it twice

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.750 
and now you need to do it twice
same<00:04:22.170> exact<00:04:22.560> thing<00:04:22.650> twice<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.340> I'm<00:04:23.400> gonna<00:04:23.520> get

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
same exact thing twice so I'm gonna get

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:57.520 
same exact thing twice so I'm gonna get
out<00:04:23.790> more<00:04:24.150> thread

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.730 

and<00:04:58.070> now<00:04:58.480> seems<00:04:59.480> weird<00:04:59.870> but<00:05:00.020> it'll<00:05:00.290> make<00:05:00.470> sense

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
and now seems weird but it'll make sense

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.499 
and now seems weird but it'll make sense
in<00:05:00.920> a<00:05:00.980> minute

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.540 

put<00:05:08.509> it<00:05:08.599> on<00:05:08.719> me<00:05:08.900> like<00:05:09.259> leave<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.860> little<00:05:10.189> gap<00:05:10.490> in

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
put it on me like leave a little gap in

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:18.490 
put it on me like leave a little gap in
between<00:05:14.469> and<00:05:15.469> then<00:05:15.620> do<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.830> same<00:05:16.129> thing<00:05:17.500> read

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
between and then do the same thing read

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:30.390 
between and then do the same thing read
the<00:05:18.680> ends<00:05:19.039> for<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.370> loop

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:38.130 

and<00:05:31.400> we<00:05:31.610> just<00:05:31.940> start<00:05:32.210> wrapping<00:05:32.270> it

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.450 

okay<00:05:39.070> so<00:05:39.130> now<00:05:39.520> you've<00:05:39.760> wrapped<00:05:40.060> both<00:05:41.460> sections

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
okay so now you've wrapped both sections

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.000 
okay so now you've wrapped both sections
so<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:43.270> should<00:05:43.480> look<00:05:43.630> like<00:05:43.690> this<00:05:44.140> should<00:05:44.890> be<00:05:44.920> a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
so it should look like this should be a

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.280 
so it should look like this should be a
little<00:05:45.220> gap<00:05:45.430> there<00:05:45.630> we're<00:05:46.630> gonna<00:05:46.780> just<00:05:47.050> take<00:05:47.230> a

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
little gap there we're gonna just take a

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.560 
little gap there we're gonna just take a
pair<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.530> scissors<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:48.430> cut<00:05:48.490> right<00:05:49.090> in<00:05:49.450> the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
pair of scissors and cut right in the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.070 
pair of scissors and cut right in the
middle<00:05:50.280> just<00:05:51.280> like<00:05:51.430> that<00:05:51.730> so<00:05:52.420> basically<00:05:52.540> what

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
middle just like that so basically what

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.170 
middle just like that so basically what
you've<00:05:53.230> done<00:05:53.470> is<00:05:53.800> you've<00:05:53.980> bound<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:54.640> end<00:05:54.850> so

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
you've done is you've bound the end so

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.910 
you've done is you've bound the end so
that<00:05:55.330> won't<00:05:55.510> come<00:05:55.750> unraveled<00:05:55.900> on<00:05:56.440> this<00:05:56.650> end

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
that won't come unraveled on this end

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.190 
that won't come unraveled on this end
and<00:05:57.190> you've<00:05:57.850> bound<00:05:58.150> it<00:05:58.360> on<00:05:58.480> this<00:05:58.690> end<00:05:58.930> so<00:05:59.050> it

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
and you've bound it on this end so it

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.260 
and you've bound it on this end so it
won't<00:05:59.380> come<00:05:59.560> unraveled<00:05:59.740> so<00:06:00.400> you<00:06:00.490> have<00:06:00.700> two

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
won't come unraveled so you have two

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.270 
won't come unraveled so you have two
pieces<00:06:01.570> of<00:06:01.780> Kimmi<00:06:02.170> kumihimo<00:06:02.740> rope<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:06.100> then

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
pieces of Kimmi kumihimo rope and then

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:17.670 
pieces of Kimmi kumihimo rope and then
you<00:06:06.400> just<00:06:06.610> trim<00:06:06.850> it<00:06:06.910> up<00:06:16.260> now<00:06:17.260> this<00:06:17.380> is<00:06:17.440> how

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
you just trim it up now this is how

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.030 
you just trim it up now this is how
you're<00:06:17.830> gonna<00:06:17.920> make<00:06:18.160> your<00:06:18.280> bracelet<00:06:19.860> you<00:06:20.860> can

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
you're gonna make your bracelet you can

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:31.260 
you're gonna make your bracelet you can
open<00:06:21.280> up<00:06:21.370> your<00:06:21.780> e6000<00:06:29.310> now<00:06:30.310> this<00:06:30.490> glue<00:06:30.730> is<00:06:30.760> is

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
open up your e6000 now this glue is is

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.750 
open up your e6000 now this glue is is
like<00:06:31.540> superglue<00:06:32.230> for<00:06:32.560> fabric<00:06:33.010> it<00:06:33.220> won't<00:06:33.460> find

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
like superglue for fabric it won't find

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.970 
like superglue for fabric it won't find
your<00:06:33.970> skin<00:06:34.270> together<00:06:34.630> but<00:06:34.960> it'll<00:06:35.170> bind<00:06:35.380> fabric

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
your skin together but it'll bind fabric

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.190 
your skin together but it'll bind fabric
and<00:06:36.160> metals<00:06:36.490> together<00:06:36.700> really<00:06:37.060> well<00:06:37.210> so<00:06:38.050> what

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
and metals together really well so what

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:45.290 
and metals together really well so what
you<00:06:38.230> need<00:06:38.440> to<00:06:38.560> do<00:06:38.680> is<00:06:38.890> drop<00:06:39.490> it<00:06:39.730> inside<00:06:39.970> the<00:06:40.300> cap

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.350 

then<00:06:46.300> you<00:06:46.390> take<00:06:46.600> the<00:06:46.750> kumihimo<00:06:48.090> and<00:06:49.090> shove

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
then you take the kumihimo and shove

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:57.260 
then you take the kumihimo and shove
that<00:06:49.570> in<00:06:49.720> there

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.490 

and<00:06:58.270> then<00:06:58.420> do<00:06:58.540> the<00:06:58.630> same<00:06:58.810> thing<00:06:59.080> for<00:06:59.260> the<00:06:59.380> other

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
and then do the same thing for the other

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:08.060 
and then do the same thing for the other
end

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.010 

now<00:07:08.970> you're<00:07:09.150> probably<00:07:09.360> gonna<00:07:09.570> need<00:07:09.660> like<00:07:09.990> a

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
now you're probably gonna need like a

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.050 
now you're probably gonna need like a
tablecloth<00:07:10.650> or<00:07:11.280> something<00:07:11.730> like<00:07:11.820> that

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
tablecloth or something like that
