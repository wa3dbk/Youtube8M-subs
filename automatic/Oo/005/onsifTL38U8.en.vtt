00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
the first class that we have is the MSMC

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.140 
the first class that we have is the MSMC
a<00:00:36.620> submachine<00:00:37.250> gun<00:00:37.400> that<00:00:37.580> feels<00:00:37.910> like<00:00:38.000> the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
a submachine gun that feels like the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.050 
a submachine gun that feels like the
aks-74u<00:00:38.750> from<00:00:39.230> black<00:00:39.530> ops<00:00:39.800> and<00:00:40.010> it's<00:00:40.580> on<00:00:40.820> see

aks-74u from black ops and it's on see
amazing<00:00:41.420> for<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:41.870> attachments<00:00:42.590> though<00:00:42.740> I

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
amazing for the attachments though I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.860 
amazing for the attachments though I
have<00:00:43.190> laser<00:00:43.520> sight<00:00:43.880> and<00:00:44.090> foreign<00:00:44.480> grip<00:00:44.630> laser

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
have laser sight and foreign grip laser

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.780 
have laser sight and foreign grip laser
sights<00:00:45.170> for<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.440> hip<00:00:45.650> firing<00:00:45.920> which<00:00:46.460> gives<00:00:46.730> a

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
sights for the hip firing which gives a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.700 
sights for the hip firing which gives a
better<00:00:46.910> accuracy<00:00:47.330> and<00:00:47.690> then<00:00:48.170> foreign<00:00:48.440> grip

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
better accuracy and then foreign grip

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.920 
better accuracy and then foreign grip
which<00:00:48.980> gives<00:00:49.730> me<00:00:49.880> even<00:00:50.060> more<00:00:50.300> better<00:00:50.630> accuracy

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
which gives me even more better accuracy

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.320 
which gives me even more better accuracy
so<00:00:51.290> this<00:00:51.440> guns<00:00:51.650> basically<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.100> laser-like<00:00:52.730> the

and<00:03:31.820> then<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.060> have<00:03:32.239> grip<00:03:32.510> for<00:03:32.720> better

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
and then you have grip for better

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.600 
and then you have grip for better
accuracy<00:03:33.200> for<00:03:33.739> perks<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.070> have<00:03:34.190> hardline

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
accuracy for perks I have hardline

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.580 
accuracy for perks I have hardline
toughness<00:03:35.510> I<00:03:35.630> have<00:03:35.780> toughness<00:03:36.200> for<00:03:36.380> all<00:03:36.470> of

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
toughness I have toughness for all of

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.080 
toughness I have toughness for all of
them<00:03:36.709> because<00:03:36.800> i<00:03:36.920> do<00:03:37.040> not<00:03:37.370> like<00:03:37.400> flinching

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
them because i do not like flinching

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.810 
them because i do not like flinching
when<00:03:38.239> I'm<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:38.840> gunfight<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.620> then<00:03:40.580> I<00:03:40.670> have

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
when I'm in a gunfight and then I have

Dexter<00:03:41.180> Dexter<00:03:42.280> Richie<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.430> think<00:03:43.820> I

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
Dexter Dexter Richie I think I

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.460 
Dexter Dexter Richie I think I
pronounced<00:03:44.150> at<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.570> time<00:03:44.750> right<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.380> then

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
pronounced at that time right and then

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.740 
pronounced at that time right and then
for<00:03:45.769> my<00:03:46.250> system<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.820> have<00:03:47.030> some<00:03:47.239> text<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.600> in

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
for my system I have some text and in

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.270 
for my system I have some text and in
shock<00:03:47.989> charge<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.530> shock<00:03:48.709> charge<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.040> really

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
shock charge and shock charge is really

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.920 
shock charge and shock charge is really
really<00:03:49.400> good<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.790> basically<00:03:50.120> stuns<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.540> person

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
really good it basically stuns a person

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.170 
really good it basically stuns a person
but<00:03:51.590> it's<00:03:51.709> like<00:03:51.860> Claymore<00:03:52.220> next<00:03:52.910> up<00:03:53.030> is

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
but it's like Claymore next up is

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.120 
but it's like Claymore next up is
another<00:03:53.510> beast<00:03:53.870> assault<00:03:54.230> rifle<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.620> these

another beast assault rifle that these

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.860 
another beast assault rifle that these
are<00:03:55.280> two<00:03:55.459> probably<00:03:56.030> my<00:03:56.120> two<00:03:56.180> favorite<00:03:56.630> salt

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
rifles next up is the m8a1 and I have to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.900 
rifles next up is the m8a1 and I have to
have<00:04:00.560> selective<00:04:00.980> fire<00:04:01.160> on<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:01.700> is<00:04:01.880> a

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
have selective fire on this it is a

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.240 
have selective fire on this it is a
three<00:04:02.269> bursts<00:04:02.480> gun<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:03.680> it's<00:04:03.830> not<00:04:03.920> like<00:04:04.100> the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
three bursts gun but it's not like the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.340 
three bursts gun but it's not like the
chip<00:04:04.489> calm<00:04:04.760> we're<00:04:05.030> like<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.630> could<00:04:05.840> spray<00:04:06.200> it

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
chip calm we're like you could spray it

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.770 
chip calm we're like you could spray it
it<00:04:06.590> has<00:04:07.010> like<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.519> maximum<00:04:08.269> point<00:04:08.450> where<00:04:08.690> you

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
it has like a maximum point where you

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.350 
it has like a maximum point where you
could<00:04:08.900> actually<00:04:09.110> like<00:04:09.830> three<00:04:10.100> births<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.489> so<00:04:11.330> I

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
could actually like three births it so I

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.000 
could actually like three births it so I
like<00:04:11.600> having<00:04:11.840> selective<00:04:12.200> fire<00:04:12.380> I<00:04:12.620> like<00:04:12.739> having

one and they're all have UAV and for the

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.260 
one and they're all have UAV and for the
last<00:04:31.860> class<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:33.070> have<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.670> primary<00:04:34.740> scorpion<00:04:36.270> evv

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
last class I have a primary scorpion evv

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.540 
last class I have a primary scorpion evv
oh<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.110> class<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.650> amazing<00:04:39.190> this<00:04:39.340> is

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
oh and this class is amazing this is

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.030 
oh and this class is amazing this is
probably<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.880> fastest<00:04:40.390> fire<00:04:41.350> rate<00:04:41.620> out<00:04:41.830> of

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
probably the fastest fire rate out of

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.350 
probably the fastest fire rate out of
all<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.700> submachine<00:04:43.360> guns<00:04:43.690> assault<00:04:44.320> rifles

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
all the submachine guns assault rifles

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.940 
all the submachine guns assault rifles
LMGs<00:04:46.360> it's<00:04:46.690> honestly<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:47.230> fastest<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:47.890> I

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
LMGs it's honestly the fastest and I

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.160 
LMGs it's honestly the fastest and I
like<00:04:48.070> having<00:04:48.340> laser<00:04:48.670> sight<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.270> grip<00:04:49.840> so<00:04:50.050> it's

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
like having laser sight and grip so it's

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.420 
like having laser sight and grip so it's
even<00:04:50.380> more<00:04:50.530> accurate<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.100> then<00:04:51.220> having

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
even more accurate and then having

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.550 
even more accurate and then having
extended<00:04:51.820> mix<00:04:52.000> so<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.270> don't<00:04:52.630> run<00:04:52.840> out<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.080> clip

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
extended mix so I don't run out of clip

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.620 
extended mix so I don't run out of clip
you<00:04:54.010> do<00:04:54.160> not<00:04:54.310> even<00:04:54.370> need<00:04:54.610> rapid<00:04:55.150> fire<00:04:55.300> for<00:04:55.510> this

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
you do not even need rapid fire for this

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.270 
you do not even need rapid fire for this
I<00:04:55.810> don't<00:04:55.930> even<00:04:56.110> know<00:04:56.410> what<00:04:56.650> would<00:04:56.830> happen<00:04:57.190> if

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
I don't even know what would happen if

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.100 
I don't even know what would happen if
you<00:04:57.370> had<00:04:57.490> rapid<00:04:57.820> fire<00:04:58.000> for<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:58.330> if<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.840> just

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
you had rapid fire for this if you just

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.650 
you had rapid fire for this if you just
run<00:04:59.380> out<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.530> it<00:04:59.800> very<00:05:00.340> quickly<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.940> i<00:05:01.360> had<00:05:01.570> the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
run out of it very quickly and i had the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.270 
run out of it very quickly and i had the
same<00:05:01.690> secondary<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.410> like<00:05:02.680> having<00:05:02.920> extreme

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
same secondary I like having extreme

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.770 
same secondary I like having extreme
conditioning<00:05:03.670> because<00:05:03.790> it<00:05:04.150> is<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.300> summoning

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
conditioning because it is a summoning

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.060 
conditioning because it is a summoning
and<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:04.990> like<00:05:05.140> running<00:05:05.320> fast<00:05:05.680> with<00:05:05.800> this<00:05:05.890> one

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
and I like running fast with this one

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.150 
and I like running fast with this one
this<00:05:06.190> is<00:05:06.250> more<00:05:06.520> for<00:05:06.700> like<00:05:06.850> a<00:05:06.880> demolition
