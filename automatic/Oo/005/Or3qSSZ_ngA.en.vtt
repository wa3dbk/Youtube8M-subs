00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
lights not really but kind of so um how

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.330 
lights not really but kind of so um how
come<00:01:26.480> I'm<00:01:26.780> in<00:01:27.080> here<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.680> you're<00:01:27.890> out<00:01:28.100> there

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
well I think the easier answer to that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.270 
well I think the easier answer to that
is<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:32.090> know<00:01:32.120> part<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.720> crop<00:01:33.290> the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
is you know part of the crop the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.890 
is you know part of the crop the
interesting<00:01:34.670> thing<00:01:34.730> about<00:01:34.910> lines<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.720> that

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
interesting thing about lines is that

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.860 
interesting thing about lines is that
they're<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.230> only<00:01:36.410> tree<00:01:36.740> social<00:01:37.520> cat<00:01:37.870> those
