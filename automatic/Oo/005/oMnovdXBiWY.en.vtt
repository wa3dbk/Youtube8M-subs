00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.390 
conditioned supple moist all that good
stuff<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:28.260> normally<00:02:29.260> when<00:02:29.409> I<00:02:29.440> use<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> steamer<00:02:30.190> I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
stuff so normally when I use a steamer I

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.449 
stuff so normally when I use a steamer I
put<00:02:30.670> both<00:02:31.269> these<00:02:31.540> switches<00:02:31.989> on<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.650> turn<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
put both these switches on I turn the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.430 
put both these switches on I turn the
dial<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:34.120> about<00:02:34.659> 25<00:02:35.079> minutes<00:02:35.379> and<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:37.150> wait

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
dial to about 25 minutes and I wait

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.199 
dial to about 25 minutes and I wait
maybe<00:02:38.440> three<00:02:38.769> minutes<00:02:38.890> until<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.640> dome<00:02:39.849> is

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
maybe three minutes until the dome is

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.990 
maybe three minutes until the dome is
completely<00:02:40.590> full<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.739> steam<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.250> opaque<00:02:42.730> and

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
completely full of steam and opaque and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.110 
completely full of steam and opaque and
then<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.540> go<00:02:43.810> under<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.500> don't<00:02:45.280> use<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.489> shower<00:02:45.819> cap

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
then I go under I don't use a shower cap

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.300 
then I go under I don't use a shower cap
when<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.510> go<00:02:46.660> into<00:02:46.810> my<00:02:47.019> steamer<00:02:47.470> simply<00:02:47.980> because

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
when I go into my steamer simply because

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.900 
when I go into my steamer simply because
I<00:02:48.579> feel<00:02:48.819> like<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.299> plastic<00:02:49.959> cap<00:02:50.440> will<00:02:50.910> inhibit

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
I feel like the plastic cap will inhibit

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.660 
I feel like the plastic cap will inhibit
the<00:02:52.420> heat<00:02:52.900> from<00:02:53.200> actually<00:02:53.980> going<00:02:54.160> into<00:02:54.430> my

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
the heat from actually going into my

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.770 
the heat from actually going into my
strands<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.720> like<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.109> go<00:02:56.769> under<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.780> pin

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
looks like and how it functions I would

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.640 
looks like and how it functions I would
say<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.329> main<00:03:37.599> benefits<00:03:38.169> of<00:03:38.349> hair

steaming<00:03:39.160> would<00:03:39.400> be<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:40.419> moist<00:03:41.139> heat<00:03:41.500> it

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
steaming would be the moist heat it

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.270 
steaming would be the moist heat it
provides<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:43.030> heat<00:03:43.269> helps<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:44.040> open<00:03:45.040> up<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
provides the heat helps to open up the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.210 
provides the heat helps to open up the
hair<00:03:45.489> cuticles<00:03:46.060> while<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.959> hair<00:03:47.169> shaft<00:03:47.530> to

allow the conditioner and its nutrients

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.059 
allow the conditioner and its nutrients
to<00:03:50.799> penetrate<00:03:51.540> therefore<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.870> are<00:03:53.199> you<00:03:53.919> had

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
to penetrate therefore you are you had

the results of an amazing treatment I

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.580 
the results of an amazing treatment I
also<00:03:57.370> noticed<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.269> steaming<00:03:58.959> helps<00:03:59.500> to

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
also noticed that steaming helps to

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.949 
also noticed that steaming helps to
infuse<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.790> hair<00:04:00.970> with<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.359> lot<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.810> moisture

infuse the hair with a lot of moisture

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.159 
infuse the hair with a lot of moisture
helps<00:04:02.889> with<00:04:03.099> shine<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:04.000> fullness<00:04:04.629> and<00:04:05.109> volume

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
stop breakage as well my steamer

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.819 
stop breakage as well my steamer
particularly<00:04:10.660> uses<00:04:10.930> distilled<00:04:11.319> water<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:11.769> I

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
particularly uses distilled water and I

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:12.930 
particularly uses distilled water and I
want<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.069> touch<00:04:12.250> on<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.459> in<00:04:12.669> a<00:04:12.730> little<00:04:12.849> bit

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
simply because with distilled water

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.759 
simply because with distilled water
there's<00:04:18.970> two<00:04:19.209> main<00:04:19.389> things<00:04:19.469> about<00:04:20.469> it

there's two main things about it

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.430 
there's two main things about it
distilled<00:04:21.729> water<00:04:22.030> has<00:04:22.599> no<00:04:23.200> impurities

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
water has like calcium chloride sulfates

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.980 
water has like calcium chloride sulfates
that<00:04:31.070> kind<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.310> thing<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:32.180> with<00:04:32.630> distilled

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
that kind of thing so with distilled

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.830 
that kind of thing so with distilled
water<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.710> prolongs<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.790> life<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:35.300> your

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
water it prolongs the life of your

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
water it prolongs the life of your
equipment<00:04:36.170> it<00:04:37.160> also<00:04:37.520> helps<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.210> keep<00:04:38.450> the

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
equipment it also helps to keep the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.650 
equipment it also helps to keep the
functionality<00:04:39.860> at<00:04:40.130> its<00:04:40.700> highest<00:04:40.910> level<00:04:41.120> so

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
functionality at its highest level so

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.350 
functionality at its highest level so
its<00:04:42.110> effectiveness<00:04:42.800> will<00:04:43.430> continually<00:04:44.090> be

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
its effectiveness will continually be

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.780 
its effectiveness will continually be
there<00:04:44.570> as<00:04:44.810> opposed<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.560> using<00:04:45.770> like<00:04:46.100> mineral

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
there as opposed to using like mineral

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.570 
there as opposed to using like mineral
water<00:04:47.000> or<00:04:47.120> tap<00:04:47.450> water<00:04:47.480> to<00:04:48.110> use<00:04:48.890> in<00:04:49.040> your<00:04:49.160> system

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
water or tap water to use in your system

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.100 
water or tap water to use in your system

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
so with my steamer it only accepts

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.940 
so with my steamer it only accepts
distilled<00:04:54.770> water<00:04:54.950> so<00:04:55.400> it's<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.700> good<00:04:55.820> thing<00:04:56.950> yes

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950
