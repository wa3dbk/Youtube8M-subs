 So I would not give it to you. 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.460
 finally this new update 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.500
 if it rains here the horses and you already 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:15.530
 You must be listening to something, it was people. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:18.829
 increase here you hear you should already have 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.969
 heard a july rock'n roll 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:28.869
 these lines are the virgin genres now 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.869
 they have a loud sound hi 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:37.480
 yesterday one thing also that I realized I 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.900
 I do not know if it already is and already had it 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.400
 Only I was going to put a slope. 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.460
 show you 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.490
 there is a new thing that put into it that 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.190
 I'll explain already and simply order 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.560
 1 rose in the manicardi and use 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.710
 probably leaving now or were 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.670
 using any type of item used already 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.860
 were using it alone 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.590
 Previously we could do today 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.590
 This is now harnessed from this family. 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.090
 I will not let you know but I will not I will not 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.020
 I will not go 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.750
 anyway and now the horses 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.700
 even on horses they now make a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.340
 different sound to let go of your 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.110
 should here be ready 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.000
 they make a different sound now 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.650
 depending on the floor he is walking 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.430
 They're going to die I think you should 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.310
 to be listening there makes sounds of good 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.290
 Good in the kitchen when you walk on the floor. 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.350
 some utopian 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.840
 He also does this, I have not forgotten how 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.050
 does he 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.580
 I think it's here in his mouth that the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:08.360
 People have to do this. 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:14.959
 I do not know 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:19.940
 really know how to do it our will 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:22.540
 as they do at first, I only know that they 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.880
 now also has a sound of destak 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.550
 Look, you give a miner he makes a sound and 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.420
 has a way of making me swell 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.950
 I do not know yet 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:39.410
 the same has been implemented donkey looks 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:45.860
 I knew here how I did it. 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.569
 I was going to show you that he does a good job. 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.940
 very strange game 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:56.630
 in the case of the cap and here now every 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.750
 pill dies and now I will also show 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.510
 For you guys, this is a really cool video. 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.190
 It will be small, I'll tell you what. 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.750
 this video to be extremely small 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.420
 because these authorizations were not 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.110
 many 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.450
 Come on, look, now it's the same. 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.140
 the horses and I'll leave you tones 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.239
 just like the horses the manicardi he 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.840
 now you can only leave it from the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.380
 shift opts shift and it comes out of a single 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.530
 charge 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.440
 If I leave now on the shift, we do not have any more. 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.360
 that pressure to leave with the button 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.610
 right this is still going to be cool because 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.120
 there it now has a shortcut key 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.470
 this way it's going it's not gonna be able 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.620
 will use this much 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:52.810
 right-click on everything 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:52.810
 Probably not a year, man. 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.980
 old face 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:09.190
 travel is is beaten fighter and look at this 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:11.340
 Look, I do not know what it is, I do not have it. 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:16.090
 idea because he was flying 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:20.380
 practically these were the 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:23.980
 Updates is no, not many. 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.860
 I 'm bringing her some days later. 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.960
 it's not a day it 's depending on how much 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.230
 time it will bring was a day after the 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.210
