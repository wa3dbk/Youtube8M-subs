00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.820 
everything they've been through can they
stand<00:02:06.099> together<00:02:06.389> so<00:02:07.389> my<00:02:07.959> guess<00:02:08.200> here<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.679> that

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
stand together so my guess here is that

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.620 
stand together so my guess here is that
net<00:02:09.039> wing<00:02:09.220> won't<00:02:09.429> actually<00:02:09.670> be<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.300> this<00:02:10.420> issue

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
net wing won't actually be in this issue

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.570 
net wing won't actually be in this issue

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
will be more of just exactly where the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.490 
will be more of just exactly where the

bat family is standing at this point it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.070 
bat family is standing at this point it
