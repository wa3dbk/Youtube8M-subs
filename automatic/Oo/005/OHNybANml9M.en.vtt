00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
feet to the fire and he kept at it and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.169 
feet to the fire and he kept at it and
that's<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.770> wasn't<00:02:08.160> there's<00:02:08.399> no<00:02:08.489> humor<00:02:08.940> there

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that's it wasn't there's no humor there

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.880 
that's it wasn't there's no humor there
there's<00:02:09.360> nothing<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.899> he<00:02:10.050> was<00:02:10.170> an<00:02:10.289> angry<00:02:10.500> guy

there's nothing but he was an angry guy
and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.520 
and
and<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.390> think<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:13.900> often<00:02:14.170> time<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.410> hear

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
and I think this it's often time to hear

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.470 
and I think this it's often time to hear
of<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.710> angry<00:02:15.010> young<00:02:15.040> man<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.670> know<00:02:15.820> who<00:02:16.300> then

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
of the angry young man you know who then

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.230 
of the angry young man you know who then
grows<00:02:17.110> up<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.590> then<00:02:17.950> he<00:02:18.100> kind<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.640> becomes<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
grows up and then he kind of becomes the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.820 
grows up and then he kind of becomes the
kind<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.480> people<00:02:19.630> he<00:02:19.870> mocks<00:02:20.140> when<00:02:20.410> he's<00:02:20.800> a

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
kind of people he mocks when he's a

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.820 
kind of people he mocks when he's a
millionaire<00:02:21.790> or<00:02:21.850> something<00:02:22.000> but<00:02:22.750> with<00:02:23.170> Stuart

millionaire or something but with Stuart

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.110 
millionaire or something but with Stuart

forth<00:05:45.520> and<00:05:45.820> in<00:05:46.030> those<00:05:46.150> moments<00:05:46.389> you<00:05:46.690> see<00:05:47.080> them

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
forth and in those moments you see them

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.379 
forth and in those moments you see them
really<00:05:47.349> come<00:05:47.590> alive<00:05:47.830> yeah<00:05:48.310> yeah<00:05:48.550> why<00:05:49.210> do<00:05:49.270> you

think<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.750> in<00:05:50.080> Canada<00:05:50.349> we<00:05:50.740> haven't<00:05:51.099> had<00:05:51.310> much

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
think that in Canada we haven't had much
