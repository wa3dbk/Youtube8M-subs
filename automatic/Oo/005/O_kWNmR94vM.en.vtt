00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 a new alternative for obtaining and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.179
 therapeutic use of stem cells 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.880
 researchers at the institute butantan 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.219
 they can recover the vision of animals 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.550
 with material removed from milk teeth 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.130
 and the tests with humans already have date 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.350
 marked 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.689
 the nine-month-old female was one of the 30 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.519
 research guinea pigs to cornea 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 indicates that the left view 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.199
 almost completely recovered 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.930
 transplantation was performed from 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.760
 human stem cells removed from the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.070
 milk tooth pulp 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.170
 The study started six years ago and is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.059
 being conducted by researchers from the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.969
 butantan institute and unifesp 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.309
 Federal University of São Paulo 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.370
 about 90% of the animals had a 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.020
 transparency of the phorm to very good with 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.870
 his fado that we have had so far 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.609
 people can confirm that these animals 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.159
 they came back to have a transparency of 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.689
 cornea compared to animals that did not 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.700
 had another company 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.820
 the next step of the research will be done 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.280
 in humans the tests that should start in 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.920
 two months will be performed in patients 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.869
 volunteers with low vision and who 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.119
 underwent surgery but did not 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.640
 obtained satisfactory results 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.740
 the researchers are excited 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.750
 procedure that will be done in humans is 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.090
 similar to what was done in rabbits 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.820
 first the pulp of the milk tooth is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.159
 isolated after the stem cells are 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.960
 extracted and possible agents of 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.030
 contamination eliminated 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.689
 culture of the cells is promoted in a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.299
 stove heated to 36 ° favorable environment 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.610
 to multiplication by preparing the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.189
 cells is time for surgery 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 you take the patient first. 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.420
 surgical procedure makes surgery to 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.909
 we cleaned the surface of the cornea 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.810
 damaged and then you put the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.810
 transplantation of these cells and 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.970
 you 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.390
 on the cells you put a 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.510
 membrane with a contact lens that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.040
 will work as a protection 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.160
 until cells grow roots 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.660
 Come on, this is how they can join 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.760
 on the surface of the cornea 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.780
 after two weeks the cells 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.030
 that populate the cornea and there you already observe 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.110
 the result and the return of transparency 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.120
 in this cup 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.310
 according to the researchers the great 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.530
 Advantage of this type of stem cell is 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.170
 high processing capacity in 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.130
 different tissues and the low 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.440
 rejection 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.549
 even between different donors and 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.890
 receptors 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.380
 the first human results should be 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.760
 be disclosed six months after the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.010
 of tests 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.190
 the study is a pioneer in brazil and in the world 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.650
 and may be the hope of treatment 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.720
 other types of disease causing a 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.230
 experience with these 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.900
 cells in the regeneration of other tissues 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.569
 muscle tissue up to tissue 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.060
 we can be there 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.910
 that these cells also 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.880
 regenerate ocular tissues such as 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.079
 the retina the optic nerve and we are already 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.739
 starting at the very beginning with no forecast 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:27.430
 and work and clinical trials 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.620
 animals in the laboratory to the test are 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.239
 testing these cells to see if they 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.470
 they can really differentiate between these 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.470
 other cells of the eye
