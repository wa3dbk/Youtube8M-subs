00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.950
 Initially the idea was to renew 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.990
 fusion but without redoing the same 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.410
 vehicle while staying on this 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.690
 segment 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.240
 at least in form because for what 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.040
 is of the mind the imagination has exceeded 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.680
 the stage of simple renewal 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.160
 we know it is free max and this is 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.250
 not new 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.140
 so d max is a new vehicle in 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 the range ford one is asked to forget 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.099
 merge to get into another 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.109
 dimension because it is not a question here of 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.060
 the association of two light nuclei for 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.430
 to form a heavier basis for this 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.530
 famous fusion but to join the group 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.930
 of brand MPV vehicle 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.239
 urban holder of all patents 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.690
 innovative technologies developed by 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.850
 ford 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.710
 today makes the change 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.050
 now as the other would say it's the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.879
 sliding rear door uplink 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.800
 this is the trick found by the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.170
 house engineers to offer in a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 vehicle of only 4 meters 8 of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.309
 sliding rear doors with a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.739
 opening generous enough for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.399
 that a passenger can board without 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.680
 shoehorn 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.719
 so we had to slash that amount 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.090
 central separating the rear doors 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.939
 and forwards or rather who holds the doors 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.070
 / b max this amount has been moved 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.560
 precisely in the front doors and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.320
 back of where an opening of a meter 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.549
 fifty wide was almost xxl 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.710
 or wide open 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.200
 and that's how we can announce a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 nice habitability and quality 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.549
 of life aboard undeniable while 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.549
 staying on the so- called urban niche 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.920
 side look d max makes us think of a 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.750
 small s max the self inherited from this very 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.160
 fluid that characterizes the great 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.280
 monospace ford 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.110
 the style is affirmed elegant and very 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.800
 quickly then we notice the quality 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.200
 assembly 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.720
 inside we'll see it with 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.600
 some elements positioned at the micron 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.660
 close to note again the central console 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.330
 wide and practical that took place between 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.680
 both seats 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.720
 no savings on security 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.420
 it is the brand's workhorse 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.800
 the vehicles are equipped with standard or 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.740
 optional latest 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.690
 innovations like the asset city stocks 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.300
 which will reduce the risk of collision at 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.880
 low pace where the sync system of 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.970
