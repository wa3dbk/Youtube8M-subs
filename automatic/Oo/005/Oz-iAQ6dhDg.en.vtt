 Hello everyone, you have half the topic

 and in this episode we'll talk about cool 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.030
 is this program people want now 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.889
 travels but often such 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.509
 travel is expensive for example 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.580
 go to another part of the country stand 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.350
 pretty big amount of money there 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.150
 blablacar application which will allow 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.100
 you travel and save money 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.600
 can you say blablacar is big 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.849
 social network in which users 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.099
 offer different trips to different 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.869
 parts of the country or even abroad 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.130
 there is a message that is different 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.809
 notifications that will help you 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.820
 customize your application either 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.250
 incoming messages that you can 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 receive from various users in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.670
 The application collected a single database throughout 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.110
 Europe in other words possible 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.059
 travel from lisbon to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 Vladivostok many users a lot 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.960
 routes many cities and so you 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 find yourself either fellow travelers or people 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.100
 which will take you to a certain 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.140
 points let's for example find a trip from 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.210
 Moscow to St. Petersburg see that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.280
 the search happens very vigorously and quickly and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.350
 in this application you will find a huge 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 the number of different sentences we see 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.850
 how many of them and prices are different that is, we 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.159
 can we find options that fit 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.710
 we will stop at about the price 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.930
 800 92 rubles for one place and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.700
 and actually say let's multiply 34 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.189
 ruble is the average cost of gasoline in 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.900
 Russia at 720 kilometers distance from 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.939
 Moscow to St. Petersburg in the end we 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.650
 this figure should be divided also by 10 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.210
 because average fuel consumption per 100 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.640
 kilometers from the average car 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.009
 it's just 10 liters in the end we are with you 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.689
 we get 2400 rubles and this is the amount 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.659
 money that the driver spends on 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.729
 gasoline on our route that is from these 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.040
 calculations follows that three passengers are priced at 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.689
 800 rubles compensate for driver expenses 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.610
 fuel and passengers will remain 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.829
 happy because the ticket from moscow to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.229
 Peter in the reserved seat costs another 200 rubles 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.479
 and a peregrine falcon in general 4 pieces that is, we 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.880
 praise the passenger sees a much cheaper and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.189
 drivers get a hundred percent payment 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.840
 gasoline and communication nobody canceled I 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.939
 true such trips are more interesting and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.979
 more fun and remembered better than 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.600
 on the same train 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.189
 if we go to any route we can 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.320
 see the route itself its cost 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.880
 view map of the route ie 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.469
 what road do we have to go on 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.009
 of course payment cards will look 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.060
 complicated 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.300
 apple steering wheels 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.190
 and also we can see the car 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.349
 driver preferences what size 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.660
 baggage and everything in this spirit if all of us 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.520
 satisfied with the drivers 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.930
 arranges cars then we can him 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.849
 send a message to agree on 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.069
 meeting and actually go 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.780
 st petersburg is important before 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.069
 choosing a driver and a trip you can 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.110
 get acquainted with the driver who 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.150
 offers you a trip to find out about him 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.269
 all similar information of his age 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.010
 see if his email phone is verified 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.390
 find out if he is active on the site 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.010
 does he dare to message 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.630
 whether he has adequate drivers there already 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.489
 choose whether you go with him or not 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.560
 service pays great attention 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.489
 safety so before you go 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.769
 the passenger receives all the necessary 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.750
 information about the driver for me personally 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.340
 a huge plus that everything happens right in 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.230
 this program does not throw in the same 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.060
 messages that blablacar it 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.430
 full social transport network 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.560
 and profitable alternative to long-distance 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.180
 transport service will break more than 9 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.099
 million people across europe and you 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.170
 find the positions you need and 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.720
 which you will remember for a long time because 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.830
 these trips promise to be interesting 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.010
 let's see the route from my 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.390
 hometown of Kharkov and say in 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.890
 Krakow namely to Poland that is for 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.959
 border to be driven 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.930
 very long distance and see that 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.310
 such a route and it costs 3000 rubles and I 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.010
 like a haiku man who can 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.079
 say that it is still a normal price because 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.000
 on the same train to krakow you will 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.069
 get molotov with transfers so 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.680
 also the price will not be 3 thousand rubles 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.510
