thick bottom and also thick and if it is

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.819 
thick bottom and also thick and if it is
nonstick<00:00:24.460> that's<00:00:24.909> even<00:00:25.179> better<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.470> I<00:00:26.619> will

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
nonstick that's even better so I will

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:32.819 
nonstick that's even better so I will
take<00:00:26.980> around<00:00:27.130> 1<00:00:27.460> liter<00:00:27.669> milk<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:31.269> cook<00:00:31.960> it<00:00:32.110> on

a very slow heat and remember to keep it
stirring<00:00:37.630> in<00:00:37.870> between<00:00:37.900> because<00:00:38.350> milk<00:00:38.830> will

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
stirring in between because milk will

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.570 
stirring in between because milk will
get<00:00:39.160> stuck<00:00:39.490> in<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.730> bottom<00:00:39.880> so<00:00:40.480> just<00:00:41.580> keep

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
get stuck in the bottom so just keep

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.150 
get stuck in the bottom so just keep
staying<00:00:43.050> after<00:00:44.050> boiling<00:00:44.440> this<00:00:44.710> milk<00:00:44.920> for

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
staying after boiling this milk for

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.860 
staying after boiling this milk for
around<00:00:45.310> half<00:00:45.850> an<00:00:46.060> hour<00:00:46.180> you<00:00:46.390> will<00:00:46.420> see<00:00:46.690> that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
around half an hour you will see that

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.790 
around half an hour you will see that
that<00:00:47.680> amount<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.340> milk<00:00:48.520> is<00:00:49.290> roughly<00:00:50.290> 1/3

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
that amount of the milk is roughly 1/3

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.190 
that amount of the milk is roughly 1/3
or<00:00:51.100> what<00:00:51.460> we<00:00:51.610> had<00:00:51.760> it<00:00:51.880> started<00:00:52.060> well<00:00:52.930> it<00:00:52.960> will

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
or what we had it started well it will

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.680 
or what we had it started well it will
depend<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:54.070> time<00:00:54.310> will<00:00:54.520> depend<00:00:54.670> upon<00:00:55.090> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
depend the time will depend upon the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.200 
depend the time will depend upon the
size<00:00:55.900> of<00:00:56.170> your<00:00:56.350> pan<00:00:57.220> if<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:57.490> take<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:57.700> very<00:00:57.940> big

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
size of your pan if you take a very big

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.650 
size of your pan if you take a very big
waistband<00:00:59.190> then<00:01:00.190> it<00:01:00.940> will<00:01:01.060> evaporate<00:01:01.450> very

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
waistband then it will evaporate very

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.660 
waistband then it will evaporate very
quickly<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.610> can<00:01:04.329> see<00:01:04.509> milk<00:01:05.199> has<00:01:05.670> become

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
quickly so you can see milk has become

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.200 
quickly so you can see milk has become
very<00:01:06.790> condensed<00:01:07.329> now<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:09.310> little<00:01:09.729> bit<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:09.969> milk

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
very condensed now if little bit of milk

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.499 
very condensed now if little bit of milk
gets<00:01:10.450> tagged<00:01:10.810> with<00:01:10.929> the<00:01:11.079> sides<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.189> sides

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
gets tagged with the sides in the sides

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.590 
gets tagged with the sides in the sides
you<00:01:13.509> see<00:01:13.659> four<00:01:14.499> in<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.710> bottom<00:01:14.859> don't<00:01:15.460> mind<00:01:15.999> it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
you see four in the bottom don't mind it

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.779 
you see four in the bottom don't mind it
gives<00:01:16.659> even<00:01:17.109> better<00:01:17.729> taste<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.939> over<00:01:19.149> a<00:01:19.179> week

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
gives even better taste to over a week

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.260 
gives even better taste to over a week
after<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.939> GAO<00:01:22.689> mean<00:01:22.960> look<00:01:23.200> nobody<00:01:23.679> huh<00:01:23.979> today

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
after the GAO mean look nobody huh today

they even Chinese Italy ee do Java those

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.169 
they even Chinese Italy ee do Java those
here<00:01:28.450> only<00:01:28.569> later<00:01:29.229> them

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
here only later them

here only later them
well<00:01:31.179> now<00:01:31.569> it's<00:01:31.749> difficult<00:01:32.109> to<00:01:32.229> find<00:01:32.439> rubbing

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
well now it's difficult to find rubbing

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.629 
well now it's difficult to find rubbing
in<00:01:32.950> many<00:01:33.670> places<00:01:34.139> anyway<00:01:35.139> we<00:01:36.039> have<00:01:36.219> our<00:01:36.369> own

in many places anyway we have our own

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.830 
in many places anyway we have our own
resolver<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:38.560> this<00:01:38.740> I'm<00:01:38.889> going<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.130> add<00:01:39.249> around

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
resolver on this I'm going to add around

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.050 
resolver on this I'm going to add around
100<00:01:40.840> grams<00:01:40.869> over<00:01:47.130> justice<00:01:48.130> Jayant<00:01:48.399> so<00:01:48.909> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
does sugar get dissolved in the milk and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.669 
does sugar get dissolved in the milk and
just<00:01:53.560> by<00:01:54.520> for<00:01:54.789> a<00:01:54.819> little<00:01:55.060> more<00:01:55.439> time<00:01:56.439> so<00:01:56.560> that

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
just by for a little more time so that

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.639 
just by for a little more time so that
the<00:01:56.920> sugar<00:01:57.189> will<00:01:57.369> mmm<00:01:57.819> will<00:01:58.689> get<00:01:59.289> mixed<00:01:59.590> with

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
the sugar will mmm will get mixed with

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
the sugar will mmm will get mixed with
the<00:01:59.829> milk<00:02:00.039> and<00:02:01.349> more<00:02:02.349> milk<00:02:02.709> will<00:02:02.859> evaporate

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the milk and more milk will evaporate

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.959 
the milk and more milk will evaporate
you<00:02:04.659> can<00:02:04.869> see<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.170> quite<00:02:05.319> tense<00:02:05.649> now<00:02:05.889> and<00:02:06.099> all

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
you can see is quite tense now and all

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.020 
you can see is quite tense now and all
the<00:02:07.090> sugar<00:02:07.389> has<00:02:07.569> qualities<00:02:08.259> dissolve<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:08.770> it

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the sugar has qualities dissolve in it

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.390 
the sugar has qualities dissolve in it
so<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.179> are<00:02:10.209> going<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.539> add<00:02:10.690> now
