00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
okay so we have the ID sized to fit on

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.250 
okay so we have the ID sized to fit on
the<00:00:13.910> cop

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
the cop

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.470 
the cop
now<00:00:16.260> we're<00:00:16.470> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:17.720> check<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.960> up<00:00:20.420> I'll<00:00:21.420> be

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
now we're going to check this up I'll be

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.470 
now we're going to check this up I'll be
careful<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.110> to<00:00:22.170> over-tighten<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:24.210> if

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
careful not to over-tighten it and if

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.280 
careful not to over-tighten it and if
there<00:00:24.660> are<00:00:24.689> cracks<00:00:25.580> you'll<00:00:26.580> want<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> use<00:00:27.290> some

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
there are cracks you'll want to use some

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.740 
there are cracks you'll want to use some
electrical<00:00:29.250> tape<00:00:29.310> or<00:00:29.700> something<00:00:29.910> wrap<00:00:30.360> around

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
electrical tape or something wrap around

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.860 
electrical tape or something wrap around
the<00:00:30.930> blank<00:00:31.489> before<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.850> would<00:00:33.090> clamp<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the blank before you would clamp on the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.260 
the blank before you would clamp on the
ID<00:00:35.390> just<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.540> make<00:00:36.660> sure<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> don't<00:00:37.110> crack<00:00:37.320> it

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
ID just to make sure you don't crack it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.960 
ID just to make sure you don't crack it
so<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.390> we've<00:00:39.540> got<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.809> tucked<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.970> we'll

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
so now we've got it tucked up we'll

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.100 
so now we've got it tucked up we'll
measure<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:44.449> width<00:00:45.449> that<00:00:45.660> we're<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.900> for

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
measure the width that we're going for

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.250 
measure the width that we're going for
here<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.650> this<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.979> about<00:00:47.220> 0.62<00:00:48.089> on<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.930> copper

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
here so this is about 0.62 on the copper

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.880 
here so this is about 0.62 on the copper
core<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.780> about<00:00:52.729> 0.76<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> I'll<00:00:55.739> take

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
core and this is about 0.76 so I'll take

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.979 
core and this is about 0.76 so I'll take
a<00:00:55.949> little<00:00:56.190> over<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.940> little<00:00:57.150> about<00:00:57.479> 1/8<00:00:57.780> inch

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
a little over up a little about 1/8 inch

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.430 
a little over up a little about 1/8 inch
off<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:59.430> length<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.970> then<00:01:00.330> this<00:01:01.140> will<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.409> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
off the length and then this will be a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:02:12.200 
off the length and then this will be a
progressive<00:01:01.799> process<00:01:02.640> here

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.399 

point<00:02:12.600> six<00:02:12.930> five

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
point six five

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:32.110 
point six five
have<00:02:14.799> another<00:02:15.040> 30<00:02:15.370> power<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.819> go

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.900 

make<00:02:33.110> sure<00:02:33.349> that<00:02:33.560> these<00:02:34.660> badges<00:02:35.660> square<00:02:36.910> we're

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
make sure that these badges square we're

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.380 
make sure that these badges square we're
cutting<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.300> somewhere<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
cutting it somewhere to the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.290 
cutting it somewhere to the
another<00:02:40.600> place

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:57.559 

26<00:02:47.930> 3

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.770 

so<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:58.620> still<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:58.890> about<00:02:59.120> 10,000

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
so we still have about 10,000

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:10.540 
so we still have about 10,000
going<00:03:02.080> together

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.030 

or<00:03:10.790> off

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.780 

ever<00:03:18.610> made<00:03:18.909> really<00:03:19.360> careful

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
ever made really careful

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.670 
ever made really careful
have<00:03:20.909> to<00:03:21.030> cut<00:03:21.180> too<00:03:21.360> much

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:38.400 

the<00:03:28.680> carbide<00:03:29.100> cutter

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.220 

we're<00:03:39.410> broke<00:03:39.560> about<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.890> 5,000

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
we're broke about a 5,000

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.980 
we're broke about a 5,000
yeah

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.300 

between<00:03:46.680> me

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
between me

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.400 
between me
between<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:48.970> edge<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.390> bangle<00:03:49.870> or<00:03:50.110> that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
between the edge of the bangle or that

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.500 
between the edge of the bangle or that
weather

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.680 

so<00:03:53.720> we're<00:03:53.930> right<00:03:54.050> at<00:03:54.200> 626

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.900 

ten<00:04:00.990> thousands<00:04:01.530> without<00:04:02.160> praying<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.820> be

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
ten thousands without praying to be

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:49.629 
ten thousands without praying to be
emphasized<00:04:03.450> here

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.879 

let's<00:04:49.849> fit<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.180> in<00:04:50.300> there<00:04:50.840> go<00:04:51.080> ahead<00:04:51.229> pricing

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
let's fit it in there go ahead pricing

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.659 
let's fit it in there go ahead pricing
it

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.680 

now<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.419> is<00:04:58.539> really<00:04:58.749> important

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.590 

so<00:05:03.020> let's<00:05:03.200> drive<00:05:03.530> fit<00:05:03.770> together<00:05:04.210> I'm<00:05:05.210> pushing

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
so let's drive fit together I'm pushing

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.300 
so let's drive fit together I'm pushing
it<00:05:05.720> together<00:05:05.900> clamping<00:05:06.740> it<00:05:06.830> hard<00:05:07.040> with<00:05:07.190> my

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
it together clamping it hard with my

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.170 
it together clamping it hard with my
hands<00:05:07.780> okay<00:05:08.780> this<00:05:09.230> this<00:05:09.530> is<00:05:09.740> together<00:05:10.400> it's

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
hands okay this this is together it's

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.360 
hands okay this this is together it's
rotating<00:05:11.840> freely<00:05:12.170> that's<00:05:12.650> really<00:05:12.920> important

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
rotating freely that's really important

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.460 
rotating freely that's really important
it's<00:05:13.490> not<00:05:13.550> bound<00:05:13.940> in<00:05:14.380> between<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:16.340> copper

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
it's not bound in between the copper

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.490 
it's not bound in between the copper
rims<00:05:18.580> we've<00:05:19.580> got<00:05:19.790> a<00:05:19.820> good<00:05:20.150> amount<00:05:20.900> of<00:05:21.020> play<00:05:21.260> in

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
rims we've got a good amount of play in

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.040 
rims we've got a good amount of play in
here

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
here

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.150 
here
okay<00:05:24.130> so<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:25.550> know<00:05:25.670> we're<00:05:25.850> going<00:05:26.000> for<00:05:26.330> this<00:05:27.160> 40

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
okay so you know we're going for this 40

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.250 
okay so you know we're going for this 40
50<00:05:28.550> thousand<00:05:29.650> gap<00:05:30.650> so<00:05:31.780> that's<00:05:32.780> ready<00:05:32.960> to<00:05:33.080> glue

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
50 thousand gap so that's ready to glue

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:43.170 
50 thousand gap so that's ready to glue
up
