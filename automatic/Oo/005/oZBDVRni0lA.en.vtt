00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
what it was like first of all the bike

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.300 
what it was like first of all the bike
is<00:01:27.060> almost<00:01:27.509> silent<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> only<00:01:28.860> thing<00:01:29.130> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
is almost silent the only thing you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.899 
is almost silent the only thing you
really<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.659> chain<00:01:31.110> drive<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:32.100> it's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
really here is the chain drive as it's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.350

going<00:01:33.360> down<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> road<00:01:34.340> now<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.640> addition<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
going down the road now in addition to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.510 
going down the road now in addition to
the<00:01:36.450> fact<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> motorcycle<00:01:37.740> sounds

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the fact that the motorcycle sounds

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.420 
the fact that the motorcycle sounds

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
different it also feels different now

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
different it also feels different now
when<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> talked<00:01:42.509> about<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
when I talked about this one this is a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.039 
when I talked about this one this is a
gas<00:01:43.799> engine<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.970> has<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> lot<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> horsepower

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
gas engine it has a lot of horsepower

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
gas engine it has a lot of horsepower
and<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.979> doesn't<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.399> nearly<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.790> much

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and it doesn't have nearly as much

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.819 
and it doesn't have nearly as much
torque<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.689> does<00:01:48.840> horsepower<00:01:49.380> those

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
torque as it does horsepower those

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
far but if you'll take it easy and maybe

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.630 
far but if you'll take it easy and maybe
not<00:02:30.540> be<00:02:30.690> going<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:31.350> hills<00:02:31.590> all<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.980> time<00:02:32.190> you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
not be going up hills all the time you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.920 
not be going up hills all the time you
can<00:02:32.700> get<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.880> pretty<00:02:33.060> good<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.569> know<00:02:33.600> at<00:02:33.870> least

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
can get a pretty good you know at least

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.720 
can get a pretty good you know at least
a<00:02:34.260> full<00:02:34.470> day's<00:02:34.680> worth<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.069> riding<00:02:35.430> out<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.580> this

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
a full day's worth of riding out of this

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.090 
a full day's worth of riding out of this
sucker<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.690> takes<00:02:36.959> about<00:02:37.080> eight<00:02:37.380> hours<00:02:37.709> to

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
sucker it takes about eight hours to

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.559 
sucker it takes about eight hours to
charge<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.700> really<00:02:38.970> what<00:02:39.090> you're<00:02:39.180> going<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.420> do

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
charge so really what you're going to do

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.640 
charge so really what you're going to do
is<00:02:39.690> you're<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.959> write<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.200> out<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
is you're going to write it out in the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.949 
is you're going to write it out in the
day<00:02:40.830> right<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.340> back<00:02:41.550> plug<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.450> overnight

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
day right it back plug it in overnight

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.660 
day right it back plug it in overnight
and<00:02:43.200> then<00:02:43.590> you'll<00:02:43.769> be<00:02:43.920> ready<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.250> go<00:02:44.430> by<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
and then you'll be ready to go by the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
and then you'll be ready to go by the
next<00:02:44.940> day<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.690> let's<00:02:45.810> talk<00:02:45.959> about<00:02:46.019> ride

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
next day so let's talk about ride

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.280 
next day so let's talk about ride
quality<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> minute<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:48.660> not<00:02:48.959> going<00:02:49.200> to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
quality for a minute it's not going to

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.120 
quality for a minute it's not going to
compete<00:02:49.830> with<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.130> BMW<00:02:50.819> for<00:02:51.269> smoothness<00:02:52.130> but

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
compete with the BMW for smoothness but

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.340 
compete with the BMW for smoothness but
it's<00:02:53.250> not<00:02:53.400> exactly<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.880> dirt<00:02:54.180> bike<00:02:54.420> either<00:02:54.750> one

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
it's not exactly a dirt bike either one

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.320 
it's not exactly a dirt bike either one
of<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.500> things<00:02:55.739> about<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.489> brahmos<00:02:57.150> is

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
of the things about the the brahmos is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.660 
of the things about the the brahmos is
they're<00:02:57.510> extremely<00:02:57.930> lightweight<00:02:58.670> compared

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
they're extremely lightweight compared

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.550 
they're extremely lightweight compared
to<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.940> big<00:03:00.360> heavy<00:03:00.600> bike<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.170> thing<00:03:01.380> weighs

it was good to maneuver it was since

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.380 
it was good to maneuver it was since

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
it's so light when he hit bumps you're

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.500 
it's so light when he hit bumps you're
going<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.569> feel<00:03:15.840> him<00:03:16.100> but<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.940> nimble

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.960 
lightweight maneuverability of it more
than<00:03:21.209> makes<00:03:21.420> up<00:03:21.630> for<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:22.019> now<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.739> was<00:03:23.310> not<00:03:23.549> fast

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
than makes up for it now it was not fast

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.960

but<00:03:24.359> it<00:03:24.900> didn't<00:03:25.170> matter<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.680> was<00:03:26.100> fun<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.760> last

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
but it didn't matter it was fun the last

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.180 
but it didn't matter it was fun the last
time<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.209> had<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.570> much<00:03:27.720> fun<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:28.230> any<00:03:28.799> kind<00:03:29.130> of
