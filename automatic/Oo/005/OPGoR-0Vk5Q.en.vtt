under the plain strings and that gives a

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.040 
under the plain strings and that gives a
fat<00:01:14.040> thick<00:01:14.369> sound<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.330> very<00:01:15.479> balanced

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
fat thick sound so it's very balanced

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.770

when you go from low to high and it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.840 
when you go from low to high and it
works<00:01:18.960> particularly<00:01:19.410> well<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.369> heavy

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
works particularly well with for heavy

brass covers and brass base plates and
what<00:01:26.940> that<00:01:27.060> does<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.360> increases<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
what that does is that increases the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.590 
what that does is that increases the
distortion<00:01:28.880> I'm<00:01:29.880> sorry<00:01:30.119> increases<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
distortion I'm sorry increases the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.219

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
which gives it a nice cut through when

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.719 
which gives it a nice cut through when
using<00:01:33.360> heavy<00:01:33.660> amounts<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.170> fuzz<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.640> you
