00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.460
 hello how is our cristian very well 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 I am very happy to be again 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.960
 with you and good first of all 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.730
 I want to warn that I'm going to have days 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.369
 fixed to upload videos are going to be 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.260
 Wednesday and Friday so subscribe 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.029
 so you do not miss any video and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 good today we are going to talk about the nails of 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.349
 how to have salon nails at home and good 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.290
 first of all I want to tell you that I do not 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.720
 I like my videos to look like some kind 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.850
 of commercial or something and the truth is not 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.410
 I want you to think neither with this brand nor 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.989
 with others with whom he collaborated or 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.300
 cooperate that I am telling you nothing 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.219
 more because they sent me the product not me 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.920
 I prefer a thousand times to lose contact 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.019
 with a brand that lose the confidence of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.879
 you would never really lie to them if 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.800
 There is something wrong with this product or another 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.629
 They send me, I'll tell them 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.390
 example if you have seen my other reviews 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.160
 I tell you the truth is that if there is one that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.379
 I like them I say I like it for this because 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.330
 these and one that I do not like I say no 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.100
 I like the truth for this and good this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.520
 parenthesis open it because I know it can 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.969
 be confusing because many bloggers 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.840
 we receive products and sometimes we have the 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.759
 doubt to see it if your products really 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.670
 they work or they just say it because they're 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.710
 committed but I did not sign any 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.600
 contract to speak well of the brand I 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.149
 there is nothing left helping from the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.700
 products if I'm going to make a video of 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.610
 what I thought was called me yes 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.799
 william what I loved about this is that 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.479
 It is super economical, that is, the little boat 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.810
 it costs the same as any other in 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.640
 gel 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.459
 it costs you 15 dollars like 200 pesos but 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.130
 you do not need to buy any base or a 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.319
 top coat fed with top coat for 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.259
 try it but what I can tell you 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.720
 I used it in one hand and in another 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.119
 to prove the difference and they lasted me 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.489
 exactly the same if they look more 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.170
 shines or if you like super shiny 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.299
 Well yes I recommend you buy it 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.280
 but in terms of duration really not 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.110
 there is a difference which is good 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.120
 because you do not have to spend 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.520
 they have a great variety of colors 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.370
 they have since neon is up to good right now 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.580
 for the autumn of a few heats and ones 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.880
 colors that I fell in love 2 do not need 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.040
 buy a lamp or anything pieces for 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.680
 put the nails and dry them because 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.630
 let me tell you that it dries with the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.430
 I swear to you that at first I do not 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.490
 I thought I said surely that as well as 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.830
 sticky or something but not really you put 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.830
 your hands below the direct sun 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.959
 and in two minutes they are already super dry 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.139
 obviously I tried to put in the 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.999
 window and it takes a little longer I do not know if 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.730
 because he had it closed and like not 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:55.310
 the sun also enters but also if it takes 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.189
 a little bit more then yes if you want 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.920
 somewhat faster and go straight to the 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.560
 Sun to a council that I give you not the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.370
 pints under the sun or painted fabrics 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.230
 inside your house and then you go out 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.969
 floor for those humans in the window 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.669
 because if you paint them under the sun 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.799
 they will dry very fast and to decide if 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:18.919
 You're in a little bit out because 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.889
 already dried and going to remove it is a process 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:24.500
 it's not like nothing else happens 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.090
 remove nail polish not then if you 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.449
 I recommend that you paint inside the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.459
 house and anything, then the 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:34.189
 I need the cotton and it is removed when 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.590
 It is not dry and another reason why not 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.590
 you must paint them below are the little bottles 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.670
 these little bottles you should not have them 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.069
 in very hot temperature for the same 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.650
 I think that because they dried up in 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.900
 the sun can not stay foggy or 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.959
 something then example I live in a 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.870
 super hot city and what I do is 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.120
 the refrigerator goals and the third thing 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.560
 it's me I do not know if it 's with all the brands 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.120
 but putting me whenever I go to 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.220
 lounge after they do not apply the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.040
 gel enamel have to pass one by 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.840
 one with a cotton and alcohol to polish 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.940
 so that they do not remain but things with 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.269
 you do not do not need to do that 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.130
 they are sticky who is talking not 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.470
 you need to do nothing really dries up and 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.540
 you are ready and if you are going to buy a 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.639
 is going to confuse that it is me or you 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.169
 so that it is the same as I am going to 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.880
 show is dry with the ground and everything 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.010
 because there is that if three steps 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.780
 which is like normal and good gel now 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.480
 I'm going to show you the process for 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.000
 paint your nails with cloths and whitfield 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.920
 this step is optional but I'll 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.680
 I recommend to be able to work in a 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.630
 smoother surface and now we're going to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.970
 our nails clean with alcohol to 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.090
 remove any type of grease or 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.130
 polvito 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.199
 Now let's choose our color 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.900
 favorite and we're going to apply a layer 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.880
 thin on each of our nails is 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.889
 very important that you do not forget the 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.810
 tips because you can get to run 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.729
 a little and the tips come to be 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.930
 discovered why I recommend that you 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.780
 you cover them very well 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.199
 now we let this first layer dry in 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.979
 the sun for about two minutes and once 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.630
 that is dry we apply the second layer 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.289
 we dry them again in the sun for others 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.419
 two minutes and this part is totally 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.539
 optional but I wanted to show you a 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:27.870
 decorated super simple let's take off 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.960
 a special band-aid for nails and we're going 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.389
 to apply diagonally presses very 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.340
 very well for them to stick and then 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.940
 with a pair of scissors we are going to cut the 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.940
 excess 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.270
 so that the band-aid lasts much longer and 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.249
 so that the enamel is shinier him 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.879
 remember this part is totally equal 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:53.129
 optional you can apply this top coat and 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.289
 once again we take out our nails in the sun 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.999
 to dry for 2 minutes 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.729
 they liked it very much very much 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:03.039
