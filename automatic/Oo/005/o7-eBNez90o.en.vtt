00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.760 
the other nice thing about the Toshiba
gets<00:01:53.950> 3,000<00:01:54.670> life<00:01:54.850> cycles<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:56.500> for<00:01:56.740> a

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
gets 3,000 life cycles which for a

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.730 
gets 3,000 life cycles which for a
battery<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.760> outstanding<00:01:58.570> are<00:01:59.500> the

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
battery is is outstanding are the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.430 
battery is is outstanding are the
competition<00:02:00.369> is<00:02:00.520> around<00:02:00.760> 1,000<00:02:01.510> this<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.290> your

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
competition is around 1,000 this is your

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.230 
competition is around 1,000 this is your
controller<00:02:02.830> right<00:02:03.010> here<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:03.670> 2

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
controller right here so this 2

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.480 
controller right here so this 2
functions<00:02:04.750> it's<00:02:05.290> turning<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.710> on<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:05.860> off<00:02:06.100> and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
functions it's turning it on and off and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.190 
functions it's turning it on and off and
it<00:02:07.000> shows<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.420> life<00:02:07.570> of<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.840> battery<00:02:08.170> that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
it shows the life of the battery that

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.469 
it shows the life of the battery that
you<00:02:08.349> have<00:02:08.619> left<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.190> this<00:02:09.700> side<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.209> right

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
you have left on this side and right

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.269 
you have left on this side and right
here<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.840> have<00:02:10.869> 3<00:02:11.260> different<00:02:11.439> settings<00:02:12.040> for

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:12.279 
here you have 3 different settings for

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.789 
here you have 3 different settings for
your<00:02:12.909> power<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.930> right<00:02:14.109> here<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.469> on<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
your power so right here it's on the

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.040 
your power so right here it's on the
middle<00:02:15.069> which<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.549> if<00:02:15.700> you're<00:02:15.849> on<00:02:15.879> a<00:02:16.029> flat

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
middle which is if you're on a flat

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.570 
middle which is if you're on a flat
there<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.530> gives<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> little<00:02:18.010> more<00:02:18.310> juice

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
there it gives you a little more juice

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.550 
there it gives you a little more juice
say<00:02:18.820> if<00:02:18.880> you're<00:02:19.030> going<00:02:19.210> uphill<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.020> if<00:02:20.440> you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
say if you're going uphill and if you

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.860 
say if you're going uphill and if you
were<00:02:20.770> going<00:02:20.950> downhill<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:22.180> order<00:02:22.420> just<00:02:22.450> wanted

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
were going downhill in order just wanted

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.290 
were going downhill in order just wanted
less<00:02:23.050> power<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.830> use<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.160> button<00:02:24.460> so

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
less power you use that button so

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.720 
less power you use that button so
depending<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:26.500> you're<00:02:26.620> going<00:02:26.860> uphill<00:02:27.100> what

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
depending on if you're going uphill what

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.390 
depending on if you're going uphill what
your<00:02:27.910> weight<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.330> will<00:02:29.020> vary<00:02:29.350> in<00:02:29.530> how<00:02:29.770> far<00:02:30.280> you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
your weight is will vary in how far you

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.850 
your weight is will vary in how far you
