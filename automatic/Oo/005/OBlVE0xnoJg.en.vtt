be allowed near bike anyway here is my
proof<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.010> take<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> real<00:00:41.430> close<00:00:41.610> look<00:00:41.850> at

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
proof if you take a real close look at

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.840 
proof if you take a real close look at
this<00:00:42.210> bike<00:00:42.620> which<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> mountain<00:00:44.489> sport

Roadmaster you can notice that the forks

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.250 
Roadmaster you can notice that the forks
are<00:00:49.500> actually<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.550> backwards<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.750> handlebars

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
are actually on backwards the handlebars

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.040 
are actually on backwards the handlebars
are<00:00:52.590> spun<00:00:52.860> 180<00:00:53.280> degrees<00:00:53.550> around<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.390> even

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
are spun 180 degrees around it even

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.110 
are spun 180 degrees around it even
though<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> tire<00:00:55.559> tread<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> still<00:00:56.610> facing<00:00:56.850> in

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
though the tire tread is still facing in

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.250 
though the tire tread is still facing in
the<00:00:57.210> same<00:00:57.239> direction<00:00:59.180> it<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.480> baffles<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the same direction it just baffles the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
the same direction it just baffles the
mind<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.820> bike<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.359> leave

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
mind to think that this bike can leave

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.500 
mind to think that this bike can leave
the<00:01:03.719> store<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.979> condition<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the store in this condition see the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.359 
the store in this condition see the
calipers<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.200> long<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> front<00:01:07.680> another

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
calipers be long in the front another

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.660 
calipers be long in the front another
thing<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.830> need<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> camera<00:01:11.520> here

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
thing is I need to get the camera here

thing is I need to get the camera here
to<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> close-up<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:14.869> but<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.960> can

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
to get a close-up of this but you can

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.490 
to get a close-up of this but you can
see<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> crazy<00:01:16.799> angle<00:01:17.840> that<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> bike<00:01:19.140> livers

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
see the crazy angle that the bike livers

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.480 
see the crazy angle that the bike livers
are<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.670> brake<00:01:20.939> lever<00:01:22.490> does

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
are at you can see this brake lever does

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.160 
are at you can see this brake lever does
not<00:01:23.700> even<00:01:23.939> attached<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> brake<00:01:24.630> cable<00:01:24.990> so

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
not even attached to the brake cable so

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.649 
not even attached to the brake cable so
there<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.409> no<00:01:25.590> action<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.430> calipers<00:01:26.909> when

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
there is no action on the calipers when

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.319 
there is no action on the calipers when
I<00:01:27.689> pull<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.369> also<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.729> pointed<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.180> too

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
I pull it and also it's pointed up too

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.120 
I pull it and also it's pointed up too
high<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> about<00:01:31.920> down

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
high you want that to be it about down

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.080 
high you want that to be it about down
right<00:01:32.369> there<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.579> ridiculous

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
right there this is this is ridiculous

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.899 
right there this is this is ridiculous
here<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:37.079> another<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.340> when<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
here is another thing is that when you

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.149 
here is another thing is that when you
spin<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> crank<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:42.600> crank<00:01:42.750> arm<00:01:43.049> hit<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.530> can't

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
spin the crank the crank arm hit I can't

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.560 
spin the crank the crank arm hit I can't
really<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.490> from<00:01:44.670> there<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.240> we'll<00:01:45.390> spin

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
really see from there so we'll spin

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.789 
really see from there so we'll spin
around<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.700> crank<00:01:47.700> arm<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.149> hitting<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.799> real

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
around the crank arm is hitting the real

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.100 
around the crank arm is hitting the real
cheap<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.340> flimsy<00:01:50.460> kickstand<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.450> people

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
cheap and flimsy kickstand and people

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.399 
cheap and flimsy kickstand and people
will<00:01:52.229> actually<00:01:52.380> bring<00:01:52.740> their<00:01:52.950> bikes<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.369> and
