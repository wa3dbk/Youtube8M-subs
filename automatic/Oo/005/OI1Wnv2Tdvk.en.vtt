powerful<00:01:42.270> too<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.680> lobby<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.369> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
powerful too so I use this lobby one so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.730 
powerful too so I use this lobby one so
if<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.759> put<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> be

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
if you put this in this is going to be

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.740 
if you put this in this is going to be
it's<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> give<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> user<00:01:47.549> slash<00:01:48.180> Lobby

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it's going to give the user slash Lobby

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.210 
it's going to give the user slash Lobby
and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> run<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.950> command

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and then it's going to run this command

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.760 
and then it's going to run this command
warp<00:01:50.850> lobby<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> still<00:01:52.290> set<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
warp lobby so you have to still set the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.139 
warp lobby so you have to still set the
warp<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.310> want<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:53.939> they

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
warp that you want them to use they

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.910 
warp that you want them to use they
still<00:01:54.420> need<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.869> permissions<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
still need to have the permissions to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.770 
still need to have the permissions to
run<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.399> command<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.570> not

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
run this command because if they do not

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.810 
run this command because if they do not
have<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> permissions<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.310> run<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.640> command

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
have the permissions to run this command

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.990 
have the permissions to run this command
they<00:02:00.689> won't<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.350> able<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.729> I

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
they won't be able to get to it so I

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.700 
they won't be able to get to it so I
know<00:02:03.060> some<00:02:03.450> aliases<00:02:03.960> out<00:02:04.079> there<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.409> allow

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
know some aliases out there will allow

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.889 
know some aliases out there will allow
you<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.130> run<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.610> commands<00:02:05.939> from<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> console

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
you to run the commands from the console

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.979 
you to run the commands from the console
or<00:02:07.409> bypassing<00:02:07.890> permissions<00:02:08.629> this<00:02:09.629> doesn't

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
or bypassing permissions this doesn't

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.869 
or bypassing permissions this doesn't
have<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.200> functionality<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.760> how

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
have this functionality this is just how

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.920 
have this functionality this is just how
it<00:02:12.000> works<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.330> they<00:02:12.450> still<00:02:12.660> need<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
it works so they still need the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.850 
it works so they still need the
essentials<00:02:13.410> don't

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
essentials don't

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.460 
essentials don't
or<00:02:13.980> or<00:02:14.940> essentials<00:02:15.480> dot<00:02:15.660> warps<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.320> then

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
or or essentials dot warps and then

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.360 
or or essentials dot warps and then
essentials<00:02:16.980> dot<00:02:17.130> warp<00:02:17.460> dot<00:02:18.050> this<00:02:19.050> or<00:02:19.950> whatever

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
essentials dot warp dot this or whatever

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.400 
essentials dot warp dot this or whatever
however<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.300> have<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.690> your<00:02:21.960> permission

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
however you have your your permission

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.150 
however you have your your permission
set<00:02:22.620> up<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:24.210> command<00:02:25.080> also<00:02:25.530> allows<00:02:25.830> you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
set up so this command also allows you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.310 
set up so this command also allows you
to<00:02:26.610> pass<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.560> variables<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.040> by<00:02:29.580> using<00:02:29.820> this

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
to pass a variables to it by using this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.990 
to pass a variables to it by using this
dollar<00:02:31.320> sign<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.830> then<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.980> number<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.790> can

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
dollar sign and then a number so you can

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.160 
dollar sign and then a number so you can
use<00:02:33.180> multiple<00:02:33.510> variables<00:02:34.170> per<00:02:34.940> alias<00:02:36.170> you

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
use multiple variables per alias you

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.720 
use multiple variables per alias you
just<00:02:37.320> got<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.530> use<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> different<00:02:37.950> number<00:02:38.310> form

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
just got to use a different number form

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.280 
just got to use a different number form
because<00:02:39.060> they<00:02:39.240> will<00:02:39.420> reference<00:02:39.930> each<00:02:40.080> other

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
because they will reference each other

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.640 
because they will reference each other
if<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.980> use<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.370> same<00:02:41.550> number<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.240> then<00:02:42.990> if

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
if you use the same number and then if

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.290 
if you use the same number and then if
you<00:02:43.800> put<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> hyphen<00:02:44.459> at<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.670> end<00:02:44.820> this<00:02:45.060> means

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you put a hyphen at the end this means

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.900 
you put a hyphen at the end this means
it's<00:02:45.540> going<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.780> be<00:02:45.870> returning<00:02:46.620> something

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
it's going to be returning something

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.110 
it's going to be returning something
printing<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.090> out<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:50.459> we'll<00:02:50.670> go<00:02:50.790> over<00:02:50.820> that

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
printing that out so we'll go over that

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.810 
printing that out so we'll go over that
this<00:02:51.690> actually<00:02:52.260> allows<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.920> do<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> lot<00:02:53.760> of

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
this actually allows you to do a lot of

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.210 
this actually allows you to do a lot of
cool<00:02:54.030> stuff<00:02:54.330> with<00:02:54.390> essentials<00:02:55.320> custom<00:02:55.830> text

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
cool stuff with essentials custom text

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.790 
cool stuff with essentials custom text

with everybody because it's so neat um
so<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.150> variables<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.260> what<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.100> command<00:03:14.370> is

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
so the variables so what this command is

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.940 
so the variables so what this command is
going<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.730> do<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.270> if<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:16.170> run<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.770> command

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
going to do is if you run this command

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.640 
going to do is if you run this command
give<00:03:17.310> D<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:18.000> got<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.299> put<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.690> one<00:03:19.140> two

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
give D you got to put in one two

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.009 
give D you got to put in one two
variables<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:21.360> first<00:03:21.540> variable<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.930> going

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
variables so the first variable is going

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.759 
variables so the first variable is going
to<00:03:22.110> be<00:03:22.170> obviously<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.709> user<00:03:23.100> name<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.640> then

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
to be obviously the user name and then

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.560 
to be obviously the user name and then
this<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.100> item<00:03:26.370> ID<00:03:26.519> for<00:03:26.910> diamonds<00:03:27.390> and

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
this is the item ID for diamonds and

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.259 
this is the item ID for diamonds and
then<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.350> number<00:03:29.010> well<00:03:29.519> that's<00:03:29.970> how<00:03:30.090> we're

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
then the number well that's how we're

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.300 
then the number well that's how we're
going<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.450> run<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.470> what<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:32.100> going<00:03:32.250> to

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
going to run it so what this is going to

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.759 
going to run it so what this is going to
do<00:03:32.549> is<00:03:32.820> it's<00:03:33.540> going<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.720> give<00:03:34.019> whatever

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
do is it's going to give whatever

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.370 
do is it's going to give whatever
username<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.430> put<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.790> there<00:03:36.110> diamonds<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
username I put in there diamonds and the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.920 
username I put in there diamonds and the
number<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.010> put<00:03:38.250> at<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.489> end<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.570> then

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
number that I put at the end so and then

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.199 
number that I put at the end so and then
if<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.709> want<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.980> do<00:03:41.040> multiple<00:03:41.549> lines<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:42.060> an

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
if you want to do multiple lines to an

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.180 
if you want to do multiple lines to an
alias<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:43.019> can<00:03:43.110> do<00:03:43.200> multiple<00:03:43.440> commands<00:03:44.010> you

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
alias you can do multiple commands you

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.370 
alias you can do multiple commands you
can<00:03:44.250> do<00:03:44.400> multiple<00:03:44.580> stays<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.600> can<00:03:45.780> do<00:03:45.900> all

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
can do multiple stays you can do all

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.100 
can do multiple stays you can do all
that<00:03:46.440> stuff<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.880> then<00:03:48.030> it's<00:03:48.180> going<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.360> be<00:03:48.510> say

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
that stuff so then it's going to be say

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.699 
that stuff so then it's going to be say
give<00:03:49.950> um<00:03:50.510> it's<00:03:51.510> going<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.780> use<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.110> variable

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
give um it's going to use this variable

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.470 
give um it's going to use this variable
username<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.610> then<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.850> number<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.239> diamonds

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
username and then the number of diamonds

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.660 
username and then the number of diamonds
for<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.709> mount<00:03:55.980> now<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.250> need<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.489> put<00:03:56.610> a

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
for this mount now you need to put a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.300 
for this mount now you need to put a
backslash<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.660> front<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.230> dollar<00:03:58.769> sign<00:03:59.100> if

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
backslash in front of a dollar sign if

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.890 
backslash in front of a dollar sign if
you<00:03:59.370> don't<00:03:59.730> want<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.030> use<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.209> as<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> variable

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
you don't want to use it as a variable

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.170 
you don't want to use it as a variable
that's<00:04:01.230> how<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.650> negates<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.640> out<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:03.060> there

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
that's how it negates that out of there

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.199 
that's how it negates that out of there
so<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:04.200> can<00:04:04.380> then<00:04:04.560> also<00:04:04.799> put<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.489> double<00:04:06.000> dollar

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
so you can then also put a double dollar

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.479 
so you can then also put a double dollar
sign<00:04:06.540> in<00:04:06.750> there<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.110> what<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:07.500> means<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.250> it

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
sign in there and what that means is it

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.130 
sign in there and what that means is it
that<00:04:08.760> variable<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.959> required<00:04:10.560> um<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:12.140> don't

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
that variable is required um I don't

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.870 
that variable is required um I don't
know<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.680> that's<00:04:13.980> just<00:04:14.190> that's<00:04:14.519> what<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.850> is

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
know that that's just that's what it is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.539 
know that that's just that's what it is
so<00:04:15.239> let's<00:04:15.570> get<00:04:15.930> into<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:17.010> server<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.370> just

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
so let's get into the server and just

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.080 
so let's get into the server and just
see<00:04:17.910> how<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.600> goes<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.380> think<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:20.250> like<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.940> see

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
see how this goes I think I like to see

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.120 
see how this goes I think I like to see
how<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.359> works<00:04:21.570> that's<00:04:22.049> how<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.289> learned<00:04:22.650> so<00:04:22.890> I'm

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
how it works that's how I learned so I'm

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.440 
how it works that's how I learned so I'm
just<00:04:23.280> going<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.460> put<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:23.880> up<00:04:24.120> on<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.270> screen

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
just going to put this up on the screen

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.029 
just going to put this up on the screen
when<00:04:24.810> we<00:04:24.930> hop<00:04:25.110> on<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.349> server<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.800> can

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
when we hop on the server so you can

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:26.730 
when we hop on the server so you can
compare

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
compare

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.820 
compare
and<00:04:26.949> see<00:04:27.699> it<00:04:27.820> so<00:04:28.150> let's<00:04:28.180> hop<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:29.050> there<00:04:29.289> okay<00:04:29.770> so

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
and see it so let's hop in there okay so

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.520 
and see it so let's hop in there okay so
here<00:04:30.160> we<00:04:30.280> are<00:04:30.310> in<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.550> server<00:04:30.789> if<00:04:31.120> you

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
here we are in the server if you

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.200 
here we are in the server if you
recognize<00:04:32.530> this<00:04:32.919> it's<00:04:33.370> because<00:04:33.669> you're<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.000> big

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
recognize this it's because you're a big

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.600 
recognize this it's because you're a big
fan<00:04:34.449> and<00:04:34.690> this<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.199> tutorial<00:04:35.949> I<00:04:36.039> went<00:04:36.280> over

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
fan and this is the tutorial I went over

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.770 
fan and this is the tutorial I went over
last<00:04:36.729> week<00:04:37.000> or<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.240> server<00:04:37.479> from<00:04:37.720> the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
last week or the server from the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.840 
last week or the server from the
tutorial<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.500> went<00:04:38.710> off<00:04:38.800> over<00:04:39.009> last<00:04:39.400> week<00:04:39.669> but

tutorial I went off over last week but

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.779 
tutorial I went off over last week but
anyway<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:41.380> commands<00:04:41.800> remember<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.400> special

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
anyway the commands remember the special

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.270 
anyway the commands remember the special
warp<00:04:43.120> commands<00:04:43.389> we<00:04:43.539> got<00:04:43.660> shop<00:04:44.350> and<00:04:44.680> then<00:04:45.190> we

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
warp commands we got shop and then we

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.640 
warp commands we got shop and then we
got<00:04:45.430> Lobby<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.270> then<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.139> big<00:04:47.320> one<00:04:47.500> that<00:04:47.530> we

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
got Lobby and then the big one that we

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.350 
got Lobby and then the big one that we
were<00:04:47.830> with<00:04:48.340> we<00:04:48.580> were<00:04:48.669> kind<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:48.940> playing<00:04:49.090> with

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
were with we were kind of playing with

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.469 
were with we were kind of playing with
is<00:04:49.539> a<00:04:49.570> gif<00:04:49.960> D<00:04:50.199> give<00:04:50.680> Diamonds<00:04:51.220> username<00:04:52.180> and

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
is a gif D give Diamonds username and

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.650 
is a gif D give Diamonds username and
then<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:53.100> number<00:04:54.100> so<00:04:54.520> as<00:04:54.789> you<00:04:55.150> can<00:04:55.270> see<00:04:55.419> here

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
then the number so as you can see here

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.230 
then the number so as you can see here
it's<00:04:55.870> giving<00:04:56.289> nine<00:04:56.949> diamonds<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.699> me<00:04:57.940> that's

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
it's giving nine diamonds to me that's

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.540 
it's giving nine diamonds to me that's
the<00:04:58.389> first<00:04:58.449> line<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.259> that<00:04:59.410> command<00:04:59.919> the

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
the first line of that command the

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.659 
the first line of that command the
second<00:05:00.940> line<00:05:01.090> is<00:05:02.250> announcing<00:05:03.250> out

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
second line is announcing out

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.680 
second line is announcing out
server<00:05:03.880> gave<00:05:04.410> that<00:05:05.410> variable<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.580> number<00:05:07.180> so

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
server gave that variable that number so

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.400 
server gave that variable that number so
remember<00:05:08.050> that's<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.380> one<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:09.009> two<00:05:09.310> for

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
remember that's the one and two for

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.230 
remember that's the one and two for
$9,001<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.680> then<00:05:11.830> it's<00:05:12.310> showing<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:12.970> dollar

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
$9,001 and then it's showing the dollar

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.180 
$9,001 and then it's showing the dollar
sign<00:05:13.479> because<00:05:13.630> we<00:05:13.810> commented<00:05:14.500> that<00:05:14.530> out<00:05:14.889> so

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
sign because we commented that out so
