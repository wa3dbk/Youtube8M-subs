versatility of a bipod a new revolution
by<00:00:24.940> pocket<00:00:25.330> so<00:00:26.140> basically<00:00:26.830> what<00:00:27.040> we<00:00:27.160> have<00:00:27.340> here

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.370 
by pocket so basically what we have here

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.130 
by pocket so basically what we have here
is<00:00:27.880> a<00:00:28.870> a<00:00:29.260> ar-15<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:31.240> we<00:00:31.450> haven't<00:00:31.630> mounted<00:00:31.990> up

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
is a a ar-15 but we haven't mounted up

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.440 
is a a ar-15 but we haven't mounted up
with<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:33.399> new<00:00:33.550> revolution<00:00:33.760> bipod

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
with the the new revolution bipod

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.029 
with the the new revolution bipod
basically<00:00:35.350> it<00:00:36.340> is<00:00:36.579> a<00:00:36.730> press<00:00:37.570> push<00:00:37.989> system<00:00:38.260> we

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
basically it is a press push system we

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.130 
basically it is a press push system we
can<00:00:39.219> actually<00:00:39.460> just<00:00:39.699> use<00:00:39.820> your<00:00:40.120> thumbs<00:00:40.329> you

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
can actually just use your thumbs you

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.479 
can actually just use your thumbs you
can<00:00:41.289> make<00:00:41.409> it<00:00:41.559> go<00:00:41.679> anywhere<00:00:41.890> you<00:00:42.100> want<00:00:42.129> to<00:00:42.339> go

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
can make it go anywhere you want to go

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.700 
can make it go anywhere you want to go
45<00:00:43.239> degree<00:00:43.510> forward<00:00:43.870> all<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.140> way<00:00:44.350> forward

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
45 degree forward all the way forward

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.399 
45 degree forward all the way forward
all<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.699> way<00:00:45.819> down<00:00:46.120> to<00:00:46.569> the<00:00:46.659> 90<00:00:46.960> degrees<00:00:47.199> all

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
all the way down to the 90 degrees all

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.040 
all the way down to the 90 degrees all
the<00:00:47.440> way<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.679> the<00:00:47.769> back<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.629> nice<00:00:49.809> thing<00:00:50.019> about

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
the way to the back the nice thing about

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.079 
the way to the back the nice thing about
the<00:00:50.379> bipod<00:00:50.769> is<00:00:50.800> that<00:00:51.309> we<00:00:51.460> can<00:00:51.609> actually<00:00:51.760> have<00:00:52.030> a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
the bipod is that we can actually have a

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.119 
the bipod is that we can actually have a
tension<00:00:52.539> right<00:00:52.690> here<00:00:52.719> so<00:00:53.469> we<00:00:53.589> can<00:00:53.620> set<00:00:53.979> the

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
tension right here so we can set the

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.639 
tension right here so we can set the
pressure<00:00:54.399> of<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:54.699> bipod<00:00:55.089> and<00:00:55.499> actually<00:00:56.499> get

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
pressure of the bipod and actually get

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.770 
pressure of the bipod and actually get
the<00:00:56.769> gun<00:00:56.979> as<00:00:57.670> stable<00:00:57.969> as<00:00:58.179> we<00:00:58.300> want<00:00:58.539> to<00:00:58.600> get

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
the gun as stable as we want to get

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.910 
the gun as stable as we want to get
it'll<00:00:59.019> get<00:00:59.139> to<00:00:59.289> there<00:01:00.280> is<00:01:00.460> no<00:01:00.609> angle<00:01:01.030> problems

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it'll get to there is no angle problems

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.910 
it'll get to there is no angle problems
because<00:01:02.920> we<00:01:03.159> could<00:01:03.309> actually<00:01:03.460> press<00:01:03.969> forward

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because we could actually press forward

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.210 
because we could actually press forward
and<00:01:05.920> then<00:01:06.820> go<00:01:06.970> ahead<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.180> take<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.540> shot<00:01:08.220> want

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
and then go ahead and take the shot want

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.580 
and then go ahead and take the shot want
to<00:01:09.310> go<00:01:09.400> 45<00:01:09.880> degree<00:01:10.150> forward<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:10.960> get<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> more

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
to go 45 degree forward and get a more

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.130 
to go 45 degree forward and get a more
stable<00:01:11.830> shot<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:13.060> can<00:01:13.270> still<00:01:13.480> get<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.840> weapon

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
stable shot you can still get the weapon

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.720 
stable shot you can still get the weapon
in<00:01:14.230> this<00:01:14.320> position<00:01:15.040> to<00:01:15.160> where<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.400> can<00:01:15.550> have

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
in this position to where you can have

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.180 
in this position to where you can have
it<00:01:15.850> nice<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.030> flat<00:01:16.390> which<00:01:17.260> is<00:01:17.290> absolutely<00:01:17.950> key

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
it nice and flat which is absolutely key

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.650 
it nice and flat which is absolutely key
when<00:01:18.220> you're<00:01:18.550> doing<00:01:18.850> precision<00:01:19.300> rifle

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
when you're doing precision rifle

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.890 
when you're doing precision rifle
shooting<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.460> other<00:01:21.520> option<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.120> to<00:01:22.180> is<00:01:22.720> that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
shooting the other option is to is that

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.400 
shooting the other option is to is that
if<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.230> have<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.620> do<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.740> press<00:01:24.070> shot<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:26.380> I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
if you have to do a press shot what I

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.010

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
would do basically single-leg it right

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.230 
would do basically single-leg it right
into<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.380> side<00:01:29.620> of<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.830> door<00:01:29.980> jamb<00:01:30.250> window
