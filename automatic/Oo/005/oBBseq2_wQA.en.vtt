00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 They run out of time. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 And if we fail, 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.200
 we have to wait 5000 years. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.400
 I don't know about you, but I won't give that much time. 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.000
 The planets will align ... 

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:30.000
 It's the Illuminati. Their ancestors will revive it. 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.500
 ... time stops ... 

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:34.000
 Did you hear about the Hours of Ages? 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.000
 They give their owner too much light. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 ... and the fate of mankind ... 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Eternal hell will come alive again! 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.500
 ... will be in the hands ... 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 ... one person. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Don't start. 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.500
 HEIRESS 

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:53.000
 You are quite a great expert on ancient and mysterious things. 

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.000
 That's why I travel. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.300
 PRÅ®ZKUMNICE 

00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:00.500
 They are ancient clocks. They were hidden in a secret room. 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.000
 Shining and still clearer. 

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.500
 Like counting something down. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 ADVENTURER 

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.000
 You can build, destroy, move in time. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 The future is yours now, Lara. 

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.000
 You're the only one who has the power to destroy the power of light. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.500
 - We could be partners. - You might try to kill me. 

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:22.000
 - I won't kill you. - But you try. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.400
 TOMB RAIDER 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.000
 Time to save the universe? 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Anyway. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Biggest Adventure ... 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.500
 ... will begin ... 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 ... Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft. 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.000
 It's getting fun here. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
