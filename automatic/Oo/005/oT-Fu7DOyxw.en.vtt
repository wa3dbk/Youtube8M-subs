the<00:01:39.470> radio<00:01:39.830> slid<00:01:40.310> forward<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.210> can<00:01:41.390> see<00:01:41.450> that

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
the radio slid forward you can see that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.170 
the radio slid forward you can see that
there<00:01:41.990> will<00:01:42.140> be<00:01:42.170> four<00:01:42.530> connectors<00:01:43.070> total<00:01:43.549> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
there will be four connectors total the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.630 
there will be four connectors total the
far<00:01:44.840> right-hand<00:01:45.200> side<00:01:45.770> as<00:01:46.010> we're<00:01:46.220> looking<00:01:46.369> at

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
far right-hand side as we're looking at

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.240 
far right-hand side as we're looking at
it<00:01:46.700> would<00:01:46.970> have<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:48.229> antenna<00:01:48.799> connection

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
it would have the antenna connection

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.039 
it would have the antenna connection
which<00:01:49.520> has<00:01:49.670> already<00:01:49.850> been<00:01:50.060> disconnected<00:01:50.659> that

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
which has already been disconnected that

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.219 
which has already been disconnected that
