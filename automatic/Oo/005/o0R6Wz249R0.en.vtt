of 249 each you do get one a finger and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.819 
of 249 each you do get one a finger and
we<00:00:38.220> get<00:00:38.400> a<00:00:38.640> card<00:00:39.170> conclude<00:00:40.170> these<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.530> well<00:00:40.710> as

you<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.130> two<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:41.700> they<00:00:42.630> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.900> see

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you have two of these they you can see

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.920 
you have two of these they you can see
the<00:00:43.260> figures<00:00:43.790> that<00:00:44.790> you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.270> close<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.690> there

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.260 
the figures that you can close and there
is<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.320> let's<00:00:46.590> open<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:49.400> inside<00:00:50.400> we<00:00:51.090> don't

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
is so let's open this up inside we don't

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.050 
is so let's open this up inside we don't
have<00:00:51.450> a<00:00:51.480> ripped<00:00:51.810> up<00:00:51.990> on<00:00:52.110> these<00:00:52.290> so<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.400> will<00:00:53.760> have

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
have a ripped up on these so I will have

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.040 
have a ripped up on these so I will have
to<00:00:54.300> use<00:00:54.500> she<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:56.060> open<00:00:57.060> it<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.330> and<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:57.840> what

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to use she just open it up and see what

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.700 
to use she just open it up and see what
we<00:00:58.200> get

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710

we get
so<00:00:59.670> our<00:00:59.880> first<00:01:00.210> figure<00:01:00.900> looks<00:01:01.200> very<00:01:01.500> cool<00:01:01.940> how

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so our first figure looks very cool how

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.469 
so our first figure looks very cool how
good<00:01:03.360> is<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.799> movable<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:05.009> well<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.330> get

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
good is that movable as well so you get

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.590 
good is that movable as well so you get
this<00:01:06.600> cardboard<00:01:07.290> inserts<00:01:07.830> included<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.420> put

this cardboard inserts included and put
that<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.110> side<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.850> Dino

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that to one side and this is Dino

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.709 
that to one side and this is Dino
Megazord<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:14.220> does<00:01:14.460> look<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.119> really

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
Megazord which does look like a really

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.109 
Megazord which does look like a really
cool<00:01:15.929> figure<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:16.859> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.340> use<00:01:17.579> this<00:01:17.820> with

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
cool figure now you can use this with

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.249 
cool figure now you can use this with
the<00:01:18.450> morph<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.499> believe<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:21.259> Power

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the morph I do believe it is the Power

Rangers<00:01:22.740> Megaforce<00:01:23.060> morva<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.420> fact<00:01:24.719> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
Rangers Megaforce morva more fact that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.169 
Rangers Megaforce morva more fact that
you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.200> use<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.700> sure<00:01:26.939> those

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
you can use that with and I'm sure those

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.499 
you can use that with and I'm sure those
do<00:01:27.509> unlock<00:01:27.960> phrases<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> figure

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
do unlock phrases so there is the figure

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.429 
do unlock phrases so there is the figure
you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.749> move<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.560> body<00:01:31.920> around<00:01:33.409> both<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
you can move the body around both of

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.539 
you can move the body around both of
that<00:01:35.990> he's<00:01:36.990> won<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.289> really<00:01:37.770> cool<00:01:38.100> looking

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
that he's won a really cool looking

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.940 
that he's won a really cool looking
figure<00:01:38.969> let's<00:01:39.119> pull<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.359> there<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.749> do<00:01:39.929> get<00:01:40.139> an

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
figure let's pull up there we do get an

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.819 
figure let's pull up there we do get an
insert<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.759> these<00:01:41.969> as<00:01:42.270> well<00:01:42.569> and<00:01:43.109> it<00:01:43.469> does<00:01:43.649> it

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.190 
good I am very pleased with that to
start<00:02:04.920> off<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.149> there<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.659> go<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.170> one

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
start off so there you go there is one

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.820 
start off so there you go there is one
will<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.190> harvested<00:02:08.759> spawns<00:02:09.000> biggest<00:02:09.830> join

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
will be harvested spawns biggest join

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
will be harvested spawns biggest join
the<00:02:11.160> ladder<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.580> could<00:02:11.819> show<00:02:12.240> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
the ladder I could show you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.020 
the ladder I could show you
so<00:02:13.500> it's

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
so it's

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.950 
so it's
get<00:02:14.270> into<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.410> second<00:02:16.070> bag<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.910> we<00:02:17.540> do<00:02:17.720> have

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
get into the second bag and we do have

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.190 
get into the second bag and we do have
what<00:02:18.890> seems<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.370> be<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.730> blue<00:02:20.090> arranger<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.050> the

what seems to be a blue arranger in the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.600 
what seems to be a blue arranger in the
translucent<00:02:22.130> colors<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:24.230> let's<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.430> look
