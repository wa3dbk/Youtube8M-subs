00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.400
 and still in the youtube era in the video of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.170
 today I bring a deskjet boxing here 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.060
 3546 which is a multifunctional 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.949
 career 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.619
 I'll show you some of this 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.170
 printer and I'm going to focus a bit more 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.359
 it is an analysis when it has mounted 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.369
 Yeah, because it's going to be a little tricky. 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.560
 take it inside the box and not take 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.590
 You, then I 'll make a good one that he 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.840
 said a little about it the dopou show 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.670
 A little bit that you have in the box here and then 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.399
 I'll show the set up that I think 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.860
 It's going to get a little better , it's us. 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.320
 see I can show you how 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.309
 does this printer work then to deat 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 jet 3546 is a wireless person is that she 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.399
 print checks copy and I do not know the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.289
 that's it but she has a resource photo 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.290
 so maybe we're from something 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.430
 Then when it's set up for you. 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.189
 to after 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:17.040
 is it can connect to web with hp 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.909
 school has a direct wireless connection 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.909
 like your computer 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.479
 it has a high-quality monochrome display 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.240
 resolution that is actually a screen like 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.700
 is monochrome a screen with only one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.220
 like in it nor the white color then deep 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.869
 her is black and even the color bank but she 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 in high resolution 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:49.310
 I believe that this high resolution is 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:52.170
 is in some cases even that attention 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 much attention to perceive what is 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.399
 written there so I think that what 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.650
 at least what you can see 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.820
 she seems to have a very high quality. 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.390
 So you can see that the environment is for 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.850
 who's watching is really from afar 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.680
 when you get little for me 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.660
 That's the one we'll see some more. 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.860
 then when amy if it really is true 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.220
 that it me that the hp eprint feature that 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.480
 you can print files from your 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.240
 directly connected tablet smartphone is 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.970
 a link there we will ask because it is second 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.810
 hp and the best print at the most cost 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.810
 low 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.820
 so she uses two ink cartridges in 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.810
 a cartridge of three colors and one 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.300
 black cartridge is that from what I saw is a 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.190
 very cheap cartridge compared to the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.410
 old printer I had is a 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.630
 and stopped cartridge I go there 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:58.010
 asking here for you 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:58.010
 and then just after traveling 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:16.130
 so I'll be right back 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.740
 show more to you 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.770
 and then I'm back here now with the 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.530
 printer already mounted here and here you 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.080
 can see a little of her design, right? 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.170
 Being sincere with you, I missed a 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.510
 A little that design is but it's more because I 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.130
 I was used to a model 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.350
 of hp had a very 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.900
 different did not have a certain 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.400
 beginning strangeness because it is a 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.130
 printer over there 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.010
 the highest and well - fulfilled then had 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.550
 some strangeness so linking her here 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.550
 for you 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.750
 so I'll show you a little bit quickly 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.070
 printer here 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:10.760
 here is where you do a scan of your 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:13.010
 normal files here where the cartridges 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.990
 of ink on the inside you make the 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.079
 change here and it opens up here 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.570
 very different from the old model 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.000
 that had 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.010
 What black and 14 curly cartridge that 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.310
 Is not it 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.300
 the shock today appeared a message to 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.300
 He's gone now. 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:42.050
 so here it is worse only than jett in 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:43.970
 every fan is the most good here is where 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.190
 the printing paper in the power of 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.190
 more space here 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.760
 he too 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.889
 it can also go on 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.650
 I think it's one of the main 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:08.150
 right defects is to make you a 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.669
 impression that you push it up 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.139
 demonstrate it 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:18.280
 I think this is a defect 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:24.220
 I really liked touching her screen . 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.220
 maybe a little reflex but that's it 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.789
 It's not for those who are very visible here. 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.470
 you can for example consult the 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:39.909
 Ink levels can do a lot 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:43.789
 here you have ue fainÃ© c as well 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:47.180
 has a button of Czech coffers here you 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:49.370
 can send copy scan same as 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.319
 they in such obligations is because of 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:58.610
 of ujs is a strength of this printer 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:01.190
 in my view was the fact that 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.289
 connectivity is that it already has 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.180
 various types of connections 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.099
 you can connect the printer via 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.190
 cable that does not come cable together is good 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.690
 stay you pay attention to it 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.240
 on the streets are thinking of buying a 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.340
 printer do not see a cable together that is 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.280
 a little bad for some people who 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.110
 have computer for example older 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.330
 that does not have wi fi or so I do not have 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.880
 There went into the house for some reason. 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.530
 so I could not connect and buy 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.680
 a separate car not that the car is 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.740
 very expensive but it 's an hour I think 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.060
 hp that could make the cable available 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.960
 everyone 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.900
 That's what else he's told me 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.370
 watched the ease of connecting right 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.530
 I think that 's the main point 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.360
 of this printer because you can 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.650
 connect it via cable, I did not have a 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.990
 Printer Car The Boy Selling 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.199
 I already know about this printer and 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.199
 on a computer with the cable, I connected 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:59.569
 via wifi notebook was already in a 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.969
 tablet direct print app 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:04.279
 so it's a huge facility you 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:05.330
 you can also create an email and send a 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:09.470
 archive 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.509
 It is a file by its the first of 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.419
 the printer will receive this 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:17.229
 and will print the file you have in 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:20.599
 attached so I think this is pretty cool 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:24.560
 It's not a novelty but I found it 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:27.259
 So cool, so I'm done here. 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.729
 Let's try to make an impression on HP. 

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:36.229
 deskjet are now making printing 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:37.490
 It's a leaf to show you. 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:40.900
 how some of the works 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.900
 hp printing 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:51.919
 here it's ready 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:53.629
 my impression then thank you to
