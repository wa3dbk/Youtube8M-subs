00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
sure must you are know about this but

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.070 
sure must you are know about this but
just<00:03:50.880> hold<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.270> crossbar<00:03:51.690> here<00:03:51.840> with<00:03:51.930> one

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
just hold the crossbar here with one

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.620 
just hold the crossbar here with one
hand<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.470> then<00:03:52.590> go<00:03:52.910> ahead<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.060> just<00:03:54.210> spin<00:03:54.510> it

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
hand and then go ahead and just spin it

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.950 
hand and then go ahead and just spin it
like<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:55.040> makes<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> little<00:03:56.280> bit<00:03:56.460> quicker

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
like that makes it a little bit quicker

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.250 
like that makes it a little bit quicker
and<00:03:57.960> I<00:03:58.230> was<00:03:58.500> if<00:03:59.370> I'm<00:03:59.580> not<00:04:00.060> using<00:04:00.300> air<00:04:00.600> tool<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:01.020> I

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
and I was if I'm not using air tool to I

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.230 
and I was if I'm not using air tool to I
always<00:04:01.860> leave<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.160> bottom<00:04:02.460> on<00:04:02.550> there<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.030> it

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
always leave the bottom on there so it

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.120 
always leave the bottom on there so it
kind<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.570> it's<00:04:03.900> holding<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.680> tire<00:04:04.890> at<00:04:05.040> all

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
kind of it's holding the tire at all

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.240 
kind of it's holding the tire at all
times<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.570> first<00:04:06.870> four<00:04:07.380> out<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.590> five<00:04:07.770> lug

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
times so the first four out of five lug

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.900 
times so the first four out of five lug
nuts<00:04:08.490> will<00:04:08.880> be<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.290> actually<00:04:10.290> easier<00:04:10.650> than<00:04:10.920> if

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
nuts will be on actually easier than if

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.410 
nuts will be on actually easier than if
you<00:04:12.150> start<00:04:13.080> from<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.410> bottom<00:04:13.710> because<00:04:13.800> then

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
you start from the bottom because then

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.590 
you start from the bottom because then
other<00:04:15.420> nuts<00:04:15.750> are<00:04:15.870> going<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.200> sitting<00:04:16.530> oh

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
other nuts are going to sitting oh

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.449 
other nuts are going to sitting oh
they'll<00:04:18.600> be<00:04:18.720> sitting<00:04:19.020> at<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.170> top<00:04:19.380> holding

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
they'll be sitting at the top holding

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.150
