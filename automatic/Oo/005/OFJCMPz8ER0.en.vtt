mentioned that I needed to replace the
cords<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:09.450> battery<00:00:09.840> charger<00:00:10.290> here

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
cords on my battery charger here

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.530 
cords on my battery charger here
obviously<00:00:11.280> they're<00:00:11.490> starting<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> get<00:00:12.269> frayed

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
obviously they're starting to get frayed

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.930 
obviously they're starting to get frayed
the<00:00:12.660> insulation<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.230> coming<00:00:13.620> off<00:00:13.769> let<00:00:14.370> me<00:00:14.519> plug

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the insulation is coming off let me plug

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.620 
the insulation is coming off let me plug
in<00:00:15.150> as<00:00:15.660> well<00:00:16.500> as<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.070> leads<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.640> go<00:00:17.789> out<00:00:17.970> plus

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
in as well as the leads that go out plus

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.990 
in as well as the leads that go out plus
leads<00:00:18.930> aren't<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.220> greatest<00:00:20.820> shape

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
leads aren't in that greatest shape

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.439 
leads aren't in that greatest shape
they're<00:00:21.300> pretty<00:00:21.510> old<00:00:21.600> kind<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.350> beat-up<00:00:23.449> so

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
they're pretty old kind of beat-up so

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.849 
they're pretty old kind of beat-up so
I'm<00:00:24.900> gonna<00:00:25.019> go<00:00:25.199> ahead<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.380> take<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.710> apart

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
I'm gonna go ahead and take this apart

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.490 
I'm gonna go ahead and take this apart
today<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.750> just<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:27.869> happens<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.199> have<00:00:28.320> another

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
today and just so happens I have another

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.349 
today and just so happens I have another
battery<00:00:28.890> charger<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.460> doesn't<00:00:30.210> work

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
battery charger that doesn't work

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.889 
battery charger that doesn't work
anymore<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.969> it's<00:00:32.969> got<00:00:33.120> very<00:00:33.329> good<00:00:33.360> cords<00:00:33.750> on

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
anymore and it's got very good cords on

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.709 
anymore and it's got very good cords on
it<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.260> gonna<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.790> swap<00:00:36.540> over

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it so I'm gonna see if I can swap over

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.229 
it so I'm gonna see if I can swap over
the<00:00:36.899> cords<00:00:37.170> fairly<00:00:37.500> easily<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.219> I'm<00:00:39.000> gonna<00:00:39.149> go

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the cords fairly easily so I'm gonna go

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.240 
the cords fairly easily so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> take<00:00:39.660> these<00:00:39.780> two<00:00:39.840> apart<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.559> we'll

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
ahead and take these two apart and we'll

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.530 
ahead and take these two apart and we'll
see<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.579> got<00:00:41.760> well<00:00:42.030> they're<00:00:42.180> connected

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
see what we got well they're connected

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.690 
see what we got well they're connected
up<00:00:42.629> inside<00:00:42.960> there<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.829> can't<00:00:44.040> swap

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
up inside there and see if I can't swap

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
up inside there and see if I can't swap
them<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:46.730> there<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:47.910> I've<00:00:48.059> got<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.510> covers

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
them out there we go I've got the covers

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.770 
them out there we go I've got the covers
off<00:00:49.620> both<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.920> them<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.449> they<00:00:51.449> are<00:00:51.539> quite

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
off both of them and they are quite

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680 
off both of them and they are quite
similar<00:00:52.050> actually<00:00:52.920> um<00:00:53.210> matter<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> fact<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
similar actually um matter of fact the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.170 
similar actually um matter of fact the
the<00:00:55.559> leaves<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:56.070> almost<00:00:56.520> identical<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the leaves are almost identical in the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.900 
the leaves are almost identical in the
way<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> screw<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.670> post

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
way to go in we just got a screw in post

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.630 
way to go in we just got a screw in post
and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> little<00:01:01.109> clip<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.949> same

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
and then a little clip there and same

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.549 
and then a little clip there and same
thing<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> clip<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
thing on this one you get a clip and a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.899 
thing on this one you get a clip and a
screw<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.100> post<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.519> that's<00:01:05.700> pretty

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
screw on post so that's pretty

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.149 
screw on post so that's pretty
straightforward<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.840> should<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.710> able<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> just

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
straightforward I should be able to just

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.350 
straightforward I should be able to just
swap<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> over<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.479> away<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
swap that over right away but the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.990 
swap that over right away but the
plug-in<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.549> different<00:01:14.880> we've

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
plug-in is a little bit different we've

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.120 
plug-in is a little bit different we've
got<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.630> wire<00:01:15.990> nut<00:01:16.200> here<00:01:16.439> split<00:01:16.710> off<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> two

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
got a wire nut here split off the two

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.210 
got a wire nut here split off the two
for<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.490> switch<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.040> one

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
for the switch on this one and this one

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.679 
for the switch on this one and this one
the<00:01:20.280> white<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.790> goes<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.119> straight<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the white one just goes in straight to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.300 
the white one just goes in straight to
the<00:01:21.780> switch<00:01:22.020> because<00:01:22.229> there's<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the switch because there's it's a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
the switch because there's it's a
two-position<00:01:23.729> switch<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.390> one's<00:01:25.159> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
two-position switch and this one's you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.600 
two-position switch and this one's you
can<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.490> from<00:01:26.990> 55<00:01:27.990> amp<00:01:28.229> 10<00:01:28.500> a.m.<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.220> an<00:01:29.400> amp<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
can go from 55 amp 10 a.m. to an amp and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.910 
can go from 55 amp 10 a.m. to an amp and
then<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> 10<00:01:30.119> amp<00:01:30.270> six<00:01:30.630> volt<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> little

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
then a 10 amp six volt so it's a little

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.140 
then a 10 amp six volt so it's a little
more<00:01:32.040> complicated<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.880> today<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
more complicated and I think for today I

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.120 
more complicated and I think for today I
may<00:01:36.390> leave<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.259> may<00:01:37.590> leave<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> power

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
may leave the I may leave the power

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.060 
may leave the I may leave the power
cords<00:01:38.460> alone<00:01:38.759> because<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.390> not<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:40.070> any

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
cords alone because I do not have any

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
cords alone because I do not have any
more<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.400> leads<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> would<00:01:42.960> have

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
more of these leads so what I would have

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.639 
more of these leads so what I would have
to<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.860> cut<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:44.970> wire<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:45.960> wire<00:01:46.530> or

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
to do is cut this wire and then wire or

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
to do is cut this wire and then wire or
not<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.579> one<00:01:47.820> along<00:01:48.600> with

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
not it like it is on this one along with

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.710 
not it like it is on this one along with
the<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.729> other<00:01:50.729> two<00:01:50.970> wires<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.360> well<00:01:51.509> because

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the the other two wires as well because

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.050 
the the other two wires as well because
this<00:01:51.780> one's<00:01:52.250> directly<00:01:53.250> soldered<00:01:53.490> right<00:01:53.820> into

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
this one's directly soldered right into

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.690 
this one's directly soldered right into
the<00:01:54.619> transformer<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> kinda<00:01:56.579> don't

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the transformer there and I kinda don't

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.700 
the transformer there and I kinda don't
want<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> mess<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> today

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
want to mess with that today

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.280 
want to mess with that today
so<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:59.070> may<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.719> throw<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:00.869> black<00:02:01.049> tape

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so I may just throw a little black tape

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.100 
so I may just throw a little black tape
on<00:02:01.439> there<00:02:01.590> these<00:02:01.740> wires<00:02:02.009> are<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:04.020> know

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
on there these wires are you know

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.539 
on there these wires are you know
they're<00:02:04.259> not<00:02:04.380> worn<00:02:04.619> through<00:02:04.770> anywhere<00:02:05.130> should

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
they're not worn through anywhere should

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.670 
they're not worn through anywhere should
be<00:02:05.670> alright<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.750> time<00:02:06.990> being<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.530> for

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
be alright for the time being and for

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.040 
be alright for the time being and for
the<00:02:07.740> little<00:02:07.890> amount<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.369> use<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.810> but<00:02:09.810> I

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the little amount that I use it but I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.010 
the little amount that I use it but I
can<00:02:10.700> indeed<00:02:11.700> swap<00:02:12.060> these<00:02:12.239> out<00:02:12.450> because<00:02:12.690> they

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
can indeed swap these out because they

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.770 
can indeed swap these out because they
are

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
are

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.760 
are
pretty<00:02:14.620> much<00:02:14.770> shot<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:16.140> could<00:02:17.140> black<00:02:17.350> tape<00:02:17.590> them

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
pretty much shot I could black tape them

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.110 
pretty much shot I could black tape them
up<00:02:17.920> too<00:02:18.130> but<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.340> really<00:02:18.640> don't<00:02:18.730> like<00:02:18.910> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
up too but I really don't like the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.090 
up too but I really don't like the
enzyme<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.780> I'm<00:02:20.470> not<00:02:20.590> gonna<00:02:20.680> go<00:02:20.830> out<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.040> buy

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
enzyme and I'm not gonna go out and buy

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.580 
enzyme and I'm not gonna go out and buy
ends<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:22.390> know<00:02:22.450> we're<00:02:22.600> gonna<00:02:22.690> have<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.020> all

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
ends you know we're gonna have this all

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.830 
ends you know we're gonna have this all
screwed<00:02:23.920> up<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.340> let<00:02:25.209> me<00:02:25.300> go<00:02:25.390> ahead<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.600> just

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
screwed up so let me go ahead and just

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.120 
screwed up so let me go ahead and just
take<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.170> part<00:02:26.410> off<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.770> now

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
take this part off for now

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.150 
take this part off for now
maybe<00:02:27.430> clean<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:27.730> out<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:27.940> little<00:02:28.090> bit<00:02:28.330> and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
maybe clean this out a little bit and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.050 
maybe clean this out a little bit and
pull<00:02:30.160> them<00:02:30.250> off<00:02:30.340> there<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.610> swap<00:02:30.850> them<00:02:31.000> over

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
pull them off there and swap them over

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.010 
pull them off there and swap them over
and<00:02:31.450> we'll<00:02:31.870> see<00:02:32.050> what<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.260> looks<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:34.020> I've

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
and we'll see what it looks like I've

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.100 
and we'll see what it looks like I've
managed<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.580> remove<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.850> terminals<00:02:37.600> or<00:02:37.959> the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
managed to remove the terminals or the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.960 
managed to remove the terminals or the
leads<00:02:39.010> from<00:02:39.970> both<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.510> these<00:02:40.569> machines<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
leads from both of these machines and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.010 
leads from both of these machines and
I've<00:02:42.970> gone<00:02:43.120> ahead<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.390> I've<00:02:43.540> got<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> good

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
I've gone ahead and I've got the good

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.000 
I've gone ahead and I've got the good
good<00:02:44.590> leads<00:02:44.860> thrown<00:02:45.850> in<00:02:46.030> here<00:02:46.239> but<00:02:46.810> as<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.890> was

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
good leads thrown in here but as I was

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.470 
good leads thrown in here but as I was
taking<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.459> original<00:02:49.030> ones<00:02:49.150> out<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.360> this

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
taking the original ones out of this

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.420 
taking the original ones out of this
when<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.660> managed<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.290> break<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.739> little

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
when I managed to break that little

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.180 
when I managed to break that little
grommet<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.000> goes<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.330> there<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:53.709> managed

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
grommet that goes in there but I managed

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.380 
grommet that goes in there but I managed
to<00:02:54.220> save<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:54.760> was<00:02:54.940> kind<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.090> tricky<00:02:55.269> to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
to save this one was kind of tricky to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.020 
to save this one was kind of tricky to
get<00:02:55.570> out<00:02:55.720> it's<00:02:56.410> from<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.739> one<00:02:56.950> what<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.730> had<00:02:57.940> to

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
get out it's from this one what I had to

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.050 
get out it's from this one what I had to
do<00:02:58.180> was<00:02:58.360> pry<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.780> up<00:02:58.959> from<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.260> bottom<00:02:59.440> and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
do was pry it up from the bottom and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.610 
do was pry it up from the bottom and
then<00:03:01.060> when<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.330> did<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.720> held<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.140> wires<00:03:02.290> up

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
then when I did that I held the wires up

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.470 
then when I did that I held the wires up
and<00:03:03.100> put<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.430> screwdriver<00:03:03.670> on<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.000> top<00:03:04.209> and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
and put a screwdriver on the top and

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.870 
and put a screwdriver on the top and
pried<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.930> out<00:03:04.989> like<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:06.370> managed<00:03:06.760> to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
pried it out like that and managed to

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.940 
pried it out like that and managed to
save<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.150> without<00:03:07.239> breaking<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.870> no<00:03:08.050> I<00:03:08.500> hope<00:03:08.800> it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
save it without breaking it no I hope it

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.740 
save it without breaking it no I hope it
fits<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.400> hole<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.180> we're<00:03:10.390> gonna<00:03:10.480> go

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
fits in that hole so we're gonna go

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.880 
fits in that hole so we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:10.989> give<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.319> shot

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
ahead and give it a shot

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.860 
ahead and give it a shot
stuff<00:03:12.580> them<00:03:12.700> in<00:03:12.850> there<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.209> hopefully<00:03:13.600> this

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
stuff them in there and hopefully this

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.130 
stuff them in there and hopefully this
will<00:03:13.989> fit<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.819> if<00:03:15.819> it<00:03:16.060> does<00:03:16.269> I'll<00:03:16.630> just<00:03:16.959> wire

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
will fit and if it does I'll just wire

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.680 
will fit and if it does I'll just wire
up<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.910> leads<00:03:18.910> I'll<00:03:19.120> put<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.299> nut<00:03:19.450> back<00:03:19.480> on

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
up the leads I'll put the nut back on

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.240 
up the leads I'll put the nut back on
and<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.489> terminal<00:03:21.489> there<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:22.799> may<00:03:23.799> actually

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
and the terminal there I may actually

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.210 
and the terminal there I may actually
play<00:03:25.120> with<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.360> one<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.810> just<00:03:26.350> cut<00:03:27.070> these

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
play with this one and just cut these

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.460 
play with this one and just cut these
wires<00:03:27.430> here<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.049> leave<00:03:29.049> them<00:03:29.170> where<00:03:29.320> they're

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
wires here and leave them where they're

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.940 
wires here and leave them where they're
at<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.890> then<00:03:30.150> run<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.299> new<00:03:31.420> one<00:03:31.600> in<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.049> just

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
at and then run the new one in and just

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.650 
at and then run the new one in and just
use<00:03:33.100> wire<00:03:33.340> nuts<00:03:33.640> it's<00:03:33.880> not<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.209> best<00:03:34.420> way<00:03:34.630> to

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
use wire nuts it's not the best way to

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.990 
use wire nuts it's not the best way to
do<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.019> but<00:03:35.260> it's<00:03:36.130> all<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.340> have<00:03:36.459> at<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.820> moment

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
do it but it's all I have at the moment

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.310 
do it but it's all I have at the moment
so<00:03:37.390> mm-hmm

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
so mm-hmm

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.800 
so mm-hmm
I<00:03:38.470> may<00:03:38.890> go<00:03:39.040> ahead<00:03:39.250> with<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.540> just<00:03:40.540> because

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
I may go ahead with that just because

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.930 
I may go ahead with that just because
I'm<00:03:41.019> I'm<00:03:41.410> in<00:03:41.560> here<00:03:41.769> now<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:42.370> do<00:03:42.519> have<00:03:42.760> wire

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
I'm I'm in here now and I do have wire

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.240 
I'm I'm in here now and I do have wire
nuts<00:03:43.209> but<00:03:43.590> we'll<00:03:44.590> see<00:03:44.769> I'll<00:03:44.920> get<00:03:45.070> this<00:03:45.190> one

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
nuts but we'll see I'll get this one

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.060 
nuts but we'll see I'll get this one
wired<00:03:45.549> up<00:03:45.700> first<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.739> let's<00:03:47.739> see<00:03:47.890> how<00:03:48.010> that

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
wired up first and let's see how that

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.099 
wired up first and let's see how that
goes<00:03:50.070> well<00:03:51.070> I've<00:03:51.250> got<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:52.359> leads<00:03:52.600> put<00:03:52.959> in

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
goes well I've got the the leads put in

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.500 
goes well I've got the the leads put in
here<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.950> little<00:03:54.160> trouble<00:03:54.549> with<00:03:54.790> this

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
here and a little trouble with this

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.349 
here and a little trouble with this
particular<00:03:56.230> grommet<00:03:56.620> because<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.850> hole<00:03:58.060> on

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
particular grommet because the hole on

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.780 
particular grommet because the hole on
the<00:03:58.600> old<00:03:58.750> one<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.170> slightly<00:04:00.100> larger<00:04:00.370> than<00:04:00.609> the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
the old one is slightly larger than the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.940 
the old one is slightly larger than the
one<00:04:00.910> that<00:04:00.940> was<00:04:01.090> on<00:04:01.150> this<00:04:01.420> one<00:04:01.600> so<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:02.019> just<00:04:02.709> quick

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
one that was on this one so I just quick

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.400 
one that was on this one so I just quick
grab<00:04:03.640> my<00:04:03.820> drill<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.150> made<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.049> hole<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.230> wee

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
grab my drill and made the hole a wee

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.349 
grab my drill and made the hole a wee
bit<00:04:05.560> bigger<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.010> slid<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.090> there<00:04:07.209> no

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
bit bigger and slid that in there no

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.289 
bit bigger and slid that in there no
problem<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:09.340> then<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.579> went<00:04:09.730> ahead<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.090> also

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
problem and then I went ahead and I also

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.590 
problem and then I went ahead and I also
replaced<00:04:10.780> see<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:10.989> power<00:04:11.320> cord<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.600> basically

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
replaced see a power cord and basically

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.210 
replaced see a power cord and basically
what<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.780> did<00:04:13.959> there<00:04:14.109> is<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.350> just<00:04:14.560> cut<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.070> wires

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
what I did there is I just cut the wires

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.380 
what I did there is I just cut the wires
on<00:04:15.459> this<00:04:15.609> one

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
on this one

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.779 
on this one
and<00:04:16.630> then<00:04:17.590> also<00:04:17.829> cut<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.250> wires<00:04:18.400> on<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:18.640> old

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
and then also cut the wires on the old

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.610 
and then also cut the wires on the old
one<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.000> I've<00:04:19.209> got<00:04:19.359> them<00:04:19.510> wire<00:04:20.109> nut<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.500> in

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
one and I've got them wire nut it in

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.360 
one and I've got them wire nut it in
here<00:04:20.829> now<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:22.030> not<00:04:22.180> an<00:04:22.510> ideal<00:04:23.020> solution<00:04:23.320> I'm

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
here now it's not an ideal solution I'm

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.030 
here now it's not an ideal solution I'm
-<00:04:24.520> fan<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.910> wire<00:04:25.060> nuts<00:04:25.360> but<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:26.229> will<00:04:26.410> work<00:04:26.650> and

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
- fan of wire nuts but it will work and

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.330 
- fan of wire nuts but it will work and
I<00:04:27.460> will<00:04:28.060> come<00:04:28.270> back<00:04:28.419> here<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:29.010> just<00:04:30.010> put<00:04:30.310> some

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
I will come back here and just put some

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.460 
I will come back here and just put some
electrical<00:04:30.880> tape<00:04:30.910> on<00:04:31.270> for<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.630> little<00:04:31.840> bit<00:04:31.960> a

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
electrical tape on for a little bit a

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.830 
electrical tape on for a little bit a
little<00:04:33.160> bit<00:04:33.280> more<00:04:33.400> peace<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.270> mind<00:04:34.570> I<00:04:34.720> guess

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
little bit more peace of mind I guess

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.480 
little bit more peace of mind I guess
you<00:04:34.960> could<00:04:35.080> say<00:04:35.110> just<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:36.100> make<00:04:36.220> sure<00:04:36.370> they

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
you could say just to make sure they

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.879 
you could say just to make sure they
don't<00:04:36.690> caps<00:04:37.690> don't<00:04:37.870> come<00:04:38.050> off<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.590> shorts

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
don't caps don't come off and it shorts

on something you know whatever just a

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.020 
on something you know whatever just a
little<00:04:41.380> bit<00:04:41.470> more<00:04:41.590> insurance<00:04:42.070> but<00:04:42.280> this

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
little bit more insurance but this
