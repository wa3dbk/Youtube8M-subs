just<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.659> put<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:31.230> little<00:02:31.439> bit<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.650> salt

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
just going to put a little bit of salt

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.479 
just going to put a little bit of salt
on<00:02:32.189> the<00:02:32.340> fish<00:02:32.609> a<00:02:33.170> little<00:02:34.170> bit<00:02:34.379> of<00:02:34.469> pepper<00:02:37.489> fresh

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
on the fish a little bit of pepper fresh

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.550 
on the fish a little bit of pepper fresh
ground<00:02:38.790> pepper<00:02:38.930> then<00:02:39.930> I'm<00:02:40.019> going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.260> brush<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
ground pepper then I'm going to brush it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.220 
ground pepper then I'm going to brush it
the<00:02:40.980> fish<00:02:41.219> with<00:02:41.489> an<00:02:41.670> egg<00:02:41.879> white<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.989> plain

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the fish with an egg white just a plain

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.110 
the fish with an egg white just a plain
egg<00:02:43.500> white<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:45.620> then<00:02:46.620> sprinkle<00:02:47.069> some<00:02:47.280> finely

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
egg white and then sprinkle some finely

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.599 
egg white and then sprinkle some finely
chopped<00:02:48.480> almonds<00:02:49.109> over<00:02:49.409> the<00:02:49.530> top<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.400> that

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
chopped almonds over the top and that

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.210 
chopped almonds over the top and that
will<00:02:50.730> make<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:50.879> nice<00:02:51.090> little<00:02:51.329> nut<00:02:52.109> crust<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:52.799> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
will make a nice little nut crust as the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.620 
will make a nice little nut crust as the
fish<00:02:53.430> crooks

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.390 

and<00:02:58.140> we're<00:02:58.440> going<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.680> put<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.190> grill

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
and we're going to put it on the grill

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.420 
and we're going to put it on the grill
and<00:02:59.700> with<00:03:00.570> fish<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.890> important<00:03:02.280> thing<00:03:02.340> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
and with fish the important thing to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.030 
and with fish the important thing to
remember<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.910> not<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.150> overcook<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.230> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
remember is not to overcook it and the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.940 
remember is not to overcook it and the
rule<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.730> thumb<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:07.200> cook<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:07.770> 15

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
rule of thumb is that you cook it for 15

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.920 
rule of thumb is that you cook it for 15
minutes<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.640> every<00:03:08.850> inch<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.270> thickness<00:03:09.510> and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
minutes for every inch of thickness and

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.570 
minutes for every inch of thickness and
this<00:03:10.050> is<00:03:10.200> pretty<00:03:10.410> thick<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.100> we'll<00:03:11.370> probably

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
this is pretty thick so we'll probably

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.450 
this is pretty thick so we'll probably
cook<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.240> for<00:03:12.510> about<00:03:12.570> 20<00:03:13.290> minutes<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.280> we

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
cook this for about 20 minutes so we

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.610 
cook this for about 20 minutes so we
preheated<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.000> grill<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.470> it's

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
preheated the grill to so that it's

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.500 
preheated the grill to so that it's
really<00:03:16.890> nice<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.250> hot<00:03:17.460> we've<00:03:18.060> got<00:03:18.210> the<00:03:18.330> fish

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
really nice and hot we've got the fish

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.480 
really nice and hot we've got the fish
all<00:03:18.690> ready<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.930> go<00:03:19.080> on<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:20.100> we're<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.220> going

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
all ready to go on so we're just going

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.120 
all ready to go on so we're just going
to<00:03:20.580> place<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.240> directly<00:03:21.720> on<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.500> great<00:03:22.800> and

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
to place it directly on the great and

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.860 
to place it directly on the great and
then<00:03:23.880> turn<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.690> temperature<00:03:24.990> down<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.440> lie

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
then turn the temperature down to lie

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.560 
then turn the temperature down to lie
then<00:03:27.870> cover<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.350> fish<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.940> let<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.120> cook<00:03:30.360> for

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
then cover the fish and let it cook for

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.960 
then cover the fish and let it cook for
about<00:03:30.720> 20<00:03:31.260> minutes<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:32.580> important<00:03:32.940> thing

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
about 20 minutes the important thing

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.610 
about 20 minutes the important thing
about<00:03:33.120> cooking<00:03:33.510> fish<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.470> don't

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
about cooking fish is that you don't

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.080 
about cooking fish is that you don't
want<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.920> overcook<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.520> because<00:03:35.850> then<00:03:35.970> it'll

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
want to overcook it because then it'll

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.180 
want to overcook it because then it'll
dry<00:03:36.450> out<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.960> if<00:03:37.590> you're<00:03:37.740> concerned<00:03:38.040> about

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
dry out so if you're concerned about

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.560 
dry out so if you're concerned about
whether<00:03:38.490> or<00:03:38.640> not<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:38.880> done<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.210> can<00:03:39.330> use<00:03:39.450> an

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
whether or not it's done you can use an

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.840 
whether or not it's done you can use an
instant-read<00:03:40.050> thermometer<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.830> when<00:03:41.700> it's

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
instant-read thermometer and when it's

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.440 
instant-read thermometer and when it's
about<00:03:42.140> 135<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.380> 140<00:03:43.830> degrees<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:45.030> fish<00:03:45.420> is

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
about 135 to 140 degrees the fish is

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.600 
about 135 to 140 degrees the fish is
done<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:46.440> been<00:03:46.590> about<00:03:46.680> 20<00:03:47.130> minutes<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.580> the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
done it's been about 20 minutes so the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.250 
done it's been about 20 minutes so the
fish<00:03:47.880> should<00:03:48.090> be<00:03:48.240> about<00:03:48.450> done<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.840> looks<00:03:49.080> like

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
fish should be about done it looks like

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.900 
fish should be about done it looks like
it's<00:03:49.440> done<00:03:49.650> let's<00:03:50.370> take<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.610> temperature

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
it's done let's take a temperature

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.320 
it's done let's take a temperature
reading<00:03:51.360> here<00:03:52.310> 135<00:03:53.310> degrees<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:54.060> should<00:03:54.210> be

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
reading here 135 degrees it should be

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.840 
reading here 135 degrees it should be
perfect<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.100> almonds<00:03:59.520> are<00:03:59.640> nicely

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
perfect and the almonds are nicely

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.830 
perfect and the almonds are nicely
browned<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.810> think<00:04:01.200> we're<00:04:01.380> ready<00:04:01.410> good<00:04:02.010> they're

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
browned I think we're ready good they're

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.390 
browned I think we're ready good they're
cooking<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.050> halibut<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.860> cedar<00:04:05.190> plank

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
cooking the halibut on a cedar plank

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.640 
cooking the halibut on a cedar plank
we'll<00:04:05.640> give<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:06.000> nice<00:04:06.210> woody<00:04:06.660> smoky<00:04:07.320> flavor

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
we'll give it a nice woody smoky flavor

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.670 
we'll give it a nice woody smoky flavor
but<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.460> can<00:04:08.640> also<00:04:08.820> use<00:04:09.360> other<00:04:09.570> kinds<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.410> wood

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
but you can also use other kinds of wood

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.890 
but you can also use other kinds of wood
like<00:04:10.950> cherry<00:04:11.610> wood<00:04:11.820> or<00:04:11.970> maple<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.630> that'll

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
like cherry wood or maple and that'll

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.010 
like cherry wood or maple and that'll
give<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.140> another<00:04:13.380> flavor<00:04:13.740> as<00:04:13.980> well<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:14.940> just

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
give it another flavor as well so just

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.690 
give it another flavor as well so just
experiment<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:16.109> decide<00:04:16.680> which<00:04:16.890> one<00:04:17.460> of<00:04:17.489> the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
experiment and decide which one of the

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.000 
experiment and decide which one of the
planks<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.420> like<00:04:18.630> best<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.260> this

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
planks that you like best and this

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.830 
planks that you like best and this
halibut<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.730> we<00:04:20.850> made<00:04:21.090> today<00:04:21.239> we're<00:04:21.690> going

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
halibut that we made today we're going

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.180 
halibut that we made today we're going
to<00:04:21.930> be<00:04:22.049> serving<00:04:22.500> with<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.310> strawberry<00:04:23.730> salsa<00:04:25.190> so

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
to be serving with a strawberry salsa so

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.920 
to be serving with a strawberry salsa so
now<00:04:26.370> we've<00:04:26.550> taken<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:27.000> halibut<00:04:27.360> from<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.750> San

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
now we've taken the halibut from the San
