running<00:00:22.920> around<00:00:23.130> although<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.670> don't<00:00:23.789> think

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
running around although I don't think

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.759 
running around although I don't think
we're<00:00:24.300> done<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.779> because<00:00:24.960> we're<00:00:25.199> still

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
we're done with it because we're still

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.769 
we're done with it because we're still
coming<00:00:26.010> into<00:00:26.460> spring<00:00:26.699> next<00:00:27.119> week<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.660> we

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
coming into spring next week and so we

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.839 
coming into spring next week and so we
have<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.500> energy<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:29.099> front<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.490> us<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:29.670> I

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
have that energy in front of us but I

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.130 
have that energy in front of us but I
think<00:00:30.090> what<00:00:30.240> you're<00:00:30.390> referring<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
think what you're referring to is the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
think what you're referring to is the
moon<00:00:31.410> has<00:00:31.590> been<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.890> Aries<00:00:32.189> for<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> last<00:00:32.579> day

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
moon has been in Aries for the last day

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.790 
moon has been in Aries for the last day
and<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.000> half<00:00:33.030> or<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.809> tonight<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.590> moves

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and a half or so and tonight it moves

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.370 
and a half or so and tonight it moves
into<00:00:35.130> Taurus<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.910> does<00:00:36.239> kind<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> give

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
into Taurus and that does kind of give

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.650 
into Taurus and that does kind of give
us<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.309> allows<00:00:38.579> us<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.910> take<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> deep<00:00:39.420> breath

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
us a it allows us to take a deep breath

impatient<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.050> innovative<00:00:43.770> Aries<00:00:44.340> tends<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
impatient but innovative Aries tends to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
impatient but innovative Aries tends to
push<00:00:45.390> things<00:00:45.629> along<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> very<00:00:46.649> very<00:00:46.920> high

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
push things along at a very very high

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.060 
push things along at a very very high
and<00:00:47.640> rapid<00:00:48.270> rate<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.870> don't<00:00:49.050> slow<00:00:49.680> down<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and rapid rate we don't slow down to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.040 
and rapid rate we don't slow down to
consider<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> consequences<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.750> after

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
consider the consequences a little after

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.010 
consider the consequences a little after
three<00:00:52.230> o'clock<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> afternoon<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.809> moon

going out and doing things right there

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.670 
going out and doing things right there
there<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.400> shift<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.540> is

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
there is really the shift here really is

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.100 
there is really the shift here really is
from<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.220> sense<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.640> initiating<00:01:33.329> action<00:01:33.720> that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
from the sense of initiating action that

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.630 
from the sense of initiating action that
we've<00:01:34.229> been<00:01:34.380> doing<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.860> couple<00:01:35.220> days<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
we've been doing for a couple days and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
we've been doing for a couple days and
it<00:01:35.729> doesn't<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.509> away<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.500> it's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
it doesn't really go away but it's

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
it doesn't really go away but it's
almost<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> day<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:38.939> two<00:01:39.119> breather

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
almost like we get a day or two breather

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.260 
almost like we get a day or two breather
where<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.409> kind<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:41.130> integrate<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
where we kind of can integrate what it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.440 
where we kind of can integrate what it
is<00:01:42.390> we've<00:01:42.659> already<00:01:43.020> begun<00:01:43.649> before<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.880> give<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
is we've already begun before we give it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
is we've already begun before we give it
the<00:01:45.600> next<00:01:45.840> push<00:01:46.229> later<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> week<00:01:47.189> I'm
