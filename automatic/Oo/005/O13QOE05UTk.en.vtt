00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.630
 the idea is so simple that the years are always an unsightly one 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.360
 uncomfortable motorway underpass and many artists and transforms the 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.050
 Hybrid also in a flourishing art landscape that also has the 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.309
 Offenbach city administration convinced in a jiffy, there was a green light for the 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.590
 Markus's art project was based on countless spray cans 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.859
 a copten Broughton head ahead Offenbacher Kaiserlei circles a real one 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.899
 looker 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.579
 Porsche makes Kaiser no 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.829
 only the rats of the skies feel comfortable walking under the pedestrian underpass 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.100
 to fear 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.270
 but the best players from all over Germany and Switzerland want that 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.850
 Now change in two days, they turn 150 square meters of gloomy world online 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.650
 to a Gesamtkunstwerk 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.540
 there is a 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.070
 Mobius concept but everyone decides what to spray world 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.500
 the city of Offenbach sponsors the art action displayed the night inside 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.670
 The initiator Marc Huster has bought 300 USD in 80 different shades 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.659
 Of course, very important if you do not let it off course 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.470
 and if we put it on top of it then he'll pick up avocados at the table so 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.210
 People from the weather ahead of our then you can of course always feared 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.200
 that it just touched up which is in what track would like to claim more 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.900
 few jumpers earn future money the EU is one of them 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.200
 Illustrator and likes to exchange the pencil with the spray can 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.240
 TV 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.710
 Hoffenheim but you also have to be very wealthy as the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.680
 medium 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.110
 whatever you want 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.700
 you will be with brochures 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.369
 this is the template from Switzerland 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.479
 He has made the biggest picture he is a perfectionist 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.790
 spraying monkeys alone and wiping 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.170
 and he sprayed for an hour 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.170
 and that is not the only challenge 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 the winner gets the right story with the proportions 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.360
 everything is open and both would still be we are not searching the internet 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.109
 and so 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:13.709
 in order to really know also the surfaces should come also productions run 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.929
 finally on the 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:20.129
 after 20 hours of work a work of art is finished you can see the view and 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.129
 so many details could be the socks here 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.569
 For some, coffee is the graffiti and vandalism here 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.279
 spray to the art 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.939
 It's just an appreciation of this whole body needing whole space here 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.529
 but in the past, people certainly started off with a red Opel 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.279
 it was the first manufacturer is the place and that has now an end 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.259
 by the way, comic drawings are the specialty of him 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.089
 The only woman among the jumpers seems to be a male domain 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.009
 it will certainly not continue 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.389
 here in the picture looks like 8 hours like this 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:06.479
 is almost completely different with him, the graffiti are later like 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.849
 Photos even the fly seems to have just turned over 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.039
 Incidentally, all artists design the pedestrian underpass at the Offenbacher 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.979
 Kaiserlei for free her pay is that the view on a legal big 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.669
 They can hope to realize the area itself that the Offenbacher long 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.609
 is what we are currently at last 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.469
 unbelievably 4 percent 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.429
 that is what it means there 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.999
 that one about one or even when we actually think about it earlier 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.279
 should go 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.279
 again as a reminder the gray 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:40.819
 Sousa is out two days before 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.119
 Now the underpass is an outdoor exhibition for everyone 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.929
 admission free
