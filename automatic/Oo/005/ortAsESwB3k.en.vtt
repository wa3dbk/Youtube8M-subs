00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 have you ever wondered how? 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.250
 many pay there and whether it is from 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:15.269
 Some pay more than others 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:16.949
 no, well, but video so it clear 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.420
 gives infinite numbers 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.619
 thanks for watching as the right goes 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.930
 first of all watching videos maybe knows 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.810
 you still the distinction natural 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.099
 pay integers rational numbers 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.510
 real numbers 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.940
 Of course, there are already numbers 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.640
 endless once the two the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.680
 three and so on whole numbers are that 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
 same then all pay with one 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.090
 minus and then the zero so two 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.489
 infinitely many and one more time 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.950
 the rational numbers are then still 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.379
 in addition the breaks and the real 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.930
 still have all the irrational numbers in it 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.090
 So those funny ones criss-cross 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.059
 infinite many number after the comma 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.309
 have so much for the first time a swiss 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.140
 team from the last video infinite 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.359
 a little bit weirder than the normal number 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.100
 when paying simply no number is 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.770
 That's why you have something else 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.140
 come up with if you only limited 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.570
 number of things he could have through 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.180
 count the three question marks 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.580
 they'll get the numbers one to three 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.470
 fantastic four clear the number one to 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.240
 four and six beer a six 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.750
 protect what we say 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.030
 want 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.080
 May finally pay many you can 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.080
 just count by 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.030
 Attention now you can also join 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.369
 Countless numbers sometimes pay 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.780
 by counting we do it just once 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.420
 with the natural numbers 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.970
 where that is easily the first 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.240
 Number is the 1, the second is the number 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.220
 2 the third gives the three and so on 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.570
 although infinitely many you can do it 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 after all, number 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.270
 no matter what number you tell me i can 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.790
 tell you which number still has 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.020
 an example of even numbers you can pay 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.540
 also number 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.149
 the first would be the 2 the second the 4 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.070
 the third the six and so on 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.600
 also where you can each ne number 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 if you give the three question marks 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.710
 Numbers from 1 to 3 is logical 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.060
 you have as many numbers as you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.680
 question mark namely three different ones 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.450
 also count the apples to three 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.770
 you know, there are just as many 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.840
 Apples like question mark 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.670
 that's why you can generally say if 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.170
 you something infinite after all 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.420
 you can count with the natural ones 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.630
 pay with 1 2 3 4 etc 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.040
 then there are as many as from 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.860
 the natural numbers 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.319
 that means there are just as many 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.590
 just pay like natural at all 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.540
 pay yes potter fuck moment number one 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.610
 Can not you do something through it 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.640
 then there's more to it than that 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.319
 natural numbers so more than 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.780
 infinitely what the fuck moment number 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.260
 two the weird ones at by counter 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.190
 That's why some infinity are the same 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.840
 great as others 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.519
 although they logically do a lot 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.340
 would have to be bigger or smaller 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.349
 As I said there are just as many 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.310
 pay like it's natural at all 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.739
 pay but gives the number 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.870
 rey will give you at least one a 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.910
 possibility of various infinite 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.299
 at least somehow compare to 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.060
 can 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.010
 So remember in the infinite there 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.840
 from quite a few different numbers 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.400
 there are just as many others 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.400
 still more than others 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.000
 rejoice that nobody from the chuck norris 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.400
 we must say that we count to infinity 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.290
 now from the rational ones so pay the 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.420
 there are just as many fractions 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.830
 pay like the natural ones why see 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.480
 her in our study video here 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.430
 right and then writes in the comments 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.470
 what do you think of what is most important 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.060
 pay only the whole pay hashtag 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.290
 Rational numbers like the number or 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.520
 plug flexi numbers 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.530
 we are looking forward to your opinion 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.780
 you check our instagram left in the 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.520
 description follows us something so behind 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.530
 the backdrop of the simple works out there 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.530
 Skin cells in the sense and makes you feel good
