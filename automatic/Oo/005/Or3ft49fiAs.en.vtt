00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.240
 Julia since very small already 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.240
 presented a creative 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.240
 different 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:28.439
 a very active imagination always 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:31.170
 creating many stories a facility 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.949
 to learn mainly in the part of the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.019
 language arts 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.570
 the talent of July comes not just from the 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.460
 notes that are normally good the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.220
 associations that the nine-year-old girl 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.769
 does it reveal a potential above 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.470
 average the July facility in the area 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.199
 creative and artistic 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.920
 for the diagnosis of high skills 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.570
 high skills are considered 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.850
 isolated or combined in the academic area 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.400
 in the area of â€‹â€‹leadership in the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 psychomotor and in the artistic area 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.440
 we do not rely on the use of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.330
 tests it is based on observation 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.430
 systematic behavior of this 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.619
 the child and collecting data from 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.439
 information with family with the school 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.450
 to recognize this characteristic. 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.520
 was a difficult task for the mother of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.800
 Julia and the school itself 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.170
 in the first year the girl who already 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.240
 I loved reading experienced difficulties 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.310
 adaptation in the classroom always 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 calling in school that she does not copy the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.880
 school stuff that she did not 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.640
 stop attention is needed 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.350
 then from that moment on that 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.480
 I saw the school's difficulty 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.600
 see the potentiality that the judge 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.190
 She had to show me at home, right? 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.250
 I went to get law and went to search 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.470
 alternatives there are many myths ideas 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.110
 mistakes about high skills and even 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.540
 to be geniuses that eventually obscure 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.590
 and disrupts the recognition of this 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.780
 potential 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.550
 as July advanced as standard 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.979
 this difficulty of identification 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.930
 resurge current girl teacher 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.110
 also took time to understand what 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.950
 spent mother sang explain she has 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.750
 other skills but in what they are and 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.150
 Creative productive return on the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.790
 arts is in Portuguese mathematics I want 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.690
 that my focus was on that there colleagues 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.730
 they 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.590
 they also wondered why Julia came 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.150
 with other questions in the classroom 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.270
 so they asked why she did not 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.030
 because she then wanted 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.520
 she did not do the same pattern as they 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.160
 Some ideas from July have 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.530
 paper she wrote tales illustrated the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.710
 book with character drawings 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.680
 I put a voice most feelings trip 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.650
 not having imagination and sailing in the sea 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.320
 looking at the horizon others left the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.600
 role and migrated to digital space is 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.180
 the case of the blog that Julia developed 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.850
 to share ideas with whom 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.060
 some mothers forced on the award 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.180
 way the people of the flu and already thinking 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.600
 law for the movies I like 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.730
 after smelling lep the teachers 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.890
 should be vigilant in promoting 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.700
 inclusion of these students in the classroom 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.620
 common 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.720
 the regular class teacher sought 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.000
 involve more class help 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.020
 combining calculations and spelling rules 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.360
 jokes 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.470
 this facilitated the student's socialization 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.050
 with colleagues 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.239
 to take classes then we all had more 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.430
 pleasurable and more playful 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.800
 she would play and understand 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.150
 and the group then also developed now 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.780
 I'm taking the other side of the class 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.780
 imagination 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.690
 the child who has high ability and she 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.500
 is not seen that way it ends up 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.690
 feeling unmotivated and others use 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.120
 this potential for an area that does not 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.250
 would be beneficial to society, they 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.340
 come to school with lots of ideas 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.230
 reasoning and why it goes 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.250
 getting lost along the course of life 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.430
 school 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.000
 I think this is my wish that the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.080
 from jÃºlia there is a change in the 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.140
 infrastructure and systems 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.140
 is
