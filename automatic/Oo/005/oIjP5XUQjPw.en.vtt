00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
comes in the box here you get the device

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.380 
comes in the box here you get the device
itself<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.800> micro<00:00:35.309> USB<00:00:35.340> cable<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> connect

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
itself the micro USB cable to connect

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.209 
itself the micro USB cable to connect
this<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> computer<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.469> also<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this thing to the computer and also the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.560 
this thing to the computer and also the
instructions<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.969> shouldn't<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:39.420> need

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
instructions you shouldn't really need

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
instructions you shouldn't really need
to<00:00:39.690> use<00:00:39.899> these<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:40.620> simple<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> get<00:00:41.309> set

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to use these it's very simple to get set

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.220 
to use these it's very simple to get set
up<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.820> again<00:00:42.030> they<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.390> included<00:00:42.840> anyway

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
up but again they are included anyway

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.110 
up but again they are included anyway
now<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> Y<00:00:43.860> Drive<00:00:44.100> itself<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.610> about<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> same

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
now the Y Drive itself is about the same

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.150 
now the Y Drive itself is about the same
size<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.629> an<00:00:45.690> iPhone<00:00:46.110> 5<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.770> probably<00:00:47.039> about

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
size as an iPhone 5 and probably about

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.680 
size as an iPhone 5 and probably about
the<00:00:47.250> same<00:00:47.430> weight<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.329> I'd<00:00:48.450> say<00:00:48.570> if

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the same weight as well so I'd say if

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.270 
the same weight as well so I'd say if
you<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.530> probably<00:00:49.649> could<00:00:49.980> carry

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you want to you probably could carry

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
you want to you probably could carry
this<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> same<00:00:50.969> pocket<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
this in the same pocket you can see the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
this in the same pocket you can see the
micro<00:00:52.199> USB<00:00:52.590> port<00:00:52.620> there<00:00:53.039> along<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
micro USB port there along with the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.220 
micro USB port there along with the
power<00:00:54.120> button<00:00:54.539> again<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.899> thing<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
power button again this thing is

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.049 
power button again this thing is
extremely<00:00:55.379> easy<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.219> set<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.940> we're

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
extremely easy to get set up and we're

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
extremely easy to get set up and we're
going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.329> over<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.840> now<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
going to go over that just now so

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.139 
going to go over that just now so
basically<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> Y<00:00:59.280> Drive<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.850> two<00:01:00.120> things

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
basically the Y Drive can do two things

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.119 
basically the Y Drive can do two things
it<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.840> send<00:01:01.079> files<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.829> receive

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it can send files and it can receive

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
it can send files and it can receive
files<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.180> example<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.750> put<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
files so for example you can put a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.719 
files so for example you can put a
picture<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> Y<00:01:04.769> Drive<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.460> connect

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
picture on the Y Drive and then connect

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
picture on the Y Drive and then connect
that<00:01:05.850> via<00:01:06.150> Wi-Fi<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:06.869> iPad<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.770> then

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that via Wi-Fi to your iPad to then

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.710 
that via Wi-Fi to your iPad to then
download<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.400> picture<00:01:08.729> onto<00:01:08.880> your<00:01:09.090> iPad<00:01:09.479> or

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
download that picture onto your iPad or

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
download that picture onto your iPad or
you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> other<00:01:10.530> way<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.250> example

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you can do the other way so for example

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.620 
you can do the other way so for example
you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> took<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.570> picture

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you can see here I took that picture

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
you can see here I took that picture
online<00:01:13.049> Nexus<00:01:13.680> 4<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.460> put<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:14.880> my

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
online Nexus 4 and I can put that on my

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
online Nexus 4 and I can put that on my
computer<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.229> easy<00:01:16.380> acts<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
computer like so really easy acts as a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
computer like so really easy acts as a
standard<00:01:17.759> hard<00:01:17.880> drive<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.479> connected

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
standard hard drive and it's connected

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
via USB to my computer and then I can go

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.880 
via USB to my computer and then I can go
ahead<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.479> connect<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.900> via<00:01:22.170> Wi-Fi<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.710> my

Nexus 4 or on the iOS side of things my
iPad<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.340> easy<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.820> can

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
iPad and it's really easy and you can

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
iPad and it's really easy and you can
see<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.360> simple<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.320> because<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> wire

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
see really simple so because the wire

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
see really simple so because the wire
drive<00:01:29.100> does<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.490> Wi-Fi<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.210> actually

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
drive does use Wi-Fi it's actually

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.969 
drive does use Wi-Fi it's actually
really<00:01:30.750> easy<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.290> connect<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.680> pretty<00:01:31.860> much

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
really easy to connect to pretty much

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.340 
really easy to connect to pretty much
any<00:01:32.189> device<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:32.820> example<00:01:33.180> my<00:01:33.270> iPad<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:33.930> we

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
any device for example my iPad here we

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.630 
any device for example my iPad here we
have<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.770> simply<00:01:35.009> turn<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> device

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
have to do is simply turn on the device

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
have to do is simply turn on the device
and<00:01:36.000> it'll<00:01:36.119> basically<00:01:36.270> create<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> wireless

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and it'll basically create a wireless

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.990 
and it'll basically create a wireless
hotspot<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.970> your

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
hotspot just like you can do on your

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.940 
hotspot just like you can do on your
phone<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.079> need<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.560> settings

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
phone and you need to go and do settings

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
phone and you need to go and do settings
Wi-Fi<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:43.049> Y<00:01:43.200> Drive

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
Wi-Fi and you can see the the Y Drive

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.260 
Wi-Fi and you can see the the Y Drive
appears<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.220> tap<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.850> wait<00:01:45.240> for

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
appears just there tap on that wait for

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.210 
appears just there tap on that wait for
it<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> connect<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.740> also<00:01:46.890> need<00:01:46.979> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
it to connect and then you also need to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.920 
it to connect and then you also need to
open<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.700> app<00:01:47.880> which<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.149> available<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.750> both

say the app works really well there are

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.050 
say the app works really well there are
sometimes<00:01:55.500> some<00:01:55.799> bugs<00:01:56.189> I've<00:01:56.399> noticed<00:01:56.790> getting

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
sometimes some bugs I've noticed getting

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.270 
sometimes some bugs I've noticed getting
files<00:01:57.329> off<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.750> device<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.619> also<00:01:58.890> putting

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
files off a device and also putting

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
files off a device and also putting
things<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> drive<00:02:00.119> itself<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.110> been

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
things on the drive itself but it's been

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.719 
things on the drive itself but it's been
fairly<00:02:01.500> ok<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.579> also

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
fairly ok and you can see you can also

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
fairly ok and you can see you can also
sort<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.210> from<00:02:03.600> file<00:02:03.899> types<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.680> if<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.829> wanted

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
sort it from file types so if you wanted

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.440 
sort it from file types so if you wanted
you<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.280> see<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.729> pictures<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.390> go

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you to see just the pictures you can go

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.270 
you to see just the pictures you can go
ahead<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.600> sort<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.920> see<00:02:08.069> here

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
ahead and sort that and you can see here

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.710 
ahead and sort that and you can see here
is<00:02:08.369> actually<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> video<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.420> streaming

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
is actually a video that I'm streaming

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.900 
is actually a video that I'm streaming
straight<00:02:10.080> from<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> device<00:02:10.619> itself<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.340> this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
straight from the device itself and this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.790 
straight from the device itself and this
definitely<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.750> drawbacks<00:02:13.020> of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
definitely is one of the drawbacks of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.980 
definitely is one of the drawbacks of
drive<00:02:14.040> herself<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.640> does<00:02:14.820> use<00:02:15.030> Wi-Fi<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.810> it's

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
drive herself it does use Wi-Fi and it's

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.510 
drive herself it does use Wi-Fi and it's
also<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.230> standard<00:02:16.650> hard<00:02:16.860> drive<00:02:16.920> which<00:02:17.250> does

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
also a standard hard drive which does

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.880 
also a standard hard drive which does
restrict<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.240> terms<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.570> speed<00:02:18.900> if<00:02:19.770> you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
restrict you in terms of speed if you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.010 
restrict you in terms of speed if you
want<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.370> use<00:02:20.550> or<00:02:20.970> watch<00:02:21.300> movies<00:02:21.510> straight

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
want to use or watch movies straight

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.330 
want to use or watch movies straight
from<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.260> drive<00:02:22.470> without<00:02:22.770> having<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.190> put

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
from the drive without having to put

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.070 
from the drive without having to put
them<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:23.730> iPad<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.690> pretty<00:02:24.960> much

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
them on your iPad it's pretty much

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.840 
them on your iPad it's pretty much
impossible<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.650> do<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.040> does<00:02:26.190> take<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.550> long

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
impossible to do it does take a long

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.910 
impossible to do it does take a long
while<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.240> buffer<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.660> movie<00:02:27.960> because<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.590> all

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
while to buffer the movie because of all

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.920 
while to buffer the movie because of all
those<00:02:29.040> restrictions<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.820> speeds<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.420> I'll<00:02:30.750> say

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
those restrictions in speeds so I'll say

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.880 
those restrictions in speeds so I'll say
if<00:02:31.050> you're<00:02:31.140> gonna<00:02:31.230> use<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.590> thing<00:02:31.650> for

if you're gonna use this thing for
pictures<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:32.460> very<00:02:32.790> easy<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.240> do<00:02:33.360> as<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.600> can

the<00:02:51.660> driver<00:02:51.870> no<00:02:52.050> problem<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:52.920> my<00:02:53.040> final

opinion on the Y Drive if you need

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.360 
opinion on the Y Drive if you need
something<00:02:55.200> that's<00:02:55.470> portable<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.160> also

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
wireless at the same time you can use it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.750 
wireless at the same time you can use it
with<00:02:58.500> your<00:02:58.590> computer<00:02:59.070> just<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> normal

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
with your computer just like a normal

hard drive but also use it with your iOS
and<00:03:01.650> Android<00:03:01.710> devices<00:03:02.040> then<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.270> pretty

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
and Android devices then this is pretty

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.880 
and Android devices then this is pretty
much<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.690> only<00:03:03.750> thing<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.380> does<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.650> only

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
much the only thing that does that only

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.920 
much the only thing that does that only
marking<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.400> does<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.640> very<00:03:05.850> well<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.420> you're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
marking it does it very well if you're

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.120 
marking it does it very well if you're
going<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.080> be<00:03:07.170> using<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.620> stream<00:03:07.800> movies

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
going to be using it to stream movies

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.980 
going to be using it to stream movies
then<00:03:08.400> perhaps<00:03:08.610> look<00:03:08.880> at<00:03:08.940> something<00:03:09.270> else<00:03:09.480> but

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
then perhaps look at something else but

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.240 
then perhaps look at something else but
if<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.170> using<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:10.680> pictures<00:03:11.070> or<00:03:11.220> even
