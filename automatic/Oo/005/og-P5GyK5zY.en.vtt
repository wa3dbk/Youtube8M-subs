conduit<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:57.160> a<00:04:57.250> speaker<00:04:57.610> wire<00:04:57.790> conduit<00:04:58.390> on

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
conduit and a speaker wire conduit on

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.620 
conduit and a speaker wire conduit on
this<00:04:58.750> side<00:04:58.990> there<00:04:59.680> again<00:05:00.150> securely<00:05:01.150> mounted

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
this side there again securely mounted

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.969 
this side there again securely mounted
not<00:05:02.139> bulk<00:05:02.639> stainless<00:05:03.639> steel<00:05:03.850> hardware

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
not bulk stainless steel hardware

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.070 
not bulk stainless steel hardware
securely<00:05:05.979> fastened<00:05:06.669> all<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.690> way<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.870> the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
securely fastened all the way to the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.770 
securely fastened all the way to the
back<00:05:08.290> of<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.130> truck<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:09.640> this<00:05:10.330> is<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.630> way

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
back of the truck so this is the way

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.290 
back of the truck so this is the way
unique<00:05:11.140> wiring<00:05:11.650> system<00:05:12.160> that<00:05:12.820> we're<00:05:13.000> using

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
unique wiring system that we're using

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.020 
unique wiring system that we're using
with<00:05:14.020> no<00:05:14.260> wires<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.040> floor<00:05:15.280> this<00:05:15.520> vehicle

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
with no wires in the floor this vehicle

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:27.070 
with no wires in the floor this vehicle
got<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.750> undercarriage<00:05:17.140> knee<00:05:17.500> on<00:05:17.680> here

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.600 

okay<00:05:28.080> talking<00:05:28.440> about<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.830> different<00:05:29.430> layers

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
okay talking about the different layers

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.270 
okay talking about the different layers
of<00:05:29.730> wire<00:05:30.090> protection<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.200> I<00:05:31.440> got<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.800> example

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
of wire protection and I got the example

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.760 
of wire protection and I got the example
here<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:32.850> this<00:05:33.360> is<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.690> flexible<00:05:34.170> conduit

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
here so this is the flexible conduit

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.040 
here so this is the flexible conduit
system<00:05:35.070> but<00:05:35.820> what<00:05:36.000> we<00:05:36.120> really<00:05:36.390> have<00:05:36.600> here<00:05:36.870> this

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
system but what we really have here this

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.050 
system but what we really have here this
is<00:05:37.110> what<00:05:37.440> every<00:05:37.920> when<00:05:38.100> the<00:05:38.190> wire<00:05:38.370> comes<00:05:38.730> out<00:05:38.880> of

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
is what every when the wire comes out of

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.400 
is what every when the wire comes out of
this<00:05:39.150> conduit<00:05:39.570> this<00:05:39.810> what<00:05:39.990> we<00:05:40.080> have<00:05:40.110> we'll

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
this conduit this what we have we'll

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.140 
this conduit this what we have we'll
start<00:05:40.650> with<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.830> connection<00:05:41.310> every

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
start with the connection every

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.990 
start with the connection every
connection<00:05:42.600> in<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.840> vehicle<00:05:43.200> is<00:05:43.410> soldered

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
connection in the vehicle is soldered

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.700 
connection in the vehicle is soldered
soldered<00:05:45.000> and<00:05:45.150> heat-shrink<00:05:45.510> then<00:05:46.290> the<00:05:46.500> wire

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
soldered and heat-shrink then the wire

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.180 
soldered and heat-shrink then the wire
itself<00:05:47.190> then<00:05:47.550> we<00:05:47.700> have<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.360> cloth<00:05:49.230> braided

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
itself then we have the cloth braided

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.150 
itself then we have the cloth braided
tape<00:05:50.460> system<00:05:50.790> so<00:05:51.330> it's<00:05:51.510> braided<00:05:51.870> cloth<00:05:52.770> tape

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
tape system so it's braided cloth tape

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.640 
tape system so it's braided cloth tape
on<00:05:53.610> top<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.240> wire<00:05:54.420> then<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.080> next<00:05:55.500> level

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
on top of the wire then the next level

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.090 
on top of the wire then the next level
this<00:05:56.100> is<00:05:56.160> a<00:05:56.420> aviation-grade<00:05:57.420> loom<00:05:58.110> so<00:05:58.800> it's<00:05:58.980> a

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
this is a aviation-grade loom so it's a

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.180 
this is a aviation-grade loom so it's a
spiral<00:05:59.660> plastic<00:06:00.660> thick<00:06:00.900> moon<00:06:01.170> that<00:06:01.830> breeze

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
spiral plastic thick moon that breeze

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.120 
spiral plastic thick moon that breeze
for<00:06:02.970> aviation<00:06:03.570> purposes<00:06:04.140> then<00:06:04.620> we<00:06:04.740> have<00:06:04.920> the

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130
