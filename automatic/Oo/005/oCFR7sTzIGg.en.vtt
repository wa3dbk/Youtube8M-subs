 the total points was set at 56 for 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.640
 this duel of week 5 the way so 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.430
 powerful of the broncos in this first 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.020
 month of nfl borders on the ridiculous 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.880
 peyton manning pitching for 16 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.340
 touchdowns an unprecedented brand 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.380
 up to averaging 44 points 8 points per 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.379
 game almost 13 more than the second 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.079
 analyst green bay in week 4 denver 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.930
 destroyed Philadelphia 52 to 20 manning 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.719
 threw for 327 yards and four passes 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.430
 score the 52 points of the targets 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.660
 they were a franchise record and the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.210
 more points than you have 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.760
 allowed Philadelphia since 1972 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.710
 every week this squad breaks brands and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 does not seem to have a rival 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.700
 dallas is willing to propose the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.560
 face in your house however the numbers 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.630
 are not favorable for the cowboys 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 they have the defensive number 27 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.860
 against the pass allowing 304 yards 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.270
 air by match 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.070
 feinmann and has all the tools 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.480
 and the impetus to destroy the new 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.360
 defense mounted by the veteran 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.470
 defensive coordinator as anti chief 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.270
 dallas who allows in less than 80 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.370
 yards by land week by week seeks 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.890
 win at least this battle and then 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.080
 will try to stop by hand the ends that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.970
 there is a 30 21 against san diego the week 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.660
 previous and added his second loss in 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.850
 two weeks 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.470
 dallas had no answer the marshal of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.990
 field of the chargers philip rivers 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.180
 who threw for 401 yards and three 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.040
 touchdowns and an interception 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.479
 the Dallas offense on the other hand could not 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.490
 set the race and the color of 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.710
 minor frame and finished with 70 yards per 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 earth that was the third time in four 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.340
 weeks ending with less than 100 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.990
 rushing yards 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.729
 Mary will face this Sunday at the best 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.399
 defense against the race always 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.890
 allow just 74 yards by land for 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.280
 week and just stop the mccoy injury 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.960
 of allusive who stayed in 73 clear 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.550
 is that number is inflated because the time 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.440
 of combing and throwing scoring passes 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.180
 everywhere the opposing teams 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.730
 they try to follow the step and finish 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.110
 forgetting to run the ball should 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.030
 covered squeeze the last two 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.500
 confrontations before waters but 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.430
 these two franchises do not face 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.129
 since 2009 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.840
 for being inter-conference duel this 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.640
 year the bronchi are 3 and 1 against the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.069
 spray only failing to cover it in the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.010
 week 3 when they came out as 16.5 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.030
 favorite points about the raiders 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.950
 also take into account that the four 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.409
 denver matches this year surpassed 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.790
 the total points agreed upon by the cowboys 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.290
 they are also pressure against the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.519
 spread last week to the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.370
 chargers could not cover when 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.719
 they went as favorites for a point the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.849
 two teams have very good offensives 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.010
 who will look for the pass as a priority for 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.870
 move the chains this makes the best 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.599
 bet is not exactly on the line 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.159
 of spread but in total points to 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.750
 despite what we have already seen in games 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.430
 previous of the whites 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.230
 We believe that the total points will not go up 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.639
 as much as past games 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.799
 denver if you will have the opportunity to write down 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.329
 several points but he went up to the cape and he 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.489
 they will realize that it is quite difficult 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.260
 move the ball against the targets and this 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.480
 will reduce the amount of points that 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.489
 will be able to score that's why we're tilting 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.620
 we got at least 56 points in this game 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.840
 I think the marker will be able to see something 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.640
 like 38 17 helping us cover the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.020
 bet on the minimum 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.460
