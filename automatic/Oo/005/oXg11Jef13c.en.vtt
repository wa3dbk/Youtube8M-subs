00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone in this tutorial I you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.640
 propose to show you how we can 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.250
 to easily create a blur 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.889
 background so with the software in 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.500
 line biffins who so here I am going to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.460
 connect to the doe interface in who 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.460
 I will select a photo 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.849
 on my computer in photo that appears 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.220
 in the work window the editor 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.020
 opened directly in the menu 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.369
 essentials that will offer you some 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.509
 number of features so no we 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.620
 let's use the blur feature 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.320
 so this feature is there for 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.449
 effect of creating a blur on the set of 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.100
 the picture but you will see it he goes 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.220
 be possible to lift some 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.720
 parts of blur through a brush in 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.760
 first thing to do is to settle 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.400
 the amount of blur 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.229
 so be careful here too after having the 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.390
 hand too heavy on the blur that has 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.890
 applied it could create an effect a 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.540
 little too much support who would not be who 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.640
 would not be very nice so there for 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.180
 to show you I'm still pushed to 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.659
 5 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.299
 the blur but hey it rarely needs 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.070
 exceeded that level even though you can 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.200
 to go much further he was fucking 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.479
 completely the image unless you want 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.560
 create really special effects if 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.060
 you want it to keep a little bit of 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.330
 natural it is better to stay in these 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.369
 waters there 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.320
 then you will click on your 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.170
 painting so he's going to make you 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.370
 actually appear a brush brush 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.409
 button you will be able to choose the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.800
 size and this person in fact will you 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.370
 allow to remove the blur on the subject 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.830
 you want tourÃ© 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.800
 so here's where I start the 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.570
 clipping work so you have to do 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.630
 be careful not to go overboard 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.550
 the object you want to turn and not 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.770
 to do this so in fact we do the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.110
 bigger with the fangs of brushes and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.570
 then we reduce the size to make 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.250
 measure for retouching 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.720
 more precise it is a job that can 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.480
 which can be relatively meticulous 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.560
 the idea is not to overflow and 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.210
 from here to let the background does not 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.530
 create too much to be born in the bottom you 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.980
 see I overflow a little bit so there 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.929
 it's not so good so that's 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.760
 a job a little me 2 minutia to 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.930
 perform well it had to go 5 10 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.770
 minutes for 1 point in pictures as 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.390
 This puts those so here is the result 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.800
 is that in fact you find yourself a 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.070
 image born on the object that you 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.450
 turned and the flank and and the fund is a 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.220
 crazy so that actually detaches 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.720
 the object on the bottom she also creates a 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.300
 depth effect which which can be 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.930
 nice so as I said on the blog 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.520
 it's an effect that's mainly 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.110
 used on the for portraits in 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.570
 does that allow tasks and the subject of the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.640
 from the bottom and then to create a blur 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.430
 harmonious so that's it so I'm not going 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.780
 you do all the object in session I 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.700
 will show you earlier the result 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.250
 finished once we've got some towers and 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.870
 where the object with meticulousness 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.980
 so here are the facts you get 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.140
 you have more than after she 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.660
 saved on your computer and you 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.440
 have an image with a neat topic on a 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.350
 background that is wrong 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.420
 so here is the software the tutorial for 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.530
 our dreams over so I tell you 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.300
 go to the blog 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.300
 and see you soon goodbye
