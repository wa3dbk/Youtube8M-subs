00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
probably be like next at just X that

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.640 
probably be like next at just X that
exploded<00:05:42.390> like<00:05:42.600> faster<00:05:43.020> than<00:05:43.140> this<00:05:43.230> day<00:05:43.410> my

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
exploded like faster than this day my

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
gear gear my gear give that day like if

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.860 
gear gear my gear give that day like if
you<00:05:46.950> leave<00:05:47.070> that<00:05:47.250> armor<00:05:47.490> on<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.670> field<00:05:47.910> like
