moved ahead to second place but the race
wasn't<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.380> simple<00:02:24.650> we<00:02:25.160> had<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.370> prove

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
wasn't that simple we had to prove

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.370 
wasn't that simple we had to prove
ourselves<00:02:25.790> mentally<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.720> we<00:02:26.900> could<00:02:27.080> do<00:02:27.230> this

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
ourselves mentally that we could do this

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.730 
ourselves mentally that we could do this
because<00:02:28.280> we<00:02:28.550> got<00:02:28.640> knocked<00:02:28.910> down<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.120> few<00:02:29.240> times

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
because we got knocked down a few times

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.080 
because we got knocked down a few times
we<00:02:30.740> knew<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.070> coming<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.520> we<00:02:31.760> were<00:02:31.850> gonna<00:02:31.940> get

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
we knew this coming in we were gonna get

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.680 
we knew this coming in we were gonna get
knocked<00:02:32.300> down<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.780> lot<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:34.910> we<00:02:35.090> didn't<00:02:35.300> give<00:02:35.450> up

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
knocked down a lot but we didn't give up

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.810 
knocked down a lot but we didn't give up
each<00:02:35.930> time<00:02:35.990> we<00:02:36.380> got<00:02:36.500> knocked<00:02:36.710> down<00:02:36.800> we<00:02:37.550> came

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
each time we got knocked down we came

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.900 
each time we got knocked down we came
back<00:02:38.090> stronger<00:02:38.720> because<00:02:39.380> we<00:02:39.650> knew<00:02:39.950> we<00:02:40.730> had<00:02:40.880> the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
back stronger because we knew we had the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.290 
back stronger because we knew we had the
heart<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.990> warrior<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:43.130> win<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.459> all<00:02:43.610> to
