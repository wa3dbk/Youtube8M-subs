on this roof
and<00:00:32.850> there's<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> chimney<00:00:33.720> that<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.050> sweep

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and there's a chimney that you can sweep

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.569 
and there's a chimney that you can sweep
out<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.010> suit<00:00:35.430> character<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.370> this

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
actually put these blocks on there in

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.390 
actually put these blocks on there in
order<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.489> solve<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:06.090> math<00:01:06.360> equation<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:08.369> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
order to solve a math equation so I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.250 
order to solve a math equation so I
choose<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:08.930> immense<00:01:10.430> knowledge<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
choose my immense knowledge of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.160 
choose my immense knowledge of
multiplication<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.570> calculator<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
multiplication and my calculator and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.570 
multiplication and my calculator and
ahead<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.770> figured<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:20.180> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
yeah and the many kids spawns after that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.920 
yeah and the many kids spawns after that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
further and there's a gray box back here

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.860 
further and there's a gray box back here
and<00:01:55.300> make<00:01:55.390> sure<00:01:55.510> you<00:01:55.570> don't<00:01:55.690> miss<00:01:55.840> that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
and make sure you don't miss that

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.830 
and make sure you don't miss that
because<00:01:56.200> it's<00:01:56.440> pretty<00:01:56.590> easy<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:56.950> miss<00:01:57.160> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
because it's pretty easy to miss and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.240 
because it's pretty easy to miss and
then<00:01:58.840> there's<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.170> chimney<00:01:59.650> up<00:01:59.770> here<00:02:01.050> and<00:02:02.250> then

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
then there's a chimney up here and then

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.240 
then there's a chimney up here and then
you<00:02:03.970> hop<00:02:04.150> back<00:02:04.360> down<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:04.930> hop<00:02:05.470> up<00:02:05.500> over<00:02:06.010> here

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
on the right and there's another chimney

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.950 
on the right and there's another chimney
here<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:09.460> can<00:02:09.610> get<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.060> that's<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.330> three<00:02:10.840> out

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
here you can get and that's a three out

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.960 
here you can get and that's a three out
of<00:02:10.990> five<00:02:11.170> for<00:02:11.440> those<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:14.350> then<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.580> left

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
of five for those and then on the left

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.730 
of five for those and then on the left
here<00:02:16.210> again<00:02:16.480> there's<00:02:17.020> going<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.380> be<00:02:17.470> another

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
here again there's going to be another

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.870 
here again there's going to be another
box<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:20.130> that's<00:02:21.130> three<00:02:21.400> out<00:02:21.460> of<00:02:21.550> five<00:02:21.700> on

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
box and that's three out of five on

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.840 
box and that's three out of five on
those<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.390> then<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.800> fourth<00:02:24.160> chimney<00:02:24.730> is

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
those and then the fourth chimney is

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.810 
those and then the fourth chimney is
here<00:02:25.120> too

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
here too

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.430 
here too
so<00:02:27.820> after<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.330> get<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.630> you're<00:02:29.140> gonna<00:02:29.260> run

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
so after you get that you're gonna run

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.920 
so after you get that you're gonna run
back<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.740> hop<00:02:30.100> into<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.580> Walker<00:02:31.270> thing<00:02:31.690> and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
back and hop into this Walker thing and
