00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
what I'm finding interested in fun is

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.310 
what I'm finding interested in fun is
that<00:02:59.940> they're<00:03:00.209> not<00:03:00.299> starting<00:03:00.720> necessarily<00:03:01.200> in

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
that they're not starting necessarily in

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.930 
that they're not starting necessarily in
the<00:03:01.440> entry<00:03:01.709> level<00:03:01.739> in<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.310> smaller<00:03:02.580> lecture

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
the entry level in the smaller lecture

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.729 
the entry level in the smaller lecture
classes<00:03:03.150> they<00:03:03.900> throw<00:03:04.140> them<00:03:04.260> right<00:03:04.290> into<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
classes they throw them right into the

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.350 
classes they throw them right into the
buggies<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.100> they're<00:03:05.370> racing<00:03:05.760> right<00:03:05.970> next<00:03:06.299> to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
buggies and they're racing right next to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.090 
buggies and they're racing right next to
the<00:03:06.450> adults<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.260> series<00:03:07.590> will<00:03:07.739> definitely

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the adults the series will definitely

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.970 
the adults the series will definitely
grow<00:03:08.330> right<00:03:09.330> now<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.140> way<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.440> had<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.590> set<00:03:10.709> up

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980

that<00:05:18.770> much<00:05:18.949> either<00:05:19.160> we've<00:05:19.580> been<00:05:19.760> qualifying

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
that much either we've been qualifying

separately<00:05:21.110> but<00:05:21.229> i<00:05:21.289> do<00:05:21.410> believe<00:05:21.590> he's<00:05:22.099> doing<00:05:22.280> a

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
separately but i do believe he's doing a

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.610 
separately but i do believe he's doing a
little<00:05:22.610> bit<00:05:22.820> better<00:05:22.940> than<00:05:23.870> I<00:05:24.020> was<00:05:24.260> so<00:05:24.500> we'll

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
little bit better than I was so we'll

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.670 
little bit better than I was so we'll
have<00:05:24.710> to<00:05:24.860> see<00:05:25.010> what<00:05:25.130> da<00:05:25.310> main<00:05:25.870> brings<00:05:26.870> up<00:05:27.050> been

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680
