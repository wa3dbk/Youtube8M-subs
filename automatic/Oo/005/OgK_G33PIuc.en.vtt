things<00:02:57.100> about<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.549> phone<00:02:57.819> is<00:02:58.090> when<00:02:58.359> it<00:02:58.450> has

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
things about this phone is when it has

video the dedicated camera button and a

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.349 
video the dedicated camera button and a
selector<00:03:02.920> switch<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.579> can<00:03:03.790> easily

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
selector switch so that you can easily

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.120 
selector switch so that you can easily
switch<00:03:04.600> from<00:03:04.630> 2d<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.590> 3d<00:03:06.660> apart<00:03:07.660> from<00:03:07.870> that

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
switch from 2d to 3d apart from that

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.170 
switch from 2d to 3d apart from that
it's<00:03:09.840> pretty<00:03:10.840> similar<00:03:11.230> as<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.280> say<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.730> HTC

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
it's pretty similar as I say to the HTC

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.699 
it's pretty similar as I say to the HTC
Sensation<00:03:13.720> one<00:03:13.870> thing<00:03:14.049> I've<00:03:14.139> just<00:03:14.170> noticed

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
Sensation one thing I've just noticed

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.590 
Sensation one thing I've just noticed
though<00:03:14.920> which<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.030> going<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.239> take<00:03:16.389> some

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
though which is going to take some

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.170 
though which is going to take some
getting<00:03:16.840> used<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.880> volume

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
getting used to is that the volume

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.180 
getting used to is that the volume
rocker<00:03:19.540> switch<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.049> on<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.260> other<00:03:20.380> side<00:03:20.650> to

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
rocker switch is on the other side to

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.259 
rocker switch is on the other side to
the<00:03:21.280> HTC<00:03:22.120> Sensation<00:03:22.870> didn't<00:03:23.139> realize<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:24.269> on

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
the HTC Sensation didn't realize that on

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.259 
the HTC Sensation didn't realize that on
the<00:03:25.510> left<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.980> HTC<00:03:27.430> Sensation<00:03:28.030> we've<00:03:28.150> got

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
the left of the HTC Sensation we've got

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.830 
the left of the HTC Sensation we've got
the<00:03:28.329> volume<00:03:28.690> rockers<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:30.549> on<00:03:30.910> Eva<00:03:31.329> that's<00:03:31.599> on

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
the volume rockers and on Eva that's on

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.349 
the volume rockers and on Eva that's on
the<00:03:31.930> right<00:03:32.790> let's<00:03:33.790> take<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.000> bit<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.209> getting

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
the right let's take a bit of getting

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.740 
the right let's take a bit of getting
used<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:35.069> does<00:03:36.069> feel<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.370> bit<00:03:36.579> heavier<00:03:36.910> somehow

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
used to does feel a bit heavier somehow

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.420 
used to does feel a bit heavier somehow
bit<00:03:37.959> thicker<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.709> bigger<00:03:38.889> in<00:03:39.099> there<00:03:39.280> and

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
bit thicker and bigger in there and

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.210 
bit thicker and bigger in there and
obviously<00:03:39.549> it's<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:40.620> slightly<00:03:41.620> thicker<00:03:41.919> phone

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
obviously it's a slightly thicker phone

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.849 
obviously it's a slightly thicker phone
but<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.120> don't<00:03:43.329> really<00:03:43.480> mind<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:44.230> don't

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
but I don't really mind that I don't

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.530 
but I don't really mind that I don't
understand<00:03:45.280> people's<00:03:45.760> obsession<00:03:46.180> as<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:46.359> said

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
understand people's obsession as I said

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.509 
understand people's obsession as I said
in<00:03:46.630> an<00:03:46.750> earlier<00:03:46.840> video<00:03:47.169> within<00:03:47.769> this<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:50.519> mean

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
in an earlier video within this I mean

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.920 
in an earlier video within this I mean
the<00:03:51.669> main<00:03:51.849> reason<00:03:52.150> I've<00:03:52.239> got<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.510> phone<00:03:52.750> is

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
the main reason I've got this phone is

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.449 
the main reason I've got this phone is
not<00:03:53.169> really<00:03:53.380> anything<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.709> do<00:03:53.889> with<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.069> 3d

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
not really anything to do with the 3d

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.890 
not really anything to do with the 3d
which<00:03:54.880> is<00:03:55.060> obviously<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:55.419> bit<00:03:55.720> gimmicky

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
which is obviously a bit gimmicky

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.629 
which is obviously a bit gimmicky
although<00:03:56.349> it<00:03:56.440> would<00:03:56.530> be<00:03:56.560> quite<00:03:56.859> good<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.489> show

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
although it would be quite good to show

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.210 
although it would be quite good to show
off<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.910> your<00:03:57.970> friends<00:03:58.030> national<00:03:59.069> that's<00:04:00.069> all

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
thing to play with the main reason I've

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.349 
thing to play with the main reason I've
got<00:04:02.859> news<00:04:03.040> Familia<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.430> because<00:04:03.699> it<00:04:03.820> has<00:04:04.000> be<00:04:04.269> an

got news Familia is because it has be an
extra<00:04:04.630> Ram<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.109> mainly<00:04:05.530> because<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.949> has

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
extra Ram and mainly because it has

extra Ram and mainly because it has
bigger<00:04:06.560> battery<00:04:07.090> battery<00:04:08.090> life<00:04:08.270> is<00:04:08.690> important

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
bigger battery battery life is important

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.210 
bigger battery battery life is important
to<00:04:09.290> me<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.440> think<00:04:09.530> if<00:04:09.800> you've<00:04:09.920> got<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.130> be<00:04:10.190> a

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
to me I think if you've got to be a

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.270 
to me I think if you've got to be a
heavy<00:04:10.430> user<00:04:11.140> but<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.650> actually<00:04:12.890> don't<00:04:13.160> mind

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
heavy user but so I actually don't mind

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.840 
heavy user but so I actually don't mind
a<00:04:13.820> bit<00:04:14.570> more<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.960> thicker<00:04:15.380> phone<00:04:15.700> if<00:04:16.700> it

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
a bit more of a thicker phone if it

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.070 
a bit more of a thicker phone if it
means<00:04:16.940> we<00:04:17.090> could<00:04:17.180> have<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.330> bigger<00:04:17.510> battery<00:04:17.660> of

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
means we could have a bigger battery of

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.210 
means we could have a bigger battery of
course<00:04:18.290> this<00:04:18.410> is<00:04:18.560> thicker<00:04:18.739> because<00:04:18.920> of<00:04:19.070> the

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
course this is thicker because of the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.800 
course this is thicker because of the
two<00:04:19.400> cameras<00:04:19.850> as<00:04:19.970> well<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.330> 3d<00:04:20.630> cameras<00:04:22.780> but<00:04:23.780> I

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
two cameras as well the 3d cameras but I

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.330

feel<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:42.170> little<00:04:42.860> heavier<00:04:43.160> than<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.400> sensation

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
feel a little heavier than a sensation

feel a little heavier than a sensation
I<00:04:44.240> mean<00:04:44.750> you<00:04:45.140> nearly<00:04:45.350> seem<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:45.770> be<00:04:45.830> able<00:04:45.890> to

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
I mean you nearly seem to be able to

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.280 
I mean you nearly seem to be able to
loosen<00:04:46.190> your<00:04:46.490> hair<00:04:46.640> but<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.880> still<00:04:47.120> feels<00:04:47.330> nice

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
loosen your hair but it still feels nice

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.690 
loosen your hair but it still feels nice
inside<00:04:48.710> one<00:04:48.950> of<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.100> things<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.490> love<00:04:49.670> about

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
inside one of the things I love about

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.820 
inside one of the things I love about
the<00:04:50.030> sensation<00:04:50.420> is<00:04:50.720> but<00:04:50.930> it<00:04:51.320> feels<00:04:51.590> really

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
the sensation is but it feels really

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.070 
the sensation is but it feels really
good<00:04:52.070> in<00:04:52.220> your<00:04:52.310> hand<00:04:52.580> feels<00:04:53.360> really<00:04:53.660> good<00:04:53.870> with

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
good in your hand feels really good with

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.710 
good in your hand feels really good with
the<00:04:54.170> knees<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:55.060> touching<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.150> screen<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.540> so

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
the knees and touching the screen and so

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.150 
the knees and touching the screen and so
on<00:04:56.780> because<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:57.140> agree<00:04:57.350> on<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.470> glass<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.890> think

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
on because of agree on the glass I think

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.310 
on because of agree on the glass I think
this<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.370> going<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.670> glass<00:04:58.820> also<00:04:59.140> you<00:05:00.140> know<00:05:00.230> it

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
this is going a glass also you know it

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.080 
this is going a glass also you know it
feels<00:05:00.590> pretty<00:05:01.220> good<00:05:01.460> so<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:04.010> suppose<00:05:04.880> it's<00:05:05.030> a

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
feels pretty good so I suppose it's a

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.340 
feels pretty good so I suppose it's a
judgment<00:05:05.480> call<00:05:05.630> whether<00:05:05.690> you<00:05:05.960> prefer<00:05:06.110> the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
judgment call whether you prefer the

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.260 
judgment call whether you prefer the
kind<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.650> square<00:05:06.980> looking<00:05:07.250> shape<00:05:07.520> or<00:05:07.730> the<00:05:07.940> oval

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
kind of square looking shape or the oval

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.940 
kind of square looking shape or the oval
shape<00:05:08.480> I<00:05:08.630> actually<00:05:08.810> kind<00:05:09.140> of<00:05:09.200> like<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.620> square

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
shape I actually kind of like the square

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.330 
shape I actually kind of like the square
shape<00:05:10.160> better<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.730> kind<00:05:11.330> of<00:05:11.390> think<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:12.340> mean

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
shape better I kind of think I mean

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.770 
shape better I kind of think I mean
obviously<00:05:13.430> this<00:05:13.700> looks<00:05:13.910> a<00:05:13.970> bit<00:05:14.000> more<00:05:14.330> like<00:05:14.390> the

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
obviously this looks a bit more like the

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.630 
obviously this looks a bit more like the
desire<00:05:15.470> in<00:05:15.710> shape<00:05:16.010> because<00:05:16.310> that's<00:05:16.460> more

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
desire in shape because that's more

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.730 
desire in shape because that's more
square<00:05:17.060> as<00:05:17.210> well

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
square as well

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.680 
square as well
baby<00:05:19.730> setting<00:05:20.090> looks<00:05:20.240> better<00:05:20.450> than<00:05:20.570> that

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
baby setting looks better than that

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.820 
baby setting looks better than that
because<00:05:20.810> of<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.080> different<00:05:21.380> buttons<00:05:21.560> and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
because of the different buttons and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.640 
because of the different buttons and
everything<00:05:22.870> just<00:05:23.870> quickly<00:05:24.169> go<00:05:24.350> over<00:05:24.380> what's

everything just quickly go over what's
