 that familiar in Iniesta 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.440
 pay attention to Libya

 accounted for in the new Hesse 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.330
 I have always been very excited about what to expect 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.090
 and over time you will always be 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.620
 Percent, you get more and more a penny the piece and the customers always 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.450
 musical education is also the musical satisfaction 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.100
 that is much nicer than new before 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 received an projection anonymous notice

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.990
 Coha 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.680
 so this time the program 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.160
 It is interesting for me that led to her demanding concerts 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.100
 have min year 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.560
 we have one 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.680
 Choirmasters have us 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.480
 can really motivate us to move forward 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.729
 Rewe and singing and musically educate 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.819
 in Stuttgart North Holding Corp. becomes 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.149
 unlike common method right from the beginning of capital that is 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:20.779
 rehearsed without piano 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:22.460
 I am totally convinced 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.460
 and that with this method questions the 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.170
 and the and the pool action or the dynamics 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.719
 right from the beginning 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.659
 stand in the foreground 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.499
 also with Eismann with this method as singer much faster the 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.160
 good and from when you get the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.000
 Now it is for the SpÃ¶ prevails 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.079
 out of your own imagination 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.549
 I like it the way you have to make the kids excited about the art 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.359
 lies 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.760
 then I find great samples here this year cappella rehearsals like the club me 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:58.859
 that's what the work really looks like and if that's the g point 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.419
 Of course, the four performances Concetto Lenz misery has grown little time 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:08.190
 he is the subject of the number of deaths b, for example on the EBA 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.950
 it is an absolute highlight and it probably does not play to the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.259
 leaders 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.219
 Sarah 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.479
 next to Aigner 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.349
 Now they do not have to be successful with my circle of friends 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.069
 Has 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.079
 May make the common interest in musicians sing together 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.819
 according to friendships and those and to the bondage in turn 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.819
 is positive it will be together 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.409
 OK

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.349

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.699
 I love it 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.060
 Of course, first of all 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.539
 the curiosity the sincerity 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.609
 and the will to achieve my score 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.509
 it makes me incredibly friendly 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.279
 the easy going 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:18.279
 happy positive mood 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.340
 that the circle 10

 with in such a text 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.469
 and also the immigrants in the medium term 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:38.889
 ultimately 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.889
 Of course, percent are also finished 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.490
 a permanent IOC Bligh 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.460
 Martin and St 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.020
 does not make any sense at all even his place has the desire over 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.610
 and actually the one culprit again and again Sammer would be in the light 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.409
 It would be nice to be here 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:00.469
 a very 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:04.089
 Versatile program have modern things as causes 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:08.079
 Per cent many things that are new to the choir but also some you already know 

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:11.229
 that 's always been singing so that we have our first example of 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:11.949
 Messiah 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.539
 Of course, in the end I am thrilled 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.289
 the enthusiasm may of the choir 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.610
 for the music 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.029
 the projects 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.370
 for the concerts for the audience reactions 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.969
 and again Corner 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.639
 together in the concerts to a unity 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.599
 Growing together then I would like to have some news introduced 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.020
 at the 90th 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.520
 everyone wears GTI 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.520
 we were 90 this the right one 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.230
 Homophon Hallelujah from the we make 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.490
