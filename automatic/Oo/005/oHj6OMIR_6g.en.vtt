00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.940
 I specially went to the hairdresser 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.519
 so keep looking 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.289
 anouk first of all congratulations especially 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.240
 what is it like to work in swimming trunks 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.890
 and especially to be able to give a lot of dirty 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.880

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.829

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.860
 very much 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.489
 yes the about to think what tips and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.020
 give my neighbor girl more ideas 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.940
 who would also like to pick it up because 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.920
 I think there is a lot of demand for it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 and this sometimes what good it yourself 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.010
 conscious to think about is yes I found 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.310
 really super nice 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.570
 most proud of yes 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.430
 well i'm just the rotten songbook 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.250
 what it looks like I really like the shape 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.040
 like I think he is very original 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.030
 it is really built with a general 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.520
 piece 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.140
 so often that is a fact or something 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.860
 from history 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.470
 then my piece comes across 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.600
 experiences about defending for example 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.830
 how does a piece come about who i am in it 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.120
 male and female football good in 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.920
 defend and why 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.510
 and then come the some tips on how you 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.250
 can be good at defending 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.680
 but this is also about headlines 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.060
 dribbling technology but also chapters 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.479
 like disappointment 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.770
 injuries busy yes you say just you 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.000
 can defend well actually you can 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.350
 good football anyway 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.760
 you are photogenic to a book 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.619
 cooperating is actually something you 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.000
 well not at all you can get it 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.850
 nice jacket to stand outside 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.500
 here then your mom is actually something 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.720
 what you are not good at 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.490
 your deposit enough things go I knew then 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.920
 perfectionistic so I experience it 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.380
 I myself would not always be our team 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.700
 the things that should do better for you 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.260
 you must not have too long in the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.700
 but its success linger 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.840
 of course I enjoy this as 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.460
 something 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.649
 yes if something comes out or if you want something beautiful 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.320
 prepared but it certainly is not me 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.700
 good at everything belong to ajax at it 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.039
 men's team is currently not like this 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.479
 well you sometimes think of it 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.580
 put me in there because then maybe it goes 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.830
 what better ah no I really don't think so 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.110
 no, we also have our lesser ones 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.970
 competitions and I also have my lesser one 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.440
 competitions and periods 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.569
 and I really believe it magnified 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.010
 I will come in how to speak 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.080
 over there with those with the boys over or with 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.400
 with people from van ajax one of the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.440
 a-selection of the here 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.000
 well little about their performance 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.880
 you that they should talk to me together 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.319
 and figure out where it all depends on 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.210
 we see is not very often anyway 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.490
 because the other times he train with it 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.170
 another field and so it is often it 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.000
 is just saying hello and briefly 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.430
 chat but I am not going too deep 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.040
 on their problems in no no cups 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.200
 coffee with my Ricardo van Rhijn e18 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.840
 commission balletje of course at the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.209
 lunch against or energy and yes then make 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.860
 have a chat but that's it 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.390
 and to follow everything actually from 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.090
 ajax do you ever read ajax showtime 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.810

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.239

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.400

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.980
 you always keep doing that 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.340
 good to bertha to what extent is important 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.110
 that this book comes that there is well me 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.090
 know very well that anouk is now a book 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.630
 made where a lot of young girls 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.980
 and also some guys of course for it 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.540
 can get tips from how they do it 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.920
 have done 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.350
 because whether cafÃ© is thinking is too 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.880
 easy thought 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.040
 how to reach the highest level 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.800
 playing football and this is another one 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.810
 Another thing they do to you and let 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.920
 or red line in there that's okay fun 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.410
 clearly 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.260
 oh the harder it work out 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.900
 disappointments swallow continue 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.120
 work as well as when things are not going well 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.700
 that's a good name here 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.980
 important that the network of your coming 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.460
 because i anouk the women's football 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.680
 dying anyway is getting stronger 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.450
 whether you are there or earlier that all costs 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.910
 or now also via miedema moroccan 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.110
 getting that anyway figureheads for 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.490
 lots of girls 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.690
 what people can look at and spot on 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.280
 the horizon 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.140
 create for someone who would love to 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.850
 want to play football or just the greeks of 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.010
 football is also possible 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.880
 and later at the World Cup in Canada where 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.240
 everyone already your 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.240
 I know 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.700
 you are actually very short here 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.000
 just heard but what is your special 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.830
 relationship that actually has with anouk 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.230
 well me next quality and we 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.260
 play soccer regularly with 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.210
 at the johan cruijff foundation and then 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.460
 we stand together in the field so I can 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.490
 see ls-ie on a very close angle 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.900
 come the rest of most football and the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.220
 unrest from maine amateur football sometimes 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.420
 in soccer 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.570
 no but she can really do well 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.940
 football a very calm very controlled 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.230
 but still i think it is for quite 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.630
 many girls who are just starting out with 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.920
 play football that yes it is fun to 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.050
 Read how it's actually a woman 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.060
 verbaan to go because yes it is still 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.110
 unlike men's soccer so basically 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.060
 not really how i am about women 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.850
 so football 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.400
 yes important and how 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.740
 it is important that it does right 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.900
 anouk is of course a role model in it 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.180
 Women's football is actually any football one 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.280
 girl who knows anouk hoogendijk 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.100
 So I think we have one who now 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.320
 can achieve the greatest thing 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.120
 have not read this book yet 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.410
 completely looked through 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.260
 those who themselves still think this type of channel 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.840
 so you put most things in it 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.669
 I know him well, but maybe I know him 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.040
 it's good that I can do something else 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.040
 learn who knows thanks yet
