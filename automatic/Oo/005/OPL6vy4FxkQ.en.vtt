on these cases they are made up of two

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.460 
on these cases they are made up of two
layers<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.340> material<00:00:26.760> there<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> silicon

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
layers of material there is a silicon

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.740 
layers of material there is a silicon
and<00:00:28.769> then<00:00:28.949> there<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.369> plastic<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.449> we

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
and then there is a plastic so on we

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.440 
and then there is a plastic so on we
don't<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.199> really<00:00:31.410> quick<00:00:31.590> show<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.450> how

don't the really quick show you how
these<00:00:33.600> cases<00:00:33.840> work<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.520> first<00:00:35.880> layer<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
these cases work so the first layer is

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.630 
these cases work so the first layer is
the<00:00:36.870> silicon<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.010> comes<00:00:38.370> right<00:00:38.520> off

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the silicon it just comes right off

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.180 
the silicon it just comes right off
really<00:00:39.090> easily<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.770> see<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.040> kind

quilted look to it and it's like really
flexible<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.850> really<00:00:47.850> thin<00:00:48.149> materials<00:00:48.629> so

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
flexible and really thin materials so

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
flexible and really thin materials so
this<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.910> part<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.500> have

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
this is one part of it and then you have

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.680 
this is one part of it and then you have
the<00:00:52.920> plastic<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:54.239> comes<00:00:54.510> apart

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the plastic right here this comes apart

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
the plastic right here this comes apart
into<00:00:55.020> two<00:00:55.110> pieces<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:56.489> when<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.969> your

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
screen a little bit if you're lying down

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.960 
screen a little bit if you're lying down
your<00:01:39.270> phone<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> flat<00:01:39.990> surface<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.680> way

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
your phone on the flat surface this way

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.510 
your phone on the flat surface this way
so<00:01:41.970> that's<00:01:42.119> pretty<00:01:42.390> cool<00:01:42.630> too<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.280> this<00:01:44.280> right

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
so that's pretty cool too and this right

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
it stands both way so it can stand up
