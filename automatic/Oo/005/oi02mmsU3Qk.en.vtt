00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.210
 you 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.969
 and good morning everyone and all those pm 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.890
 I hope you are well for a 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.329
 everywhere goes nickel today and we get 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.129
 find for a top 5 stuff the 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.449
 more raging on some flanks and 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.510
 exceptionally today I will be 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.860
 accompanied by my sister hi to you and 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.110
 so in fact master you do not know 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.489
 maybe not but it's so the head of the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.949
 clan war handed 2 if you want to come 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.510
 in the little warmie clan there is 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.579
 no problem actually he likes 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.470
 a lot of people but by then I think 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.000
 we will do a little cleaning and so 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.409
 you can come and do not hesitate to 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.390
 postulate you are looking for in the search 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.040
 of clan so things clan war handed 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.509
 2 and normally we are the only club 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.520
 was called like that so there is no 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.909
 problem at this level then in this 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.880
 video 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.770
 myself, I'll introduce you to three 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.570
 stuff that make me angry and my sister will you 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.280
 to present two so it's gone 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.220
 starts directly with the fifth 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.780
 position then at the fifth position 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.759
 we find a village that has its 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.799
 crowd reserves ie full of 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.060
 French but unfortunately the 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.229
 village owner does not have 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.900
 of book workers to be able to 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.520
 increase something then that's it 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.929
 in fact the problem is that if you 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.729
 are crowds but you do not have 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.759
 of workers to increase a building or 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.409
 even improve traps you can not 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.999
 so not spend your resources 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.569
 unless wasting seeking 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:50.389
 so parts of the villages found 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.469
 on general research and so for 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:53.299
 litters you can always the 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.590
 to spend by creating troops but the 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.659
 problem is that you can also 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.340
 get attacked by people 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.799
 who can you so want a lot 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.530
 of resources therefore the a61 hdv 7 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.600
 the person who can attack can fly 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.959
 up to 200 miles or 250 miles from 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.630
 each 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.429
 and then for the hd v10 that are crowd 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.060
 it can go even up to 500 miles 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.950
 each and if of course the extractors and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.650
 the mines are also complaining at this time 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.590
 that's up to a million 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.240
 possible resources to fly to the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.670
 fourth position 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.440
 we have the ban of the general chad 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.510
 while most of the time you 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.220
 did not make offensive remarks and 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.080
 often the players just signal you 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.050
 by jealousy of your number of trophies 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.340
 from your bed or from your village 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.900
 so that was for fourth place 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.910
 of the standings and now we get 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.220
 find for third place it's up to 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.110
 to say the smallest step of the podium 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.760
 then on the third place we find 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.280
 in fact a person who has become 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.330
 attack by lightning spells and that 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.650
 it's really something very 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.480
 very annoying and very very boring not 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.390
 happily warms clan thanks to the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.590
 updated July 2015 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.700
 people can not you anymore 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.740
 smashed your resources 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.420
 there is a layer of invincibility that 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.770
 form above her if ever you 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.140
 try the thunderbolts or the 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.520
 touch with the earthquake spell and so 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.770
 that's really a beautiful thing that has 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.150
 been directed by christophe gans then 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.650
 actually even I used myself 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.390
 so this technique to be able to 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.090
 fly over to write black where more gold 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.740
 but it's true that in defense it's 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.209
 however better because I was too 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.380
 victim of this kind of attacked here is at the 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.209
 second position of the ranking on 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.430
 finds signals indicating the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.440
 poor quality of your network and this 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.810
 bug can be very annoying because it can 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.430
 lead to a disconnect to place this 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.950
 plan is your leaf will be 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.930
 accounted for this may weigh in the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.240
 balance if you 're at war too 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.250
 your chair and casually we arrive 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.920
 directly to the first place of the 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.590
 podium and look at the picture we see 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.050
 that the person did 99% and only one 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.519
 star the only building that still holds 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.910
 standing it's the level town hall 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.769
 7 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.269
 and as you can see in fact there 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.670
 there is no defense 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.800
 so the only thing that prevents the wood from 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.780
 destroy the hd that's the time then for 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.910
 I think the time is 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.030
 badly distributed on the flank 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.220
 make an attack in three minutes to 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.660
 the ages and 17 h 10/8 it still goes but 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.370
 for ages and villeneuve or hd v10 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.540
 I think he should rather put 3 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.890
 minutes 30 or even four minutes 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.470
 to make an attack because otherwise 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.729
 it's not at all personal enough for me 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.979
 make 1 go away peace everything every time 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.880
 I miss a lot of time and that's it 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.610
 so I do not know if you agree 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.870
 with me but I think that several 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.540
 people are of the same opinion as me 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.890
 that there is no time for big 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.690
 lebel to make the tax on the purchase of 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.430
 seedlings this is so it will be all for 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.729
 this video I hope it will have you 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.100
 enjoyed 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.360
 tell me also if you like when 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.250
 I make videos with my sister so 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.660
 you tell me in the comments 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.790
 and so that will be all for this time 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.650
 thank you for watching the video please 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.820

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.479
