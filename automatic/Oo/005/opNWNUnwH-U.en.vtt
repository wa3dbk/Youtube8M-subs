00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.240
 after jesus christ it was a bishop 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.940

 then saint nicolas rival of the father 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.989
 Christmas or ancestor of Santa Claus 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.699
 to know it you have to dive into 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.320
 most famous legends in France 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.989
 tells how three little children 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.299
 misled to take refuge in a butcher who 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.280
 after having made the dinner Koopas 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.729
 in small pieces before throwing them 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.020
 in his memory seven years later 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.720
 Saint Nicholas vain asked for hospitality 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.900
 to the butchers and asked to taste the salty 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.090
 prepare seven years earlier 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.980
 the butcher is scared and runs away and 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.780
 Saint Nicholas revived the children a 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.160
 other legend is that of the man 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.590
 in debt who had no other 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.540
 solution to survive that to sell its 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.620
 three girls as slaves thing that 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.810
 was common in antiquity 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.520
 when nicolas took it he went during 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.620
 three consecutive nights throw by the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.570
 window enough money for that 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.710
 the father repays his debts and provides 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.260
 his three daughters a dowry 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.430
 curious thing some versions of 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.770
 this story tells that saint nicolas 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.630
 would have thrown the pieces by the chimney 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.160
 what's fun is that these two 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.260
 legends have probably the same origin 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.880
 Byzantine icons that told 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.070
 how would that nicolas have saved from 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.050
 execution three officers or notary 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.979
 unfairly doomed in the icons 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.300
 byzantine 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.460
 the saints being represented so 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.100
 disproportionate to men 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.200
 Christians later hurt 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.340
 interpreted his images and they took 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.140
 the three officers for children 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.660
 giving birth to the legends that we 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.520
 knows and knows since the twelfth century 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.360
 that it is said that saint nicolas goes from 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.610
 house in house 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.080
 in the night of December 5th to 6th for 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.000
 ask the children if they have been 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.590
 obedient wise children receive 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.060
 gifts while others 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.010
 receive a stick given by the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.560
 companion of saint nicolas the famous 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.390
 bogeyman who would be neither more nor 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.400
 less than the incarnation of the wicked 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.890
 butcher this is how saint-nicolas 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.290
 became the boss of little children and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.220
 by extension of schoolchildren what a report 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.170
 with Santa Claus 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.640
 you have to cross the Atlantic for the 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.890
 understand and do some phonetics 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.870
 in the fifteenth century the Protestant Reformation 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.610
 banished the legend of saint nicolas from a 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.100
 much of Europe except in 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.170
 Holland 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.820
 and the Dutch were among the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.800
 pioneers who colonized america 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.140
 taking with them their beliefs which 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.110
 saint nicolas which is pronounced sinter 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.060
 klaas in dutch sinter klaas becomes 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.220
 quickly santa claus in english 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.410
 americans and as you know santa 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.030
 claus and the name of Santa Claus in America 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.950
 in fact it seems that during the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.020
 decades after Christians 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.970
 American thinkers and had the idea of 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.070
 bring this children's holiday closer to the 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.510
 birth of the child jesus and that's it 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.460
 why Santa Claus who is only one 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.830
 modern vision of saint-nicolas done 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.540
 today his tour on December 24 the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.460
 Christian world is therefore divided in two 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.560
 those who remained faithful to the 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.220
 saint-nicolas and those who adopted his 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.740
 modern version 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.600
 Santa Claus and the children of Lorraine 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.380
 are probably the luckiest ones out there 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.380
 we do both
