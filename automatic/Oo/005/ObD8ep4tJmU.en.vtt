pounds of fish in a day depending on the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.190 
pounds of fish in a day depending on the
animal<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> time<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.189> year<00:01:17.399> so<00:01:18.359> how<00:01:18.929> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
animal and the time of year so how is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
animal and the time of year so how is
this<00:01:19.409> different<00:01:19.859> from<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.789> sea<00:01:21.090> lions<00:01:21.479> eat

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
this different from what sea lions eat

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.469 
this different from what sea lions eat
in<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.350> wild<00:01:22.380> well<00:01:23.249> it's<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.939> lot<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> same

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
in the wild well it's a lot of the same

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.349 
in the wild well it's a lot of the same
fish<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.350> these<00:01:25.770> fish<00:01:26.039> are<00:01:26.249> already<00:01:26.579> dead<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
fish but these fish are already dead the

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.539 
fish but these fish are already dead the
ones<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> wild<00:01:28.859> they<00:01:29.070> need<00:01:29.249> to<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
ones in the wild they need to go out and

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.880 
ones in the wild they need to go out and
catch<00:01:29.820> those<00:01:30.149> fish<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.659> themselves<00:01:31.109> that's<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
catch those fish for themselves that's a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770 
catch those fish for themselves that's a
little<00:01:32.070> bit<00:01:32.189> trickier<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.609> them<00:01:32.939> she<00:01:33.509> doesn't

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
little bit trickier for them she doesn't

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.359 
little bit trickier for them she doesn't
have<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> worry<00:01:33.990> about<00:01:34.140> predators<00:01:34.679> either<00:01:34.950> so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
have to worry about predators either so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.290 
have to worry about predators either so
I<00:01:35.399> think<00:01:35.549> she<00:01:35.880> has<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.060> pretty<00:01:36.179> good<00:01:36.420> here

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.000 

well<00:01:41.300> now<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.450> Sparky<00:01:41.930> has<00:01:42.050> all<00:01:42.230> filled<00:01:42.710> up

method<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.119> training<00:02:08.330> behaviors<00:02:08.960> and<00:02:09.260> we<00:02:09.740> use

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
method of training behaviors and we use

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.490 
method of training behaviors and we use
very<00:02:10.100> short<00:02:10.729> approximations<00:02:11.360> are<00:02:11.780> very<00:02:12.110> small

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
very short approximations are very small

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.910 
very short approximations are very small
steps<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.310> reach<00:02:13.940> our<00:02:14.150> training<00:02:14.510> goals<00:02:14.920> so

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
steps to reach our training goals so

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.890 
steps to reach our training goals so
teaching<00:02:16.460> my<00:02:16.730> puppy<00:02:17.030> at<00:02:17.150> home<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> bit<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.840> a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
teaching my puppy at home is a bit of a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.750 
teaching my puppy at home is a bit of a
challenge<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.770> anything<00:02:19.310> like<00:02:19.490> teaching

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
challenge is this anything like teaching

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.740 
challenge is this anything like teaching
a<00:02:19.940> dog<00:02:20.380> it's<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.740> lot<00:02:21.980> like<00:02:22.340> teaching<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.910> dog<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
a dog it's a lot like teaching a dog the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.810 
a dog it's a lot like teaching a dog the
methods<00:02:24.200> really<00:02:24.620> are<00:02:24.770> quite<00:02:24.980> similar<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.520> as

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
methods really are quite similar and as

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.370 
methods really are quite similar and as
a<00:02:25.850> matter<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.210> fact<00:02:26.300> they<00:02:26.570> do<00:02:26.780> use<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.200> same

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
a matter of fact they do use the same

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.530 
a matter of fact they do use the same
clickers<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:28.160> do<00:02:28.630> Cece<00:02:29.630> target<00:02:30.110> good<00:02:31.540> so

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
clickers that we do Cece target good so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.720 
clickers that we do Cece target good so
this<00:02:32.750> Sparky<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.290> an<00:02:33.440> exercise<00:02:33.980> routine<00:02:34.280> or

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
this Sparky have an exercise routine or

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.280 
this Sparky have an exercise routine or
does<00:02:34.970> she<00:02:35.000> get<00:02:35.209> all<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.510> activity<00:02:35.959> she<00:02:36.140> needs

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
does she get all the activity she needs

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.830 
does she get all the activity she needs
during<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.800> training<00:02:37.070> Sparky<00:02:38.000> does<00:02:38.390> like<00:02:38.660> to

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
during the training Sparky does like to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.960 
during the training Sparky does like to
swim<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.110> lot<00:02:39.320> on<00:02:39.590> her<00:02:39.920> own<00:02:40.130> but<00:02:40.580> we<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.940> make

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
swim a lot on her own but we do make

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.150 
swim a lot on her own but we do make
sure<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.690> within<00:02:42.080> her<00:02:42.380> training<00:02:42.650> sessions

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
sure that within her training sessions

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.820 
sure that within her training sessions
she<00:02:43.489> does<00:02:43.730> get<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.600> good<00:02:45.110> amount<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.500> exercise

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
she does get a good amount of exercise

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.310 
she does get a good amount of exercise
and<00:02:46.370> that's<00:02:46.580> part<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.450> reason<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.989> we<00:02:48.140> do

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
and that's part of the reason that we do

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.080 
and that's part of the reason that we do
training<00:02:48.800> is<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.100> make<00:02:49.280> sure<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:50.060> our

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
training is to make sure that our

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.840 
training is to make sure that our
animals<00:02:50.660> get<00:02:50.870> exercised<00:02:54.400> well<00:02:55.400> thanks<00:02:55.670> city

to know to take care of seals and sea

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.100 
to know to take care of seals and sea
lions<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.360> what<00:03:16.480> are<00:03:16.600> some<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.840> their<00:03:16.930> health

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
lions and what are some of their health

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.020 
lions and what are some of their health
concerns<00:03:17.530> well<00:03:18.100> for<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.370> most<00:03:18.550> part<00:03:18.640> seals

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
concerns well for the most part seals

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.610 
concerns well for the most part seals
and<00:03:19.210> sea<00:03:19.330> lions<00:03:19.360> are<00:03:19.660> pretty<00:03:19.870> healthy<00:03:20.200> animals

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
and sea lions are pretty healthy animals

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.080 
and sea lions are pretty healthy animals
so<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.830> lot<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.340> things<00:03:21.550> that<00:03:21.610> we<00:03:21.790> do<00:03:21.910> here

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
so a lot of the things that we do here

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.880 
so a lot of the things that we do here
are<00:03:22.240> just<00:03:22.360> prevention<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.170> we<00:03:23.380> through<00:03:23.830> a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
are just prevention so we through a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.320 
are just prevention so we through a
training<00:03:24.130> program<00:03:24.580> we're<00:03:24.760> able<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:25.060> kind<00:03:25.240> of

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
training program we're able to kind of

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.850 
training program we're able to kind of
examine<00:03:25.780> them<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.050> keep<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.260> daily<00:03:26.440> look<00:03:26.710> at

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
examine them and keep a daily look at

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.380 
examine them and keep a daily look at
them<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.250> as<00:03:27.490> they<00:03:27.670> get<00:03:27.790> older<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.270> like

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
them and and as they get older just like

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.940 
them and and as they get older just like
people<00:03:28.660> sometimes<00:03:29.260> they<00:03:29.410> do<00:03:29.470> get<00:03:29.680> some<00:03:29.830> eye

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
people sometimes they do get some eye

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.260 
people sometimes they do get some eye
problems<00:03:30.310> or<00:03:30.430> some<00:03:30.550> joint<00:03:30.760> problems<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.180> we

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
problems or some joint problems so we

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.720 
problems or some joint problems so we
just<00:03:31.420> keep<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.600> look<00:03:31.810> at<00:03:31.930> for<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:33.160> what

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
just keep a look at for that so what

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.390 
just keep a look at for that so what
goes<00:03:33.940> on<00:03:34.120> during<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.630> sparky<00:03:35.080> checkup<00:03:35.500> well<00:03:36.100> for

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
goes on during a sparky checkup well for

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.770 
goes on during a sparky checkup well for
the<00:03:36.460> most<00:03:36.640> part<00:03:36.820> we<00:03:37.000> train<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:37.330> animals<00:03:37.690> at

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
the most part we train the animals at

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.510 
the most part we train the animals at
least<00:03:37.959> three<00:03:38.140> times<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.500> day<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.890> during<00:03:39.250> those

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
least three times a day and during those

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.730 
least three times a day and during those
we<00:03:39.760> can<00:03:39.910> do<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.060> wide<00:03:40.480> range<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:41.020> exams<00:03:41.380> we<00:03:41.590> can

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
we can do a wide range of exams we can

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.320 
we can do a wide range of exams we can
check<00:03:41.920> their<00:03:42.100> mouths<00:03:42.310> we<00:03:43.000> check<00:03:43.180> their

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
check their mouths we check their

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.300 
check their mouths we check their
flippers<00:03:43.750> basically<00:03:44.620> just<00:03:44.770> do<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.950> full<00:03:45.160> body

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
flippers basically just do a full body

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.010 
flippers basically just do a full body
exam<00:03:45.790> make<00:03:46.030> sure<00:03:46.060> they<00:03:46.270> don't<00:03:46.300> have<00:03:46.600> any<00:03:46.720> cuts
