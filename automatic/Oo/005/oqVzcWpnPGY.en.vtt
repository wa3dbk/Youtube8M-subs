00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.910
 [Music] 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.849
 how about my means how are they and how good 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.909
 as the title says now I bring you the 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.789
 game called pacman world that is for 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:26.349
 the playstation 10 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:30.050
 I have it for the PC and without needing 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.090
 ok emulator well 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.640
 all we have to do is go 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.190
 to the next link that I will leave in 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.519
 the description of the video 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.739
 give you a download to wait for the start 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.449
 download and wait for the end of 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.400
 download me for while I cancel it 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.210
 because I already have it 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.520
 these are some texture packs for 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.490
 for minecraft 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.250
 then if they want to be I can teach them 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.830
 and all that 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.660
 ok well once the download is finished 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:09.240
 we will have a rar file like this one 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.970
 what we have to do is give him extract 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.680
 here as everyone already knows how to extract a 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.790
 archive and then for those who do not know 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.760
 they need winrar 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.680
 and all that will be the archives 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.270
 like these 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.150
 this is the game but they need this 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.560
 to open it this we have it 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:36.920
 put in we're going to team 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.360
 to local disk to windows 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.110
 here we look for a folder that is called 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.710
 system32 this assistant 32 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.720
 and here in this folder we give little 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.450
 so they do not get into one of those 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.870
 folders here there are 32 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.170
 what we do is move this this 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.810
 file here and give it in move and 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.369
 replace 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.369
 and give it in continue 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.800
 we wait 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.320
 once the file is in the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.010
 folder there are 32 we can close 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.420
 this is going to work for us the pacman 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.800
 let's see how 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.800
 let's see if you can 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.120
 we do not wait for it to open 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.340
 look for it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.359
 As you can see, all this window of 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.340
 here they do not close it this is needed to 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.330
 that now the game 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.240
 here says press x 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.420
 well for who knows what it gives but 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.430
 here says press in the circle to 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.329
 Start the game 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.969
 here in file in configuration and here 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.000
 in controls you can see which key is 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:24.209
 each button and here you can change it 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.390
 on memory cards you are going to have 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.860
 created some memory cards 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.080
 in this case the key the the key c is 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.200
 the circle that we have to crush the 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.200
 c 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.490
 I do not think the ce is lx 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.090
 if it is the x of crush when doing for 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.090
 start it 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.110
 [Music] 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.910
 now let's wait 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.910
 and the game is already starting 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.190
 Well, as you can see, everything is fine, everything is 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.960
 perfect 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:12.260
 and it's very easy to control it and all that 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.770
 we are going to put him to be of what use 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.770
 fallen 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.750
 and look 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:31.300
 watching me playing street guido 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:34.930
 Well, if the game helped them 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.100

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.100

 totally good that has been all 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.010
