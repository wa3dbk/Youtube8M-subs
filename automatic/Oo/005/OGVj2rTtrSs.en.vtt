the<00:00:38.040> coven<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.610> wasn't<00:00:38.820> sure<00:00:39.120> how<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.420> were

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510

the coven I wasn't sure how they were
gonna<00:00:39.690> come<00:00:39.899> out<00:00:40.140> because<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:42.090> wasn't<00:00:42.300> human

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660

that when I did my hair in and took it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300 
that when I did my hair in and took it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
out I could stuff I could still feel the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
out I could stuff I could still feel the
heat<00:01:17.670> through<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.909> towel<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.630> how<00:01:18.840> hot<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
heat through the towel that's how hot it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
heat through the towel that's how hot it
was<00:01:20.030> I<00:01:21.530> think<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.650> dipped<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.220> each<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.000> did<00:01:24.210> like

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
was I think I dipped in each I did like

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.270 
was I think I dipped in each I did like
great<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.960> maybe<00:01:25.259> two<00:01:25.500> or<00:01:25.560> three<00:01:25.619> braids<00:01:26.040> in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
great like maybe two or three braids in

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.609 
great like maybe two or three braids in
at<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> time<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:27.090> much<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.689> could<00:01:28.080> fit<00:01:28.380> without

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
at a time as much as I could fit without

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.749 
at a time as much as I could fit without
me<00:01:29.009> getting<00:01:29.189> burnt<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.320> each<00:01:31.759> for

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
me getting burnt I think for each for

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.039 
me getting burnt I think for each for
the<00:01:32.850> amount<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> grace<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> had<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the amount of grace I had I think I

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.630 
the amount of grace I had I think I
probably<00:01:34.200> left<00:01:34.500> them<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:34.979> maybe<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
probably left them in for maybe like a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640 
probably left them in for maybe like a
minute<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> two<00:01:36.750> minutes<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.229> felt<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.619> was

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
minute to two minutes it felt like I was

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.560 
minute to two minutes it felt like I was
in<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> long<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.430> maybe<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.820> minute<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.390> two

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
in for a long time maybe a minute to two

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.980 
in for a long time maybe a minute to two
minutes<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:40.110> each<00:01:40.229> braid<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:42.270> long<00:01:42.600> I

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
minutes for each braid and that long I

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.760 
minutes for each braid and that long I
um<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.950> stayed<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.790> long<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
um I stayed in that long just so that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.069 
um I stayed in that long just so that
the<00:01:46.770> hot<00:01:47.040> water<00:01:47.310> at<00:01:47.490> least<00:01:47.670> seep<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the hot water at least seep in and if it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.539 
the hot water at least seep in and if it
was<00:01:49.320> good<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> game<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> call<00:01:50.009> pattern<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
was good a game of call pattern that I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.660 
was good a game of call pattern that I
would<00:01:50.729> really<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.780> car<00:01:52.110> pattern<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.430> that's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
would really get a car pattern so that's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.280 
would really get a car pattern so that's
what<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.880> did

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
what I did

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.280 
what I did
a<00:01:55.380> towel<00:01:55.950> dried<00:01:56.250> everything<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.150> then<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.780> took

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
a towel dried everything and then I took

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.930 
a towel dried everything and then I took
them<00:01:58.410> out<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.860> these<00:01:59.100> are<00:01:59.310> pictures<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.700> how

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
them out so these are pictures of how

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.110 
them out so these are pictures of how
the<00:02:00.000> hair<00:02:00.690> looks<00:02:01.490> unraveled<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.730> I<00:02:02.850> would<00:02:02.970> say

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
the hair looks unraveled and I would say

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.030 
the hair looks unraveled and I would say
it<00:02:03.300> did<00:02:03.510> curl<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.020> guess<00:02:04.230> maybe<00:02:04.410> because<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.800> used

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
it did curl I guess maybe because I used

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.280 
it did curl I guess maybe because I used
I<00:02:05.430> braided<00:02:05.850> I'm<00:02:06.120> tying<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.630> well<00:02:06.840> I've<00:02:06.990> used

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
I braided I'm tying a well I've used

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.800 
I braided I'm tying a well I've used
small<00:02:07.620> braids<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.520> curl<00:02:08.820> pattern<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.420> kind<00:02:09.690> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
small braids the curl pattern is kind of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.960 
small braids the curl pattern is kind of
tight<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.350> maybe<00:02:11.130> if<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> braid<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.730> bigger

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
tight so maybe if you braid and bigger

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.790 
tight so maybe if you braid and bigger
you<00:02:12.210> might<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.600> looser<00:02:13.020> curl<00:02:13.260> pattern<00:02:13.620> but

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you might get a looser curl pattern but

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
you might get a looser curl pattern but
I<00:02:13.920> mean<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.670> them<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.270> rock<00:02:15.420> out<00:02:15.570> with

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
I mean I like them I can rock out with

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.430 
I mean I like them I can rock out with
these<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.320> think<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.010> different<00:02:17.400> look<00:02:17.550> to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
these I think it's a different look to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.990 
these I think it's a different look to
you<00:02:19.440> singly<00:02:19.920> sister<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.400> your<00:02:20.490> title<00:02:20.850> ring

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
you singly sister and your title ring

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.580 
you singly sister and your title ring
I'm<00:02:21.180> straight<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.350> you're<00:02:22.500> about

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
I'm straight and you know you're about

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.020 
I'm straight and you know you're about
to<00:02:22.740> take<00:02:23.040> them<00:02:23.220> out<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.520> know<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:23.850> rock

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
to take them out you know you can rock

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.960 
to take them out you know you can rock
them<00:02:24.150> dipper<00:02:24.450> for<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.780> while
