00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.550
 Hello, good night, we need a 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.919
 new video today is the first mod came 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.080
 for minecraft 1.6 point 1 good today is 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:10.420
 the flight bot for these new 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.540
 thematic good number that I've done to 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.209
 enter minecraft 1.6 point 1 I do not know that 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.430
 this is a bug that brings the engine I'm going to 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.900
 teach but nothing more 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.640
 the truth is that I do not understand it much 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.430
 but it does not matter 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.020
 well let's the question the mobile flame 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.700
 is a good mod that allows us 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.529
 fly in survival mode as you see 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.320
 we were survival and only 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.870
 pressing the efe from above you see that 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.070
 It puts flying and good and how and after 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.280
 we can already fly it seems to me that if we 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.920
 we throw no value is worth to let go 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.920
 we press the efe and it is already 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.130
 if you are suddenly so good 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.130
 you hurt 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.050
 in the water not but 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.400

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.050

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.510
 changes for this new version of 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.160

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 minecraft 26.1 good in principle is going 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.620
 to be where he installed the mod with the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.510
 mc to cher are in principle then 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.420
 when they spend a few hours and go 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.070

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.159

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.920
 we will go see let's go as I said 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.530
 to install the mod and we will need mc 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.970
 for cher let's leave in the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.460
 description of the video the two pages of 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.890
 cph and the mod's 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.390
 So nothing 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.390
 let's go to the page 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.090
 and good and where it is for 1.6 point 1 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.799
 Well, any of these four lines 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.830
 we see a click and download it 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.440
 automatically then we go to the page 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.420
 of the play mode and download more down here and 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.590
 any of these two links so you 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.509
 we give if it also does not download 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.570
 automatically as you see guys I already 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.789
 I have both here and well now we are going to 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.709
 make a right click on the mc patch 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.950
 and we execute as administrator clausen 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.950
 yes 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.250
 the coast of being here she says that 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.590
 this beta version is worth not yet 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.790
 it is not the official 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.670
 and well I 'm going to start analyzing 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.879
 the hard dot file so we're going to 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.819
 wait a little bit and I can imagine that 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.950
 as time goes by then 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.799
 You can do all of these 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.659
 they will reduce them to those of the others 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.420
 Minecraft version worth no need 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.310

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.900
 of cake but good I have no idea 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.760

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.020
