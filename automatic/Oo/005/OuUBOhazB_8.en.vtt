00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.380 

ok<00:00:20.900> let's<00:00:21.900> get<00:00:22.050> started<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:23.300> don't<00:00:24.300> think

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
ok let's get started here I don't think

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.660 
ok let's get started here I don't think
I'm<00:00:24.960> gonna<00:00:25.880> LP<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.029> whole<00:00:27.210> game<00:00:27.480> because

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
I'm gonna LP the whole game because

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.049 
I'm gonna LP the whole game because
frankly<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.789> pretty<00:00:29.970> hard<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.759> really

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
frankly it's pretty hard and it really

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.940 
frankly it's pretty hard and it really
isn't<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.450> interesting<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.770> later

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
isn't that interesting in the later

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.920 
isn't that interesting in the later
levels<00:00:35.160> aside<00:00:35.610> from<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.059> art<00:00:36.420> direction<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
levels aside from the art direction it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.040 
levels aside from the art direction it
gets<00:00:37.079> pre<00:00:37.290> repetitive<00:00:38.629> and<00:00:39.629> I'll<00:00:39.840> explain

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
gets pre repetitive and I'll explain

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.450 
gets pre repetitive and I'll explain
what<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.320> mean<00:00:40.350> by<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.680> later<00:00:43.219> also<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> should

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
what I mean by that later also I should

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.450 
what I mean by that later also I should
point<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.180> i'm<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:46.260> actually<00:00:47.190> that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
point out that i'm not actually that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.780 

just<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:41.840> now<00:01:42.840> luckily<00:01:43.650> these<00:01:44.580> levels

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
just like that now luckily these levels

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.450 
just like that now luckily these levels
aren't<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.330> hard<00:01:45.979> if<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.160> start<00:01:47.370> at

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
aren't really that hard if you start at

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.620 
aren't really that hard if you start at
the<00:01:47.490> beginning<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:47.940> pretty<00:01:48.210> much<00:01:48.300> just

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the beginning you can pretty much just

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.170 
the beginning you can pretty much just
walk<00:01:49.110> straight<00:01:49.320> through<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.910> long<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
walk straight through and as long as you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.359 
walk straight through and as long as you
don't<00:01:51.330> fall<00:01:51.540> off<00:01:51.619> nothing<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.890> bad<00:01:53.100> will

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
don't fall off nothing that bad will

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.260 
don't fall off nothing that bad will
happen<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:56.369> biggest<00:01:56.550> threat<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.940> actually

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
happen the biggest threat is actually

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.969 
happen the biggest threat is actually
the<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:58.020> beetle<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.470> creatures<00:01:58.860> that

and<00:02:17.430> here's<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.330> guess<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.709> mini<00:02:19.860> boss<00:02:20.040> of

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and here's I guess it's a mini boss of

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.260 
and here's I guess it's a mini boss of
sorts<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:21.570> actually<00:02:21.690> harder<00:02:22.140> than<00:02:23.270> real

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
sorts it's actually harder than real

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.000

female protagonist in a video game I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.840 
female protagonist in a video game I
think<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:28.630> probably<00:03:28.840> correct<00:03:29.760> but<00:03:30.760> it's

think it's probably correct but it's

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.060 
think it's probably correct but it's
interesting<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.870> note<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:35.440> Metroid<00:03:35.860> even

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
interesting to note that in Metroid even

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.680 
interesting to note that in Metroid even
though<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.190> did<00:03:36.400> have<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.970> female<00:03:37.450> protagonist
