00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.330 
again me I had the whole motor out and
over<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.220> course<00:02:43.460> of<00:02:43.610> two<00:02:44.510> or<00:02:44.540> three<00:02:44.660> months

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
over a course of two or three months

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.780 
over a course of two or three months
took<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.460> all<00:02:46.640> apart<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:47.890> had<00:02:48.890> all<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.580> black

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
took it all apart I had all the black

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.110 
took it all apart I had all the black
things<00:02:50.120> powder-coated<00:02:51.280> all<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.610> silver

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
things powder-coated all the silver

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.270 
things powder-coated all the silver
stuff<00:02:53.660> was<00:02:53.840> repainted<00:02:54.380> by<00:02:54.650> me<00:02:54.830> after<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.160> was

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
stuff was repainted by me after it was

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.360 
stuff was repainted by me after it was
sandblasted<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:57.070> everything<00:02:58.070> put<00:02:58.250> together

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
sandblasted and everything put together

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.540 
sandblasted and everything put together
again<00:02:58.910> with<00:02:59.120> stainless<00:02:59.660> steel<00:03:00.370> nuts<00:03:01.370> and

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
again with stainless steel nuts and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.360 
again with stainless steel nuts and
bolts<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.560> probably<00:03:04.010> going<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.250> be

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
bolts so this is probably going to be

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.800 
bolts so this is probably going to be
the<00:03:04.520> cleanest<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.030> motor<00:03:05.240> is<00:03:05.360> ever<00:03:05.570> going<00:03:05.750> to

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
the cleanest this motor is ever going to

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.370 
the cleanest this motor is ever going to
be<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.710> kind<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.040> makes<00:03:07.190> me<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.370> little<00:03:07.430> bit<00:03:07.640> sad

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
be it kind of makes me a little bit sad

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.300 
be it kind of makes me a little bit sad
just<00:03:09.380> took<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.530> little<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.830> lot<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:10.010> pictures<00:03:10.160> of

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310

it<00:03:10.930> as<00:03:11.930> soon<00:03:12.140> as<00:03:12.230> some<00:03:12.380> heat<00:03:12.560> hits<00:03:12.770> this<00:03:12.950> we're

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
it as soon as some heat hits this we're
