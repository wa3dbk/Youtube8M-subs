00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.100
 this video is sponsored by copy 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.510
 jones 4 the application that allows you to 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.070
 transfer the content of your idevice 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.960
 to your computer 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.280
 hello ipod touch to the aporia 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.750
 today i will show you bleury 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.220
 'well background for your idevice 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.590
 jabri that it's less five fish 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.060
 and even the 6.0 plus then I know that 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.109
 I already made a video on blu ray 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.449
 of a big cyber who is a 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.679
 free studio application and this 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.900
 that it makes it really 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.420
 of costumes and customize actually 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.460
 the notification center interface 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.930
 so we can make it a certain 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.969
 different color we can make it 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.399
 transparent we decide not quoted and 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.680
 so it's a lot of settings that 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.360
 are added for the center of 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.829
 notifications simply by 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.989
 installing this app the op 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.300
 so ben laurie datchy background is 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.980
 now compatible highway if it's 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.649
 for that I make a video in pass 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.590
 so I typed blu ray from a cyber games 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.300
 studio and I did install confirmed 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.350
 so that's what we see here and then 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.969
 lets all of this can make it 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.860
 transparent that 's the purpose of 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.180
 first-time application have done 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.380
 install confirmed once 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.730
 installed there is no said on the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.439
 springboard of your device but there 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.400
 will have sections in the settings made 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.530
 that if I go into the settings 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.240
 here I went down more beautiful I must 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.250
 have blowin in the wind 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.710
 so if I go down pursuit we see 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.280
 that by default that's how it is at 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.750
 about 50% opacity then it will be 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.939
 there we do we see work center 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.380
 of notifications just made there 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.630
 we 're going to go into buried a background 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.939
 make sure and you that is activated by the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.380
 following the blur the radius that these surplus 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.090
 which is to the right 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.070
 - you will see below that 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.420
 we really see nothing and then 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.640
 question the mans left completely 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.340
 but there we see perfectly through 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.829
 so it's like a frosted glass or 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.450
 less free and if you who decide me 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.420
 I was about 50 so that's 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.689
 the perfect one because I'm the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.149
 better 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.369
 subsequently head colors then 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.049
 orange streelman for example back 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.149
 you have the opportunity to put it into play 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.289
 Then you can decide on the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.210
 more orange - a little orange blurred 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.710
 -If you want to do more trick either 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.270
 orange more than 120 right you 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.869
 would really know ben bergon orange to 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.550
 100% 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.800
 otherwise it would be just a little hue 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.900
 orange will put your lawn fixed value 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.410
 not only 50% pitt all 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.980
 colors that exercise at the high seas 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.600
 it was red make them 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.250
 Decide the one you want me by default 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.380
 I will take black because I find 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.820
 it is he who is better able to see the text in 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.160
 back then I find it's the most 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.810
 beautiful so far the fact that subsequently 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.460
 death parity if you want a small 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.860
 little less of the possibility if you 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.870
 do not want to see black anymore and soon I 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.250
 wish to turn more to the right that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.780
 that you decide at this level 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.670
 there and now for the category 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.670
 exception also you have for example a 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.320
 ex screen tv and you want that 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.940
 the fuzzy effect on which lives a 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.620
 lock is off meters 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.420
 just put it underneath but who 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.220
 rest by default tulsa off then this is 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.930
 everything else if that's all for the application 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.780
 blue red and see background for your 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.730
 idevice gerry kessler - 5.0 and even 6 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.920
 points or more then we can sometimes 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.300
 again one vote on the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.640
 raid so background we had it already 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.170
 put 5 stars actually that's still the 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.580
 case I put it again five stars a 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.820
 beautiful application for customize 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.070
 the russan interface of the notification 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.360
 forgiveness makes it for the one put 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.550
 five stars do you also 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.470
 can vote in beautiful where it tempts you 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.030
