what<00:00:17.490> you've<00:00:17.640> asked<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.420> so

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
what you've asked for and so

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
what you've asked for and so
vibrationally<00:00:19.800> speaking<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.490> know<00:00:20.609> you

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
vibrationally speaking and we know you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.400 
vibrationally speaking and we know you
don't<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.420> human<00:00:21.779> manifesting

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
don't like that is human manifesting

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.000 
don't like that is human manifesting
beings<00:00:23.210> but<00:00:24.210> vibrationally<00:00:24.900> speaking<00:00:25.500> what

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
beings but vibrationally speaking what

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.830 
beings but vibrationally speaking what
you've<00:00:26.189> asked<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.910> accomplished<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
you've asked for is accomplished in the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.300 
you've asked for is accomplished in the
moment<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.380> asked<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.130> wrote<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
moment that you asked for we wrote a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.070 
moment that you asked for we wrote a
whole<00:00:29.550> book<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:30.000> call<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> ask<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.960> is

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
whole book we call it ask and it is

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.049 
whole book we call it ask and it is
given<00:00:31.170> that's<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.340> about<00:00:32.579> when<00:00:32.910> you

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
given that's what it is about when you

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.110 
given that's what it is about when you
ask<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.960> given<00:00:34.320> immediately<00:00:35.000> but<00:00:36.000> then

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
ask it is given immediately but then

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.880 
ask it is given immediately but then
step<00:00:36.420> three<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.719> you've<00:00:37.110> got<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> find<00:00:37.620> some

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
step three is you've got to find some

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.380 
step three is you've got to find some
way<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.640> speak<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.059> what<00:00:39.239> you're

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
way to be up to speak with what you're

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.270 
way to be up to speak with what you're
asking<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.140> can't<00:00:40.410> doubt<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.040> want

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
asking for you can't doubt it and want

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
asking for you can't doubt it and want
it<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.960> you've<00:00:42.960> got<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> want<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.559> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
it and get it you've got to want it and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.229 
it and get it you've got to want it and
believe<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.280> over<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> order<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
believe in and over to order to get it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.880 
believe in and over to order to get it
and<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.170> ask<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and we are not going to ask you to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.490 
and we are not going to ask you to
suddenly<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.149> sudden<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.840> change<00:00:49.200> your

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
suddenly all of a sudden to change your

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
suddenly all of a sudden to change your
beliefs<00:00:49.800> because<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.579> can't<00:00:50.969> law<00:00:51.930> of

beliefs because you can't law of
attraction<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:53.039> accommodate<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
attraction will not accommodate that you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
attraction will not accommodate that you
can't<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:55.110> believed<00:00:55.500> something<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> long

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
can't have believed something for a long

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.910 
can't have believed something for a long
time<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> manifested<00:00:58.350> around<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
time and have it manifested around you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.770 
time and have it manifested around you
and<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.489> people<00:00:59.609> around<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.149> talking<00:01:00.570> about

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and the people around you talking about

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
and the people around you talking about
it<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.590> sudden<00:01:01.620> say<00:01:02.039> okay<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
it and all of a sudden say okay that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
it and all of a sudden say okay that
doesn't<00:01:03.030> serve<00:01:03.329> me<00:01:03.480> I'm<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> believe

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
doesn't serve me I'm going to believe

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
doesn't serve me I'm going to believe
this<00:01:04.170> instead<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> momentum

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
this instead because there is a momentum

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
this instead because there is a momentum
to<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> beliefs<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.350> already<00:01:07.530> hold<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
to the beliefs that you already hold and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.850 
to the beliefs that you already hold and
law<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> attraction<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.750> dishing<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.710> you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
law of attraction is dishing up to you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.620 
law of attraction is dishing up to you
evidence<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> beliefs<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.450> hold

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
evidence of the beliefs that you hold

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.080 
evidence of the beliefs that you hold
that's<00:01:12.990> why<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.229> keep<00:01:13.470> believing<00:01:13.920> them<00:01:14.100> we

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
that's why you keep believing them we

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999 
that's why you keep believing them we
just<00:01:15.299> want<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> understand<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.650> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
just want you to understand that if you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.670 
just want you to understand that if you
would<00:01:17.250> gently<00:01:17.700> try<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> believe<00:01:18.990> slightly

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
would gently try to believe slightly

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
would gently try to believe slightly
differently<00:01:20.159> than<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.759> about<00:01:20.970> things

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
differently than you do about things

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
differently than you do about things
that<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.720> want<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.680> universe<00:01:23.159> will<00:01:23.369> support

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that you want the universe will support

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.800 
that you want the universe will support
the<00:01:24.090> change<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:25.020> beliefs<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.830> see<00:01:26.810> so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the change in your beliefs you see so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
the change in your beliefs you see so
that's<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.920> about<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> momentum<00:01:29.790> thing

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that's all about the momentum thing

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.719 
that's all about the momentum thing
isn't<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.470> talk<00:01:31.740> about<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.310> think

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
isn't it if you talk about it and think

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
isn't it if you talk about it and think
about<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> manifest<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
about it it's going to manifest and the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.929 
about it it's going to manifest and the
momentum<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.340> stronger<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
momentum is going to get stronger and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.499 
momentum is going to get stronger and
stronger<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:37.140> more<00:01:37.320> attention<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.040> subject

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
stronger the more attention to a subject

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.100 
stronger the more attention to a subject
the<00:01:39.509> more<00:01:39.750> momentum<00:01:40.650> happens<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.110> what

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
deliberate about it and it's not so much

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.629 
deliberate about it and it's not so much
fun<00:05:27.000> when<00:05:27.599> you're<00:05:27.779> just<00:05:28.020> sort<00:05:28.229> of<00:05:28.289> sloppily<00:05:28.830> in

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
fun when you're just sort of sloppily in

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.950 
fun when you're just sort of sloppily in
deliberately<00:05:30.419> creating<00:05:31.379> by<00:05:31.800> default<00:05:32.779> most<00:05:33.779> of

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
those around you are doing that they are

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.930 
those around you are doing that they are
offering<00:05:37.289> most<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:38.039> their<00:05:38.159> vibration<00:05:38.759> in

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
offering most of their vibration in

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.019 
offering most of their vibration in
response<00:05:39.719> to<00:05:39.990> what<00:05:40.169> they<00:05:40.289> are<00:05:40.319> observing<00:05:41.190> so

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.029 
response to what they are observing so

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:44.209 
response to what they are observing so
when<00:05:42.150> they<00:05:42.270> see<00:05:42.330> something<00:05:42.690> wanted<00:05:43.229> they

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
when they see something wanted they

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.950 
when they see something wanted they
offer<00:05:44.400> vibration<00:05:45.120> about<00:05:45.360> that<00:05:45.569> when<00:05:45.779> they<00:05:45.900> see

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
offer vibration about that when they see

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.749 
offer vibration about that when they see
something<00:05:46.319> not<00:05:46.620> wanted<00:05:46.979> they<00:05:47.460> offer<00:05:47.610> a

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
something not wanted they offer a

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.640 
something not wanted they offer a
vibration<00:05:48.300> about<00:05:48.509> that<00:05:48.750> so<00:05:49.229> they<00:05:49.349> got<00:05:49.500> this

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
vibration about that so they got this

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.559 
vibration about that so they got this
cross<00:05:50.129> current<00:05:50.639> going<00:05:50.789> on<00:05:51.000> all<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.389> time

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
cross current going on all the time

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.019 
cross current going on all the time
which<00:05:52.020> is<00:05:52.050> what<00:05:52.379> makes<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:52.830> tired<00:05:53.159> and<00:05:53.580> that's

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
which is what makes you tired and that's

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:55.790 
which is what makes you tired and that's
what<00:05:54.210> makes<00:05:54.389> you<00:05:54.539> have<00:05:54.659> to<00:05:54.779> work<00:05:55.050> so<00:05:55.319> hard<00:05:55.349> it's

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
what makes you have to work so hard it's

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.769 
what makes you have to work so hard it's
what<00:05:55.979> puts<00:05:56.250> all<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.610> effort<00:05:57.089> in<00:05:57.270> everything

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
what puts all the effort in everything

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.339 
what puts all the effort in everything
that<00:05:57.810> you<00:05:57.930> do<00:05:58.400> so<00:05:59.400> many<00:05:59.550> people<00:05:59.699> are<00:06:00.240> not<00:06:00.750> clear

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
that you do so many people are not clear

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:02.629 
that you do so many people are not clear
about<00:06:01.529> the<00:06:01.889> thoughts<00:06:02.250> that<00:06:02.430> they<00:06:02.580> think

about the thoughts that they think

about the thoughts that they think
they're<00:06:03.120> not<00:06:03.270> offering<00:06:03.650> vibrationally

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
they're not offering vibrationally

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.980 
they're not offering vibrationally
thought<00:06:05.190> or<00:06:05.460> energy<00:06:05.879> that<00:06:06.029> is<00:06:06.120> clear<00:06:06.479> and<00:06:06.629> then

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
thought or energy that is clear and then

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.510 
thought or energy that is clear and then
they<00:06:07.080> try<00:06:07.319> to<00:06:07.379> compensate<00:06:07.889> for<00:06:08.430> the

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
they try to compensate for the

they try to compensate for the

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
contradiction and energy with hard work

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.550 
contradiction and energy with hard work
well<00:06:11.009> that's<00:06:11.729> why<00:06:11.909> you're<00:06:12.060> tired<00:06:12.409> that's<00:06:13.409> why
