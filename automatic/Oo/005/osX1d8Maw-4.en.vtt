00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
to transfer them it's going to take a

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.910 
to transfer them it's going to take a
while<00:03:45.580> because<00:03:46.580> I'm<00:03:46.819> trying<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.540> get<00:03:48.200> just<00:03:48.680> the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
while because I'm trying to get just the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.320 
while because I'm trying to get just the
larva<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.819> not<00:03:50.780> all<00:03:51.110> of<00:03:51.290> these<00:03:51.470> shed<00:03:51.860> skins<00:03:52.330> so

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
larva and not all of these shed skins so

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.240 
larva and not all of these shed skins so
trying<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:53.989> fight<00:03:54.200> figure<00:03:54.530> out<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.739> best<00:03:54.920> way

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
trying to fight figure out the best way

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.430 
trying to fight figure out the best way
to<00:03:55.280> do<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:56.050> still<00:03:57.050> working<00:03:57.380> on<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:59.080> well<00:04:00.080> so

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
to do that still working on that well so

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.850 
to do that still working on that well so
far<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:01.040> found<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:02.080> using<00:04:03.910> these<00:04:05.860> soft

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
far I found that using these soft

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.820 
far I found that using these soft
forceps<00:04:07.459> work<00:04:07.790> pretty<00:04:08.060> well<00:04:08.150> for

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
forceps work pretty well for

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.520 
forceps work pretty well for
transferring<00:04:09.830> them<00:04:10.160> from<00:04:10.670> here<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:12.200> their<00:04:12.349> new

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
transferring them from here to their new

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.319 
transferring them from here to their new
habitat<00:04:18.549> until<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:19.579> could<00:04:19.790> think<00:04:19.910> of<00:04:20.090> something

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
habitat until I could think of something

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:28.780 
habitat until I could think of something
else<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:23.270> this<00:04:23.479> is<00:04:23.660> pretty<00:04:23.930> cool<00:04:26.650> this<00:04:27.650> is<00:04:28.040> kind

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
else so this is pretty cool this is kind

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.540
