00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.770 

okay<00:00:01.800> so<00:00:02.070> i<00:00:02.310> made<00:00:02.490> this<00:00:02.610> video<00:00:02.760> showing<00:00:03.270> if<00:00:03.600> he

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
okay so i made this video showing if he

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.559 
okay so i made this video showing if he
could<00:00:03.959> chew<00:00:04.140> evolved<00:00:04.589> into<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:04.950> mu<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:06.420> just

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
could chew evolved into a mu and I just

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.419 
could chew evolved into a mu and I just
figured<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:06.899> would<00:00:07.109> make<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.319> video<00:00:07.560> showing

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
figured I would make a video showing

drum um you can probably do it with
pearl<00:00:41.530> two<00:00:41.769> I<00:00:42.160> don't<00:00:43.000> think<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:43.420> works<00:00:43.600> with

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
pearl two I don't think it works with

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
pearl two I don't think it works with
platinum<00:00:44.230> not<00:00:44.680> sure<00:00:44.920> haven't<00:00:45.309> tried<00:00:45.550> it<00:00:46.019> all

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
the program you need is the same all you

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:36.980 
the program you need is the same all you
run<00:01:16.009> it<00:01:18.070> was<00:01:19.070> here<00:01:19.640> poke<00:01:20.539> around<00:01:23.020> find

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
options are here is all the evolution

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.760 
options are here is all the evolution
options<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.619> video<00:01:47.920> i<00:01:48.280> will<00:01:49.710> use<00:01:50.710> he<00:01:51.130> do

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
options for this video i will use he do

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.260 
options for this video i will use he do
all<00:01:53.770> right<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.340> where<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.729> would<00:01:54.850> how<00:01:55.210> it

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
all right this is where it would how it

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.010 
all right this is where it would how it
would<00:01:55.390> regularly<00:01:55.810> level<00:01:56.289> up<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:57.600> i<00:01:58.600> would<00:01:58.869> go

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
would regularly level up and i would go

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.679 
would regularly level up and i would go
to<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.560> which<00:02:00.520> there<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.850> no<00:02:01.000> second<00:02:01.420> kind<00:02:01.600> of

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
to to which there is no second kind of

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.639 
to to which there is no second kind of
evolution<00:02:02.140> for<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:02.560> but<00:02:02.830> i<00:02:02.950> will<00:02:03.189> say<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:04.649> it

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
evolution for it but i will say that it

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:13.960 
evolution for it but i will say that it
involves<00:02:06.460> by<00:02:06.670> item<00:02:08.759> um

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.699 

ah<00:02:14.170> alright<00:02:17.920> let's<00:02:18.920> make<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.250> evolve<00:02:19.460> to

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
ah alright let's make it evolve to

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.520 
ah alright let's make it evolve to
art<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.980> why<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.569> then<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.349> would<00:02:25.499> click

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
art is why not and then you would click

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.160 
art is why not and then you would click
Save<00:02:27.139> and<00:02:28.139> then<00:02:29.209> you'd<00:02:30.209> put<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.510> rom<00:02:30.689> on<00:02:31.019> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
Save and then you'd put the rom on the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.500 
Save and then you'd put the rom on the
card<00:02:31.409> but<00:02:31.620> i<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.280> added<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.700> edit<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.329> rom

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
card but i just added to edit the rom

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.580 
card but i just added to edit the rom
directly<00:02:34.019> on<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.409> card<00:02:35.930> make<00:02:36.930> things<00:02:37.200> easier

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
directly on the card make things easier

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.000 
directly on the card make things easier
all<00:02:38.280> right<00:02:38.730> one<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.389> that<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.989> now<00:02:40.829> i<00:02:40.859> will

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
