00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
could bring some co2 into it actually in

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:32.860 
could bring some co2 into it actually in
this<00:00:23.400> case<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:23.850> nitrogen

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:01:06.550

so yeah we got these we got these

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.989 
so yeah we got these we got these
fermenter<00:01:10.890> caps<00:01:11.130> from<00:01:11.280> Brewers<00:01:11.609> hardware

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 
fermenter caps from Brewers hardware

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.510 
fermenter caps from Brewers hardware
trying<00:01:12.840> them<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:13.049> wait<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.859> get<00:01:13.950> your<00:01:14.100> clamps

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
trying them out wait to get your clamps

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240 
trying them out wait to get your clamps
though<00:01:14.640> these<00:01:14.819> ones<00:01:15.030> were<00:01:15.179> not<00:01:16.130> working<00:01:17.130> on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250

we were just testing got the one kid
actually<00:01:32.039> from<00:01:32.189> kneeled<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:32.789> at<00:01:32.969> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
actually from kneeled down at the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.380 
actually from kneeled down at the
vineyard<00:01:33.240> that's<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.289> good<00:01:34.439> price<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.950> so

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
vineyard that's a good price on it so

thanks<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.420> him<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:40.140> needed<00:01:40.319> a<00:01:40.969> nitrogen

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
thanks to him and we needed a nitrogen

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.859 
thanks to him and we needed a nitrogen
tank<00:01:42.209> actually<00:01:42.629> for<00:01:43.170> pushing<00:01:43.619> any<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
tank actually for pushing any of the

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.669 
tank actually for pushing any of the
beer<00:01:45.869> wine<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:46.560> we're<00:01:46.739> making<00:01:47.489> here

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
beer wine that we're making here

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.660 
beer wine that we're making here
hopefully<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.799> keep<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.129> from<00:01:50.280> getting

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
hopefully to keep it from getting

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.869 
hopefully to keep it from getting
oxidized<00:01:51.179> as<00:01:51.360> much<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.659> possible<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.879> keeps

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:53.879 
oxidized as much as possible but keeps

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:58.179 
oxidized as much as possible but keeps
it<00:01:55.369> keeps<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> whole<00:01:56.700> lot<00:01:56.729> more<00:01:57.000> sanitary

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
it keeps it a whole lot more sanitary

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.999 
it keeps it a whole lot more sanitary
we're<00:01:59.189> running<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.670> kind<00:01:59.879> of<00:02:00.000> setup<00:02:01.009> don't

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
we're running this kind of setup don't

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.109 
we're running this kind of setup don't
have<00:02:02.099> to<00:02:02.189> worry<00:02:02.340> about<00:02:02.369> bugs<00:02:02.700> getting<00:02:03.000> in

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
have to worry about bugs getting in

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.819 
have to worry about bugs getting in
there<00:02:03.299> screwed<00:02:04.140> around<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.409> tattoos<00:02:04.799> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
there screwed around with tattoos and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.690 
there screwed around with tattoos and
siphons<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.549> crap<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.819> that<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:07.519> do<00:02:08.519> some

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
siphons and crap like that so do some

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.069 
siphons and crap like that so do some
more<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.119> stuff<00:02:09.329> make<00:02:09.780> some<00:02:09.929> more<00:02:10.019> videos

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
more on this stuff make some more videos

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.530 
more on this stuff make some more videos
once<00:02:10.920> you're<00:02:11.039> kind<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:11.220> gonna<00:02:11.370> figure<00:02:12.329> it<00:02:12.420> out

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
once you're kind of gonna figure it out

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.580 
once you're kind of gonna figure it out
and<00:02:12.690> tuned<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:13.049> properly<00:02:14.870> but<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
and tuned up properly but you get the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.140 
and tuned up properly but you get the
general<00:02:17.040> idea

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.520 

you're<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.299> pushing<00:02:24.569> another<00:02:24.989> batch<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.230> one

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
you're just pushing another batch of one

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.220 
you're just pushing another batch of one
here<00:02:26.690> got<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> choke<00:02:27.989> video

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.559 

just<00:02:33.920> another<00:02:34.129> couple<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:34.519> Clips<00:02:34.790> here<00:02:35.060> this

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
just another couple of Clips here this

00:02:35.569 --> 00:03:12.760 
just another couple of Clips here this
is<00:02:35.720> just<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.989> red<00:02:36.170> wine<00:02:36.349> with<00:02:36.530> push<00:02:36.680> on

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.960 

so<00:03:13.770> as<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.100> see<00:03:14.160> these<00:03:14.550> four<00:03:14.610> men<00:03:14.850> are

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
so as you can see these four men are

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.150 
so as you can see these four men are
kids
