00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:23.090
 What 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.090
 I think love could train me not 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.440
 Fall I'm crying, I'm not leaving. 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.740
 I need a place to camp 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:43.790
 You have to have another way to get by 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.400
 Please, it was just the moment of your time. 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.330
 Excuse me if I was not clear if the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.660
 confuses me with my words was not 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.220
 my intention to deceive you so try 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.840
 clarify 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.840
 fall out of my property 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:29.180
 I'm going up, you can listen, you're afraid. 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.590
 what the fear 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.410
 I think I 'm afraid of something. 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:40.190
 even over a convinced sergeant 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:43.970
 as possible to maybe you dream to be 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.959
 A hero taking part in rescues save the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:52.060
 world but if you continue on this path 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.060
 end up just dead 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.230
 the world changed the night 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.230
 you should be fine 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:15.909
 I 'm not going to leave, you heard me. 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.909
 I'm not leaving, just wait, my old man. 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.520
 I will not be defeated easily 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.280
 it's all 40's going to be easy because you 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.680
 I said it again and ended up with a 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.979
 dead horse and a black eye who are 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.979
 you 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.560
 it's nothing your thing had better 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:08.180
 fall off before something bad happens 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.180
 Do not say we did not warn you. 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.120
 Hey colleagues, shop your holy league pair. 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.000
 the size of the letter 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:47.400
 would have run away from the tax office will stay 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.400
 making matters worse in place 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:07.610
 what is here what it is 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.610
 ask the boss 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:20.560
 working for the old man 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:20.560
 this is maybe so you talk then 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:32.539
 the free brigade 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.199
 I think we should talk later.
