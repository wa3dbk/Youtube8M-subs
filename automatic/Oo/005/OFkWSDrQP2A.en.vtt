both bills if you're using a half sheet
of<00:00:23.880> square<00:00:24.150> origami<00:00:24.510> paper<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.560> much<00:00:25.740> easier

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
of square origami paper it's much easier

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.990 
of square origami paper it's much easier
to<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.370> fold<00:00:26.790> the<00:00:26.910> sheet<00:00:27.120> in<00:00:27.150> half<00:00:28.730> now<00:00:29.730> take

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
to just fold the sheet in half now take

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.430 
to just fold the sheet in half now take
one<00:00:30.180> of<00:00:30.270> the<00:00:30.330> corners<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.870> the<00:00:30.960> sheet<00:00:31.200> and<00:00:31.380> fold

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.440 
one of the corners of the sheet and fold

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.540 
one of the corners of the sheet and fold
it<00:00:31.950> up<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:33.649> we're<00:00:34.649> gonna<00:00:34.739> take<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.129> corner<00:00:35.460> at

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
it up and we're gonna take the corner at

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.189 
it up and we're gonna take the corner at
the<00:00:35.670> opposite<00:00:36.030> end<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.359> sheet<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.780> fold

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.239 
the opposite end of the sheet and fold
it<00:00:37.410> down<00:00:39.469> now<00:00:40.469> we'll<00:00:40.679> need<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.949> make<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249 
it down now we'll need to make the

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.700 
it down now we'll need to make the
second<00:00:41.609> piece<00:00:41.789> but<00:00:42.510> fold<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> corners<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
second piece but fold the corners up and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.739 
second piece but fold the corners up and
down<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> first<00:00:44.879> piece<00:00:45.210> put<00:00:45.600> in

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
down just like the first piece put in

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:50.090 
down just like the first piece put in
opposite<00:00:46.260> directions<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.530> second<00:00:49.920> piece<00:00:50.069> is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
opposite directions the second piece is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
opposite directions the second piece is
not<00:00:50.460> symmetrical<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.359> the<00:00:51.390> first<00:00:51.719> it's

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
not symmetrical to the first it's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.800 
not symmetrical to the first it's
actually<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.589> mirror<00:00:52.859> image

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.600 

now<00:00:58.810> take<00:00:59.110> this<00:00:59.290> corner<00:00:59.590> and<00:00:59.890> fold<00:00:59.950> it<00:01:00.310> up<00:01:00.460> and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
now take this corner and fold it up and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.180 
now take this corner and fold it up and
end<00:01:00.850> towards<00:01:01.240> the<00:01:01.330> middle<00:01:01.650> flip<00:01:02.650> it<00:01:02.770> over<00:01:02.890> and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
end towards the middle flip it over and

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.540 
end towards the middle flip it over and
make<00:01:03.340> sure<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.700> these<00:01:03.910> edges<00:01:04.420> line<00:01:04.720> up<00:01:08.550> now

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
make sure that these edges line up now

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.460 
make sure that these edges line up now
take<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.970> other<00:01:10.120> corner<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.780> fold<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.230> down

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
take the other corner and fold it down

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.100 
take the other corner and fold it down
and<00:01:11.500> end<00:01:11.980> towards<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.490> middle<00:01:12.900> you'll<00:01:13.900> need

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
and end towards the middle you'll need

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.870 
and end towards the middle you'll need
to<00:01:14.229> repeat<00:01:14.500> this<00:01:14.740> process<00:01:15.010> on<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.550> other

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
to repeat this process on the other

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.900 
to repeat this process on the other
piece<00:01:16.380> take<00:01:17.380> note<00:01:17.620> that<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.220> side<00:01:18.490> with<00:01:18.790> the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
piece take note that the side with the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.150 
piece take note that the side with the
corner<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.420> was<00:01:19.540> folded<00:01:19.960> up<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.380> now<00:01:20.950> going

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
corner that was folded up is now going

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:37.010 
corner that was folded up is now going
to<00:01:21.220> be<00:01:21.310> folded<00:01:21.729> down<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.300> vice<00:01:22.810> versa

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.240 

when<00:01:38.020> you've<00:01:38.170> done<00:01:38.380> this<00:01:38.530> correctly<00:01:38.740> you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
when you've done this correctly you

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.029 
when you've done this correctly you
should<00:01:39.579> have<00:01:39.759> two<00:01:40.000> mirror<00:01:40.299> images

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
should have two mirror images

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.929 
should have two mirror images
now<00:01:42.039> take<00:01:42.280> one<00:01:42.520> piece<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.819> flip<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.359> over<00:01:44.939> take

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
now take one piece and flip it over take

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.730 
now take one piece and flip it over take
the<00:01:45.969> piece<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.569> didn't<00:01:46.929> flip<00:01:47.110> over<00:01:47.229> then

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
the piece that you didn't flip over then

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.889 
the piece that you didn't flip over then
place<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.159> on<00:01:48.250> top<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.819> other<00:01:48.969> piece<00:01:51.899> take

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
place it on top of the other piece take

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.330 
place it on top of the other piece take
one<00:01:53.079> of<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.259> points<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:53.799> bottom<00:01:54.100> piece

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
one of the points of the bottom piece

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.749 
one of the points of the bottom piece
and<00:01:54.369> fold<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:55.000> in<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.420> form<00:01:55.659> a<00:01:55.750> triangle<00:01:56.759> take

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
and fold it in to form a triangle take

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.699 
and fold it in to form a triangle take
the<00:01:57.909> point<00:01:58.179> and<00:01:58.359> tuck<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.810> under<00:01:59.109> the<00:01:59.229> flap<00:01:59.469> of

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
the point and tuck it under the flap of

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.639 
the point and tuck it under the flap of
this<00:01:59.859> piece<00:02:00.100> on<00:02:00.310> top<00:02:03.929> take<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:04.959> other<00:02:05.259> point
