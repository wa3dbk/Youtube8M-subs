Steve Mandanda Mandanda probably should

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.840

obviously<00:01:15.030> yeah<00:01:15.930> there's<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.380> good<00:01:16.470> goal<00:01:16.759> but

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
obviously yeah there's a good goal but

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.670 
obviously yeah there's a good goal but
nice<00:01:18.000> bit<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> skill<00:01:18.930> moves<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:19.290> from<00:01:19.470> nima

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
nice bit of skill moves there from nima

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.520 
nice bit of skill moves there from nima
I<00:01:19.979> think<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.960> maguey<00:01:21.960> d<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
I think that's the maguey d or the but I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.570 
I think that's the maguey d or the but I
think<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> berber<00:01:23.130> spin<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
think that's the berber spin and the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
think that's the berber spin and the
maguey<00:01:23.850> d<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> five<00:01:24.420> style<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
maguey d is the five style one and the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.140 
maguey d is the five style one and the
berber<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> force<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.640> once<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.060> was

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
berber is the force that once I was

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.340 
berber is the force that once I was
quite<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> nice<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.720> skill<00:01:27.960> moves<00:01:28.170> they're

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
quite a nice bit of skill moves they're

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
quite a nice bit of skill moves they're
beating<00:01:29.009> cashell<00:01:29.369> me<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> he's<00:01:29.820> able<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
beating cashell me and he's able to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.999 
beating cashell me and he's able to
score<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.380> nil<00:01:31.590> but

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
score there to make it to nil but

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.530 
score there to make it to nil but
unfortunately<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> rebound<00:01:33.060> goal<00:01:33.299> comes

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
unfortunately the rebound goal comes

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.200 
unfortunately the rebound goal comes
back<00:01:33.780> 49<00:01:34.439> minutes<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.820> kicked

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.270 
him ago and he's now in this series and
then<00:03:12.600> we<00:03:12.690> go<00:03:12.810> for<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.140> right<00:03:13.680> back<00:03:13.860> by<00:03:14.040> of

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
then we go for a right back by of

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.460 
then we go for a right back by of
rafinha<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.880> think<00:03:15.120> his<00:03:15.240> name<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.720> bottom

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
rafinha I think his name is and bottom

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.620 
rafinha I think his name is and bottom
for<00:03:16.650> 450<00:03:17.459> coins<00:03:17.640> had<00:03:17.850> like<00:03:18.030> six<00:03:18.300> hundred<00:03:18.600> and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
for 450 coins had like six hundred and

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.600 
for 450 coins had like six hundred and
eighty<00:03:18.840> coins<00:03:19.140> left<00:03:19.320> over<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.160> thought<00:03:20.370> why

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
eighty coins left over so I thought why

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.310 
eighty coins left over so I thought why
not<00:03:20.640> get<00:03:20.910> another<00:03:21.150> silver<00:03:21.420> player<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.930> sort<00:03:22.170> of

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
not get another silver player to sort of

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.380 
not get another silver player to sort of
them<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:23.100> know<00:03:23.190> make<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.730> team<00:03:24.060> look<00:03:24.269> a

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
them you know make the team look a

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.910 
them you know make the team look a
little<00:03:24.570> bit<00:03:24.780> better<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.380> course<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.650> guy

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
little bit better and of course that guy

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.290 
little bit better and of course that guy
was<00:03:26.070> out<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.220> contracts<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.880> we've<00:03:27.000> replaced

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
was out of contracts that we've replaced

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.840 
was out of contracts that we've replaced
so<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.050> all<00:03:28.230> it's<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.739> bit<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.100> win-win<00:03:29.550> and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
so it's all it's a bit of a win-win and

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.300 
so it's all it's a bit of a win-win and
a<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.209> know<00:03:30.330> it's<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.080> good<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:32.010> was<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.190> good

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
a you know it's a good it was a good

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.820 
a you know it's a good it was a good
time<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.760> change<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.330> right<00:03:33.480> back<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.019> into
