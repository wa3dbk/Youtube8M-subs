agricultural system this particular site

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.560 
agricultural system this particular site
is<00:00:55.289> often<00:00:55.739> windy<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.519> right<00:00:56.699> now<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.390> so

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
is often windy as it is right now and so

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
is often windy as it is right now and so
we're<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.019> modify<00:00:58.410> our<00:00:58.530> spray<00:00:59.100> system

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
we're going to modify our spray system

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.349 
we're going to modify our spray system
with<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.600> drop<00:01:00.960> nozzle<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.399> XP<00:01:03.030> boom

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
with a down drop nozzle it's a XP boom

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.340 
with a down drop nozzle it's a XP boom
jet<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:05.040> throws<00:01:05.430> about<00:01:05.790> two<00:01:06.060> meters<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.630> wide

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
jet that throws about two meters a wide

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.609 
jet that throws about two meters a wide
swath<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.670> having<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.210> lower<00:01:09.479> will<00:01:10.080> reduce

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
swath and so having it lower will reduce

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.399 
swath and so having it lower will reduce
the<00:01:10.890> drift<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.570> most<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> chemical

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the drift and get most of the chemical

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.800 
the drift and get most of the chemical
on<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> site<00:01:14.610> we're<00:01:15.180> also<00:01:15.299> using<00:01:15.600> a

on the on the site we're also using a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.590 
on the on the site we're also using a
compressed<00:01:16.259> air<00:01:16.470> system<00:01:16.520> with<00:01:17.600> individual

compressed air system with individual
treatments<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.070> three<00:01:20.310> treatments

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759

for<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:20.970> experiment<00:01:21.600> first<00:01:22.079> we're<00:01:22.229> gonna

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
for this experiment first we're gonna

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.109 
for this experiment first we're gonna
look<00:01:22.470> at<00:01:22.650> two<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.070> D<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> very<00:01:23.610> common
