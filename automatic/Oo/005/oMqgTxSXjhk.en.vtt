00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.560
 he deserves it and I hope that also those 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.990
 people come to you because I 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.759
 or videos of all many times of games 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.930
 of pokÃ©mon things that are copyright 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.340
 that I do not care at all not 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.259
 monetize the ones because I like to 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.659
 you like it and this has been like a 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.220
 a prize a take I do not know I do not have 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.899
 words to apply this because as 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.630
 I say when I received the package when 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.610
 what video fuck a bubble in the mario 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.610
 kart and the super smash bros 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.740
 incredible that enzyme in front of my 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.600
 parents opening the city in plan as 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.800
 when I was a little girl even more 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.530
 little one than another and they were there 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.210
 they helped me open it, it was good 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.900
 gift of the wise men not in 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.870
 this case a gift from nintendo and not 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.179
 I know again I reiterate that very 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.860
 happy I tried the console not what 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.450
 had been able to get to try before some 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.730
 couple of times in the mall and 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.970
 incredible that the command really is 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.200
 great good is great that a little more and 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.840
 bigger than me you know that I do 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.900
 also the pocket but it is super comfortable 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.250
 it does not bother me the hand is light and 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.430
 Little games that I play already 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.560
 Mario Kart and the NBA that I bought 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 incredible really I just say perfect 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.620
 for the moment what I could get to 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.680
 try to love me 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.239
 and I'm seeing it in the video that I 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.700
 I do not have words either to be 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.799
 here because I'm so happy that 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.860
 nintendo will also be fixed in 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.480
 other people for example not only 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.400
 on youtube that has a lot of 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.379
 subscribers that are pointers but the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.940
 that they really want their 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.620
 products that prove them that 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.450
 they enjoy that they say good things and 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.579
 also the negative things because that 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.739
 to some extent it's not bad I always 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.870
 I bring out pros and cons of everything and then I say 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.159
 because this interests me or this does not or this 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.920
 I'm interested in this because of this 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.209
 because there is almost nothing perfect I 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.220
 I believe that perfection is in the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.000
 imperfection look at you what phrase more 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.280
 Strange I just left but it's great 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.629
 because I love it is a console and I 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.400
 I consider to play mostly with the 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.340
 family with the wii you can not imagine 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.060
 the laughs that existed in my house 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.310
 plays said to the games something and 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.640
 part and I think it was called they look good 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.569
 and play if anything else is amazing so 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.159
 I put I do not know I wish I could do 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.590
 something to thank all of you 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.770
 that to a certain extent greatly 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.440
 and the causes of all this 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.840
 I would unfortunately love the money 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.580
 he does not give me to give them all 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.440
 the most I can do what I 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.390
 I would love to do would be to play with everyone 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.980
 you mean give the codes friends 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.900
 try to play the odd game 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.700
 being sincere is not going to be of 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.860
 moment I could not even enjoy it yet 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.900
 of the super smash bros because it makes me 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.629
 lack internet to download it and up 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.819
 February I do not have internet so I 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.440
 I looked like an idiot directly 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.630
 OK 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.130
 because come on I should have 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.430
 internet from my house but how is that 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.350
 another bizarre roll and did not not what 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.630
 I was not going to enter now I said 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.890
 I have also the captured captor 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.240
 already to use it from time 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.490
 immemorial because I had not yet 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.980
 come to use so I will record the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.120
 games that I play with you 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.740
 commenting on the game if you know like that in 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.720
 plan not only racing in plan 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.170
 Mario Kart or fight like the super 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.700
 smash bros but another one that better kill 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.410
 I do not know to speak or something I do not know 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.930
 has used is that in that sense I could 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.610
 use the resistant but I'm very good 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.870
 I think that I notice this must be 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.150
 one of the videos I'm in 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.130
 talking non-stop, not good, it shows 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.980
 when I'm excited because I'm very 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.190
 excited and you will see some other 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.370
 playing video eye that you know what 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.500
 has sent nintendo is not what I would do and 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.740
 is what I do when something happens like this 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.010
 I think that less than to thank him and 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.010
 others because 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:17.300
 what am I doing this video days 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.480
 afterwards and still is that is that I play 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.160
 when I saw the box I say god is 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.180
 amazing 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.770
 thank you very much and as he said 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.770
 of friends comes quite well because 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.840
 it's something new something I think what 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.460
 practical what I like also sometimes 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.740
 are the things that move away a little from 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.060
 the everyday not because other things 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.640
 then find somewhere else but 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.050
 something specific something like that and it's not 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.120
 pretty good I have and the figurines there 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.470
 of ornament used them from time to time 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.850
 I have not been able to use them at all 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.830
 because of course I have pistachio 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.770
 example and I want to use the super 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.050
 smash bros I want internet and I hope that 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.690
 it's going to be a lot in putting it that has 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.550
 another early Christmas gift and the 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.170
 Internet company will give you to come and 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.610

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.790
 because it's a problem I internet 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.960
 I should have it but what there is not 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.960
