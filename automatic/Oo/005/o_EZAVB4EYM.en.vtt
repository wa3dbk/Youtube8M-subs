steady<00:01:47.960> here<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.410> consume<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> camera

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
steady here we can consume the camera

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.060 
steady here we can consume the camera
with<00:01:50.550> them<00:01:51.170> all<00:01:52.170> right<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.830> camera

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
with them all right so you the camera

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.040 
with them all right so you the camera
goes<00:01:53.190> up<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.490> down<00:01:53.580> yes<00:01:54.030> okay<00:01:54.450> remember<00:01:54.929> this

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
goes up and down yes okay remember this

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.070 
goes up and down yes okay remember this
is<00:01:55.259> not<00:01:55.640> rascally<00:01:56.640> 5<00:01:56.850> 10<00:01:57.090> verse<00:01:57.240> 2<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
is not rascally 5 10 verse 2 so the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.630 
is not rascally 5 10 verse 2 so the
quality<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.530> not<00:01:58.679> so<00:01:58.890> good<00:01:59.039> as<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.550> you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
quality is not so good as the one you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
quality is not so good as the one you
move<00:01:59.820> alright<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.350> final<00:02:01.530> version<00:02:01.770> will

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
move alright so the final version will

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.760 
move alright so the final version will
be<00:02:02.130> even<00:02:02.280> better<00:02:02.520> than<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.710> think

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
be even better than this I don't think

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.020 
be even better than this I don't think
this<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.070> good

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
these tiny applications we start to see

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.560 
these tiny applications we start to see
there<00:03:14.800> are<00:03:14.920> some<00:03:15.220> vertical<00:03:15.850> markets<00:03:16.390> that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
there are some vertical markets that

out they could use these for their

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.930 
out they could use these for their
activities<00:03:42.490> are<00:03:42.670> not<00:03:42.820> just<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.300> play<00:03:43.540> right<00:03:44.940> so
