with nine pieces of wheat and previously

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.810 
with nine pieces of wheat and previously
you<00:00:31.050> weren't<00:00:31.289> able<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.590> drop<00:00:31.890> them<00:00:32.130> into<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
you weren't able to drop them into a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
you weren't able to drop them into a
crafting<00:00:33.300> table<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.780> get<00:00:33.960> those<00:00:34.079> nine<00:00:34.350> pieces

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
crafting table and get those nine pieces

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950 
crafting table and get those nine pieces
of<00:00:34.829> wheat<00:00:35.130> back<00:00:35.370> which<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
of wheat back which you can see here you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.420 
of wheat back which you can see here you
can<00:00:36.989> now<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> great<00:00:38.219> way<00:00:38.399> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
can now do so this is a great way of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.840 
can now do so this is a great way of
storing<00:00:38.940> lots<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.300> wheat<00:00:40.309> this<00:00:41.309> second<00:00:41.670> bug

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
storing lots of wheat this second bug

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.090 
storing lots of wheat this second bug
fix<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.930> important<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> do

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
fix is a really important one is to do

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040 
fix is a really important one is to do
animals<00:00:44.579> being<00:00:44.789> contained<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> small<00:00:45.780> space

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
animals being contained in a small space

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
animals being contained in a small space
like<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.280> animals<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.850> push<00:00:48.030> each

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
like this now the animals can push each

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
like this now the animals can push each
other<00:00:48.420> around<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.200> known<00:00:49.379> thing<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
other around that's a known thing and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
other around that's a known thing and
they<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.100> push<00:00:50.280> each<00:00:50.430> other<00:00:50.670> into<00:00:51.090> blocks

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
they can push each other into blocks

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.029 
they can push each other into blocks
which<00:00:51.660> isn't<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.079> problem<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:52.829> don't

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
which isn't a problem because they don't

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.160 
which isn't a problem because they don't
actually<00:00:53.190> take<00:00:53.640> damage<00:00:53.910> however<00:00:54.840> when<00:00:55.079> you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
actually take damage however when you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
actually take damage however when you
log<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.770> world<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.460> log<00:00:56.670> off<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
log out of the world or you log off a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
log out of the world or you log off a
server<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.320> log<00:00:58.500> back<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.890> when<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
server and then you log back in when the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
server and then you log back in when the
chunks<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.699> loading<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.270> an<00:01:00.359> animal<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
chunks are loading and an animal is

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
chunks are loading and an animal is
glitched<00:01:01.230> inside<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> block<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.430> actually

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
glitched inside a block it can actually

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.850 
glitched inside a block it can actually
take<00:01:02.969> damage<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.140> has<00:01:04.229> been<00:01:04.350> corrected

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
take damage so that has been corrected

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.700 
take damage so that has been corrected
in<00:01:05.070> 1.6.2<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.360> can't<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.170> give<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.530> good

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
in 1.6.2 I can't really give you a good

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.260 
in 1.6.2 I can't really give you a good
demonstration<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.580> cause<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.060> hard

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
demonstration of that cause it's a hard

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
demonstration of that cause it's a hard
thing<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> try<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.810> capture<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.040> has<00:01:11.159> been

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
thing to try and capture but it has been

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.890 
thing to try and capture but it has been
fixed<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.210> animals<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
fixed so now your animals are going to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
fixed so now your animals are going to
be<00:01:12.990> safe<00:01:13.260> when<00:01:13.560> they're<00:01:13.680> kept<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.130> pens<00:01:14.700> like

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
be safe when they're kept in pens like

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.010 
be safe when they're kept in pens like
this<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.970> there<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.180> good<00:01:18.450> example<00:01:18.600> right

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
this and there is a good example right

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320 
this and there is a good example right
there<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.470> thought<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.799> would<00:01:20.040> record<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
there I thought I would record as I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
there I thought I would record as I
logged<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.960> show<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.439> animals<00:01:22.830> taking

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
logged in to show you the animals taking

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.920 
logged in to show you the animals taking
damage<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.090> downgraded<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> one

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
damage because I have downgraded to one

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.050 
damage because I have downgraded to one
point<00:01:25.049> six<00:01:25.229> point<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.340> order<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> show<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
point six point one in order to show you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.460 
point six point one in order to show you
all<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> other<00:01:27.689> bugs<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.320> been

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
all of the other bugs that have been

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.830 
all of the other bugs that have been
fixed<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.729> first<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.689> if

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
fixed so the first one is to do if

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.679 
fixed so the first one is to do if
horses<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.770> right-click<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:33.390> an

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
horses if you right-click on a on an

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.240 
horses if you right-click on a on an
adult<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.259> spawn<00:01:34.740> egg<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
adult with a spawn egg you will get a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.940 
adult with a spawn egg you will get a
baby<00:01:35.460> animal<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> example<00:01:37.740> that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
baby animal and that is the example that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.260 
baby animal and that is the example that
I<00:01:38.100> wanted<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> show<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.180> actually

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
I wanted to show you you can actually

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
I wanted to show you you can actually
nudge<00:01:39.780> these<00:01:40.049> animals<00:01:40.500> into<00:01:40.740> blocks<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
nudge these animals into blocks and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.609 
nudge these animals into blocks and
that's<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> horses<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.409> merge

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
that's just the horses so if I merge

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.270 
that's just the horses so if I merge
this<00:01:43.829> guy

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
this guy

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
this guy
you'll<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.850> nudged<00:01:45.090> into<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.630> blocks<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you'll get nudged into the blocks and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
you'll get nudged into the blocks and
will<00:01:46.320> start<00:01:46.619> taking<00:01:46.799> damage<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.790> has

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
will start taking damage so that has

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.020 
will start taking damage so that has
been<00:01:48.180> fixed<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.720> 1.6.2<00:01:49.680> another<00:01:50.610> bug<00:01:50.850> with

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
been fixed in 1.6.2 another bug with

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.210 
been fixed in 1.6.2 another bug with
these<00:01:51.149> horses<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.409> Armour<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.130> if

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
these horses is to do with Armour so if

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.980 
these horses is to do with Armour so if
I<00:01:53.340> pick<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.700> both<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.060> these<00:01:54.119> pieces<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.659> armor

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
I pick up both of these pieces of armor

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.399 
I pick up both of these pieces of armor
and<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:56.310> need<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> shift<00:01:57.180> click<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> open<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and I need to shift click to open the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.980 
and I need to shift click to open the
horses<00:01:58.710> inventory<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.780> that

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
horses inventory and you can see that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
horses inventory and you can see that
like<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.439> normal<00:02:01.829> army<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.189> can't<00:02:02.430> click

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
like with normal army you can't click

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.969 
like with normal army you can't click
directly<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.990> swap<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.829> do

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
directly on it to swap it you have to do

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.660 
directly on it to swap it you have to do
this<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.180> has<00:02:06.360> been<00:02:06.390> changed<00:02:06.810> in

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
this and so this has been changed in

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.380 
this and so this has been changed in
1.6.2<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.830> another<00:02:11.099> important<00:02:11.670> bug<00:02:11.849> fix<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
1.6.2 so another important bug fix is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.700 
1.6.2 so another important bug fix is
with<00:02:12.629> donkeys<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.349> mule

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
with donkeys and mule

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.470 
with donkeys and mule
they<00:02:13.920> can<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.220> chests<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> back<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.360> you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
they can have chests on the back and you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.720 
they can have chests on the back and you
can<00:02:15.510> put<00:02:15.660> items<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.320> those<00:02:16.500> chests<00:02:17.010> now<00:02:17.550> when

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
can put items in those chests now when

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.280 
can put items in those chests now when
you're<00:02:17.850> riding<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.300> one<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.480> these<00:02:18.630> horses<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
you're riding on one of these horses and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.080 
you're riding on one of these horses and
you<00:02:19.410> log<00:02:19.620> out<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.980> then<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.580> log<00:02:20.730> back<00:02:20.760> in

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
you log out and then you log back in

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.640 
you log out and then you log back in
again<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.630> duplicate<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> mule<00:02:22.500> and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
again you can duplicate the mule and

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.470 
again you can duplicate the mule and
that's<00:02:23.190> if<00:02:23.370> you're<00:02:23.490> on<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> server<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.390> has

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that's if you're on a server so that has

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.330 
that's if you're on a server so that has
now<00:02:24.630> been<00:02:24.840> fixed<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.290> can't<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.740> anymore

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
now been fixed you can't do that anymore

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.490 
now been fixed you can't do that anymore
then<00:02:27.060> over<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.390> another<00:02:27.750> strange<00:02:28.110> bug<00:02:28.350> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
then over here another strange bug that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.530 
then over here another strange bug that
we<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.130> break<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:30.090> front<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.480> a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
we have if you break the front of a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.200 
we have if you break the front of a
piston<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.590> will<00:02:31.740> drop<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.250> piston

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
piston like this it will drop the piston

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.910 
piston like this it will drop the piston
block<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.990> break<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.350> back<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.800> it

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
block and if you break the back of it it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.300 
block and if you break the back of it it
won't

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
won't

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.060 
won't
so<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.700> 1.6.2<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.930> doesn't<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.380> anymore

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
so in 1.6.2 it doesn't do that anymore

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.070 
so in 1.6.2 it doesn't do that anymore
then<00:02:38.700> over<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.000> we<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> sign<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:39.900> some

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
then over here we have a sign with some

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.810 
then over here we have a sign with some
flowing<00:02:40.380> water<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.130> another<00:02:41.430> strange

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
flowing water this is another strange

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.980 
flowing water this is another strange
bug<00:02:42.060> that's<00:02:42.210> been<00:02:42.450> fixed

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
bug that's been fixed

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.320 
bug that's been fixed
you<00:02:43.530> can<00:02:43.710> place<00:02:43.920> down<00:02:44.190> signs<00:02:44.550> like<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.090> in

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
you can place down signs like this in

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.630 
you can place down signs like this in
the<00:02:45.480> water<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.050> keeps<00:02:46.290> flowing<00:02:46.530> which<00:02:47.460> is

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the water and it keeps flowing which is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.980 
the water and it keeps flowing which is
really<00:02:47.940> strange<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.390> can<00:02:48.570> see<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:48.960> that

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
really strange you can see there that

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.730 
really strange you can see there that
shouldn't<00:02:49.350> be<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.250> at<00:02:50.550> all<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.740> then

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
shouldn't be like that at all so then

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.500 
shouldn't be like that at all so then
over<00:02:52.890> here<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.490> couple<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.940> chests<00:02:54.390> on

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
over here we have a couple of chests on

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.780 
over here we have a couple of chests on
the<00:02:54.690> wall<00:02:54.900> they<00:02:55.770> look<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.250> same<00:02:56.430> chest

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the wall they look like the same chest

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.550 
the wall they look like the same chest
but<00:02:57.000> actually<00:02:57.300> one<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.570> them<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> trap<00:02:58.200> chest

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
but actually one of them is a trap chest

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.830 
but actually one of them is a trap chest
and<00:02:59.190> one<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.490> them<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> regular<00:03:00.240> chest<00:03:00.540> so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
and one of them is a regular chest so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.030 
and one of them is a regular chest so
there's<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.080> small<00:03:01.230> bug<00:03:01.560> here<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.920> it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
there's a small bug here that it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.800 
there's a small bug here that it
displays<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.460> chest<00:03:02.940> when<00:03:03.570> there<00:03:03.720> is

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
displays the chest when there is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.630 
displays the chest when there is
actually<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> trap<00:03:04.500> chest<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:05.010> an<00:03:05.130> item<00:03:05.400> frame

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
actually a trap chest in an item frame

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.850 
actually a trap chest in an item frame
so<00:03:05.820> that's<00:03:05.970> been<00:03:06.150> changed<00:03:06.510> as<00:03:06.690> well<00:03:06.900> another

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
so that's been changed as well another

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.740 
so that's been changed as well another
bug<00:03:08.130> fix<00:03:08.370> over<00:03:08.700> here<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.120> do<00:03:09.270> with<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.510> lead

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
bug fix over here is to do with the lead

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.870 
bug fix over here is to do with the lead
and<00:03:09.930> how<00:03:10.050> it's<00:03:10.230> displayed<00:03:10.500> if<00:03:11.250> we<00:03:11.550> don't<00:03:11.730> look

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
and how it's displayed if we don't look

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.400 
and how it's displayed if we don't look
at<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> chicken<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:12.720> we<00:03:12.840> won't<00:03:13.050> see<00:03:13.230> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
at the chicken then we won't see the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.840 
at the chicken then we won't see the
lead<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.830> when<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:13.980> look<00:03:14.190> over<00:03:14.340> here<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.730> no

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
lead so when I look over here you no

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.850 
lead so when I look over here you no
longer<00:03:15.150> see<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.360> lead<00:03:15.660> attached<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.740> the

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
longer see the lead attached to the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.130 
longer see the lead attached to the
fence<00:03:17.100> post<00:03:17.400> until<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.420> chicken<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.050> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
fence post until the chicken is on the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.430 
fence post until the chicken is on the
screen<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.530> course<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:21.330> next<00:03:21.660> bug<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.260> do

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
screen of course this next bug is to do

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.710 
screen of course this next bug is to do
with<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.740> absorb<00:03:23.160> effects<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:23.880> if<00:03:24.060> we<00:03:24.210> go<00:03:24.420> into

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
with the absorb effects so if we go into

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.900 
with the absorb effects so if we go into
survival<00:03:25.230> mode<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.770> then<00:03:26.400> we<00:03:26.550> give<00:03:26.760> ourselves

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
survival mode and then we give ourselves

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.600 
survival mode and then we give ourselves
the<00:03:27.570> absorb<00:03:28.380> effect<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:28.980> can<00:03:29.100> see<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.490> we

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
the absorb effect you can see that we

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.340 
the absorb effect you can see that we
have<00:03:29.820> six<00:03:30.240> extra<00:03:30.420> hearts<00:03:30.900> there<00:03:31.080> because<00:03:31.230> we

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
have six extra hearts there because we

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.860 
have six extra hearts there because we
have<00:03:31.470> absorbed<00:03:31.980> level<00:03:32.220> three<00:03:32.490> and<00:03:32.730> if<00:03:33.570> we<00:03:33.720> walk

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
have absorbed level three and if we walk

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.720 
have absorbed level three and if we walk
into<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:34.200> cactus<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.950> remove<00:03:35.280> all<00:03:35.460> of<00:03:35.610> those

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
into this cactus and remove all of those

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.550 
into this cactus and remove all of those
we're<00:03:36.360> actually<00:03:36.450> going<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.900> get<00:03:37.020> those<00:03:37.260> back

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
we're actually going to get those back

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.380 
we're actually going to get those back
in<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:38.160> moment<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:41.580> when<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:41.880> goes<00:03:42.120> down<00:03:42.330> to

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
in a moment so when this goes down to

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.180 
in a moment so when this goes down to
one<00:03:42.780> minute<00:03:43.080> we're<00:03:43.290> going<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.470> get<00:03:43.680> an<00:03:43.890> extra

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
one minute we're going to get an extra

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.800 
one minute we're going to get an extra
six<00:03:44.400> hearts<00:03:44.700> again<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.270> previously<00:03:45.690> I

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
six hearts again and previously I

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.600 
six hearts again and previously I
thought<00:03:46.110> this<00:03:46.320> was<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.500> feature<00:03:46.770> of<00:03:46.980> absortion

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
thought this was a feature of absortion

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.900 
thought this was a feature of absortion
but<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.270> turns<00:03:48.450> out<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:48.780> it's<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.020> bug<00:03:49.850> okay<00:03:50.850> so

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
but it turns out that it's a bug okay so

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.550 
but it turns out that it's a bug okay so
there<00:03:51.240> we<00:03:51.270> go<00:03:51.360> our<00:03:51.720> thirty<00:03:51.960> seconds<00:03:52.410> are<00:03:52.530> up

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
there we go our thirty seconds are up

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.440 
there we go our thirty seconds are up
and<00:03:52.860> now<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.040> have<00:03:53.340> another<00:03:53.730> six<00:03:54.030> hearts<00:03:54.240> as

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
and now we have another six hearts as

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.490 
and now we have another six hearts as
you<00:03:54.570> can<00:03:54.720> see<00:03:54.900> down<00:03:55.080> here

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
you can see down here

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.100 
you can see down here
so<00:03:56.130> in<00:03:56.310> 1.6.2<00:03:57.180> when<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.570> use<00:03:57.720> this<00:03:57.900> potion

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
so in 1.6.2 when you use this potion

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.200 
so in 1.6.2 when you use this potion
effect<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.860> that<00:03:59.400> will<00:03:59.490> no<00:03:59.610> longer<00:03:59.910> happen

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
effect and that will no longer happen

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.030 
effect and that will no longer happen
every<00:04:00.480> 30<00:04:00.720> seconds<00:04:01.260> which<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.620> how<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.950> was

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
every 30 seconds which is how it was

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.710 
every 30 seconds which is how it was
supposed<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.940> be<00:04:03.120> used<00:04:05.090> another<00:04:06.090> strange<00:04:06.420> bug

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
supposed to be used another strange bug

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.780 
supposed to be used another strange bug
in<00:04:06.930> one<00:04:06.990> point<00:04:07.440> six<00:04:07.680> point<00:04:07.860> one<00:04:08.130> is<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.520> do<00:04:08.640> with

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
in one point six point one is to do with

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.520 
in one point six point one is to do with
signs<00:04:09.030> if<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.420> place<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:09.990> a<00:04:10.050> block<00:04:10.290> like

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
signs if you place it on a block like

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.560 
signs if you place it on a block like
this<00:04:10.560> it's<00:04:11.070> fine<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.550> can<00:04:11.790> write<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.480> message

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
this it's fine you can write a message

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.990 
this it's fine you can write a message
however<00:04:13.410> if<00:04:13.740> you<00:04:13.860> place<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.340> on<00:04:14.460> a<00:04:14.670> fencepost

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
however if you place it on a fencepost

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.210 
however if you place it on a fencepost
like<00:04:15.390> this<00:04:15.660> you<00:04:16.260> don't<00:04:16.440> even<00:04:16.620> get<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:17.010> write

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
like this you don't even get to write

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.190 
like this you don't even get to write
anything<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:17.790> just<00:04:17.820> places<00:04:18.390> on<00:04:18.510> directly<00:04:18.989> like

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
anything it just places on directly like

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.130 
anything it just places on directly like
that<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:20.850> another<00:04:21.120> strange<00:04:21.450> bug<00:04:21.690> as<00:04:21.930> well

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
that and so another strange bug as well

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.350 
that and so another strange bug as well
placing<00:04:22.800> water<00:04:23.100> into<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.640> source<00:04:24.000> block<00:04:24.240> of

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
placing water into a source block of

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.420 
placing water into a source block of
water<00:04:24.480> like<00:04:24.780> this<00:04:25.050> will<00:04:25.680> make<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.070> breaking

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
water like this will make the breaking

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.350 
water like this will make the breaking
block<00:04:26.640> sound<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.120> there

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
block sound it there

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.240 
block sound it there
also<00:04:27.629> display<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.139> particles<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.800> breaking

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
also display the particles of breaking

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.589 
also display the particles of breaking
blocks<00:04:30.379> and<00:04:31.639> another<00:04:32.639> small<00:04:32.969> change<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.360> you

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
blocks and another small change that you

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.059 
blocks and another small change that you
might<00:04:33.810> want<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.080> know<00:04:34.319> about<00:04:34.469> when<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:34.919> use

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
might want to know about when you use

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:36.950 
might want to know about when you use
the<00:04:35.250> direct<00:04:35.610> connect<00:04:35.939> it<00:04:36.090> now<00:04:36.120> remembers<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
the direct connect it now remembers the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.629 
the direct connect it now remembers the
server<00:04:37.349> address<00:04:37.770> however<00:04:38.219> it<00:04:38.370> didn't

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
server address however it didn't

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.490 
server address however it didn't
remember<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.300> port<00:04:39.539> number<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:39.930> this<00:04:40.229> part

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
remember the port number so this part

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.469 
remember the port number so this part
here<00:04:40.770> would<00:04:41.340> not<00:04:41.490> get<00:04:41.699> remembered<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.330> when

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
here would not get remembered so when

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.209 
here would not get remembered so when
you<00:04:42.659> would<00:04:42.840> log<00:04:43.080> back<00:04:43.289> on<00:04:43.469> to<00:04:43.680> use<00:04:43.860> direct

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
you would log back on to use direct

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.100 
you would log back on to use direct
connect<00:04:44.520> again<00:04:44.669> you'd<00:04:45.330> only<00:04:45.479> see<00:04:45.719> this<00:04:45.840> part

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
connect again you'd only see this part

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.330 
connect again you'd only see this part
of<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.259> server<00:04:46.500> address<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:47.009> that's<00:04:47.159> been

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
of the server address so that's been

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.659 
of the server address so that's been
corrected<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:48.319> 1.6.2

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
corrected in 1.6.2

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.040 
corrected in 1.6.2
so<00:04:50.669> there's<00:04:50.909> a<00:04:50.969> couple<00:04:51.270> of<00:04:51.330> other<00:04:51.569> important

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
so there's a couple of other important

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.320 
so there's a couple of other important
bug<00:04:52.229> fixes<00:04:52.710> as<00:04:52.919> well<00:04:53.159> first<00:04:53.580> of<00:04:53.729> all<00:04:53.789> sprint<00:04:54.210> is

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
bug fixes as well first of all sprint is

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.029 
bug fixes as well first of all sprint is
handled<00:04:54.719> by<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.900> client<00:04:55.319> again<00:04:55.439> so<00:04:55.800> when<00:04:55.949> you

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
handled by the client again so when you

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.249 
handled by the client again so when you
are<00:04:56.159> playing<00:04:56.370> online<00:04:56.669> on<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.599> server<00:04:57.990> in<00:04:58.110> the

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
are playing online on a server in the

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.629 
are playing online on a server in the
previous<00:04:58.590> update<00:04:58.770> there'd<00:04:59.189> be<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.340> delay

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
previous update there'd be a delay

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:00.980 
previous update there'd be a delay
before<00:04:59.969> you<00:05:00.060> could<00:05:00.240> sprimp<00:05:00.569> and<00:05:00.750> now<00:05:00.810> it's

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
before you could sprimp and now it's

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.260 
before you could sprimp and now it's
back<00:05:01.139> to<00:05:01.169> normal<00:05:01.349> which<00:05:01.770> is<00:05:01.800> good<00:05:02.189> and<00:05:02.430> as<00:05:03.090> well

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
back to normal which is good and as well

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.580 
back to normal which is good and as well
as<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.539> there<00:05:03.750> was<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:03.900> problem<00:05:04.199> that<00:05:04.409> was

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
as that there was a problem that was

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.290 
as that there was a problem that was
introduced<00:05:05.039> quite<00:05:05.189> a<00:05:05.310> while<00:05:05.580> ago<00:05:05.729> we're<00:05:06.090> never

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
introduced quite a while ago we're never

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.059 
introduced quite a while ago we're never
forretress<00:05:06.750> only<00:05:07.110> mobs<00:05:07.349> they're<00:05:07.590> ones<00:05:07.830> that

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
forretress only mobs they're ones that

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.189 
forretress only mobs they're ones that
can<00:05:08.219> only<00:05:08.460> spawn<00:05:08.789> on<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.210> nether<00:05:09.659> fortress

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
can only spawn on a nether fortress

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.469 
can only spawn on a nether fortress
wouldn't<00:05:10.529> spawn<00:05:10.860> in<00:05:11.129> old<00:05:11.669> nether<00:05:11.939> fortresses

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
wouldn't spawn in old nether fortresses

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.059 
wouldn't spawn in old nether fortresses
only<00:05:12.870> in<00:05:12.990> new<00:05:13.139> ones<00:05:13.409> and<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:13.740> that's<00:05:13.889> been

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
only in new ones and so that's been

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.070 
only in new ones and so that's been
fixed<00:05:14.370> so<00:05:14.669> if<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:14.879> have<00:05:15.060> another<00:05:15.389> fortress<00:05:15.779> in

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
fixed so if you have another fortress in

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.779 
fixed so if you have another fortress in
your<00:05:16.229> map<00:05:16.439> that<00:05:16.710> suffered<00:05:17.069> from<00:05:17.189> this<00:05:17.370> problem

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
your map that suffered from this problem

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.480 
your map that suffered from this problem
it<00:05:18.180> will<00:05:18.360> now<00:05:18.509> spawn<00:05:18.840> those<00:05:19.080> mobs<00:05:19.319> again<00:05:19.650> so

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
it will now spawn those mobs again so

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.640 
it will now spawn those mobs again so
now<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.669> I'm<00:05:20.849> back<00:05:21.000> in<00:05:21.199> 1.6.2<00:05:22.199> I'm<00:05:22.500> just

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
now that I'm back in 1.6.2 I'm just

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.080 
now that I'm back in 1.6.2 I'm just
going<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.830> show<00:05:23.039> you<00:05:23.069> those<00:05:23.250> bugs<00:05:23.520> again<00:05:23.849> so

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
going to show you those bugs again so

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.760 
going to show you those bugs again so
you<00:05:24.150> know<00:05:24.360> they<00:05:24.539> are<00:05:24.569> fixed<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.229> can<00:05:25.379> see<00:05:25.560> here

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
you know they are fixed you can see here

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.010 
you know they are fixed you can see here
the<00:05:25.889> horse<00:05:26.069> can't<00:05:26.430> be<00:05:26.490> pushed<00:05:26.819> into<00:05:27.539> the<00:05:27.750> walls

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
the horse can't be pushed into the walls

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.140 
the horse can't be pushed into the walls
and<00:05:28.349> if<00:05:28.800> we<00:05:28.919> grab<00:05:29.129> some<00:05:29.400> of<00:05:29.430> this<00:05:29.550> armor<00:05:29.969> you'll

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
and if we grab some of this armor you'll

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.570 
and if we grab some of this armor you'll
see<00:05:30.419> that<00:05:31.289> we<00:05:31.440> can<00:05:31.650> swap<00:05:31.919> it<00:05:31.979> around<00:05:32.339> quickly

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
see that we can swap it around quickly

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.249 
see that we can swap it around quickly
just<00:05:33.000> by<00:05:33.150> clicking<00:05:33.360> on<00:05:33.599> the<00:05:33.719> armor<00:05:34.020> with<00:05:34.169> the

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
just by clicking on the armor with the

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.820 
just by clicking on the armor with the
other<00:05:34.409> piece<00:05:34.680> like<00:05:35.009> that<00:05:36.259> so<00:05:37.259> if<00:05:37.379> we<00:05:37.409> destroy

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
other piece like that so if we destroy

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.740 
other piece like that so if we destroy
the<00:05:37.860> back<00:05:38.400> or<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.879> front<00:05:38.909> of<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.419> sticky

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
the back or the front of the sticky

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.360 
the back or the front of the sticky
piston<00:05:40.110> it<00:05:40.229> no<00:05:40.349> longer<00:05:40.500> drops<00:05:40.889> the<00:05:41.069> sticky

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
piston it no longer drops the sticky

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.579 
piston it no longer drops the sticky
piston<00:05:41.789> block<00:05:42.029> you<00:05:42.599> can<00:05:42.750> see<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.139> water<00:05:43.349> is

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:43.589 
piston block you can see the water is

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.529 
piston block you can see the water is
behaving<00:05:43.919> normally<00:05:44.250> again<00:05:44.759> which<00:05:45.150> is<00:05:45.300> good

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
behaving normally again which is good

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.589 
behaving normally again which is good
and<00:05:46.460> over<00:05:47.460> here<00:05:47.639> you<00:05:47.729> can<00:05:47.759> actually<00:05:48.029> see<00:05:48.240> that

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
and over here you can actually see that

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.959 
and over here you can actually see that
this<00:05:48.779> is<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.080> trap<00:05:49.409> chest<00:05:49.710> here<00:05:50.009> and<00:05:50.219> this<00:05:50.759> one

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
this is a trap chest here and this one

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:52.879 
this is a trap chest here and this one
is<00:05:51.120> a<00:05:51.150> regular<00:05:51.389> chest<00:05:51.839> and<00:05:52.110> if<00:05:52.289> we<00:05:52.409> stand<00:05:52.680> in

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
is a regular chest and if we stand in

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.769 
is a regular chest and if we stand in
front<00:05:53.039> of<00:05:53.219> the<00:05:53.339> chicken<00:05:53.520> we<00:05:54.180> can<00:05:54.330> still<00:05:54.569> see

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
front of the chicken we can still see

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.100 
front of the chicken we can still see
the<00:05:54.930> lead<00:05:55.139> as<00:05:55.379> well<00:05:55.589> and<00:05:56.479> after<00:05:57.479> having<00:05:57.839> the

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
the lead as well and after having the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.379 
the lead as well and after having the
absorbed<00:05:58.560> effect<00:05:58.830> for<00:05:59.189> 30<00:05:59.550> seconds<00:06:00.120> you<00:06:00.240> can

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
absorbed effect for 30 seconds you can

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.059 
absorbed effect for 30 seconds you can
see<00:06:00.419> we<00:06:00.719> don't<00:06:00.839> get<00:06:01.050> those<00:06:01.199> hearts<00:06:01.500> back<00:06:01.710> again

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
see we don't get those hearts back again

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.570 
see we don't get those hearts back again
and<00:06:03.199> now<00:06:04.199> if<00:06:04.289> we<00:06:04.349> place<00:06:04.620> a<00:06:04.650> sign<00:06:05.039> on<00:06:05.099> a<00:06:05.279> fence

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
and now if we place a sign on a fence

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.179 
and now if we place a sign on a fence
post<00:06:05.699> we<00:06:06.089> can<00:06:06.210> actually<00:06:06.539> type<00:06:06.750> again<00:06:07.139> and<00:06:08.039> it's

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:08.189 
post we can actually type again and it's

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.029
