pie dishes and it works on oil pressure
so<00:00:14.250> then<00:00:14.990> this<00:00:16.039> box<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.279> filled<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.960> with

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
soft enough that it can use the pressure

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.760 
soft enough that it can use the pressure
from<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.740> from<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.280> machine<00:01:48.649> make<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
from there from the machine make it

it's much safer when we turn the tarts

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.609 
it's much safer when we turn the tarts
around<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.500> get<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.130> out<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.550> mode<00:02:06.730> yeah

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
around and get it out of the mode yeah

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.040 
around and get it out of the mode yeah
that's<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:09.030> put<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.149> in<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:12.220> press<00:02:12.430> this<00:02:12.610> two
