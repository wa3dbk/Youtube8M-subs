00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.449
 3 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.379
 later 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.379
 finish 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.320
 a new segment of vehicles is imposing the world he is called 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.470
 crossover 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.430
 it is known that 4 4 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.280
 in many cases the country since you bought it for the simple fact of 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.710
 enjoy the features increased in mind can a beach 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.690
 but having a vehicle really soon 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.059
 with the suspension 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.269
 strong that I generated got for another extreme use 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.010
 it does not make much sense since you want to enjoy comfort and the board 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.920
 of communities 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.809
 total 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.769
 of the characteristics of a good high-end vehicle 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.530
 these superb be an intermediate thing say a vehicle 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.180
 with the characteristics of one frob 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.690
 but with the comfort of a high-end vehicle and is growing a lot 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.090
 Ford world market can not be outside of your region presents the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.160
 argentina this novelty that forms a young card 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.690
 please 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.690
 Hahaha 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 4 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.350
 so to date 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.390
 rossi was all very well done very interesting 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.050
 it was the first surprise let's say a curve of earth that turned out to be some mud 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.610
 nor fast William prices despite claiming that there was close then the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.469
 always display to the landscape 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.450
 rival special vehicle uro 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.030
 I felt and staying the vehicle the omc that they were pressing was acting 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.450
 the control system 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.439
 traction stability system 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.580
 I was surprised second curve the same thing again surprised me 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.960
 and I was surprised all the way back the behavior of the vehicle I always 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.820
 evolution on a vehicle 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.780
 from which settled a conversation with the aforementioned hospital 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.320
 relationship now how will you touch comfortable 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.130
 rare is that there is no doubt or practically nothing very good is very 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.850
 ok although the first curve 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.259
 to see how is this 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:18.969
 raising it excellent second by a little bit stronger toralin and 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.499
 we arrived at the circuit 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:25.729
 mateo rushed to earth just rich replied beautifully answered 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.029
 all right 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.199
 when electronics abinee without human help you have to understand 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.849
 that there are things that even though this is the best pilot in the pilot world 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.399
 reality what you love you can not do because you can not have control 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:42.989
 individual on each tire or on race track that continues in the air the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.599
 brakes that the one that we are outside will bring traction to the front 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.199
 theo metro I need because he liked it is seeing school s3f se tercia and a 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.009
 dwarf 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:56.629
 in controlling a computer to make decisions as to what 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.929
 what this version and spectra of stability protest rolling after the 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.190
 Traction success is 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.580
 and stop that to avoid leaving all these systems 1los known but 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.160
 when the market is defeated but when you see them working all 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.039
 together and with one thing that I should highlight in this vehicle 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.869
 what is the differential system 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:19.109
 differential chosica to transfer courtesy in front of another multi-disk 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.439
 that he acted an incredible speed and that 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.059
 really gives advantages against the competition in that sense is a 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.289
 advantage now 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.569
 there is a well-known mark who knows who gives this type of vehicle that 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.289
 the sand has a very good behavior as long as there is no speed 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:38.129
 but when you start to want to fit in 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.170
 it does not waver and asserts that I will accept without a helmet because it is because the system 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.480
 must redistribute the clear traction and when will it be in sand delay what 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.749
 same as they say the mud means tell us something else 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:54.139
 said retention of pilot's expertise if it is not a problem or with which the 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.639
 answer he has and kolo 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.819
 the answer is that yes they are speeding me in the order of the tenth and a half 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.809
 of second if it does not give time to the vehicle actis laces and that for 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:08.459
 basile and you at all times feel chilena grandson on the computer is 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.239
 accompanying that I think the most remarkable thing beyond of course I'm 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.559
 trusted the community 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.349
 not everything the designers are going to tell you until I'm tired and can 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.070
 I think he has it without any doubt 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.290
 According to the officials, the detainees believe that they do have 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.770
 differential set 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.190
 a really relevant difference 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.050
 when technology comes 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.650
 it was a century not only of comfort because 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.140
 that is able to do that can go up that can lower that we empower the 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.129
 concanaco work how long lasts 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.969
 a wonderful a very nice vehicle 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:46.360
 the comfortable molejÃ³n that none in which he has 60 driving 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.060
 a four by four with a more interesting power of one hundred cabal 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.400
 with a curve actor that controls also electronically trimmed his 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.059
 engine of five cylinders 200 hp turbocharged 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.790
 that has its maximum torti begin the thousand 200 laps 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.680
 and even a little beyond the four thousand which is formidable because there 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.800
 who for example 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.919
 usually the extreme subtitles we put the low in this reserve for 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.779
 when the thing gets complicated a troop accem an extreme descent 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.430
 if you do not have much touch much torque 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.930
 good to see if you can do without savage beauty take out have left 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.930
 situations that would be another very difficult case to cope with 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.939
 4 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.809
 in pinamar we came here in charge of a lot of people, a lot of people 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.219
 very reasonable because this is a company of the caliber of football 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.779
 got involved in this segment and fell this divisions of I'm also going to 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.779
 competing obviously when you see how nice and attention-grabbing 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.280
