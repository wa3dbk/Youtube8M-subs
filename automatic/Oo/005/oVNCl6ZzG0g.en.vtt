beat<00:00:09.570> tutorials<00:00:10.260> com<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:12.120> tutorial<00:00:12.330> I

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
beat tutorials com in this tutorial I

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.010 
beat tutorials com in this tutorial I
want<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.259> look<00:00:13.469> at<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:14.250> take<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:15.020> loop

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
want to look at how you can take a loop

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.130 
want to look at how you can take a loop
that<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.160> basically<00:00:17.960> convert<00:00:18.960> it

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that you have and basically convert it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.189 
that you have and basically convert it
into<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:20.039> score<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> piano<00:00:21.539> roll<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.109> you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
into a score in the piano roll so you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.960 
into a score in the piano roll so you
can<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.619> what<00:00:22.830> notes<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.310> playing<00:00:23.699> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
can see what notes is playing and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.589 
can see what notes is playing and
possibly<00:00:24.960> even<00:00:25.439> change<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:27.210> way<00:00:27.449> it

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
possibly even change the the way it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.620 
possibly even change the the way it
sounds<00:00:28.050> by<00:00:28.199> playing<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:29.010> same<00:00:29.369> loop<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
sounds by playing the same loop with a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.580 
sounds by playing the same loop with a
different<00:00:31.380> VST<00:00:32.130> such<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.239> citrus<00:00:33.719> or<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.469> know

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
different VST such as citrus or you know

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.709 
different VST such as citrus or you know
any<00:00:34.920> vsti<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.940> want<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.210> play<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.570> with

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
any vsti that you want to play it with

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.220 
any vsti that you want to play it with
so<00:00:37.410> let's<00:00:37.620> take<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> look<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.250> how<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.700> that

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
so let's take a look at how you do that

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
so let's take a look at how you do that
so<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.350> my<00:00:40.500> browser<00:00:40.800> window<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.610> I've<00:00:42.059> loaded

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so in my browser window here I've loaded

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.380 
so in my browser window here I've loaded
some<00:00:42.750> loops<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
some loops that I have and I have a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
some loops that I have and I have a
string<00:00:45.899> loop<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.469> I'm<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.489> mess

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
string loop here that I'm going to mess

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.279 
string loop here that I'm going to mess
around<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.510> let's<00:00:48.750> take<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> listen<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
around with so let's take a listen to

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.069 
around with so let's take a listen to
that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.439 

you

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.420 

so<00:00:58.449> let's<00:00:58.660> say<00:00:58.840> I<00:00:58.870> like<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.649> loop<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.100> I<00:01:00.160> want

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
so let's say I like that loop and I want

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.660 
so let's say I like that loop and I want
to<00:01:00.520> use<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:02.379> I<00:01:02.590> don't<00:01:02.649> really<00:01:03.100> like<00:01:03.219> the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
to use it but I don't really like the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.850 
to use it but I don't really like the
sound<00:01:03.969> of<00:01:04.269> what<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:04.900> is<00:01:05.080> so<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.320> want<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.650> find

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
sound of what it is so I want to find

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.430 
sound of what it is so I want to find
out<00:01:06.070> what<00:01:06.340> notes<00:01:06.640> it's<00:01:06.880> playing<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.509> how<00:01:08.409> I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
out what notes it's playing and how I

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.410 
out what notes it's playing and how I
can<00:01:08.740> change<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.340> instrument<00:01:09.729> that's<00:01:10.090> playing

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
can change the instrument that's playing

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.399 
can change the instrument that's playing
it<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.670> reason<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.450> may<00:01:14.080> want<00:01:14.350> to

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
it now the reason that you may want to

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.719 
it now the reason that you may want to
do<00:01:14.590> this<00:01:14.800> is<00:01:15.040> for<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.250> couple<00:01:15.490> different

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
do this is for a couple different

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.480 
do this is for a couple different
reasons<00:01:15.970> say<00:01:16.649> maybe<00:01:17.649> you<00:01:17.830> like<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.070> notes

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
reasons say maybe you like the notes

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.190 
reasons say maybe you like the notes
that<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.880> loop<00:01:19.119> is<00:01:19.330> playing<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:19.990> want

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
that that loop is playing and you want

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.630 
that that loop is playing and you want
to<00:01:20.290> play<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.710> with<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:20.890> different<00:01:21.130> instrument

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
to play it with a different instrument

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.350 
to play it with a different instrument
like<00:01:22.000> we've<00:01:22.210> talked<00:01:22.479> about<00:01:22.659> or<00:01:23.259> maybe<00:01:24.360> you're

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
like we've talked about or maybe you're

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.070 
like we've talked about or maybe you're
not<00:01:25.540> sure<00:01:25.810> what<00:01:26.140> what<00:01:26.799> key<00:01:27.220> or<00:01:27.610> note<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:29.050> that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
not sure what what key or note so that

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.889 
not sure what what key or note so that
it's<00:01:29.410> playing<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.039> you<00:01:30.880> want<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.690> want<00:01:31.780> to

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
it's playing and you want to you want to

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.660 
it's playing and you want to you want to
pull<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.140> into<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.619> piano<00:01:32.830> roll<00:01:33.190> so<00:01:33.429> you<00:01:33.460> can

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
pull that into the piano roll so you can

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.389 
pull that into the piano roll so you can
see<00:01:33.940> what<00:01:34.119> that<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:35.679> can<00:01:35.860> match<00:01:36.100> your

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
see what that is and you can match your

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.359 
see what that is and you can match your
beat<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.940> it<00:01:36.970> or<00:01:37.500> maybe<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.649> even<00:01:38.979> want<00:01:39.340> to

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
beat to it or maybe you even want to

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.960 
beat to it or maybe you even want to
transpose<00:01:40.090> what<00:01:40.479> it's<00:01:40.630> playing<00:01:41.399> so<00:01:42.399> let's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
transpose what it's playing so let's

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.109 
transpose what it's playing so let's
take<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.240> look<00:01:43.479> at<00:01:43.659> how<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.869> can<00:01:44.110> do<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.500> so<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
take a look at how we can do that so the

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.219 
take a look at how we can do that so the
first<00:01:46.300> thing<00:01:46.539> I'm<00:01:46.659> going<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.810> do<00:01:46.960> is<00:01:47.080> I'm<00:01:47.200> going

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.779 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:47.380> add<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.560> new<00:01:47.800> channel<00:01:48.130> because<00:01:48.369> right<00:01:48.580> now<00:01:48.759> I

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
to add a new channel because right now I

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.990 
to add a new channel because right now I
just<00:01:48.909> have<00:01:49.240> drum<00:01:49.509> samples<00:01:49.990> in<00:01:50.170> my<00:01:51.039> window<00:01:51.700> here

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
just have drum samples in my window here

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.320 
just have drum samples in my window here
so<00:01:52.210> I'm<00:01:52.539> going<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.750> add<00:01:52.899> citrus<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:55.149> go<00:01:55.270> to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
so I'm going to add citrus we go to

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.149 
so I'm going to add citrus we go to
channels<00:01:55.840> add<00:01:56.140> one

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.929 

and<00:02:00.020> citrus<00:02:01.020> okay<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.640> here

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and citrus okay so now we have that here

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.330 
and citrus okay so now we have that here
and<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.810> see<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.259> citrus<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and you can see that citrus is the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.180 
and you can see that citrus is the
selected<00:02:05.969> channel<00:02:06.289> now<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.350> next<00:02:07.860> thing<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
selected channel now the next thing I

going to add Edison

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.430 
going to add Edison
I<00:02:21.200> load<00:02:22.200> Edison<00:02:22.830> okay<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.630> Edison<00:02:25.200> here

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
I load Edison okay so I have Edison here

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.430 
I load Edison okay so I have Edison here
I<00:02:25.470> have<00:02:25.740> citrus<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.910> my<00:02:27.390> channel<00:02:28.260> window

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
I have citrus here and my channel window

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.150 
I have citrus here and my channel window
here<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.070> look<00:02:30.030> within<00:02:30.690> Edison<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.740> want<00:02:32.070> to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
here so look within Edison I want to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.180 
here so look within Edison I want to
drag<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.820> loop<00:02:33.210> from<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:34.380> from<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
drag this loop from here from the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.730 
drag this loop from here from the
browser<00:02:35.460> into<00:02:35.970> Edison<00:02:38.930> pasty<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.170> here<00:02:40.530> that

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
browser into Edison pasty in here that

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.900 
browser into Edison pasty in here that
this<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.130> now<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.520> Edison

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
this is now in Edison

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.870 
this is now in Edison
you

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.540 

now<00:02:47.240> what<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.570> want<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.290> is<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.740> Edison

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
now what I want to do is have Edison

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.450 
now what I want to do is have Edison
analyze<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.720> create<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.710> piano<00:02:52.160> roll

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
analyze this and create a piano roll

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.630 
analyze this and create a piano roll
score<00:02:52.970> from<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.930> what<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.200> do<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:55.370> come

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
score from it so what I do is I come

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.550 
score from it so what I do is I come
down<00:02:55.790> here<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:56.090> where<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.390> loop<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.930> right

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
down here to where the loop is right

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.180 
down here to where the loop is right
click

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
click

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.750 
click
and<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.670> go<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.940> tools'<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.400> over<00:03:02.400> here<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and I go to tools' and over here on the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.700 
and I go to tools' and over here on the
right<00:03:03.000> side<00:03:03.270> under<00:03:03.660> analysis<00:03:04.260> you'll<00:03:04.500> see

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
right side under analysis you'll see

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.250 
right side under analysis you'll see
convert<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.340> score<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.060> dump<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.600> piano<00:03:06.960> roll

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
convert the score and dump to piano roll

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.360 
convert the score and dump to piano roll
if<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:08.220> left<00:03:08.490> like<00:03:08.790> that

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
if I left like that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.360 
if I left like that
you<00:03:10.790> now<00:03:11.060> see<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.349> taking<00:03:12.830> this<00:03:12.980> loop

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
you now see that it is taking this loop

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.940 
you now see that it is taking this loop
and<00:03:13.629> created<00:03:14.629> a<00:03:14.720> score<00:03:15.110> on<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.379> piano<00:03:15.680> roll

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
and created a score on the piano roll

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.039 
and created a score on the piano roll
from<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.549> it's<00:03:16.700> already<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.269> my<00:03:17.510> citrus

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
from it and it's already on my citrus

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.770 
from it and it's already on my citrus
Channel<00:03:18.470> now<00:03:19.310> let's<00:03:19.580> take<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.819> look<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.390> take<00:03:20.750> a

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
Channel now let's take a look and take a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.610 
Channel now let's take a look and take a
listen<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.349> citrus

and the great thing about this is now
I<00:03:33.670> can<00:03:34.950> go<00:03:35.950> into<00:03:36.630> citrus<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:40.390> can<00:03:40.750> change

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620
