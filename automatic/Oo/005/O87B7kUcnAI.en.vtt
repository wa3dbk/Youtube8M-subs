this whole concept of your toxification

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.070 
this whole concept of your toxification
is<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.259> complicated<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> really

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
is a very complicated one that I really

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
is a very complicated one that I really
I'm<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.189> into<00:01:20.310> without
