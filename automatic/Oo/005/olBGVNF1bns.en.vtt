00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.360 
this act this actually happens now yes
I'm<00:02:20.360> running<00:02:20.810> my<00:02:21.380> computer<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.040> actually

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
I'm running my computer is actually

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.890 
I'm running my computer is actually
recording<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.000> video<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.569> I'm<00:02:23.690> using

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
recording this video so I'm using

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.699 
recording this video so I'm using
resources<00:02:24.819> actually<00:02:25.819> two<00:02:26.660> separate<00:02:27.380> types<00:02:27.530> of

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
resources actually two separate types of

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.339 
resources actually two separate types of
resources<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:29.150> order<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.510> run<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.140> maybe

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
resources in order to run this so maybe

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.960 
resources in order to run this so maybe
there's<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.010> dis<00:02:31.310> conflict<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.910> you

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
there's a dis conflict and you

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.280 
there's a dis conflict and you
definitely<00:02:32.180> want<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.569> run<00:02:32.750> phone<00:02:32.989> gloaming<00:02:33.260> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
