that I've been testing for last three
months<00:01:40.299> that's<00:01:40.780> why<00:01:40.899> we<00:01:41.140> have<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.409> do<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.649> they

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
months that's why we have to do it they

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.380 
months that's why we have to do it they
might<00:01:42.189> be<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.369> little<00:01:42.490> bit<00:01:42.670> pricier<00:01:43.060> at<00:01:43.149> first

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
might be a little bit pricier at first

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.080 
might be a little bit pricier at first
as<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.810> volume<00:01:44.350> goes<00:01:44.799> up<00:01:44.829> I<00:01:45.219> suspect<00:01:45.909> this<00:01:46.030> is

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
as the volume goes up I suspect this is

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.450 
as the volume goes up I suspect this is
going<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.450> be<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.890> around<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.219> same<00:01:48.429> price

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
going to be just around the same price

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.760 
going to be just around the same price
