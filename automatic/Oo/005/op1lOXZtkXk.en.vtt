00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
court is a 10-7 likessee seventh is like

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.410 
court is a 10-7 likessee seventh is like
that<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.860> not<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.430> seventh<00:00:38.850> degree<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that it's not the seventh degree of the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.569 
that it's not the seventh degree of the
scale<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.500> forward<00:00:40.980> seventh<00:00:41.430> degree

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
scale but it's a forward seventh degree

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.360 
scale but it's a forward seventh degree
of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> scale<00:00:42.530> okay<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.890> always<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
of the scale okay so you always have to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.069 
of the scale okay so you always have to
find<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.789> Lord<00:00:45.030> seventh<00:00:45.570> degree<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
find the Lord seventh degree of the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.160 
find the Lord seventh degree of the
scale<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.649> get<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.450> seventh<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> dominant

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
scale to get a seventh or a dominant

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.950 
scale to get a seventh or a dominant
seventh<00:00:49.530> okay<00:00:49.789> for<00:00:50.789> example<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> F<00:00:51.570> scale

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
seventh okay for example the F scale

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100 
seventh okay for example the F scale
goes<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:53.329> also<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> seventh<00:00:54.930> would

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
goes like this also the seventh would

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.279 
goes like this also the seventh would
not<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.370> would<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.940> lowered<00:00:57.840> seven

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
not be that it would be a lowered seven

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.979 
not be that it would be a lowered seven
so<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.649> F<00:00:58.920> seventh<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.120> G<00:01:00.359> scale<00:01:00.660> goes

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
so that's F seventh the G scale goes

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.520 
so that's F seventh the G scale goes
like<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:02.660> that's<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> seventh<00:01:04.199> degree<00:01:04.320> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
like this that's the seventh degree of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140 
like this that's the seventh degree of
the<00:01:04.619> scale<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.280> wouldn't<00:01:05.549> play<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> but

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the scale so you wouldn't play that but

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.190 
the scale so you wouldn't play that but
you<00:01:06.240> find<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> lower<00:01:06.930> 70<00:01:07.760> forward<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.970> okay<00:01:09.479> so

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you find the lower 70 forward so okay so

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.740 
you find the lower 70 forward so okay so
that's<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.799> kind<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.250> simple<00:01:11.580> another<00:01:12.450> kind

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that's one kind of simple another kind

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
that's one kind of simple another kind
of<00:01:12.900> seventh<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.439> called<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.010> major<00:01:14.280> set<00:01:14.700> with

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
of seventh is called a major set with

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.020 
of seventh is called a major set with
maj7<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.320> would<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.340> chord<00:01:17.610> symbol

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
maj7 that would be that the chord symbol

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.590 
maj7 that would be that the chord symbol
maj7<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.580> major<00:01:20.820> doesn't<00:01:21.210> refer<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
maj7 and the major doesn't refer to the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.359 
maj7 and the major doesn't refer to the
cord<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> chords<00:01:22.439> major<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.920> either<00:01:23.070> case

chord with a major 7th that's four kinds
of<00:01:55.830> segments<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.310> we've<00:01:56.490> considered<00:01:56.910> re<00:01:57.150> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
of segments that we've considered re a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.930 
of segments that we've considered re a
minor<00:01:58.110> chord<00:01:58.440> with<00:01:58.650> a<00:01:58.680> major<00:01:59.010> seventh<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
minor chord with a major seventh and the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.860 
minor chord with a major seventh and the
symbol<00:02:00.300> for<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> would<00:02:00.720> be<00:02:00.870> C<00:02:01.500> minor<00:02:01.800> maj7

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
symbol for that would be C minor maj7

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.350 
symbol for that would be C minor maj7
okay<00:02:04.070> then<00:02:05.070> there<00:02:05.250> would<00:02:05.400> be<00:02:05.430> an<00:02:05.610> Augmented

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
okay then there would be an Augmented

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.240 
okay then there would be an Augmented
seventh<00:02:06.960> which<00:02:07.350> would<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.830> dominant

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
seventh which would be the dominant

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.960 
seventh which would be the dominant
seventh<00:02:08.670> with<00:02:08.880> an<00:02:09.030> augmented<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:11.670> suppose

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
seventh with an augmented and I suppose

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.720 
seventh with an augmented and I suppose
there<00:02:12.120> could<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.860> augmented<00:02:13.860> seventh<00:02:14.340> with

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
there could be a augmented seventh with

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.930 
there could be a augmented seventh with
a<00:02:14.900> major<00:02:15.900> sep<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.500> mean<00:02:16.650> augmented<00:02:17.310> chord<00:02:17.790> with

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
a major sep I mean augmented chord with

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.190 
a major sep I mean augmented chord with
a<00:02:17.970> major<00:02:18.270> seventh<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:20.570> it's<00:02:21.570> useful

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
a major seventh but it's it's useful

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.960 
a major seventh but it's it's useful
effect<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.920> I'm<00:02:23.040> not<00:02:23.130> sure<00:02:23.340> I've<00:02:23.459> ever<00:02:23.490> seen<00:02:23.850> it

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
effect on I'm not sure I've ever seen it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.230 
effect on I'm not sure I've ever seen it
used<00:02:24.320> okay<00:02:25.320> but<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:25.950> possible<00:02:26.459> okay<00:02:26.820> and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
used okay but it's possible okay and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.270 
used okay but it's possible okay and
then<00:02:27.930> there's<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.200> diminished<00:02:28.770> seventh<00:02:29.130> now<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
then there's a diminished seventh now a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.740 
then there's a diminished seventh now a
diminished<00:02:29.760> seventh<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.239> little<00:02:30.420> tricky<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
diminished seventh is a little tricky a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.270 
diminished seventh is a little tricky a
diminished<00:02:31.200> triad<00:02:31.500> as<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.830> notice<00:02:32.070> where<00:02:32.250> you

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
diminished triad as you notice where you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.180 
diminished triad as you notice where you
lower<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.700> third<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.239> fifth<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:34.650> a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
lower the third and the fifth but a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.290 
lower the third and the fifth but a
diminished<00:02:36.120> seventh<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.600> where<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:38.300> don't

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
seventh with a major seventh I mean a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.930 
seventh with a major seventh I mean a

minor chord the major seventh and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.059 
minor chord the major seventh and
there's<00:03:12.120> an<00:03:12.269> Augmented<00:03:13.519> seventh

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
there's an Augmented seventh

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.690 
there's an Augmented seventh
and<00:03:15.189> then<00:03:15.730> there's<00:03:15.969> a<00:03:16.060> diminished<00:03:16.689> 7<00:03:17.469> and<00:03:18.370> then

and then there's a diminished 7 and then
a<00:03:18.969> half<00:03:19.719> of<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.079> percent<00:03:20.469> okay<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.599> lost<00:03:22.989> track

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
a half of a percent okay so I lost track

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.319 
a half of a percent okay so I lost track
I<00:03:23.409> think<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.650> was<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.769> seven<00:03:24.129> but<00:03:24.280> there's<00:03:25.269> a

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
I think it was a seven but there's a

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.860 
I think it was a seven but there's a
whole<00:03:25.480> bunch<00:03:25.659> of<00:03:26.670> 7th<00:03:27.670> chords<00:03:27.999> so<00:03:28.209> get<00:03:28.840> a

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
whole bunch of 7th chords so get a
