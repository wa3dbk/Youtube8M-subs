00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the zoom in we got the crystal what

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.280 
the zoom in we got the crystal what
makes<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.350> crystal<00:01:13.680> tonics<00:01:14.750> it's<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> new

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
makes it crystal tonics it's like a new

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.870 
makes it crystal tonics it's like a new
technology<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:17.009> something<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:17.400> said<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
technology or something they said that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.499 
technology or something they said that
they're<00:01:18.689> trying<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> use<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> think<00:01:21.360> that's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
they're trying to use so I think that's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.740 
they're trying to use so I think that's
pretty<00:01:21.750> cool<00:01:23.060> got<00:01:24.060> an<00:01:24.150> interesting<00:01:24.360> color

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
wires and then got some headphones some

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.780 
wires and then got some headphones some
black<00:02:09.810> ones<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.170> are<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.550> yellow

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
black ones that are just like the yellow

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.630 
black ones that are just like the yellow
ones<00:02:12.030> over<00:02:12.330> there

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
ones over there

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.180 
ones over there
you<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.850> some<00:02:15.150> foam<00:02:15.630> ones<00:02:15.980> which<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.130> don't

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
you have some foam ones which I don't

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.310 
you have some foam ones which I don't
personally<00:02:17.520> like<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.300> think<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.960> takes<00:02:19.140> away

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
personally like I think it takes away

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.220 
personally like I think it takes away
from<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:20.400> music<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.820> think<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.090> really<00:02:21.390> makes<00:02:22.140> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
from the music I think it really makes a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.910 
from the music I think it really makes a
lot<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.470> softer<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.130> they<00:02:23.490> are<00:02:23.610> pretty<00:02:23.730> cool

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
lot of softer but they are pretty cool

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.120
