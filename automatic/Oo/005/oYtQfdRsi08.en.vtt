00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:28.349
 clear once is the second time that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.930
 return to this team is another situation 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.930
 the first time is short really 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:56.400
 was the main difference is that this 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.979
 he had just come out of an operation that 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.559
 I tell you fast I would have two months to 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.780
 recover but my metabolism was 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.240
 very slow then I could not think that that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.640
 is the main one if now I come last 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.100
 conditions to be able to contribute to the team 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.100
 I already have other experiences 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.630
 I come from a year and a half needed is had 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.570

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.520

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.060
 try to keep growing then come and 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.430
 work 100% every day come to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 deliver and always be available to 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.740
 what the coach asked to help 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.450
 much to the team that is my main goal 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:44.470
 this help have the greatest participation 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:47.260
 possible and try to do it because I would 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.440
 I take it as a new challenge and the truth is 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.430
 that since I 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.710
 in him 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.530
 Well the news that comes here by the 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.130
 truth is not motivated apart by the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.250
 technical 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.160
 that I know rubÃ©n and as I say the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.000
 truth I come to contribute with my granite of 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.000
 sand and with all the desire of the world what 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.530
 what does this new mean for me 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.550
 challenge and 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.950
 and the important thing that we notice as a 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.910
 new new stage and elaborated very 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.280
 motivating for me because the truth this 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.010
 mine can say that I like 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.980
 to order I like 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.340
 but at the front very offensive and 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.190
 I define myself as a young man this offensive and 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.640
 this as wheat now the colors that 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.740
 come we come to contribute to the tree 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.430
 as I have not know our part 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.040
 sand and as always in the teams that 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.550
 it's my turn to be always there to port and 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.280
 makes the group to make a good 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.760
 a good player on and off the field 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.860
 and as I say this we come to contribute 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.530
 like me and those of us who have just come 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.800
 arriving and as I say this motivating to 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.360
 one and apart 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.650
 by colleagues that I had already had in 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.410
 two other teams is simply giving 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.410
 the best of me, I'm going to kill him 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.100
 inside the field and doing a good 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.560
 a good tournament grab minutes in arm 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.840
 the confidence of the teacher and as I say 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.420
 this 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.550
 is a new stage and the truth is that 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.550
 I'm very happy to get to the town
