00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
long so I got that but this one's called

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.000 
long so I got that but this one's called
the<00:01:45.610> heatwave<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.540> you<00:01:47.500> can<00:01:47.620> fly<00:01:47.800> already

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
the heatwave and you can fly already

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.280 
the heatwave and you can fly already
straight<00:01:48.430> when<00:01:48.850> it's<00:01:49.060> awaited<00:01:49.450> back<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.140> it's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
straight when it's awaited back so it's

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.920 
straight when it's awaited back so it's
very<00:01:50.470> similar<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:52.200> your<00:01:53.200> typical<00:01:53.560> process
