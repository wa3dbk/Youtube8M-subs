00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.699 
I'm like no the things that turned to
gold<00:03:19.370> have<00:03:20.360> turned<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.750> gold<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.140> things<00:03:21.380> that

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
gold have turned to gold the things that

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.560 
gold have turned to gold the things that
didn't<00:03:22.489> turn<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.790> gold<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.180> haven't<00:03:23.420> heard

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
didn't turn to gold you haven't heard

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.319 
didn't turn to gold you haven't heard
about<00:03:23.630> because<00:03:23.959> they<00:03:24.079> failed<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:24.680> know<00:03:24.829> I

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
about because they failed you know I

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.970 
about because they failed you know I
guess<00:03:26.329> but<00:03:26.840> if<00:03:27.049> they<00:03:27.230> don't<00:03:27.410> turn<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.799> gold

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
guess but if they don't turn the gold

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.039 
guess but if they don't turn the gold
