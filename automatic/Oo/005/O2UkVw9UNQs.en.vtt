and<00:01:43.470> six<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.920> honestly<00:01:44.340> think<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.640> better<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and six I honestly think it's better I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.630 
and six I honestly think it's better I
feel<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.990> accuracy<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:46.860> long<00:01:47.100> range<00:01:47.399> is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
feel like the accuracy at long range is

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.280 
feel like the accuracy at long range is
like<00:01:47.850> literally<00:01:48.210> next<00:01:48.600> level<00:01:48.990> compared<00:01:49.229> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
like literally next level compared to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.630 
like literally next level compared to
the<00:01:49.380> sm<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.009> feel<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.250> that's<00:01:50.369> what

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the sm one and I feel like that's what

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.399 
the sm one and I feel like that's what
separates<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.450> me<00:01:51.630> I'm<00:01:52.020> mainly<00:01:52.290> an

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
separates it because me I'm mainly an

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.870 
separates it because me I'm mainly an
assault<00:01:52.680> rifle<00:01:52.740> player<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.399> i<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.850> use

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
assault rifle player but i like to use

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.639 
assault rifle player but i like to use
submachine<00:01:54.360> guns<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.720> maneuver<00:01:55.320> around<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
submachine guns just maneuver around the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.859 
submachine guns just maneuver around the
map<00:01:55.829> quicker<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.509> feel<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
map quicker so with this I feel like I

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.539 
map quicker so with this I feel like I
kind<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.110> get<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.290> mix<00:01:58.590> best<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.100> both<00:01:59.219> worlds

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
kind of get the mix best of both worlds

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
kind of get the mix best of both worlds
put<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> grip<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.360> put<00:02:00.869> avance<00:02:01.140> rifling

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
put the grip on it put avance rifling

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.319 
put the grip on it put avance rifling
shoot<00:02:01.860> kids<00:02:02.070> across<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> map<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.880> does<00:02:03.030> really

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
shoot kids across the map it does really

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.639 
shoot kids across the map it does really
really<00:02:03.630> well<00:02:03.780> compare<00:02:04.049> today's<00:02:04.140> someone<00:02:04.530> in

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
really well compare today's someone in

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.319 
really well compare today's someone in
my<00:02:04.770> opinion<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> range<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> lot<00:02:05.850> better<00:02:06.030> I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
my opinion the range is a lot better I

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210 
my opinion the range is a lot better I
know<00:02:06.930> maybe<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.649> school<00:02:07.860> range<00:02:08.069> isn't

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
know maybe this to school range isn't

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.309 
know maybe this to school range isn't
better<00:02:08.429> or<00:02:08.580> whatever<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.170> with<00:02:10.170> how<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
better or whatever but with how the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
better or whatever but with how the
recoil<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> iron<00:02:11.280> set<00:02:11.489> everything<00:02:11.819> with

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
recoil is the iron set everything with

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.760 
recoil is the iron set everything with
that<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.209> my<00:02:12.390> personal<00:02:12.660> opinion<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.290> think

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that in my personal opinion I think

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
that in my personal opinion I think
lesson<00:02:14.130> 6<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.520> better<00:02:14.850> at<00:02:15.000> range<00:02:15.180> without

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
lesson 6 is better at range without

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.540 
lesson 6 is better at range without
doing<00:02:15.720> any<00:02:15.900> statistical<00:02:16.440> lookups<00:02:16.740> at<00:02:16.950> all<00:02:17.130> so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
doing any statistical lookups at all so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.350 
doing any statistical lookups at all so
I<00:02:17.580> don't<00:02:17.820> know<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.000> guys<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.240> really

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
awesome stuff but I've never really

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280 
awesome stuff but I've never really
tried<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:26.820> six<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.870> when<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.080> did

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
tried this at six and when I did

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.690 
tried this at six and when I did
normally<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.680> was<00:02:28.770> like<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.980> s<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.310> six<00:02:29.490> money

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
normally it was like the s and six money

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.010 
normally it was like the s and six money
because<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.060> had<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.570> really<00:02:30.840> didn't

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
because I had that but I really didn't

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.420 
because I had that but I really didn't
like<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.290> literally<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> default

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
like I literally like the default

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
like I literally like the default
essence<00:02:32.820> 60<00:02:33.210> this<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.020> good

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
essence 60 this is it's really good

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.570 
essence 60 this is it's really good
there's<00:02:34.440> probably<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.740> better<00:02:34.860> very<00:02:35.130> added<00:02:35.490> I

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
there's probably a better very added I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.360 
there's probably a better very added I
might<00:02:35.820> do<00:02:35.940> some<00:02:36.120> research<00:02:36.240> into<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.380> for

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
might do some research into it but for

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.580 
might do some research into it but for
now<00:02:38.520> literally<00:02:38.850> just<00:02:39.090> go<00:02:39.270> try<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.660> default<00:02:40.440> s

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
now literally just go try the default s

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.930 
now literally just go try the default s
and<00:02:40.800> six<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.250> guys<00:02:41.400> were<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.550> try<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> sub

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
and six if you guys were to try a sub

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.430 
and six if you guys were to try a sub
she<00:02:42.120> go<00:02:42.210> that<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.390> personally<00:02:42.690> think<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.200> better

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
she go that I personally think is better

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.980
