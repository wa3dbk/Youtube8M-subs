00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:05.879
 some details of the gospels that leads us to believe that this 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.449
 she says josé de arimatéia for example had to be in the garden near the place 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:15.969
 of the skull and this mob is to be more 160 meters from the goal the boot had to be 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.119
 excavated in solid rock 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.570
 and many of the tombs at that time were only caves but this 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.909
 dug into the rock 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.410
 the third 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.670
 should belong to a Jewish peak period and rudi year 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.329
 but we know that Joseph was rich in satuba has all the characteristics of 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.140
 belong to someone rich 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.750
 two archaeologists dated this tunga of the period to have hated 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.250
 also has to have a channel for the rock to roll as it has here a month 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.320
 there should also be room so much for several people gathered at home 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.520
 we noticed that the women followed for a turning body of Jesus 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.170
 as the last act of love 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.670
 they are our beach the amazing features of satuba first 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.820
 I need a channel excavated in the ground because it allows the vertical fit of a 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.539
 left sliced ​​plate 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.349
 the same channel on the ground is cut off that behind the other side three times 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.410
 this allows to put on up of vertical with a flat horizontal stone 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.970
 marijuana wall if the body would be placed on top 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.030
 something else that is important to show 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 we are in the glass hall here the body could be separated 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800
 is what I want to emphasize that the Jews is not our neighborhood 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.590
 they had hope of the resurrection 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.350
 the women wanted to bring of spices here in the pituba to soften 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.800
 the decomposition process 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.720
 he is the god of war we know that when the women came on sunday 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.150
 in the morning and after the Passover they found it when I did 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.860
 thirty days after what we know the Jewish culture of the first century 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.650
 the Sunday morning after Easter was an extremely relevant date for 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.060
 the Jewish faith after that kiss on the day when the high priest of the temple 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.970
 would be offering it is one of the first fruits of the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.969
 grain 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:16.180
 it is no coincidence that Jesus was resurrected exactly in that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.999
 same date marked let's love jesus say 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.999
 the first fruits of the Christian harvest 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:27.999
 so it symbolizes the first born of the many millions who would follow the faith 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.319
 Christian 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.079
 organic failure after the women came to work where Jesus would be buried in the 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.719
 Easter Sunday, we know from evangelicals that one of the 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:43.039
 concerns was how they would be able to return that huge stone 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.759
 which closed the entry of the supporter 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.979
 gospel of Matthew tells us that they will not need to worry because a 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:54.769
 angel of the Lord came down from heaven rolled the stone presented on them that too 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.899
 makes us wonder why that joke had to be rolled over when we know 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:03.539
 the body of Jesus after the resurrection was able to cross 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:08.279
 doors and relatives now so clear he could leave the purchase without needing 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.830
 take the answer 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.920
 is that jesus 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.980
 did not need the stone to be removed 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.260
 because that's the way God showed the world, since Cuba was empty. 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.779
 without the body inside 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:26.939
 this is the most significant aspect of the Christian faith because we know that 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.919
 jesus is no longer in the tomb he is not dead so the old lighthouse 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.079
 the women on Easter Sunday morning and that's the message of 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.769
 hope because it has echoed for centuries he is not here March 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.579
 resurrected c 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.169
 I want to be where we can always meet with is alive 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.609
 with us all the time through the spirit of God because they live in the country 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.609
 visit the meaning of the empty tomb 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.449
 Jesus was alive death did not have power over him the resurgence of 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:08.069
 has appeared to 500 of his followers for 40 days but 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.639
 important he wanted will be revealed those closest to him 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.909
 in one situation he met Pedro who had turned his business around 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.639
 galley fishing 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.229
