00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.360
 shit quality shit but what 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.000
 I wanted to do because I wanted to be 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.009
 very excited about the update and that 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.680
 I was going to be the first to record because 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.110
 on YouTube you can not find a fucking 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.390
 result of neutralization increases 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.610

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.440
 I feel quite happy to discover 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.800
 this new update so that the 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.320
 packers quickly find out about this from 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.089
 that there is a new song and that 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.480
 be careful because maybe in these 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:39.850

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.170

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.980
 it is not concerned because all 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:31.109
 the doubts that I have where I was a 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.819
 power and 8 are quite complete and 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.040
 I'm afraid that now that it came out 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.230
 advance warfare and spit an egg of the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.769
 photos and do not believe anymore all for talking 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.250

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.670
 bots 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.819
 clear because I'm bathed and used them to 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.639
 use your other moments like the 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.469
 worthy moment he is a moment 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.469

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.049
