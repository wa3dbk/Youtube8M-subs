00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.780 
her mouth I saw these wide spaces
multiple<00:02:51.000> missing<00:02:51.420> teeth<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:52.400> major<00:02:53.400> tooth

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
multiple missing teeth and major tooth

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.340 
multiple missing teeth and major tooth
loss<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.300> aesthetic<00:02:54.750> zone<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.320> I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
loss in that aesthetic zone you and I

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.410 
loss in that aesthetic zone you and I
were<00:02:55.500> talking<00:02:55.830> about<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.370> what<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.730> not<00:02:57.180> so

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
were talking about but what is not so

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.470 
were talking about but what is not so
obvious<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.650> when<00:02:58.950> teeth<00:02:59.160> are<00:02:59.310> gone<00:02:59.520> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
obvious is that when teeth are gone the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.780 
obvious is that when teeth are gone the
remaining<00:03:00.900> teeth<00:03:01.170> shift<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.280> move<00:03:02.430> into<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
remaining teeth shift and move into the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.860 
remaining teeth shift and move into the
wrong<00:03:03.150> place<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.870> creates<00:03:04.230> an<00:03:04.830> extreme

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
wrong place and that creates an extreme

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.410 
wrong place and that creates an extreme
