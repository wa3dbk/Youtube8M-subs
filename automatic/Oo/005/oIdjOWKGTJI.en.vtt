00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.109
 ravelli presents the new rds ravelli system the name system 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.089
 there are many leather qualities on the market 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:14.269
 with the rds system the stove regulates combustion according to the type of skin 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.129
 used 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.330
 that rds system is composed of three main elements 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.019
 oral sex 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.349
 the primary and secondary air inlet pipe 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.829
 a simple and intuitive control panel 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.759
 let's start from the heart of rds technology 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.690
 the flow meter or flow sensor 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.120
 on the end of the sensor a special vitrification process guarantees 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.910
 extreme precision and sensors that determine the functioning of the DVD 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.880
 meter protecting it from dust and dust that is usually created 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.470
 inside a house 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.650
 this process guarantees minimum maintenance is an extreme precision of 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.080
 operation 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.710
 the rds sensor 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.969
 and then inserted into its silicone housing which determines the right one 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.640
 distance 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.090
 it is simply mounted in its membrane with the connector always in 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.560
 view so that even a possible maintenance takes place in a simple way e 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 fast 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.560
 this is how it is mounted on a complete system 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.310
 the rds sensor perfectly fits the tube surface 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.550
 so as to completely seal operation 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.080
 only in this way will the sensor guarantee accuracy and safety 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.060
 the ds areas allows the pellet stove to live a type operation 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.550
 dynamic as the thesis pellet stove manages independently in the base 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.980
 to extraordinary teeth like for example 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.350
 the ambient temperature 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.830
 based on the temperature the system rds self-adjusts the amount of air for one 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.810
 correct combustion 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.140
 the particular weather conditions 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.999
 based on another low atmospheric pressure 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.919
 the draft of the chimney can be different e-system rds compensation 

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.409
 autonomously these variations always guaranteeing a functioning 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.270
 optimal 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.590
 latitude 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.660
 setting the altitude in the rds menu the system will automatically set up the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.870
 values ​​that will compensate for the difference in the concentration of oxygen in the air 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.060
 the rds system automatically compensates the differences declared between 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.069
 one chimney and another 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.060
 Well, that's the air for the combustion until it's correct 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.899
 Stoichiometric will be respected 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.910
 the success of the operation of the rds system 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.400
 is also due to the collaboration with the University of Brescia faculty of 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.130
 fluid dynamics engineering 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.590
 which enabled mathematical calculations to understand the correct 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.770
 Stoichiometric ratio that determines the correct combustion of our stoves 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.719
 with pellets 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.129
 RDS system therefore guarantees our stove 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.999
 continuous self-regulation of combustion 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.909
 a guaranteed return over time is greater security within the 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.149
 our home 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:01.189
 stoves with rds are equipped with the new graphic interface 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.699
 backlit with the latest technology that allows us to use software 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.109
 adicore chart 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.429
 extremely simple, practical and intuitive 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.040
 in the initial screen we find three hills 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.300
 menu menu settings the factory settings menu 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:20.730
 entering the settings menu 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.040
 we find a menu settings menu state stove human clock 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.999
 human a chronothermostat to adjust the transfer of the stove switch-off 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:34.219
 language menu so that the stove of 20 can be customized according to the country where 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.309
 is used 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:39.379
 human climate comfort for switching on and off the stove according to 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.509
 reaching room temperature 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:44.619
 and in addition it does not work which is one of the novelties of 2010 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.909
 the salerno menu knows 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.069
 which allows us to make our stove silent 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.799
 el sest system that allows us to reduce the security thresholds when 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.539
 we are at home 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.379
 these three buttons render 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.739
 very easy and intuitive to use by the end user 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.409
 a button dedicated to switching on when turned off 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.249
 a button with which we want the room temperature and a go button 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.249
 which we regulate the power of the flame 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.069
 here we see our display installed in a wall plate 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.030
 this display can be installed on one side of the stove or on one 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.110
 wall tube may be more comfortable 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.659
 the placa can be installed at home and thanks to a new system of 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.659
 data communication called power line communication system 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.060
 we use the classic electrical system to obtain communication 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.300
 between stewed displays 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.870
 in addition to manual use via the display 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.070
 supplied with a new multi-function remote control capable of handling all the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.409
 stove menu 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.539
 we also have the possibility to connect the stove bone with the module 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.039
 gprs 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.650
 so a simple text message even if we are far from home 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.180
 we can control our stew by turning it on and adjusting the temperature e 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.909
 adjusting the power 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.849
 let's now see how the rds system affects the operation of the stove 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.550
 in this case we have an optimal combustion able to guarantee an excellent 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.499
 caloric yield 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.370
 unfortunately according to the qualities of the aforementioned type of installation 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.320
 sometimes the flame will mention a quantity of oxygen other than that 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.110
 set by parameters 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.340
 in fact we ship as in this case by simulating the clogging of the rod 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.930
 fumaria the flame worthy needing more sitemap 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.060
 at this point the rds system perceives that the stoichiometric ratio is no longer 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.450
 respected and decides to increase the amount of oxygen to bring back the 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.300
 combustion at optimal values 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.509
 rds 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.750
 ravelli the name system
