 of support for the process of the ceni of which 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.820

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.950
 look, we vote together for 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.479

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.789

 voting with the pp to ask the pp 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.720

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.579
 resolution in ireland that has as a 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.770

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.250
 anti-terrorist policy use the 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.600
 pain of the victims or that some 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.189
 parties will attack others in 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.590
 State issues is what we 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.630

 anti-terrorist policy like politics 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.890
 of security in this case have to be 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.399
 elements that have the consensus of
