was<00:00:45.360> someone<00:00:45.660> else<00:00:45.810> was<00:00:46.130> singing<00:00:47.130> it<00:00:47.220> than<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
was someone else was singing it than I

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.030 
was someone else was singing it than I
expected<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.930> when<00:00:49.290> I<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.470> a<00:00:49.500> kid<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:49.920> was

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
expected this when I was a kid there was

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.650 
expected this when I was a kid there was
a<00:00:50.070> song<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.400> sounded<00:00:51.060> just<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.630> I

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a song that sounded just like this and I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.600 
a song that sounded just like this and I
guess<00:00:51.810> it's<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> remake<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.470> that<00:00:52.649> song<00:00:53.040> I<00:00:53.370> think

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
guess it's a remake of that song I think

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.040 
guess it's a remake of that song I think
was<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> synthesizer<00:00:54.360> at<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.630> beginning<00:00:54.960> or

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.670

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
don't care about all the theory behind

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.580 
don't care about all the theory behind
it<00:04:33.640> even<00:04:34.240> though<00:04:34.360> knowing<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:35.110> chords<00:04:35.470> and

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
it even though knowing the chords and

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.250 
it even though knowing the chords and
stuff<00:04:35.740> really<00:04:36.010> does<00:04:36.250> help<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:37.050> put<00:04:38.050> things

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
stuff really does help you put things

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.950 
stuff really does help you put things
together<00:04:38.700> we're<00:04:39.700> gonna<00:04:39.790> have<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.000> deal<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.900> a

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
together we're gonna have a deal and a

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.830 
together we're gonna have a deal and a
gene<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.590> being<00:04:41.920> here<00:04:42.100> together<00:04:42.630> all<00:04:43.630> right

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
gene and being here together all right

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.940 
gene and being here together all right
and<00:04:44.110> then<00:04:44.200> we're<00:04:44.290> going<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.440> play<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.770> D

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
and then we're going to play that D

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.790 
and then we're going to play that D
again<00:04:45.070> on<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.460> thumb<00:04:46.080> not<00:04:47.080> too<00:04:47.260> loudly<00:04:47.530> though

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
again on the thumb not too loudly though

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.700 
again on the thumb not too loudly though
cuz<00:04:48.100> that's<00:04:48.280> not<00:04:48.370> really<00:04:48.670> part<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.030> melody

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
cuz that's not really part of the melody

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.260 
cuz that's not really part of the melody
that<00:04:50.710> D<00:04:51.010> what<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:51.460> do<00:04:51.610> want<00:04:51.730> to<00:04:51.820> hit<00:04:51.910> hard<00:04:52.150> that

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
that D what you do want to hit hard that

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.450 
that D what you do want to hit hard that
higher<00:04:52.480> D<00:04:52.720> appear<00:04:53.080> on<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.710> pinky<00:04:54.010> so<00:04:54.160> hit<00:04:54.280> that

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
one hard and then I see hold that T on

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.380 
one hard and then I see hold that T on
just<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.810> little<00:04:58.840> bit<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.380> then<00:04:59.830> B<00:05:00.010> a<00:05:00.280> so<00:05:01.270> I'm

all right left here we're going to go to

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.740 
all right left here we're going to go to
octaves<00:05:18.320> here<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:18.590> it's<00:05:18.740> a<00:05:18.770> little<00:05:18.949> more<00:05:19.070> full

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
to have a low a octave and then down to

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.580 
to have a low a octave and then down to
a<00:06:10.070> low<00:06:10.310> F<00:06:10.639> octave<00:06:11.050> remember<00:06:12.050> knock<00:06:12.199> it<00:06:12.410> just

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
a low F octave remember knock it just

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.920 
a low F octave remember knock it just
means<00:06:12.800> eighth<00:06:13.070> notes<00:06:14.060> it's<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:14.330> same<00:06:14.539> note<00:06:14.750> F

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
means eighth notes it's the same note F

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.100 
means eighth notes it's the same note F
an<00:06:15.110> F<00:06:15.229> a<00:06:15.590> a<00:06:15.620> together<00:06:16.310> and<00:06:16.729> then<00:06:17.060> G's<00:06:17.479> together
