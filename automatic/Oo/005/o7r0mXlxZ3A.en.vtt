00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the high school this was actually a fan

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.330 
the high school this was actually a fan
made<00:00:47.910> game<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.559> got<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> feedback

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
made game and that got on a feedback

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.040 
made game and that got on a feedback
like<00:00:50.520> last<00:00:50.910> week<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.300> released<00:00:51.570> or<00:00:51.719> something

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
like last week it released or something

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
like last week it released or something
yeah<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.770> reddit<00:00:52.980> place<00:00:53.160> didn't<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.699> do

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
yeah the reddit place didn't really do

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.450 
yeah the reddit place didn't really do
much<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:55.440> guess<00:00:56.039> we're<00:00:56.160> gonna<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
much so I guess we're gonna have to

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
much so I guess we're gonna have to
figure<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.910> who<00:00:57.120> goes<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.329> right<00:00:57.930> because

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
figure out who goes first right because

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.920 
figure out who goes first right because
whoever<00:00:58.559> goes<00:00:58.739> first<00:00:59.359> has<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
whoever goes first has to get the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.450 
whoever goes first has to get the
highest<00:01:01.109> score<00:01:01.559> i've<00:01:01.800> ever<00:01:01.980> kind<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> know
