00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
could create a password which we are

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.400 
could create a password which we are
going<00:02:56.960> to<00:02:57.110> do<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.180> good<00:02:59.600> idea<00:02:59.900> to

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
going to do and it is a good idea to

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.810 
going to do and it is a good idea to
create<00:03:00.590> those<00:03:00.950> passwords<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.700> way<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:04.610> can

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
create those passwords that way you can

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.640 
create those passwords that way you can
keep<00:03:05.000> your<00:03:05.240> account<00:03:05.570> personal<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.410> private

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
keep your account personal and private

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.550 
keep your account personal and private
and<00:03:07.330> give<00:03:08.330> yourself<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.810> password<00:03:09.290> hint

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
and give yourself a password hint

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.900 
and give yourself a password hint
whatever<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.250> might<00:03:10.520> be<00:03:14.080> let's<00:03:15.080> say<00:03:15.320> that

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
whatever that might be let's say that

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.850 
whatever that might be let's say that
Jr's<00:03:16.910> password<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.720> name<00:03:18.020> of<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.260> dog<00:03:18.470> so

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
Jr's password is the name of the dog so

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.070 
Jr's password is the name of the dog so
we'll<00:03:18.950> just<00:03:19.130> put<00:03:19.310> in<00:03:19.490> dog<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.090> that's<00:03:20.840> not<00:03:21.050> a

we'll just put in dog and that's not a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.660 
we'll just put in dog and that's not a
good<00:03:21.320> password<00:03:21.590> hint<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.100> should<00:03:22.310> know<00:03:22.460> better

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
good password hint I should know better

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.700 
good password hint I should know better
than<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:23.060> but<00:03:23.330> quite<00:03:23.900> honestly<00:03:24.230> right<00:03:24.680> now

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710
