we're<00:00:11.730> going<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.090> take<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.299> an<00:00:12.599> ordinary

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:12.779 
we're going to take just an ordinary

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.959 
we're going to take just an ordinary
toothpick<00:00:13.440> bounce<00:00:14.129> it<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.430> the<00:00:14.580> rim<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.760> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
toothpick bounce it on the rim of the

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.349 
toothpick bounce it on the rim of the
glass<00:00:15.119> while<00:00:16.020> holding<00:00:16.320> two<00:00:17.279> ordinary<00:00:17.910> Forks

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
glass while holding two ordinary Forks

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.130 
glass while holding two ordinary Forks
and<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:20.400> material<00:00:20.880> augeas<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.750> you'll<00:00:21.870> need

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and the material augeas that you'll need

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.570 
and the material augeas that you'll need
is<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:22.800> an<00:00:22.980> ordinary<00:00:23.160> glass<00:00:24.710> two<00:00:25.710> forks<00:00:26.130> that

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
is just an ordinary glass two forks that

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.600 
is just an ordinary glass two forks that
we<00:00:26.789> watch<00:00:26.970> together<00:00:27.350> um<00:00:28.350> then<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.280> just<00:00:29.430> need

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
we watch together um then you just need

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.519 
we watch together um then you just need
the<00:00:29.640> toothpick<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.690> asleep<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.140> balance<00:00:31.440> it

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the toothpick at asleep to balance it

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.220 
the toothpick at asleep to balance it
down<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.759> need<00:00:33.030> matches<00:00:33.690> which

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
down and then you need matches which

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.800 
down and then you need matches which
will<00:00:34.590> show<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> why<00:00:35.010> later<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.570> what

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
will show you the why later and so what

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.470 
will show you the why later and so what
you<00:00:36.930> first<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.470> is<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.399> wedge<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.000> two<00:00:39.149> forks

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you first do is you wedge the two forks

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.880 
you first do is you wedge the two forks
together<00:00:42.050> just<00:00:43.050> takes<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:43.410> bit<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.590> time

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
together just takes a little bit of time

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.740 
together just takes a little bit of time
and<00:00:44.130> practice<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.210> see

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.540 

this<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:53.870> all<00:00:53.989> you<00:00:54.140> need<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.379> touchdown<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.430> like

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
this is all you need a touchdown to like

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.100 
this is all you need a touchdown to like
that<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.059> then<00:00:56.210> there's<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.480> little<00:00:56.629> simple

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
that and then there's a little simple

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.959 
that and then there's a little simple
run<00:00:57.260> through<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.559> see<00:00:57.739> if<00:00:57.769> it<00:00:57.980> works<00:00:58.190> it<00:00:58.910> is

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
run through to see if it works it is

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.970 
run through to see if it works it is
just<00:00:59.269> putting<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.690> on<00:00:59.809> your<00:00:59.930> finger<00:01:00.230> just<00:01:00.890> to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
just putting it on your finger just to

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.520 
just putting it on your finger just to
see<00:01:01.219> how<00:01:01.460> it'll<00:01:01.670> balance<00:01:01.930> then<00:01:02.930> what<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:03.379> do

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
see how it'll balance then what you do

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.639 
see how it'll balance then what you do
is<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:04.339> take<00:01:04.369> a<00:01:04.580> toothpick<00:01:04.909> and<00:01:05.380> you<00:01:06.380> just

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
is you take a toothpick and you just

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.310 
is you take a toothpick and you just
watch<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:07.399> into<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.180> center<00:01:08.450> of<00:01:08.540> gravity<00:01:09.170> of

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
watch it into the center of gravity of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.420 
watch it into the center of gravity of
the<00:01:09.770> two<00:01:09.950> forks<00:01:10.520> which<00:01:11.270> happens<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.810> be<00:01:12.100> on<00:01:13.100> the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
the two forks which happens to be on the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.719 
the two forks which happens to be on the
second<00:01:14.300> from<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.509> top<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:15.080> little<00:01:15.110> time<00:01:16.100> and

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
second from the top a little time and

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.399 
second from the top a little time and
you<00:01:17.479> slide<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.500> toothpick<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.690> right<00:01:20.690> in<00:01:20.930> the

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
you slide the toothpick in right in the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.950 
you slide the toothpick in right in the
center<00:01:22.420> wait<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.570> in<00:01:23.720> there<00:01:23.929> and<00:01:25.810> so<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.899> can

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
center wait it in there and so you can

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.440 
center wait it in there and so you can
see<00:01:27.020> it's<00:01:27.470> just<00:01:27.789> ordinary<00:01:28.789> toothpick<00:01:29.179> and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
see it's just ordinary toothpick and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.419 
see it's just ordinary toothpick and
what<00:01:30.140> we're<00:01:30.259> going<00:01:30.440> to<00:01:30.560> do<00:01:30.740> you're<00:01:31.160> going<00:01:31.310> to

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
what we're going to do you're going to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.600 
what we're going to do you're going to
balance<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.030> on<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.360> edge<00:01:32.539> of<00:01:32.570> glass<00:01:33.580> which<00:01:34.580> is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
balance it on the edge of glass which is

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.330 
balance it on the edge of glass which is
tips<00:01:37.610> out<00:01:37.789> of<00:01:37.909> practices<00:01:39.039> kind<00:01:40.039> of<00:01:40.159> hard<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.369> do

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
tips out of practices kind of hard to do

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.850 
tips out of practices kind of hard to do
as<00:01:43.479> you<00:01:44.479> can<00:01:44.600> see<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.170> two<00:01:45.350> forks<00:01:45.710> are

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
as you can see the two forks are

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.090 
as you can see the two forks are
bouncing<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:47.050> just<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.259> one<00:01:48.409> tooth<00:01:48.649> pick<00:01:48.890> on

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
bouncing on just the one tooth pick on

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.410 
bouncing on just the one tooth pick on
the<00:01:49.220> glass<00:01:49.729> which<00:01:51.069> kind<00:01:52.069> of<00:01:52.250> shows<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.210> center

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the glass which kind of shows the center

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.150 
the glass which kind of shows the center
of<00:01:53.450> gravity<00:01:53.539> laws<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.259> defies<00:01:54.679> them<00:01:54.950> at<00:01:55.069> the

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
of gravity laws and defies them at the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.850 
of gravity laws and defies them at the
same<00:01:55.310> time<00:01:55.750> then<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:57.289> next<00:01:57.410> thing<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:57.709> do

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
same time then the next thing you do

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:07.119 
same time then the next thing you do
like<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.640> match<00:02:02.470> light<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.619> match<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:06.890> put<00:02:07.039> it

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
like to match light the match you put it

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:08.770 
like to match light the match you put it
on<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.250> edge<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.459> the<00:02:07.550> toothpick<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.149> tell

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
on the edge of the toothpick and tell

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.900 
on the edge of the toothpick and tell
it's<00:02:08.899> burning<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:10.129> as<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.399> can<00:02:10.520> see<00:02:10.550> as<00:02:10.789> the

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
it's burning and as you can see as the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.530 
it's burning and as you can see as the
flame<00:02:11.150> moves<00:02:11.390> along<00:02:12.129> it<00:02:13.129> just<00:02:13.520> leaves<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
flame moves along it just leaves the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.540 
flame moves along it just leaves the
remaining<00:02:14.989> part<00:02:15.230> as<00:02:15.410> an<00:02:15.560> orange<00:02:15.950> which<00:02:16.250> kind

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
remaining part as an orange which kind

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.460 
remaining part as an orange which kind
of<00:02:16.730> dissolves<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:19.459> as<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.989> flame<00:02:21.230> keeps

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
of dissolves and as the flame keeps

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.229 
of dissolves and as the flame keeps
going<00:02:21.800> how's<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.069> gets<00:02:22.280> closer<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.910> rim<00:02:23.209> of

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
going how's it gets closer to the rim of

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.290 
going how's it gets closer to the rim of
the<00:02:23.480> glass<00:02:23.629> it<00:02:24.470> will<00:02:25.430> slow<00:02:25.760> down<00:02:25.790> and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
the glass it will slow down and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.790 
the glass it will slow down and
eventually<00:02:27.290> die<00:02:28.120> which<00:02:29.120> is<00:02:29.390> right<00:02:29.780> about<00:02:30.020> you

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.559 

stop<00:02:33.800> right<00:02:34.040> at<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.280> end<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:35.269> looks<00:02:35.420> like

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
stop right at the end and it looks like

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.530 
stop right at the end and it looks like
it<00:02:35.810> will<00:02:35.900> file<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:37.519> doesn't<00:02:37.910> get<00:02:37.970> better

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
it will file but it doesn't get better

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.589 
it will file but it doesn't get better
and<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:39.829> you<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.099> see<00:02:40.129> this<00:02:40.549> orange<00:02:41.000> part<00:02:41.329> is

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
and as you can see this orange part is

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:48.640 
and as you can see this orange part is
just<00:02:42.099> dissolving<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:46.959> shortly<00:02:47.959> we<00:02:48.170> knock<00:02:48.439> off

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
just dissolving and shortly we knock off

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.440 
just dissolving and shortly we knock off
the<00:02:48.920> black<00:02:49.189> part<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.790> was<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.329> little

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
the black part it was just a little

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.899 
the black part it was just a little
black<00:02:50.750> part<00:02:51.939> there<00:02:54.040> now<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.280> comes<00:02:55.489> off<00:02:55.609> and

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
black part there now that comes off and

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.300 
black part there now that comes off and
if<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.299> come<00:02:56.450> around<00:02:56.569> here<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.349> as<00:02:58.250> you

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
if you can come around here and as you

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.490 
if you can come around here and as you
can<00:02:58.640> see<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:59.060> there's<00:02:59.569> just<00:02:59.870> two<00:03:00.049> forms

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
can see that there's just two forms

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.619 
can see that there's just two forms
balancing<00:03:01.099> on<00:03:01.250> half<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.819> toothpick<00:03:02.209> with<00:03:02.450> no

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
balancing on half of a toothpick with no

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.110 
balancing on half of a toothpick with no
other<00:03:02.959> side<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:04.069> support<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.790> center<00:03:05.060> of

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
other side to support the center of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.440 
other side to support the center of
gravity<00:03:05.209> which<00:03:06.040> really<00:03:07.040> makes<00:03:07.489> no<00:03:07.819> sense<00:03:08.209> as

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
gravity which really makes no sense as

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.770 
gravity which really makes no sense as
far<00:03:08.659> as<00:03:08.810> physical<00:03:09.680> law<00:03:09.859> but<00:03:10.819> it<00:03:11.150> still<00:03:11.510> works

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
far as physical law but it still works

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:26.250 
far as physical law but it still works
and<00:03:12.109> as<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.829> can<00:03:12.920> see<00:03:12.950> it's<00:03:13.730> pretty<00:03:13.939> sturdy

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.869 

suburbs<00:03:27.260> right<00:03:27.319> there<00:03:27.680> don't<00:03:28.069> have<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.579> knock

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
suburbs right there don't have to knock

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.909 
suburbs right there don't have to knock
it<00:03:29.090> up<00:03:29.209> but<00:03:29.540> yeah<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.109> then<00:03:30.349> once<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:30.650> get<00:03:30.799> it

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
it up but yeah and then once you get it

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:40.809 
it up but yeah and then once you get it
off<00:03:33.730> kind<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.760> hard<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:38.829> then<00:03:39.829> if<00:03:40.099> you<00:03:40.639> wedge

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
off kind of hard and then if you wedge

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.229 
off kind of hard and then if you wedge
them<00:03:41.030> back<00:03:41.180> together<00:03:42.819> put<00:03:43.819> it<00:03:43.940> back<00:03:44.060> together

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
them back together put it back together

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:52.750 
them back together put it back together
Oh

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.300 

we're<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:54.569> we<00:03:54.750> did<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.019> trick<00:03:55.200> before<00:03:55.379> and

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
we're like we did the trick before and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.360 
we're like we did the trick before and
as<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:56.610> put<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.879> toothpick<00:03:57.269> in<00:03:57.480> where<00:03:57.689> it<00:03:57.780> was

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
as you put the toothpick in where it was

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.789 
as you put the toothpick in where it was
and<00:03:59.370> then<00:03:59.549> try<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.730> balance<00:03:59.939> it<00:04:00.180> again<00:04:03.799> nope

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
and then try to balance it again nope

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.210 
and then try to balance it again nope
doesn't<00:04:05.610> work<00:04:08.150> another<00:04:09.150> workout<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:10.319> it's<00:04:11.190> a

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
doesn't work another workout so it's a

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.009 
doesn't work another workout so it's a
pretty<00:04:11.340> cool<00:04:11.579> trick<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.120> thanks<00:04:12.959> for

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
pretty cool trick and thanks for

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.839 
pretty cool trick and thanks for
