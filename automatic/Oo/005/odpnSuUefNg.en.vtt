there<00:03:53.870> are<00:03:54.080> a<00:03:54.110> lot<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.410> talk<00:03:54.560> about<00:03:54.890> for<00:03:55.160> one<00:03:55.400> it

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
there are a lot to talk about for one it

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.640 
there are a lot to talk about for one it
does<00:03:55.820> have<00:03:56.120> radar-guided<00:03:56.660> cruise<00:03:56.989> control

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
does have radar-guided cruise control

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.920 
does have radar-guided cruise control
it's<00:03:58.130> very<00:03:58.520> similar<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.330> one<00:03:59.480> we<00:03:59.630> have<00:03:59.780> on

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
it's very similar to the one we have on

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.509 
it's very similar to the one we have on
the<00:04:00.049> Audi<00:04:00.200> very<00:04:00.560> similar<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.130> one<00:04:01.250> we<00:04:01.340> had

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
the Audi very similar to the one we had

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.820 
the Audi very similar to the one we had
on<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.850> Ford<00:04:02.150> Fusion<00:04:02.500> basically<00:04:03.500> there<00:04:03.650> is<00:04:03.680> a

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
on the Ford Fusion basically there is a

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.800 
on the Ford Fusion basically there is a
radar<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.280> picks<00:04:04.640> up<00:04:04.820> any<00:04:05.060> objects<00:04:05.630> but<00:04:05.720> it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
radar that picks up any objects but it

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.840 
radar that picks up any objects but it
is<00:04:05.900> in<00:04:06.019> front<00:04:06.320> of<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.500> car<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:07.010> basically<00:04:07.700> you

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
is in front of the car so basically you

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.880 
is in front of the car so basically you
can<00:04:07.970> hook<00:04:08.150> up<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:08.510> car<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.530> will<00:04:09.680> follow

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
can hook up to a car and it will follow

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.580 
can hook up to a car and it will follow
a<00:04:10.070> set<00:04:10.459> distance<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.209> set<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:12.320> set

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
a set distance that you set and a set

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.320 
a set distance that you set and a set
speed<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.250> won't<00:04:13.400> go<00:04:13.580> above<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:14.000> speed

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
speed and it won't go above that speed

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.539 
speed and it won't go above that speed
very<00:04:14.870> similar<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:15.440> that<00:04:15.590> car<00:04:15.799> accelerates<00:04:16.370> you

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
very similar so that car accelerates you

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.250 
very similar so that car accelerates you
accelerate<00:04:16.910> if<00:04:17.209> that<00:04:17.390> car<00:04:17.600> breaks<00:04:17.900> when<00:04:18.140> you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
accelerate if that car breaks when you

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.590 
accelerate if that car breaks when you
brakes<00:04:18.590> it's<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.979> very<00:04:19.250> simple<00:04:19.549> idea<00:04:19.760> now<00:04:20.390> this

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
brakes it's a very simple idea now this

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.930 
brakes it's a very simple idea now this
one<00:04:20.810> does<00:04:21.109> have<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.769> blind<00:04:22.160> spot<00:04:22.310> monitoring

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
one does have a blind spot monitoring

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.640 
one does have a blind spot monitoring
system<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.479> is<00:04:23.690> a<00:04:23.900> passive<00:04:24.169> system

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
system it is a passive system

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.890 
system it is a passive system
unfortunately<00:04:25.520> not<00:04:25.700> like<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.180> Ford<00:04:26.450> Fusion<00:04:26.630> I

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
unfortunately not like the Ford Fusion I

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.480 
unfortunately not like the Ford Fusion I
will<00:04:27.050> actually<00:04:27.470> torque<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.950> steering<00:04:28.310> wheel

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
will actually torque the steering wheel

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.520 
will actually torque the steering wheel
this<00:04:29.030> one<00:04:29.240> will<00:04:29.450> just<00:04:29.479> light<00:04:29.960> up<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.350> make<00:04:30.500> a

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
this one will just light up and make a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.250 
this one will just light up and make a
little<00:04:30.740> noise<00:04:30.979> if<00:04:31.370> there<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:31.850> someone<00:04:32.720> on<00:04:32.960> that

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
little noise if there is someone on that

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.620 
little noise if there is someone on that
side<00:04:33.740> or<00:04:33.979> that<00:04:34.190> side<00:04:34.250> of<00:04:34.700> your<00:04:34.850> car<00:04:35.150> if<00:04:35.330> you're

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
side or that side of your car if you're

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.020 
side or that side of your car if you're
indicating<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.620> go<00:04:36.740> into<00:04:37.040> that<00:04:37.190> lane<00:04:37.460> it's<00:04:37.880> a

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
indicating to go into that lane it's a

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.030 
indicating to go into that lane it's a
very<00:04:38.240> simple<00:04:38.510> system<00:04:38.990> as<00:04:39.080> well<00:04:39.229> there<00:04:39.710> are<00:04:39.830> two

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
very simple system as well there are two

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.310 
very simple system as well there are two
little<00:04:40.220> LEDs<00:04:40.729> on<00:04:41.060> side<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.750> side<00:04:42.110> view

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
little LEDs on side the side view

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.050 
little LEDs on side the side view
mirrors<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.710> light<00:04:42.950> up<00:04:43.130> if<00:04:43.340> there<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.700> car

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
mirrors that light up if there is a car

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.210 
mirrors that light up if there is a car
and<00:04:44.270> if<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.110> indicate<00:04:45.680> what<00:04:45.710> you're<00:04:45.950> going<00:04:46.160> to

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
and if you indicate what you're going to

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.880 
and if you indicate what you're going to
turn<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.760> way<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.540> will<00:04:47.720> actually<00:04:47.960> make<00:04:48.680> a

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
turn that way it will actually make a

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.370 
turn that way it will actually make a
little<00:04:49.190> beep<00:04:49.669> noise<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.540> last<00:04:50.810> technology<00:04:51.169> I

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
little beep noise the last technology I

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.290 
little beep noise the last technology I
want<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:51.620> talk<00:04:51.770> about<00:04:51.950> is<00:04:52.310> cross<00:04:52.700> traffic

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
want to talk about is cross traffic

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.690 
want to talk about is cross traffic
monitoring<00:04:53.750> on<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.350> back<00:04:54.530> camera<00:04:55.130> basically

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
monitoring on the back camera basically

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.120 
monitoring on the back camera basically
this<00:04:56.180> car<00:04:56.390> has<00:04:56.570> no<00:04:56.870> certs<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.350> parking<00:04:57.770> sensor

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
this car has no certs a parking sensor

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.640 
this car has no certs a parking sensor
all<00:04:58.340> does<00:04:58.550> have<00:04:58.760> is<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.210> backup<00:04:59.750> camera<00:05:00.229> which

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
all does have is a backup camera which

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.530 
all does have is a backup camera which
gives<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:01.040> an<00:05:01.130> image<00:05:01.340> of<00:05:01.640> what's<00:05:01.940> behind<00:05:02.120> you

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
gives you an image of what's behind you

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.420 
gives you an image of what's behind you
now<00:05:02.960> basically<00:05:03.229> there<00:05:03.470> are<00:05:03.560> two<00:05:03.830> sensors<00:05:04.250> on

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
now basically there are two sensors on

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.140 
now basically there are two sensors on
the<00:05:04.669> back

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
the back

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.000

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
number of this car it will tell you if

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.740 
number of this car it will tell you if
there's<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.250> car<00:05:07.520> about<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:07.880> t-bone<00:05:08.330> you<00:05:08.510> in

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
there's a car about the t-bone you in

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.380 
there's a car about the t-bone you in
terms<00:05:09.290> of<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.620> parking<00:05:10.040> lot<00:05:10.100> situation<00:05:11.000> they

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
terms of a parking lot situation they

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.240 
terms of a parking lot situation they
won't<00:05:11.630> apply<00:05:11.870> brakes<00:05:12.290> for<00:05:12.590> you<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:12.890> all<00:05:13.070> will

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
won't apply brakes for you it all will

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.730 
won't apply brakes for you it all will
do<00:05:13.460> actually<00:05:14.150> just<00:05:14.180> make<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.660> noise<00:05:14.930> if<00:05:15.230> there

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
do actually just make a noise if there

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.140 
do actually just make a noise if there
is<00:05:15.920> a<00:05:15.950> car<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.550> I'll<00:05:16.640> give<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:17.000> little

have<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.280> sky<00:05:22.550> active<00:05:22.850> technology<00:05:23.120> by<00:05:24.020> Mazda

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
have the sky active technology by Mazda

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.770 
have the sky active technology by Mazda
now<00:05:24.680> what<00:05:24.890> SKYACTIV<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.640> is<00:05:25.850> basically<00:05:26.600> an

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
now what SKYACTIV is is basically an

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.450 
now what SKYACTIV is is basically an
engine<00:05:27.170> but<00:05:27.320> has<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.770> higher<00:05:28.100> compression

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
engine but has a higher compression

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.240 
engine but has a higher compression
ratio<00:05:29.300> than<00:05:29.960> normal<00:05:30.350> standard<00:05:30.710> cars<00:05:30.980> this<00:05:31.190> car

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
ratio than normal standard cars this car

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.190 
ratio than normal standard cars this car
has<00:05:31.550> eight<00:05:31.790> thirteen<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.540> one<00:05:32.840> compression

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
has eight thirteen to one compression

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.770 
has eight thirteen to one compression
ratio<00:05:33.800> which<00:05:34.340> is<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.640> same<00:05:34.850> as<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.240> Formula<00:05:35.750> One

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
ratio which is the same as a Formula One

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.660 
ratio which is the same as a Formula One
car<00:05:35.960> does<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.620> go<00:05:36.710> like<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.890> Formula<00:05:37.280> One<00:05:37.310> car

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
car does it go like a Formula One car

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.850 
car does it go like a Formula One car
no<00:05:38.030> but<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.750> doesn't<00:05:39.170> mean<00:05:39.290> that<00:05:39.320> it<00:05:39.800> will

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
no but it doesn't mean that it will

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.150 
no but it doesn't mean that it will
deliver<00:05:40.220> more<00:05:40.610> bang<00:05:40.970> to<00:05:41.330> every<00:05:41.930> fuel<00:05:42.860> ounce

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
deliver more bang to every fuel ounce

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.700 
deliver more bang to every fuel ounce
that<00:05:43.490> it<00:05:43.640> burns<00:05:43.940> now<00:05:44.720> the<00:05:44.780> only<00:05:45.110> problem<00:05:45.410> -

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
that it burns now the only problem -

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.010 
that it burns now the only problem -
that<00:05:45.740> is<00:05:46.190> pretty<00:05:46.700> detonation<00:05:47.390> on<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.840> high

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
that is pretty detonation on that high

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.680 
that is pretty detonation on that high
compression<00:05:48.620> what<00:05:48.860> Mazda<00:05:49.250> does<00:05:49.520> is<00:05:49.850> they

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
compression what Mazda does is they

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.410 
compression what Mazda does is they
drill<00:05:51.290> a<00:05:51.320> hole<00:05:51.650> into<00:05:51.920> the<00:05:52.250> cylinder<00:05:52.730> that<00:05:53.270> will

drill a hole into the cylinder that will

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.300 
drill a hole into the cylinder that will
sort<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.720> relieve<00:05:54.050> some<00:05:54.560> of<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.710> pressure<00:05:54.980> and
