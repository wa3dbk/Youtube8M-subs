it's<00:00:09.099> been<00:00:09.280> tough<00:00:09.490> to<00:00:09.639> get<00:00:09.759> out<00:00:09.909> lately<00:00:11.190> so

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
it's been tough to get out lately so

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.770 
it's been tough to get out lately so
like<00:00:12.579> I<00:00:12.699> said<00:00:12.879> in<00:00:12.999> the<00:00:13.059> review<00:00:13.389> if<00:00:13.480> you<00:00:13.509> haven't

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
like I said in the review if you haven't

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.760 
like I said in the review if you haven't
seen<00:00:13.900> the<00:00:13.989> tabletop<00:00:14.530> this<00:00:14.709> is<00:00:14.860> a<00:00:15.299> nice<00:00:16.299> little

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
seen the tabletop this is a nice little

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.720 
seen the tabletop this is a nice little
22<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.970> know<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:20.350> very<00:00:20.620> big<00:00:20.800> at<00:00:20.920> all<00:00:21.040> and<00:00:21.490> I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
22 you know not very big at all and I

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.570 
22 you know not very big at all and I
think<00:00:21.970> it's<00:00:22.090> a<00:00:22.210> very<00:00:22.360> good<00:00:22.570> option<00:00:22.750> for<00:00:22.960> a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
think it's a very good option for a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.520 
think it's a very good option for a
concealed<00:00:24.580> carry<00:00:24.790> if<00:00:25.030> your<00:00:25.540> recoil<00:00:25.900> sensitive

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
concealed carry if your recoil sensitive

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.920 
concealed carry if your recoil sensitive
like<00:00:26.830> some<00:00:27.039> people<00:00:27.310> are<00:00:27.460> you<00:00:28.300> can't<00:00:28.510> handle

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
like some people are you can't handle

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.920 
like some people are you can't handle
different<00:00:29.590> calibers<00:00:30.039> in<00:00:30.700> the<00:00:31.150> full-size<00:00:31.539> and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
different calibers in the full-size and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.619 
different calibers in the full-size and
all<00:00:32.589> those<00:00:32.829> most<00:00:33.489> people<00:00:33.820> will<00:00:33.909> say<00:00:33.940> 22<00:00:34.539> is<00:00:34.600> a

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
all those most people will say 22 is a

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.939 
all those most people will say 22 is a
bad<00:00:34.839> choice<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:36.070> your<00:00:36.309> recoil<00:00:36.699> sensitive<00:00:37.329> to

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
bad choice if your recoil sensitive to

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.479 
bad choice if your recoil sensitive to
other<00:00:38.949> calibers<00:00:39.510> 22<00:00:40.510> might<00:00:40.749> be<00:00:41.069> the<00:00:42.069> only<00:00:42.190> way

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
other calibers 22 might be the only way

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.919 
other calibers 22 might be the only way
for<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:42.789> to<00:00:42.850> go<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:44.309> know<00:00:45.629> 22<00:00:46.629> is<00:00:46.749> better

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
for you to go and you know 22 is better

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.340 
for you to go and you know 22 is better
than<00:00:47.170> nothing<00:00:47.350> so<00:00:48.359> if<00:00:49.359> you<00:00:49.510> remember<00:00:49.899> from<00:00:50.079> the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
than nothing so if you remember from the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.739 
than nothing so if you remember from the
video<00:00:50.620> I<00:00:50.679> did<00:00:50.979> do<00:00:51.460> some<00:00:51.670> modifications<00:00:52.479> to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749

this pistol it is clear right now I I

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.969 
this pistol it is clear right now I I
got<00:00:56.469> in<00:00:56.620> here<00:00:56.949> and<00:00:58.649> did<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.769> safety

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
got in here and did the safety

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.770 
got in here and did the safety
modifications<00:01:00.309> I'll<00:01:00.969> post<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.329> link<00:01:01.359> to<00:01:01.600> that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
modifications I'll post a link to that

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.510 
modifications I'll post a link to that
up<00:01:02.159> in<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.249> corner<00:01:03.609> and<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.870> I<00:01:05.170> can<00:01:05.410> now<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:06.280> can

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
up in the corner and so I can now I can

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.890 
up in the corner and so I can now I can
take<00:01:06.730> the<00:01:06.880> magazine<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.570> out<00:01:07.690> without

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
take the magazine in and out without

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.310 
take the magazine in and out without
having<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.560> put<00:01:08.710> it<00:01:08.800> on<00:01:08.920> safe<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:10.450> can<00:01:10.990> basically

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
having to put it on safe I can basically

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.790 
having to put it on safe I can basically
use<00:01:11.800> it<00:01:11.830> like<00:01:12.100> any<00:01:12.370> other<00:01:12.460> gun<00:01:12.850> out<00:01:13.120> there<00:01:13.800> this

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
use it like any other gun out there this

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.190 
use it like any other gun out there this
gun<00:01:15.040> comes<00:01:15.310> with<00:01:15.400> some<00:01:15.700> ridiculous<00:01:16.200> safety

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
gun comes with some ridiculous safety

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.070 
gun comes with some ridiculous safety
features<00:01:17.590> but<00:01:17.920> it<00:01:18.790> comes<00:01:19.120> from<00:01:19.240> California<00:01:19.510> so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
features but it comes from California so

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.340 
features but it comes from California so
that's<00:01:20.260> just<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.470> way<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:21.480> but<00:01:22.480> like<00:01:22.810> you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
that's just the way it is but like you

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.250 
that's just the way it is but like you
know<00:01:23.380> I'm<00:01:24.040> absurd<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:24.730> and<00:01:24.910> I<00:01:25.420> love<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:25.960> have<00:01:26.140> it

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
know I'm absurd it and I love to have it

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.920 
know I'm absurd it and I love to have it
as<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.410> backup<00:01:26.620> option<00:01:26.980> like<00:01:27.970> over<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.630> past

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
as a backup option like over this past

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.260 
as a backup option like over this past
weekend<00:01:29.320> I<00:01:29.410> was<00:01:29.470> doing<00:01:29.650> some<00:01:29.800> yard<00:01:29.830> work

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
weekend I was doing some yard work

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.680 
weekend I was doing some yard work
couldn't<00:01:31.270> really<00:01:31.830> handle<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.100> full<00:01:33.280> size<00:01:33.690> gun

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
couldn't really handle the full size gun

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.510 
couldn't really handle the full size gun
just<00:01:35.440> because<00:01:35.650> I<00:01:35.710> was<00:01:35.800> bending<00:01:36.070> over<00:01:36.220> and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
just because I was bending over and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.560 
just because I was bending over and
doing<00:01:36.700> all<00:01:36.760> kinds<00:01:36.790> of<00:01:37.060> stuff<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.360> I<00:01:37.480> was

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
doing all kinds of stuff and I was

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.720 
doing all kinds of stuff and I was
having<00:01:38.110> trouble<00:01:38.200> keeping<00:01:38.470> it<00:01:38.680> concealed<00:01:39.040> so<00:01:39.670> I

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
having trouble keeping it concealed so I

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.550 
having trouble keeping it concealed so I
just<00:01:39.880> grabbed<00:01:40.120> this<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.720> put<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.290> my<00:01:41.380> pocket

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
just grabbed this and put in my pocket

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.580 
just grabbed this and put in my pocket
in<00:01:41.980> this<00:01:42.640> little<00:01:43.060> pocket<00:01:43.690> holster<00:01:44.050> that<00:01:44.230> I<00:01:44.350> got

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
in this little pocket holster that I got

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.210 
in this little pocket holster that I got
here<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.540> then<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:46.990> was<00:01:47.110> able<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.380> have<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.070> in

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
here and then I was able to have it in

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.770 
here and then I was able to have it in
my<00:01:48.250> pocket<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:49.000> have<00:01:49.150> something<00:01:49.540> like<00:01:49.690> I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
my pocket just to have something like I

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.260 
my pocket just to have something like I
said<00:01:49.960> something<00:01:50.230> is<00:01:50.410> better<00:01:50.560> than<00:01:50.680> nothing

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
said something is better than nothing

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.100 
said something is better than nothing
and<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:53.800> know<00:01:53.920> if<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:54.130> put<00:01:54.390> ten<00:01:55.390> shots<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:56.020> a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
and you know if you put ten shots in a

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.490 
and you know if you put ten shots in a
bad<00:01:56.320> guy<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.850> fast<00:01:58.510> as<00:01:58.659> you<00:01:58.780> can<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.260> put

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
bad guy as fast as you can and you put

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.750 
bad guy as fast as you can and you put
it<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.620> know<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.890> put<00:02:00.280> them<00:02:00.370> where<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:00.610> need

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
it you know you put them where you need

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.520 
it you know you put them where you need
to<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:02.760> most<00:02:03.990> bad<00:02:04.990> guys<00:02:05.230> aren't<00:02:05.409> gonna

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530
