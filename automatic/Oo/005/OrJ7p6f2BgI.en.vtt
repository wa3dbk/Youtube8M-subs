to<00:01:56.579> try<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.820> thing<00:01:57.409> it's<00:01:58.409> about<00:01:58.560> 5<00:01:59.040> degrees

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to try this thing it's about 5 degrees

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.789 
to try this thing it's about 5 degrees
today<00:01:59.880> maybe<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.229> bit<00:02:01.350> cooler<00:02:01.560> than

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
today maybe a little bit cooler than

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.819 
today maybe a little bit cooler than
that<00:02:01.969> I'm<00:02:02.969> guessing<00:02:03.659> I'm<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that I'm guessing I'm not going to

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.170 
that I'm guessing I'm not going to
bother<00:02:04.950> giving<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.640> an<00:02:05.729> actual<00:02:05.969> weather

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
bother giving you an actual weather

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.609 
bother giving you an actual weather
report<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.439> guess

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
report because they just guess

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.040 
report because they just guess
now<00:02:07.799> -

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
now -

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.570 
now -
so<00:02:09.350> I'm<00:02:09.410> gonna<00:02:09.530> guess<00:02:09.770> that's<00:02:09.950> five<00:02:10.190> degrees

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
so I'm gonna guess that's five degrees

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.920 
so I'm gonna guess that's five degrees
