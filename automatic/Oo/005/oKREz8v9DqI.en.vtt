our<00:00:27.510> speed<00:00:27.810> bag<00:00:27.990> bladders<00:00:28.439> are<00:00:28.650> latex<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
our speed bag bladders are latex and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.960 
our speed bag bladders are latex and
latex<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> slightly<00:00:31.470> porous<00:00:31.920> material<00:00:32.430> so

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
latex is a slightly porous material so

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.120 
latex is a slightly porous material so
your<00:00:33.450> speed<00:00:33.720> bag<00:00:33.899> bladder<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.500> actually

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
your speed bag bladder will actually

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160 
your speed bag bladder will actually
lose<00:00:35.370> air<00:00:35.760> over<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> period<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> couple<00:00:36.780> weeks

lose air over a period of a couple weeks

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.350 
lose air over a period of a couple weeks
but<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.950> shouldn't<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.430> having<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.820> refill<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
but you shouldn't be having to refill it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.910 
but you shouldn't be having to refill it
maybe<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:40.050> once<00:00:40.320> every<00:00:40.500> two<00:00:40.649> weeks<00:00:40.829> just

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
maybe but once every two weeks just

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
maybe but once every two weeks just
adding<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.370> little<00:00:41.579> bit<00:00:41.670> air<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.480> reason

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
adding a little bit air to it the reason

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.900 
adding a little bit air to it the reason
why<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.050> use<00:00:46.079> latex<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.430> our<00:00:47.520> speed<00:00:47.730> bag

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
why we use latex for our speed bag

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.110 
why we use latex for our speed bag
bladders<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.820> gives<00:00:51.000> us

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
bladders is that is that that gives us

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.060 
bladders is that is that that gives us
the<00:00:51.239> fastest<00:00:51.719> rebound<00:00:52.170> off<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.440> striking

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the fastest rebound off the striking

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:03.880 
the fastest rebound off the striking
surface

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.040 

another<00:01:04.610> thing<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:04.970> remember<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.690> size<00:01:05.930> of

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
another thing to remember is the size of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.450 
another thing to remember is the size of
the<00:01:06.140> speed<00:01:06.350> bag<00:01:06.560> bladder<00:01:06.890> doesn't<00:01:07.310> really

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
the speed bag bladder doesn't really

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.730 
the speed bag bladder doesn't really
matter<00:01:07.730> since<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.510> is<00:01:08.630> latex<00:01:09.080> it'll<00:01:09.470> stretch

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
matter since it is latex it'll stretch

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.340 
matter since it is latex it'll stretch
to<00:01:10.070> whatever<00:01:10.850> material<00:01:11.840> you're<00:01:11.990> putting<00:01:12.260> it

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
to whatever material you're putting it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.260 
to whatever material you're putting it
inside<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:12.740> when<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.190> blow<00:01:13.370> it<00:01:13.490> up<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:14.090> will

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
inside of when you blow it up this will

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.520 
inside of when you blow it up this will
actually<00:01:14.450> blow<00:01:14.780> up<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.110> size<00:01:15.320> of<00:01:15.440> a

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
actually blow up to the size of a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.750 
actually blow up to the size of a
basketball<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.250> even<00:01:16.460> though<00:01:16.520> it's<00:01:16.670> the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
basketball so even though it's the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.460 
basketball so even though it's the
smallest<00:01:17.180> speed<00:01:17.420> bag<00:01:17.630> bladder<00:01:17.900> I'm<00:01:18.140> able<00:01:18.410> to

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
smallest speed bag bladder I'm able to

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.050 
smallest speed bag bladder I'm able to
put<00:01:18.650> it<00:01:18.740> inside<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.250> large<00:01:19.520> speed<00:01:19.820> bag

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
put it inside of this large speed bag

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:28.960 
put it inside of this large speed bag
with<00:01:20.330> no<00:01:20.360> problem<00:01:27.729> all<00:01:28.729> right<00:01:28.790> you're

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
with no problem all right you're

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.400 
with no problem all right you're
basically<00:01:29.360> turning<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.780> bag<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:29.990> little<00:01:30.290> bit

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
basically turning the bag a little bit

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.469

inside<00:01:30.860> out<00:01:31.040> about<00:01:31.250> half<00:01:31.460> way<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.390> you

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
inside out about half way so that you

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.700 
inside out about half way so that you
can<00:01:32.510> get<00:01:33.290> down<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.710> valve<00:01:33.979> stem

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.890 

once<00:01:39.710> you've<00:01:39.890> expose<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.670> valve<00:01:40.880> stem<00:01:41.180> that's

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
once you've expose the valve stem that's

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.390 
once you've expose the valve stem that's
where<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.229> needlenose<00:01:42.530> pliers<00:01:42.950> are<00:01:43.220> going<00:01:43.340> to

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
where the needlenose pliers are going to

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.770 
where the needlenose pliers are going to
come<00:01:43.550> in<00:01:43.670> play<00:01:43.850> sometimes<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.390> can<00:01:44.509> just<00:01:44.540> get

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
come in play sometimes you can just get

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.050 
come in play sometimes you can just get
it<00:01:44.840> with<00:01:44.960> your<00:01:45.020> fingers<00:01:45.440> you<00:01:46.250> can<00:01:46.400> actually

do<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:06.009> just<00:02:07.009> an<00:02:07.460> easy<00:02:07.640> way<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.909> get<00:02:08.090> them<00:02:08.239> in

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
do that just an easy way to get them in

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.820 
do that just an easy way to get them in
and<00:02:08.479> out<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:08.780> it'll<00:02:08.929> definitely<00:02:09.049> stay<00:02:09.560> when

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
and out and it'll definitely stay when

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.710 
and out and it'll definitely stay when
you<00:02:09.920> do<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.610> way<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.120> I'm<00:02:11.330> doing<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.600> as

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
you do it the way that I'm doing it as

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.900 
you do it the way that I'm doing it as
well<00:02:11.900> but<00:02:12.049> you're<00:02:12.530> taking<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> valve<00:02:13.519> and

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
well but you're taking the valve and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.789 
well but you're taking the valve and
you're<00:02:14.120> sticking<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.390> through<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.630> hole<00:02:14.799> and

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
you're sticking it through the hole and

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.979 
you're sticking it through the hole and
then<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:16.670> reach<00:02:16.880> through<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.180> bottom<00:02:17.450> side<00:02:17.660> you

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
then I reach through the bottom side you

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.750 
then I reach through the bottom side you
can<00:02:18.470> see<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.680> valve<00:02:18.890> stem<00:02:19.190> there<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.580> I'm

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
can see the valve stem there and I'm

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.420 
can see the valve stem there and I'm
grabbing<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.769> I'm<00:02:21.769> holding<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.280> with<00:02:22.310> my

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
grabbing it I'm holding it with my

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.830 
grabbing it I'm holding it with my
fingers<00:02:22.549> and<00:02:22.940> then<00:02:23.030> pulling<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.390> bag<00:02:23.570> against

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
fingers and then pulling the bag against

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.140 
fingers and then pulling the bag against
back<00:02:24.200> inside<00:02:24.560> out<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.549> basically<00:02:25.940> all

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
back inside out and then basically all

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.380 
back inside out and then basically all
you're<00:02:26.299> doing<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:27.410> real<00:02:27.830> acing<00:02:28.250> back<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.239> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
you're doing is real acing back up the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:40.270 
you're doing is real acing back up the
speed<00:02:29.630> bag<00:02:31.600> pulling<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.720> tight<00:02:32.900> as<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.320> go

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.440 

be<00:02:41.280> sure<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.730> shoe<00:02:41.880> strings<00:02:42.180> are<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> same

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
be sure the shoe strings are the same

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.870 
be sure the shoe strings are the same
length<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.830> then<00:02:43.980> we<00:02:44.070> get<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.400> top<00:02:44.580> we

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
length so then we get to the top we

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:54.590 
length so then we get to the top we
haven't<00:02:45.360> got<00:02:45.690> enough<00:02:45.720> stuff<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.110> work<00:02:46.380> with

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.070 

I<00:02:55.100> just<00:02:56.100> use<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> little<00:02:56.460> X<00:02:56.790> pattern<00:02:57.060> when<00:02:57.960> I'm

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
I just use a little X pattern when I'm

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.640 
I just use a little X pattern when I'm
lacing<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.530> up<00:02:59.420> where<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.450> put<00:03:00.810> an<00:03:00.900> X<00:03:01.050> on<00:03:01.170> top<00:03:01.410> and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
lacing it up where I put an X on top and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.740 
lacing it up where I put an X on top and
then<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.800> next<00:03:02.010> down<00:03:02.160> below<00:03:02.460> but<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.480> really
