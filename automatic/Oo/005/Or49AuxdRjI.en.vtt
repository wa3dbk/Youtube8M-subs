00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.710 
I really like about teaching these kinds
of<00:01:09.560> lessons<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.940> this<00:01:11.179> information

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
of lessons is that the this information

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.109 
of lessons is that the this information
was<00:01:11.840> not<00:01:11.990> really<00:01:12.259> available<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.740> me<00:01:13.039> when<00:01:13.310> I

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
was not really available to me when I

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.279 
was not really available to me when I
first<00:01:14.360> started<00:01:14.479> trying<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:14.960> learn<00:01:15.050> these

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
first started trying to learn these

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:16.899 
first started trying to learn these
tunes<00:01:15.560> what<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> mean<00:01:16.069> by<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:16.250> is<00:01:16.550> if<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:16.789> go

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
tunes what I mean by that is if you go

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.520 
tunes what I mean by that is if you go
when<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.149> find<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.509> song<00:01:17.750> book<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:18.170> has<00:01:18.289> ain't
