00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:12.240
 and it's the little wolf I find you 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.769
 today for a new parliament 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.269
 guy as his name indicated 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.590
 here we will talk - degas and everything 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.940
 especially hot jo I'm just doing 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.890
 a little reminder as it's the second 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.060
 editing only if you are never 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.650
 not fall on the first one you do not know 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.539
 not what is this series of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.070
 videos that I 'm doing in this video 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.150
 so we'll talk manga but more 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.859
 particularly hot 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 what is the shÃ´jo the show is a 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.800
 particular manga style for the simple 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.530
 and good reason that it is intended more 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.850
 especially a female audience 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.980
 since he speaks simply of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.420
 romance of love story and that's it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.879
 people say that novel story 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.910
 of love that corresponds more to a style 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.129
 feminine good I will not linger 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.649
 on the subject during these videos I have 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.320
 decided to present you a series a 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.520
 manga title that I liked a lot 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.449
 I want to share with you and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.340
 make you discover 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.600
 here it is simple these videos do not 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.980
 will not last long since I'm taking 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.699
 just the time to introduce the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 title in question 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.229
 the author the edition to give you a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.700
 brief summary back cover a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.000
 little better my way 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.320
 and my opinion on the matter besides 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.640
 today for the occasion I do not know 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.479
 if you saw I made the cut 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.890
 of guyana ok I'm going out unfortunately this 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.299
 is not a manga with me since I 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.340
 am at my parents and not at home 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.530
 me and so I do not have my library 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.759
 simply fix 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.259
 so I can not introduce them to you 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.460
 by voice I will try anyway 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.810
 to put you pictures and plants 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.430
 during this video for you 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 can see imagine a little bit 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.360
 the appearance of the manga if you ever 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.500
 look in bookstores or elsewhere I 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
 you find today so for you 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.829
 present the manga go king jo a life of 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.659
 neighborhood of hay al hawa which was therefore 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.700
 drawn by aya zawacki for those who do not 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.530
 do not know it and the mangaka that has 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.659
 also does the nana series which is 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.130
 much more well known and that everyone 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.500
 usually knows when we speak shoujo 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.630
 we speak nana here 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.610
 in general that's it here at yazawa 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.290
 did not just do nana she also 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.360
 does gotta go king jo is everything everything 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.729
 paradiski what is the result elsewhere 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.270
 brief cooking show cooking show 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.250
 what is it talking about 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.750
 hockenjos beyond the history of milk aco 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.000
 and at least who is a couple 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.800
 of childhood friends who always have everything 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.090
 lived together who grew up together 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.190
 by the simple fact that they are neighbors 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.470
 we discover mikako and all in the soft 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.850
 in a slightly artistic universe 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.680
 since they are all both in 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.080
 an artistic school finally that's it 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.350
 in bonus one I tell you like that does 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.420
 obviously goudjo that also speaks romance 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.700
 since it's a shojo so you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 doubt that mikako and all 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.690
 words may go finally you see 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.540
 what a neighborhood life that speaks of 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.730
 this idyll the of his characters of 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.770
 their entourage of their lives in high school 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.959
 their adventure all that all this is a 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.300
 other old style at the level of 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.250
 drawings but it is simply super 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.720
 this manga really and I advise you 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.920
 very strongly if you like shojo 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.360
 you must not miss out 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.870
 cooking show because it's really a 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.290
 super manga and everything so for the little 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.910
 resume 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.500
 see little summary very small summary 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.810
 I give you now very quickly 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.430
 my opinion on the subject since I 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.989
 repeat I have no intention of 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.650
 you spoil the manga otherwise it does not 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.150
 would be useless at all so why 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.290
 I liked go kidjo and beat for the simple 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.000
 and good reason that I got everything 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.100
 simply attached to the characters of this 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.140
 book of this book of this manga 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.660
 I loved the character of 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.209
 tsutomu more than that of mika quo because 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.910
 that mika what's a bit you see it's 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.590
 a little bit the plague the plague it's not 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.459
 really a plague but let's say that she 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.290
 not sure what she wants in the 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.790
 seen in life she knows where she goes by 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.930
 against that we can not blame her 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.970
 know where she's going but she's 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.739
 capricious and she used to have 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.910
 always everything for her or pretty much 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.290
 anyway she's used to having everything 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.420
 in the long run she always there now 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.459
 and seeing that growing up 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.200
 beat or tommy everyone can 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.570
 take a little flight sahala 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.989
 moussa this is it's a bit bothering her 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.420
 and suddenly she will have a character and 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.799
 a picture a little 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.510
 not great anyway I do not have too much 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.710
 Too much too much, but I understand 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.120
 absolutely she is 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.280
 this character is also what 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.630
 does his character but I prefer everything 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.940
 just tsutomu because everything to the must 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.170
 is an already very handsome boy who has 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.580
 a lot of charisma that attracts the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.400
 people who very sociable you see jean 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.870
 he is a magnet to an agent he always has 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.980
 world around him and if he always 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.630
 of the world around him it's because 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.160
 he's a great guy he's very good 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.080
 nice he is very caring 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.090
 short for me what makes no jo 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.380
 it's all at the end of the relationship that everything 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.490
 tight self retaining with mikako 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.970
 the attention that gives it all that all 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.200
 that to see 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.820
 so that's one of the reasons why 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.290
 I really liked this manga for 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.940
 characters there is not just everything 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.190
 slack but and mikako but there is also 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.930
 all around them that has a character 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.160
 a little special every time there is 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.480
 always things to discover 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.250
 they will do things more or less 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.680
 interesting finally short it's really a 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.420
 special universe that I appreciate everything 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.740
 simply at the level of 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.910
 the intrigued man well here's the plot that 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.780
 do not break three legs to a duck but 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.580
 at the same time that's what I like 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.280
 there was a romance this is what 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.020
 I ask there is an entourage that has 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.090
 also a life and so he lives 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.250
 also adventures and that's what 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.110
 I also ask so naughty jo it's 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.620
 simplicity but simplicity very 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.680
 well done 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.750
 the design is pretty good me at all 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.220
 case I like the design I know who 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.320
 poses problem to some people but 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.940
 in any case here are the drawings are 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.710
 easily that that they are different from 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.270
 those nahla it's voluntary I think 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.070
 or so it is that Syria is well 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.660
 older than nana I do not know 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.620
 not so I like drawings I like 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.100
 the intrigued I really like them 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.900
 characters 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.460
 again I repeat it is this 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.860
 which makes for me a very good manga all 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.900
 simply 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.400
 so if you liked nana if you have 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.960
 loved paradiski and if you like the 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.250
 romance the shoujo all that I you 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.650
 simply advise the irg 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.300
 hawking jo in addition it is presented under 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.050
 seven volumes it's not huge this is 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.310
 not excessive 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.780
 I'm sure if you're looking good 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.890

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.050

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.640
 also an animated animate a design 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.220
 it's really very special 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.020
 old and he's a little bit different 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.550
 two 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.710
 manga anyway I prefer the 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.970
 manga but hey it's for me if ever

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.680
 did not like mangas at all and they 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.180
 have simply adhere to guangzhou 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.690

 pleasure the last time when a lot

 manga titles for the most part I
