against<00:01:06.869> trout<00:01:07.110> was<00:01:07.409> due<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> his<00:01:08.670> last

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
against trout was due the his last

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
against trout was due the his last
performance<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.560> venue<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:10.950> this

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
performance and just a venue for this

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
performance and just a venue for this
fight<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.790> didn't<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.150> he<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.869> enough

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
fight I didn't think he would do enough

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.340 
fight I didn't think he would do enough
or<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> fight<00:01:14.130> pc<00:01:14.490> close<00:01:15.270> too<00:01:15.750> close<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
or if the fight pc close too close I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
or if the fight pc close too close I
think<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.680> he<00:01:16.799> would<00:01:16.920> get<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.130> decision<00:01:17.790> if

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
think that he would get the decision if

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.960 
think that he would get the decision if
this<00:01:18.090> fight<00:01:18.330> was<00:01:18.479> held<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.310> Las<00:01:20.310> Vegas<00:01:20.820> in

in<00:07:01.320> a<00:07:01.440> hard<00:07:01.680> sport<00:07:02.010> like<00:07:02.280> boxing<00:07:03.140> and<00:07:04.140> I<00:07:04.230> felt

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
in a hard sport like boxing and I felt

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.940 
in a hard sport like boxing and I felt
that<00:07:04.740> he<00:07:04.890> was<00:07:04.920> big<00:07:05.610> underachiever<00:07:06.590> and<00:07:07.590> in<00:07:07.800> the

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:07.950 
that he was big underachiever and in the
