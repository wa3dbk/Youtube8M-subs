00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hello again Monday today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.080
 again a video on the asus vivo tab note 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.530
 8th 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:20.369
 you can see it today 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:22.830
 here with camera or case it is today 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.560
 arrived and of course I have it 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.449
 I'll also try it directly 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.099
 now only on the case itself 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.670
 refer so that worked first briefly 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.670
 to the side 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:39.340
 the case itself 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:42.550
 you can see it and it's good here 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 Flight case up here with a small one 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:51.940
 metal tiles and here on the side 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.809
 side edge corresponding magnets so that 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.960
 also the complete case closes ball 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:03.300
 In the end, of course , you can do it too 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.320
 set up accordingly, etc 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.119
 like that on a flight today 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.660
 is common 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.090
 the floor is not made of cardboard it is a 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.140
 Other material is could be imitation leather 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.180
 his 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.450
 I studied up quickly thawed 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.399
 that leaves a bit of dust 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.890
 display but i think that will be im 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.240
 keep changing the time as I said 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.190
 I got it today 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.550
 otherwise it makes for a complete 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.710
 valent impression of the back is too 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.980
 in my opinion, mass and some 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:41.250
 usually better 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.440
 otherwise it is made of a handy 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.940
 material on the back and you see 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:51.390
 Well that's still a good thing to talk about 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.100
 looks right here on the specially for 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.650
 the speakers and institutions for 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.120
 speakers, we also see the light 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.920
 Of course , it fits perfectly here in protection 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.800
 it still for the camera and the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.270
 corresponding recess here on the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.480
 side for the buttons or on the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.640
 other side is then just the case 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.080
 this is but then louder 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.760
 windows button on the other side 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.860
 which can reduce or operate 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.680
 I do not show my kathrin either 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.070
 just a moment or so you can see 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:28.800
 also here on the lower side suitable 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:33.690
 appropriate slot for the pen in 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:37.710
 the corresponding pen of the wetab note 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.100
 8 Now I want to say where can you do that 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:51.420
 whole then just that can be 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:53.489
 recordings tablet and left 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:01.130
 snap in and it fits my opinion 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:01.130
 after so far firm and good in it 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.000
 and we can rule out 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.770
 it feels good in the hand 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.060
 the thing is coming for the transport now 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.750
 finally take with you no fear 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.550
 before that tempi breaks like 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.310
 said here on the side we see the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.170
 corresponding conclusions for the rangers 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.730
 for the buttons so that everything else 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.170
 use white and that easily 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.670
 on the other side, that's the whole thing 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.430
 tight and on the back we find 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.690
 perfect fit 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.810
 it would be able to see it here 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.810
 here 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:47.840
 so perfectly fits the slot here 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:52.480
 the top at the top corner for the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.439
 speakers as well as on the lower end 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.390
 according to the slot for the 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.459
 speaker it and that will take care if 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.650
 It may not fit you now 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:07.760
 it's just the same as here below 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:09.889
 the slot for the pen lifted as well 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.150
 the corresponding recess fits exactly 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:19.070
 actually for the camera if we can 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:22.070
 open it all now fits it too 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.419
 again perfect the whole now 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.470
 set up accordingly with a 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.669
 have to touch 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.530
 tricky but also possible here 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.750
 has now placed in appropriate 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.220
 corner 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.820
 I have not tried yet 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.030
 to type on it to type or how 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.250
 maybe always one too 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.610
 Another video but I think that is 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.770
 not necessarily necessary if you have it 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.380
 think I can see so well is 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.390
 In any case, is stable 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.250
 in this situation that means it is slipping 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.520
 not away when writing or yourself 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.460
 just stay on as you see and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.160
 the other way, for example, to watch movies 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.730
 and as the whole as digital images too 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.850
 you can set that up to word 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.290
 and that fits so far 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.490
 It has to be said that it is natural 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.050
 not in quality now 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.840
 inevitably such as script 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.120
 case of ipad but it also plays 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.400
 long not in the price category 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:27.500
 I mean 16 euros or 17 euros included 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.960
 shipping costs, it is then right 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.480
 cheap but not necessarily 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.730
 very cheap processed so mine 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.350
 this is already one opinion 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.790
 decent quality that will be one now 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.430
 but only in the course of time 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.810
 notice how the whole then in the 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.830
 runtime may evolve 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.950
 then there's a little one again 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.510
 report to watch what is noticeable and 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.980
 I think that's more likely now 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.260
 because it is a windows tablet 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.090
 if you close that, it's halfway 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.980
 closed because you open it gives that 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.960
 display automatically to that means one 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.090
 still needs to go here again 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.930
 Press the display accordingly 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.350
 As for 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.610
 and if you close the whole thing then that 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.810
 unfortunately you will see here 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.980
 still is, to what closes this 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.190
 but then it does not have to 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.630
 to do by hand is a pity of mine 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.060
 opinion , that was still one 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.860
 feature was what was beautiful in the sense 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.740
 a book maybe even if you have it 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.140
 then it's time to turn on power and 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.620
 if you close it automatically 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.150
 but that's a matter of taste 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.780
 For the price I think the whole thing 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.270
 pretty good 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.400
 handy it is now here it is 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.530
 very good and very easy in the hand 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.430
 that does not really do much for the tab 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.430
 harder to 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.810
 and it really does close well as well 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.220
 you can see there is no getting over 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.150
 border or none none 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.220
 delle in here 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.020
 Let's see how it goes in the course of the 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.300
 time beats if that maybe 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.020
 also worked well at all 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.880
 to type or write 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.180
 Let's see how that behaves 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:11.160
 now here my first impression also 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:13.440
 everything ok under the video you will find then 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.330
 Also according to a product link now 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.650
 in the case of amazon, there are now 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:23.070
 at other manufacturers I have it myself 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:27.660
 the delivery time orders a page 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:29.940
 order determined after month ii early 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.460
 ordered talent has just fine 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.300
 took a long time to arrive 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.790
 I hope that all now 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:41.860
 I'm gonna pay a little bit 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:44.300
 test and then be possible 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.620
 what will happen to me soon 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:50.919
 again a few protective films 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.760
 document it again but try it 

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:53.540
 that should be it now for the first time 

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.910
 have been 

00:07:53.540 --> 00:08:00.940
 All right, I wish you a nice day 

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.940
 and is the days mainz
