00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
our barn and that way it kind of helps

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.410 
our barn and that way it kind of helps
deter<00:01:32.039> someone<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.849> backing<00:01:33.209> up<00:01:33.300> their

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
deter someone from just backing up their

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660 
deter someone from just backing up their
pickup<00:01:33.750> truck<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> helping<00:01:34.440> themselves<00:01:35.009> but

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
pickup truck and helping themselves but

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.699 
pickup truck and helping themselves but
she<00:01:35.849> wants<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> snow<00:01:36.300> falls<00:01:36.599> we<00:01:37.349> don't<00:01:37.530> keep

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
she wants the snow falls we don't keep

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:40.550 
she wants the snow falls we don't keep
any<00:01:37.830> trails<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.399> and<00:01:38.580> out<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:38.940> so<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.410> just

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
any trails up and out there so it's just

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
any trails up and out there so it's just
a<00:01:40.649> little<00:01:40.800> bit<00:01:41.009> more<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.429> a<00:01:41.520> deterrent<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.450> guess

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
a little bit more of a deterrent I guess

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.339 
a little bit more of a deterrent I guess
for<00:01:42.810> theft<00:01:47.539> once<00:01:48.539> you<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:48.899> location

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
raise them up a few inches will really

them<00:02:50.060> kind<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.330> parallel<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.020> can<00:02:51.080> stack<00:02:51.410> them

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
them kind of parallel you can stack them

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.110 
them kind of parallel you can stack them
up<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:51.920> top<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.370> as<00:02:52.670> well

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
up on top of that as well

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.300 
up on top of that as well
just<00:02:53.570> getting<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.990> separated<00:02:54.560> makes<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.980> pretty

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
just getting a separated makes a pretty

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.430 
just getting a separated makes a pretty
big<00:02:55.370> difference<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.900> played<00:03:00.140> around<00:03:00.350> with

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
big difference so played around with

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.020 
big difference so played around with
several<00:03:00.830> different<00:03:01.100> methods<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.489> stacking<00:03:01.940> my

several different methods of stacking my

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.210 
several different methods of stacking my

preferred<00:03:04.610> way<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:04.820> more<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.540> traditional

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
preferred way is more of a traditional

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.620 
preferred way is more of a traditional
style<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.650> stacking<00:03:06.950> with<00:03:07.760> cross<00:03:08.030> decking<00:03:08.540> on

style of stacking with cross decking on

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.680 
style of stacking with cross decking on
the<00:03:08.780> ends<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.260> find<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.250> pretty<00:03:11.000> quick<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.540> easy

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
the ends I find it pretty quick and easy

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.080 
the ends I find it pretty quick and easy
to<00:03:11.900> stack<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.980> cross<00:03:13.190> stacking<00:03:13.700> adds<00:03:14.000> a

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
to stack and the cross stacking adds a

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.720 
to stack and the cross stacking adds a
nice<00:03:14.239> square<00:03:14.630> edge<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.340> really<00:03:16.340> helps

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
nice square edge and really helps

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.060 
nice square edge and really helps
stabilize<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.510> pile<00:03:17.750> quite<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.110> bit<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.560> can

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
stabilize the pile quite a bit I can

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.370 
stabilize the pile quite a bit I can
oftentimes<00:03:19.400> stack<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.150> wood<00:03:20.690> well<00:03:20.959> over<00:03:21.230> my

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
oftentimes stack that wood well over my

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.620 
oftentimes stack that wood well over my
head<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.860> still<00:03:22.670> have<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.820> very<00:03:23.030> stable<00:03:23.239> pile

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
head and still have a very stable pile

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.039 
head and still have a very stable pile

found<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.980> more<00:03:52.010> traditional<00:03:52.640> style

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
found that the more traditional style

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.670

does have some nice benefits I kind of

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.470 
does have some nice benefits I kind of
like<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.010> shingled<00:04:07.430> roof<00:04:07.580> type<00:04:07.880> setup<00:04:08.269> it

like the shingled roof type setup it

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.300 
like the shingled roof type setup it
seems<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.780> do<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.930> real<00:04:09.170> good<00:04:09.200> job<00:04:09.380> shedding<00:04:10.190> the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
seems to do a real good job shedding the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.310 
seems to do a real good job shedding the
rain<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:11.290> snow<00:04:12.290> in<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.590> winter<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:14.630> does

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
rain and snow in the winter and it does

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.490 
rain and snow in the winter and it does
a<00:04:15.350> really<00:04:15.590> good<00:04:15.709> job<00:04:15.769> hiding<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.669> real<00:04:16.970> ugly

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
a really good job hiding the real ugly

a really good job hiding the real ugly
splits<00:04:18.500> or<00:04:18.739> some<00:04:19.220> real<00:04:19.400> odd<00:04:19.640> sized<00:04:20.000> ones

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
splits or some real odd sized ones

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.040 
splits or some real odd sized ones
basically<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.220> build<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.550> wall<00:04:22.760> or<00:04:23.479> circle

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
basically you build a wall or circle

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.920 
basically you build a wall or circle
walls<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:24.979> fill<00:04:25.790> kind<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.390> those<00:04:26.479> oddball

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
walls and fill kind of those oddball

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.020 
walls and fill kind of those oddball
shape<00:04:27.200> sizes<00:04:27.710> in<00:04:27.860> there<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.280> still<00:04:28.880> have<00:04:29.000> a

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
shape sizes in there and still have a

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.390 
shape sizes in there and still have a
very<00:04:29.330> stable<00:04:29.660> pile

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.890 

so<00:04:34.400> in<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.550> second<00:04:34.940> this<00:04:35.090> more<00:04:35.330> traditional

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
so in a second this more traditional

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.190 
so in a second this more traditional
style<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.740> start<00:04:37.700> by<00:04:37.880> laying<00:04:38.240> down<00:04:38.360> two<00:04:38.720> pallets

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
style I start by laying down two pallets

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.230 
style I start by laying down two pallets
usually<00:04:39.860> can<00:04:40.040> do<00:04:40.190> two<00:04:40.400> pallets<00:04:40.790> at<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:41.000> time

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
usually can do two pallets at a time

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.060 
usually can do two pallets at a time
because<00:04:41.450> it<00:04:41.690> kind<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.470> gives<00:04:42.590> me<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.830> rough

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
because it kind of gives me a rough

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.830 
because it kind of gives me a rough
ballpark<00:04:43.340> of<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:44.180> cord<00:04:44.540> and<00:04:44.780> then<00:04:45.460> my<00:04:46.460> my<00:04:46.910> wood

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
ballpark of a cord and then my my wood

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.990 
ballpark of a cord and then my my wood
splits<00:04:48.170> are<00:04:48.290> usually<00:04:48.500> cut<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:48.800> 18<00:04:49.250> inches<00:04:49.670> so

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
splits are usually cut to 18 inches so

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.370 
splits are usually cut to 18 inches so
two<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.480> those<00:04:50.570> together<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:51.880> 36<00:04:52.880> inches<00:04:53.380> so

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
two of those together is 36 inches so

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.740 
two of those together is 36 inches so
that's<00:04:54.830> around<00:04:55.280> 3<00:04:55.730> feet<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:56.180> I'd<00:04:56.570> have<00:04:56.690> to

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
that's around 3 feet so I'd have to

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.600 
that's around 3 feet so I'd have to
stack<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.320> wood<00:04:57.440> about<00:04:57.650> five<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.580> half

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
stack the wood about five and a half

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.320 
stack the wood about five and a half
feet<00:04:59.030> tall<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.690> actually<00:04:59.990> equal<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.590> true<00:05:00.860> cord

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
feet tall to actually equal a true cord

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.170 
feet tall to actually equal a true cord
so<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:03.470> start<00:05:04.070> with<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.250> cross<00:05:04.460> decking<00:05:04.880> on<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
so I start with the cross decking on the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.430 
so I start with the cross decking on the
ends<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:05.510> I<00:05:05.600> kind<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:05.870> build<00:05:06.080> those<00:05:06.260> up<00:05:06.410> a

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
ends and I kind of build those up a

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.020 
ends and I kind of build those up a
little<00:05:06.710> ways<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.070> then<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.280> start<00:05:07.520> filling<00:05:07.820> in

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
little ways and then I start filling in

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.320 
little ways and then I start filling in
the<00:05:08.060> rows<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:09.230> join<00:05:09.890> they<00:05:10.010> have<00:05:10.130> two<00:05:10.280> rows<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:11.270> I

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
the rows I join they have two rows and I

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.230 
the rows I join they have two rows and I
push<00:05:11.720> those<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.710> outside<00:05:13.280> edges<00:05:13.670> of<00:05:14.060> the

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
push those to the outside edges of the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.850 
push those to the outside edges of the
pallets<00:05:14.630> because<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:14.990> gives<00:05:15.140> it<00:05:15.260> a<00:05:15.350> nice<00:05:15.530> clean

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
pallets because it gives it a nice clean

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.520 
pallets because it gives it a nice clean
appearance<00:05:16.400> as<00:05:16.760> well<00:05:17.390> as<00:05:17.780> it<00:05:17.960> adds<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.410> little

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
appearance as well as it adds a little

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.350 
appearance as well as it adds a little
air<00:05:18.800> space<00:05:19.100> in<00:05:19.310> between<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.820> rows<00:05:19.940> so<00:05:20.240> it

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
air space in between the rows so it

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.360 
air space in between the rows so it
helps<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:20.780> wood<00:05:20.930> dry<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.230> little<00:05:21.560> quicker<00:05:21.920> if

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
helps the wood dry a little quicker if

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.800 
helps the wood dry a little quicker if
you<00:05:22.490> want<00:05:22.670> those<00:05:22.820> piles<00:05:23.060> to<00:05:23.270> be<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.420> little<00:05:23.690> more

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
you want those piles to be a little more

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.780 
you want those piles to be a little more
stable<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.500> can<00:05:24.650> also<00:05:24.800> cut<00:05:25.160> some<00:05:25.430> branches

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
stable you can also cut some branches

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.490 
stable you can also cut some branches
kind<00:05:26.420> of<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.600> width<00:05:26.810> of<00:05:26.900> your<00:05:26.960> pallet<00:05:27.410> and

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
kind of the width of your pallet and

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.320 
kind of the width of your pallet and
then<00:05:27.620> lay<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:27.860> across<00:05:28.010> the<00:05:28.400> two<00:05:28.640> rows<00:05:28.970> a

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
then lay it across the two rows a

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.030 
then lay it across the two rows a
handful<00:05:30.050> of<00:05:30.080> those<00:05:30.320> kind<00:05:30.590> of<00:05:30.680> stagger

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
handful of those kind of stagger

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.980 
handful of those kind of stagger
throughout<00:05:31.400> your<00:05:31.550> pile<00:05:31.820> makes<00:05:32.600> a<00:05:32.720> pretty<00:05:32.930> big

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
throughout your pile makes a pretty big

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.950 
throughout your pile makes a pretty big
difference<00:05:33.140> on<00:05:33.650> how<00:05:33.890> stable<00:05:34.160> that<00:05:34.340> is<00:05:37.930> so<00:05:38.930> I

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
difference on how stable that is so I

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.800 
difference on how stable that is so I
generally<00:05:39.500> don't<00:05:39.620> tarp<00:05:39.980> my<00:05:40.130> firewood<00:05:40.940> until

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
generally don't tarp my firewood until

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.690 
generally don't tarp my firewood until
late<00:05:41.990> fall<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:42.560> usually<00:05:42.980> I<00:05:43.070> only<00:05:43.250> tarp<00:05:43.580> the

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
late fall and usually I only tarp the

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.310 
late fall and usually I only tarp the
stuff<00:05:43.970> that<00:05:44.150> I'm<00:05:44.240> planning<00:05:44.450> on<00:05:44.720> burning<00:05:44.990> that

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
stuff that I'm planning on burning that

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.980 
stuff that I'm planning on burning that
winter<00:05:45.680> I<00:05:45.890> try<00:05:46.550> to<00:05:46.610> kind<00:05:46.850> of<00:05:46.940> beat<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.780> rainy

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
winter I try to kind of beat the rainy

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.590 
winter I try to kind of beat the rainy
part<00:05:48.350> of<00:05:48.500> fall<00:05:48.740> that<00:05:49.010> we<00:05:49.160> usually<00:05:49.490> get<00:05:49.640> here<00:05:50.000> in

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
part of fall that we usually get here in

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.110 
part of fall that we usually get here in
Minnesota<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:52.160> there's<00:05:52.400> there's<00:05:52.760> a<00:05:52.910> couple

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
Minnesota and there's there's a couple

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.990 
Minnesota and there's there's a couple
reasons<00:05:53.360> why<00:05:54.230> I<00:05:54.260> don't<00:05:54.440> tarp<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:55.130> haven't

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
reasons why I don't tarp I haven't

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.520 
reasons why I don't tarp I haven't
really<00:05:56.210> found<00:05:56.360> it<00:05:56.540> to<00:05:56.630> dry<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:56.930> wood<00:05:57.230> any

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
really found it to dry the wood any

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.360 
really found it to dry the wood any
quicker<00:05:58.430> and<00:05:59.200> the<00:06:00.200> tarps<00:06:00.560> get<00:06:00.770> beat<00:06:00.980> up<00:06:01.130> pretty

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
quicker and the tarps get beat up pretty

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.400 
quicker and the tarps get beat up pretty
bad<00:06:01.610> out<00:06:01.850> here<00:06:02.030> in<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.300> summer<00:06:02.540> because<00:06:03.290> of

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
bad out here in the summer because of

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.950 
bad out here in the summer because of
all<00:06:03.530> the<00:06:03.650> wind<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.160> I<00:06:05.120> just<00:06:05.630> don't<00:06:05.810> like

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
all the wind and I just don't like

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.550 
all the wind and I just don't like
spending<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:06.530> money<00:06:06.710> on<00:06:07.000> the<00:06:08.000> tarps<00:06:08.360> and<00:06:08.560> when

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
spending the money on the tarps and when

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.070 
spending the money on the tarps and when
I<00:06:09.590> have<00:06:09.830> tarp<00:06:10.160> to<00:06:10.340> the<00:06:10.460> past<00:06:10.700> nine<00:06:11.630> times<00:06:11.870> out

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
I have tarp to the past nine times out

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.080 
I have tarp to the past nine times out
of<00:06:12.110> ten<00:06:12.320> when<00:06:12.560> I<00:06:12.590> go<00:06:12.980> out<00:06:13.100> there<00:06:13.370> start<00:06:13.790> moving

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
of ten when I go out there start moving

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.250 
of ten when I go out there start moving
firewood<00:06:14.390> in<00:06:14.660> the<00:06:14.750> fall

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
firewood in the fall

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.380 
firewood in the fall
I'm<00:06:16.100> usually<00:06:16.280> finding<00:06:16.790> a<00:06:16.880> couple<00:06:17.030> of<00:06:17.180> wasp

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
I'm usually finding a couple of wasp

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.140 
I'm usually finding a couple of wasp
nests<00:06:17.780> of<00:06:17.930> some<00:06:18.140> sort<00:06:18.500> and<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:18.980> makes<00:06:19.880> for

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
nests of some sort and it makes for

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.210 
nests of some sort and it makes for
probably<00:06:20.840> an<00:06:20.960> interesting<00:06:21.110> view<00:06:21.710> for<00:06:22.130> the

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
probably an interesting view for the

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.550 
probably an interesting view for the
neighbors<00:06:22.580> so<00:06:23.080> that's<00:06:24.080> just<00:06:24.260> part<00:06:24.440> of<00:06:24.470> the

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
neighbors so that's just part of the

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.770 
neighbors so that's just part of the
reason<00:06:24.770> I<00:06:24.920> personally<00:06:25.430> don't<00:06:25.610> tarp<00:06:25.880> if<00:06:26.060> we

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
reason I personally don't tarp if we

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.620 
reason I personally don't tarp if we
were<00:06:26.930> probably<00:06:27.140> in<00:06:27.410> a<00:06:27.500> much<00:06:27.680> more<00:06:28.240> rainy<00:06:29.240> moist

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
were probably in a much more rainy moist

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.740 
were probably in a much more rainy moist
area<00:06:30.020> and<00:06:30.200> maybe<00:06:30.410> think<00:06:30.770> about<00:06:30.860> it<00:06:31.220> but

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
area and maybe think about it but

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.880 
area and maybe think about it but
personally<00:06:32.750> I<00:06:32.840> just<00:06:33.050> haven't<00:06:33.320> found<00:06:33.500> a<00:06:33.680> need

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
personally I just haven't found a need

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.730 
personally I just haven't found a need
to<00:06:34.400> do<00:06:34.550> it<00:06:34.730> so<00:06:35.140> so<00:06:36.140> I<00:06:36.170> think<00:06:36.290> I<00:06:36.440> want<00:06:36.590> to<00:06:36.620> be
