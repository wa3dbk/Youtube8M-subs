sleep remedy shampoo and conditioner and
I've<00:00:10.410> been<00:00:10.559> using<00:00:10.710> these<00:00:10.830> for<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.070> couple<00:00:11.160> of

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
I've been using these for a couple of

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.490 
I've been using these for a couple of
weeks<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.269> I've<00:00:12.719> leased<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.259> notice

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
weeks now and I've leased I just notice

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.259 
weeks now and I've leased I just notice
difference<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.040> my<00:00:14.190> hair

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
difference in my hair

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.019 
difference in my hair
I<00:00:15.330> did<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:16.130> dogs<00:00:17.130> what<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.730> there<00:00:17.910> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I did have dogs what you have there is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.759 
I did have dogs what you have there is
hair<00:00:18.270> but<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.900> did<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.529> some<00:00:19.560> split<00:00:20.279> ends

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
hair but I did have some split ends

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
hair but I did have some split ends
splitting<00:00:22.769> damage<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> bottom<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.699> my

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
splitting damage on the bottom of my

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.230 
splitting damage on the bottom of my
hair<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.840> some<00:00:25.140> areas<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:26.550> from<00:00:26.820> bleaching

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
hair in some areas just from bleaching

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.310 
hair in some areas just from bleaching
and<00:00:27.840> dye<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:29.810> general<00:00:30.810> wear<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.019> tear

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and dye and just general wear and tear

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680 
and dye and just general wear and tear
okay<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.489> since<00:00:32.820> using<00:00:33.059> these<00:00:33.270> two<00:00:33.480> split

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
okay so but since using these two split

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.950 
okay so but since using these two split
gravity<00:00:34.880> formula<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.300> noticed<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.690> my

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
gravity formula I have noticed that my

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.979 
gravity formula I have noticed that my
split<00:00:37.380> ends<00:00:37.610> they're<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.300> much<00:00:39.719> there

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
split ends they're not so much there

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.350 
split ends they're not so much there
anymore<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.710> some<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:41.460> split<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
anymore and some of them split at the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.639 
anymore and some of them split at the
bottom<00:00:42.570> lip<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:42.930> split<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> little<00:00:43.410> bit

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
bottom lip and they split a little bit

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.930 
bottom lip and they split a little bit
more<00:00:43.860> at<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> shaft<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:44.760> noticing

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
more at the shaft and I'm noticing

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.840 
more at the shaft and I'm noticing
that's<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.600> lot<00:00:46.230> less<00:00:46.469> predominant<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.489> my<00:00:47.640> hair

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that's a lot less predominant in my hair

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.639 
that's a lot less predominant in my hair
now<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.300> that's<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.629> great<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.500> really

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
now so that's really great so I'm really

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.869 
now so that's really great so I'm really
not<00:00:49.800> good<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> really<00:00:50.640> did<00:00:50.760> not

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
not good with that so I really did not

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.490 
not good with that so I really did not
expect<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> work<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:52.260> does

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
expect that to work but it really does

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.090 
expect that to work but it really does
and<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:55.770> trust<00:00:56.070> me

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
have some split ends split any damage on

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
have some split ends split any damage on
the<00:01:21.570> bottom<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> my<00:01:21.990> hair<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.979> some<00:01:23.250> areas<00:01:23.729> I'm

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the bottom of my hair in some areas I'm

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.760 
the bottom of my hair in some areas I'm
just<00:01:24.750> from<00:01:24.990> bleaching<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.009> dye<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.770> get

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
just from bleaching and dye and just get

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
just from bleaching and dye and just get
it<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:28.979> wear<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.280> tear<00:01:29.460> okay<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.689> since

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it all wear and tear okay so but since

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.219 
it all wear and tear okay so but since
using<00:01:31.229> these<00:01:31.439> two<00:01:31.619> split<00:01:31.829> gravity<00:01:33.049> formula<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
using these two split gravity formula I

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.740 
using these two split gravity formula I
have<00:01:34.259> noticed<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.860> my<00:01:35.250> split<00:01:35.520> ends<00:01:35.750> they're

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
have noticed that my split ends they're

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.469 
have noticed that my split ends they're
not<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.470> much<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.159> anymore<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.850> some<00:01:39.420> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
not so much there anymore and some of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
not so much there anymore and some of
them<00:01:39.600> look<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> bottom<00:01:40.740> lip<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:40.979> they

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
them look at the bottom lip and they

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
them look at the bottom lip and they
split<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.790> more<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> shaft<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
split a little bit more of the shaft and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
split a little bit more of the shaft and
I<00:01:42.899> notice<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.770> lot<00:01:44.369> less

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I notice that that's a lot less

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.609 
I notice that that's a lot less
predominant<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.659> my<00:01:45.780> hair<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.439> that's

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
predominant in my hair now so that's

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.109 
predominant in my hair now so that's
really<00:01:46.799> great<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:47.970> good<00:01:48.090> with

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
really great so I'm really not good with

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609 
really great so I'm really not good with
that<00:01:48.299> cuz<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.540> really<00:01:48.689> did<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:49.020> expect<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that cuz I really did not expect that to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.130 
that cuz I really did not expect that to
work<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.490> does<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> these<00:01:51.899> are
