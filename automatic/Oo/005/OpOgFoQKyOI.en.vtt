sleeps on his stomach and um and he does
tummy<00:02:46.860> time<00:02:47.099> so<00:02:47.489> he<00:02:48.300> doesn't<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:48.920> rub<00:02:49.920> this

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
tummy time so he doesn't really rub this

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.009 
tummy time so he doesn't really rub this
much<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:51.120> know<00:02:51.239> rub<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.660> much<00:02:51.870> because

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
much you know rub this much because

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.690 
much you know rub this much because
that's<00:02:52.170> not<00:02:52.530> how<00:02:52.620> he<00:02:52.680> sleeps<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.099> lot<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.580> is

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
that's not how he sleeps a lot of it is

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.640 
that's not how he sleeps a lot of it is
to<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.569> way<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.870> baby<00:02:55.050> sleep<00:02:55.470> they<00:02:55.590> sleep

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
to the way the baby sleep they sleep

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.960 
to the way the baby sleep they sleep
where<00:02:55.980> they're<00:02:56.099> supposed<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.489> sleep<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.819> her

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
where they're supposed to sleep on her
back<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.290> would<00:02:58.409> cause<00:02:58.590> them<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.830> lose

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
back so that would cause them to lose

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.810 
back so that would cause them to lose
their<00:02:59.250> hair<00:03:00.349> but<00:03:02.360> that's<00:03:03.360> what<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.599> wanted
