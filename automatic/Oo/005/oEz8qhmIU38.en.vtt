00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.440
 show will start the room wait bits 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.420
 4.2.2 is a hoarseness comes and is there 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.969
 It comes with certain features 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 specials that it serves us so that 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.940
 flow much faster and better good what 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.060
 what I recommend before starting is 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.490
 make an android backup you have to save 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.170
 all your photos files everything 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.730
 they need to save here the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.830
 applications the photos are not going to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.760
 save but then anyway is 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.760
 important to have them saved 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.380
 well the rom that we are going to install is 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.830
 in x of all the credits go to the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.379
 creator and we just found the 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.150
 charge interest then we click and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 we select which model is our 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.160
 galaxy eight points until five days 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.900
 is the action and increase them to look 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.690
 what is the one of us simply we 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.480
 we go to settings and about the device 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.660
 it does not come out in this part then what 110 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.100
 I'm going to select the 110 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.270
 likewise the procedure thereof 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.340
 for 100 and 120 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.119
 one as several downloads come out we're going to 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.290
 download the most recent 97 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.120
 2013 we are going to download 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.740
 well wait for seconds and click 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.270
 while they load they will show you here 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.330
 one thing 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.160
 they say yes 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.960
 we have 100 to 120 as they are 3 g then 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.040
 we need in traditional then 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.870
 let's say if we have the one hundred 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.320
 we are going to download an additional file 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.820
 system the 110 not then take the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.820
 fifth cw m 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.400
 and we are going to choose the one that belongs to us 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.150
 so if we see in settings 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.149
 a certain device that will appear 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.130
 here n 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.950

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.989
 letters xx b 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.269
 and those are the ones that we are going to look for here 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:17.040
 then either lb or xx or ekiza and depending 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.980
 of that we are going to download it good 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.250
 We have just fallen or X to both serve 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.080
 perfectly then 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.830
 we unload when they arrive at loaders 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.140
 of tapes let's click here 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.910
 and then we are going to download good 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.430
 when they have downloaded it, we are going to 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.430
 turn off the tablet and let's do what 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.380
 next let's press the button 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.640
 turn up the volume we have it pressed 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.020
 we press the home button and we will be able to 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.880
 learn it 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.500
 when the image comes out we will accept 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.640
 to light but we will continue to have 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.640
 pressed to the other two 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.740
 and it will enter us 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.570
 the route 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.520

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.430
 datafactory Luis who does this was 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.190
 absolutely all the applications that 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.290
 we have on the tablet but not now 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.020
 music photos other things is 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.020
 absolutely the whole system we give ourselves 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.980
 the one to learn 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.720
 Let's go to 10 and we'll work to light 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.560

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.670
 good and now let's give install if 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.430
 I promised card here 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.670
 we can give and depend now we have to 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.920
 find the file that we downloaded 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.319
 that being in download is usually 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.859
 starting in bot 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.859
 yes 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.580
 in the 5 thousand 110 depends your brand and 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.570
 We are going to learn 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.570
 now let's give in 10 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.410
 will start to install the file 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.300
 then we open a menu we are going to 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.880
 handle the same with those of igniting and 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:23.460
 lower volume then next to learn 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.260
 in this menu we will choose to install 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.150
 room 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.800
 Well, if you want to change the subject 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.790
 here you can choose the theme we are going to 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.360
 navigate anyway with the same 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.310
 settle once 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.139
 well here we get an option to 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.150
 install applications at once and 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.900
 widgets that we're going to jump to do it 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.569
 faster 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.270
 the one who helps me the same 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.070
 and we are going to direct the region good 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.740
 then here 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.740
 let's go to choose the meeting 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.350
 Colombia really without this one yours 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.780
 can impose 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.400
 once you are with the language there 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.260
 The country matters a lot but the language 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.390
 since we have that, let's give it next 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.849
 14 that fall to the sea the tactile but 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.420
 it works a little even 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.889
 and it did not work much 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.900
 also Colombia was already elected 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.639
 and we are going to give you install now 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.639
 will start loading all the files 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.540
 well now let's give next if 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.160
 for some reason they are stuck in this 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.540
 part 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.520
 and good 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.530
 the campus as it says here tells me 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.420
 while we are simply going to press 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.390
 the button to turn it off we have it pressed 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.020
 for about 7 seconds until it goes out 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.020
 the tablet 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.230
 because then we normally 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.230
 this removes us at the beginning 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.449
 here is no longer good charge and well 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.490
 we have the room fully installed 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.680
 now the only thing that we lack then is 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.260
 configure what is the principle of 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.390
 all android 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.390
 we have our evening completely 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.230
 and well here we have the rome and 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.120
 completely installed if we give each other 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:33.910
 account is already rooted that saves us 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.210
 of step and if we see in applications then 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.780
 well in normal and has no good 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:43.210
 some that remove ads that do the 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.560
 online backup and good as always 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.080
 forget to leave your comments have 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.660
 some question also enter android 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.660
 fact point teak and see you next
