sometimes you kind of just get sick of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.840 
sometimes you kind of just get sick of
it<00:01:45.080> naturally<00:01:45.709> because<00:01:46.039> it's<00:01:46.280> there<00:01:46.490> all<00:01:46.640> time

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
it naturally because it's there all time

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.490

it's<00:01:47.000> kind<00:01:47.149> of<00:01:47.179> like<00:01:47.330> listening<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.990> song<00:01:48.259> on

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
it's kind of like listening to a song on

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.740 
it's kind of like listening to a song on
repeat<00:01:48.770> all<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.220> time<00:01:49.490> even<00:01:50.000> if<00:01:50.300> it's<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.539> song

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.270 
repeat all the time even if it's a song
that<00:01:50.780> you'd<00:01:51.020> like<00:01:51.200> eventually<00:01:52.039> it<00:01:52.130> starts

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
that you'd like eventually it starts

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.639 
that you'd like eventually it starts
wearing<00:01:52.700> on<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.209> and<00:01:53.450> then<00:01:53.690> it<00:01:54.110> might<00:01:54.500> even

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649
